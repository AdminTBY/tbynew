		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main vision and mission behind Sumarse?</h4><p>Sumarse is a multi-stakeholder platform that aims to promote CSR through sustainable development to develop the country. The objective of Sumarse is to help companies implement CSR best practices and global compact principles as well as be a platform to generate public private partnerships (PPPs) for development. Sumarse has 158 companies, 72 NGOs, the chamber of commerce, and various universities that are members. That is what makes us a broad organization and gives us a unique role when either international organizations or government institutions want to start a dialog with the private sector. This is why it is important that the financing of Sumarse is fully private.</p><h4>Are local companies investing enough in CSR?</h4><p>If you had asked me five years ago, the answer would have been no. Raising awareness on CSR matters over the years has helped create a program that allows companies to develop best practices within and be practical and business oriented. It has helped them develop. There are a handful of companies that are very mature and oriented toward sustainability, but there is a large group that are already implementing best practices. One of our achievements as an organization was including 25 of our member companies in the creation of a CSR strategy. In the next two or three years, we will have a much larger group of companies maturing in terms of CSR.</p><h4>Which areas should be a focus for local and international companies operating here in Panama?</h4><p>The main topic is always governance. That is where everything starts. It is hard to make companies understand this. They start by implementing practices, but when you make them go through the whole process they understand that if you make a plan and an analysis you come back to the starting point, which is governance. It matters how you align your mission, vision, and values, and then how you transmit these through the whole organization to allow the company to become socially responsible. It should start in governance but usually does not. Here in Panama we have been very successful in a few areas, such as corporate volunteering, now a hot topic in Panama. What we have done at Sumarse is give companies the methodology and process for how to do it. We always make them work in groups, develop the project themselves and share best practices among participants. At the end of the process they come out with their corporate volunteering program, in addition to having created working relationships between the companies. The added value of what we do is that companies start talking to each other and NGOs. We also teach NGOs how to manage volunteers and connect with businesses.</p><h4>What are your plans for this year and what will be the focus of your activity for 2017?</h4><p>The main focus for 2017 is the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We started working on these since they came out in late 2015 and in 2016 it was more about understanding what it was all about and making the connections and getting all the info from the UN, studying the tools. This year we want to start working with Panamanian companies and show them how to implement these SDGs. I would say most of them have heard about the SDGs, but we want to show them what to do make an impact and take that further. The CSR week is the broadcast of what the companies do and will be a reflection of what we are working on. It is a time for showing what can be done in Panama. Panamanians tend to forget this is a country of only 4 million people, and that we entered this incredible positive economic cycle just a decade ago.</p><h4>What role does e-learning play in your information and communication activity?</h4><p>We are part of a Central American CSR network named Red Integrarse, and have completed several projects together. We even have a common strategy in Central America on CSR. One of the issues here was how to share the learning experience and bring our knowledge together. About 5,000 people in the whole region have taken e-courses. It is focused on CSR, and there will probably be a human rights module as well. They are all specifically oriented to Central America.</p><h4>What do you want to achieve before the end of this year?</h4><p>My wish list is to be able to give companies the means to understand the SDGs and their strategic importance for becoming more competitive and sustainable. In the end CSR is defining a triple bottom line, so it assumes that as a company that you have a social and environmental impact on top of having an economic one. This is what we want companies to understand. A huge challenge is human rights because people generally think of human rights as only relating to child labor. Our other wish is to be successful in bringing our organization beyond the capital and into the interior of the country. We especially want to expand into Chiriquí­.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Who do you work with in your academic and practical courses and programs?</h4><p>For our degrees we work with a number of British universities. We also work with big law firms and large multinationals. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement as they seek and find talent among our graduates. It is often experience where recruiters find a gap between academia and the demands of the workplace. That is the reason why we invite industry professionals to teach practical skills, like negotiation, drafting documents, and presentation. In addition, we offer specific non-legal courses like project and risk management for students to develop a more holistic approach to their field of study.</p><h4>You are a strong promoter of inclusive education, for which you have launched EduNation. Can you tell us more about this initiative?</h4><p>EduNation is our free education platform inspired by the Khan Academy, which has been successful in the US. The problem with the Khan Academy for our students is that it does not follow the Malaysian syllabus and not all Malaysian children have the English proficiency to understand the English videos. Also, 80% of the videos are about math, whereas we wanted to cover a broader spectrum of subjects, including some Malaysian and Southeast Asian-specific subjects. Therefore, three years ago we started with EduNation and invested in it as a CSR initiative. To date, it has almost 4,000 videos, covering the entire secondary school syllabus for 12 subjects, and more than 100,000 students are using it. The videos are currently available in English and Malay, and this year we will also offer Mandarin and Tamil versions for primary schools, so it will all be available in four languages. Most of our students are from Malaysia, followed by the US, the UK, Australia, and Singapore. Most of the science videos are in English, and have gained traction all over the world. We are now looking at complementing the videos with printed versions to make the studying process more comprehensive. EduNation is a completely private initiative, and has grown to be the largest educational resource for primary and secondary schools in Malaysia. We do everything ourselves, we have a great team, and it has been extremely satisfying to help children learn and enjoy learning, and to create a real community around the initiative, with teachers, parents, children, and our team of developers</p><h4>Brickfields runs over 15 companies, including a number of tech startups. How do you go about starting and choosing your investments?</h4><p>We run so many companies that it becomes difficult for us to be the champion in every field. In our CSR initiatives, we look to see who can make the biggest difference for those who need the most help. We help promote, fund, and support those who have innovative ideas to raise money for charitable causes like education, children in need, women's issues, or those suffering from rare diseases. We act as an incubator for startups to help them achieve these objectives, which are for of social good. Besides EduNation, we organize a number of charity events, and managed a food relief program for flood victims in Sri Lanka, in which we spearheaded the national relief efforts and our university campus served as the main collection point, providing an effective channel for people from different walks of life to contribute. Another thing we do is teachers' training. The UNHCR approached us with this request and it was not difficult for us. We already have the premises and just had to hire some experts in education. The program unfolded and the experts trained 450 people, who would in turn train 5,000 people. It is all about leveraging our resources for these purposes. In a similar way, we work with a women's organization that runs an entrepreneurship program whereby participants later receive a MYR2,000 grant to start their own business. We teach them about financing, branding, and all other expects of running a business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Non-Surgical Pain Relief]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[non-surgical-pain-relief]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you venture into your new holistic healthcare activities?</h4><p>We found a niche in the market of non-surgical, non-pharmacological pain relief. With the diamagnetic machine we could venture into this new area and become the first in Malaysia to offer such an innovative treatment. The device is imported from Italy and works essentially like an MRI machine. One of the forms of magnetism is called diamagnetism, where dia repels and ferrous attracts, which is where our machine takes it functionality. Around 70% of the human body consists of water, and water is an excellent diamagnetic matter. When we apply diamagnetic force to an injury with swelling, it repels the fluid. This is the basic principle. In addition, it generates cells and recharges them to start functioning again. Our therapy is done in three steps; namely cell stimulation, lymphatic drainage, and molecular implants. With the help of a gel, we can push as deep as 12cm, which is effective for healing wounds and pain management. At the moment, we only perform pain management; however, in the future, we could also move into aesthetics and healing wounds. With improved wound healing, there will be fewer scars.</p><h4>How have your operations advanced since you established yourself as the diamagnetic treatment provider of choice?</h4><p>Currently, our services have been spread by word of mouth, often recommended by existing patients. In addition to that, we have created awareness amongst third parties, like hospitals, specialist clinics, and insurance companies. Large hospitals can save on their investments and space by outsourcing their patients to us, and we are working on awareness. Patients may then choose to follow their rehabilitation program at one of the 50 centers that we plan to build nationwide. As our operations progress, we want to take things one step further and localize operations. Currently, we are in discussion with our principals to move a part of the manufacturing to Malaysia.</p><h4>Do you seek to expand to other countries in the region?</h4><p>We have already opened our first center in Singapore, and we are planning to open two more very soon. Singapore is always hungry for something new and innovative, and our diamagnetic device sparked immediate interest. We became certified shortly after we installed the first machine and four more devices are on their way. Indonesia is next on the agenda, and we are on the verge of signing an MoU. Indonesians are often interested in what happens in Singapore, and as we have established ourselves there, we could leverage on that experience. We seek to export to Australia as well. We are open to explore strategic partnerships, especially with private hospitals and other healthcare providers. At the recent Asia Pacific Electroplastic Congress, a medical conference in Penang, we saw a great deal of interest from India and the Philippines as well. One of the avenues that we discussed there was partnering with hospitals to build centers—in this case with one in India. Other than that, we invite medical travelers to have their treatment in Malaysia, as the cost of usage is more affordable here. The difference in pricing between a treatment in Malaysia and Europe for patients includes accommodation and airfare.</p><h4>What are your objectives and ambitions for the next years?</h4><p>A personal ambition is to be a pioneer in diamagnetic treatments, offering pain relief for many. ASEAN is our target area at the moment; we will likely have three centers in Singapore by the end of this year, and two in Indonesia, after which Australia, New Zealand, and the rest of ASEAN will follow. The costs to start a diamagnetic center are relatively modest; it requires an investment of around USD100,000 to have the device and build the center around it. With organic growth, the right partners, and strategic investments, we can have 500 centers in the Asia Pacific region in 10 years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your business advanced in recent years, especially in light of the recent listing?</h4><p>We started operations in 1996 as a manufacturer and trader of medical/healthcare beds, peripherals, and accessories, and our business operations and customer portfolio has seen a significant expansion over time. Between 2002 and 2008 we were exporting to 10 countries and today we deliver our products to numerous public and private hospitals and medical centers as well as other healthcare-related facilities in Malaysia and more than 30 countries across six continents. We have four objectives for our listing: to increase our local and global presence, recruit skilled employees, invest in new machinery to increase our production efficiency, and repay one of our bank loans.</p><h4>What international markets do you target?</h4><p>Africa is one of the markets that we target as we already have some presence there and also the ASEAN region. We currently sell to over 30 countries, or roughly 16% of all countries. There are still many markets for us to tap into and good opportunities for our product line that can serve any healthcare sector in the world. Through the listing process, we can brand our company internationally and tap into new markets.</p><h4>How would you break down your current revenue and key markets?</h4><p>The key market is still Malaysia, accounting for approximately 80% of our total revenue. Our market share in Malaysia is 40.5% in 2014 and we are one of the major local player. As of 3Q2016, our export markets comprise Asia (excluding Malaysia) with 14.68%, the Middle East with 2.13%, Africa at 3.79%, Central America at 0.17%, and Europe with 0.01%. In most markets, we have distributors and agents that help us with servicing and promotion.</p><h4>Can you tell us a bit more about your products?</h4><p>Our core business is the manufacturing of medical/hospital beds, including manual, hydraulic, and electric beds. We also produce medical peripherals and accessories such as medical carts, instrument trolleys, and patient transport trolleys. Our production facilities are all in Kuala Lumpur, and we intend to continue there. If we find a place where we can set up a second supply chain to expand our operations in another country, we might do so. We currently have our manufacturing, fabrication, and warehousing on the same premises; this saves us a great deal on logistics. We even source most of our raw materials locally, except for electrical components and hydraulic systems, which are from overseas.</p><h4>What are some of the services provided by your in-house R&amp;D center?</h4><p>We have close relations with our clients and listen to their feedback on our products and how we can improve them. Our R&amp;D is based on market trend and demand as well as customer feedback. Other input comes from exhibitions or interesting designs by other players in the market. We do not copy designs and instead take inspiration to improve our own production line. Another service that our R&amp;D team offers is customizing products according to the needs of our clients. Our industry is increasingly becoming demanding, and we are always on the lookout to improve the safety and comfort of patients.</p><h4>Have you seen an increased effort to push the medical equipment industry forward?</h4><p>The government supports us by inviting us on overseas trade missions where we promote our products. We have often done this by ourselves, and that works well, but the government's presence helps us open doors that would have remained closed otherwise. Under the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, the government announced it wants to increase access to public medical healthcare. We see our growth merely in those terms: the need to expand public hospitals, thus requiring more medical furniture and equipment. We are one of the nation's largest manufacturers of medical/healthcare beds, peripherals, and accessories in terms of revenue, and I see our domestic market share expanding to meet the growing needs of these new public hospitals and medical centers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you consider your main achievements at the National Heart Institute?</h4><p>We are considered one of the leading cardiac centers in Asia Pacific. In terms of volume, we only come behind some centers in China and India. We take pride in our high standards—we have an international JCI accreditation. Many of our consultants are key opinion leaders in Asia Pacific and are often invited to give scientific talks. We combine our clinical care with a strong research agenda and publish our studies in international publications. We participate in medical trials and for a center to be chosen, it is an indirect way of saying we have reached a certain level. Initially, the hospital provided cardiac treatment for Malaysians; however, as our quality reached the highest standards, we now have a large foreign patient base. At the same time, we have grown to become a reference point for training and research. We provide training to many young doctors around the region and have trained nearly 120 doctors who have spent at least one year with us. The fact these young doctors later choose to work with us is another measure of our quality.</p><h4>How do you present yourself abroad to attract an international client base?</h4><p>The crux of it all is our quality, ensuring that we have clinical and service excellence. Without this we cannot move forward; this is our key philosophy. Meanwhile, we make strong efforts to position ourselves as the heart center of choice in the region. We have a marketing department to collaborate with other partners and a representative office in Jakarta as Indonesia represents our largest foreign client base. We also target other regional markets like Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Myanmar. The Middle East is the next region that we will target. Another element that supports our value proposition is that we have trained many doctors from overseas, who after returning to their home countries become ambassadors for us. We grow by reputation and medical care is all about trust. Having references from friends and relatives is the most reliable and guaranteed method of marketing abroad. In Malaysia, we are leading the game if we compare ourselves to other regional players like Thailand and Singapore. The Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC) is doing a great job in streamlining promotional efforts abroad; however, the responsibility also lies with individual hospitals, and, therefore, we have our own international agenda as well. We have all the ingredients; however, we could organize ourselves better to get the message out into the right forum. A successful system of medical tourism requires the efforts from all players in the ecosystem, and we work to do our part and develop our own branding strategy. Essentially, our value proposition is two-fold: quality and care, and competitive pricing.</p><h4>Can you tell us how you enhance the health of the nation with wellness programs and preventative care initiatives?</h4><p>In recent years, we have promoted ourselves as not just the place to go when one has health problems, but also rather as proponents of heart healthcare. We look more and more into preventative care activities and run several awareness campaigns that are also as part of our CSR agenda. We have a trailer equipped with echo clinical equipment, and every month we go to rural areas outside of Kuala Lumpur to provide medical check-ups. We are softening our image and reaching out to a larger circle of people. Our wellness center has also been well received; we provide medical screenings to those who are keen on staying informed about their condition. This is a great vehicle for us, not just in terms of business but in healthcare terms—we can detect diseases at an early stage, resulting in much higher levels of success. The wellness center is not where our margins lie; however, it introduces our high-quality standards to our patients and demonstrates how our full-range of care is higher than private hospitals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Health Spectrum]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[health-spectrum]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your current assessment of the medical staff in Malaysia and how do you work to develop your staff?</h4><p>Our vision is to be involved in teaching the future generation of doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and other allied health professionals as well as to do relevant research. Having teaching and research in-house naturally helps us to upgrade our clinical services and improve the skill sets of our staff. In Malaysia, we have plenty of doctors; however, we are short on specialists. There are many graduates but training a specialist takes years. We want to have universities provide the training and on our end, we look to provide postgraduate scholarships so that our doctors and nurses can take specialist courses in their respective fields. We closely cooperate with the Ministry of Health to finalize such public-private partnerships—at the moment training is only done in public hospitals. If we structure ourselves well and our graduates feel that it is a great place for them to practice, with good technology and staff support, they will return after they finish their education.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your partnerships with foreign universities?</h4><p>We are a private hospital group and our focus is on treatment; our research, therefore, is to support and improve our medical care. We have embarked on various research paths and routinely do clinical drug trails. Our doctors participate in these clinical trials, which are reactive by default. Our Chairman's Foundation sponsors professorial chairs in Cambridge and Oxford who collaborate with us on certain areas of research. We plan to work with Cambridge on a project on diabetes because Malaysia has the highest incidence rate of such cases in Asia and it is increasingly a major problem in China and India as well. Another area of interest is regenerative medicine, such as stem cell therapy. Globally, we can identify certain diseases that are more prevalent here than in regions with a predominantly Caucasian population. Our Harvard collaboration provides a one-year healthcare leadership program for managers in Southeast Asian nations.</p><h4>What are the advantages of having horizontal integration of the Sunway Group?</h4><p>The biggest synergy comes from the cooperation between Sunway University and Monash University Malaysian campus centers, because of the research and graduate exchange. The hotels are convenient for patients who come from outside the city, so their families can stay close by. The Sunway campus is well connected and public transport here is state-of-the-art. We provide aesthetic services for many foreign patients and they make a vacation out of it for their family. In addition, for both Sunway and Monash universities, around 30% of their students are international—both they and their families use our medical facilities as well. Sunway furthermore has a construction company, a real estate developer, and an investment holding, which eases the process of building our new blocks here and satellite hospitals in other towns. Our hospital in Kuala Lumpur serves as a tertiary referral medical hub with the full range of clinical expertise while hospitals around the country, such as in Ipoh, Penang, and Johor, provide more secondary healthcare.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the Sunway Medical Centre in the coming years?</h4><p>We want to provide a whole spectrum of healthcare to our patients and be the primary specialist center of choice. By law, we cannot have our own GP clinics; however, we can have specialist clinics, so that is what we focus on. Thus, besides building five more satellite hospitals, we are in the midst of setting up two ambulatory care centers with specialist clinics and support facilities limited to just day care. These care centers will allow our specialists in the hospital to practice in the community. Another center is meant for independent, assisted living care services for senior citizens who want to stay in a safe and secure assisted environment and who need daily assistance with medication, or diabetes care or dementia, for example. Our ambition is to open a number of these residences. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Healthy Growth]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[healthy-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Do you anticipate growth to continue to come from Indonesia or do you also tap into new markets?</h4><p>In becoming a regional destination, we cannot rely on just one country, despite the fact that typically about 60% of all medical travelers come from Indonesia. Indonesia has itself embarked on a path for national health insurance and we should therefore grow other markets such as the Middle East and CIS countries, as well as China, Bangladesh, Australia, and New Zealand. In each of these countries, we focus on offering niche treatments whereas in Indonesia we offer all treatments. Singapore is another country where we believe we can grow, as medical costs there are sky high. On top of that we have medical travelers from the UK, Japan, Korea, India, and the US; however, these are often expats working in the region. We have offices abroad in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Dhaka, Jakarta, Hong Kong, and Yangon and also look to set up in the Middle East, most likely in Saudi Arabia or the UAE. In healthcare, trust is important and therefore our physical presence overseas is necessary. In terms of numbers, we had 850,000 medical travelers in 2015, and we target 1 million for 2016. Total revenue in 2015 was more than MYR900 million, and for 2016, we target MYR1.3 billion. We want to drive the industry forward and aim high to push our boundaries.</p><h4>How will the medical corridors of Penang, Johor, and Malacca drive the industry forward?</h4><p>Penang has been a destination for medical travelers for many decades and is ahead in terms of promotion. The state is responsible for 50% to 60% of the total number of medical travelers coming into Malaysia; half of the patients in Penang hospitals are medical tourists. Penang has the whole ecosystem in place: excellent hospitals, an end-to-end service, and an active medical tourism association. We can learn from Penang and want to create similar hubs in other states. Malacca has experience with tourism influx. There is the Mahkota Medical Centre, which has been attracting medical travelers for some years. Malacca also has The Orchard, a unique hotel that provides preventive and recuperative healthcare and wellness treatments. These elements together give Malacca a strong value proposition for medical tourism. Johor Bahru is also a natural destination because of its proximity to Singapore and Indonesia. Our challenge in Johor was that we did not have hospitals with capacity previously. In the recent years, we have seen significant developments there, particularly with the opening of Gleneagles Medini and the growth of the Regency and KPJ hospitals. In general, when we choose areas to promote, we look at availability, existing hospitals and their capacity, and the overall tourism infrastructure. Our next destination would be Sabah and Sarawak, starting with Kota Kinabalu, where there is a strong appeal from China, Australia, and New Zealand.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the growth of the medical equipment industry?</h4><p>Medical equipment is indeed one of the fastest growing industries in Malaysia. Both medical devices and consumables, such as rubber gloves, are major contributors to the sustainability of the health sector at large. The fact that these goods are produced locally has a spillover effect in that our medical centers do not need to import them, which supports affordability factor. The industry is not under our mandate; however, when we travel abroad to promote our healthcare, we often discover potential new markets and collaborations for this industry.</p><h4>What are your goals for this year?</h4><p>We continue to drive promotion to become the number one medical travel destination in the region. The immediate objective here is to create awareness. We want to become the top-of-mind medical travel destination by 2020. We also want to increase our global presence in all of our target markets. By 2020, we want total revenues of MYR4 billion in the sector as a whole, including the wellness and preventative healthcare, alternative healthcare, and traditional Chinese medicine. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[forbidden-fruit]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have been outspoken about fruit diversity, for environmental as well as commercial reasons. What are your plans to enhance diversity here?</h4><p>Fruit diversity is an exclusive value of this region and is important for the future. It is also something that can be utilized and monetized. Some fruits have commercial value but some have other traits that need to be conserved and utilized. For example, the exotic king of the fruits, durian, has a unique and indigenous flavor that is only found naturally here in this region. Malaysia is already known as a major producer of durian. However, it is a seasonal fruit and, therefore, it is quite challenging to commercialize. This is the same for many other Malaysian fruits. Hence, MARDI has programs to look at fruit diversity and rare fruits. We have collected around 40 different types of rare fruits to evaluate, characterize, and potentially monetize.</p><h4>Do you coordinate with universities and other institutes and companies to conduct this research?</h4><p>We have built up a great network of local and international entities. Academia conducts most of the fundamental sciences while we do the applied sciences—in that sense we complement each other. We are mostly interested in products, the production process, and the commercialization of our research. Internationally, we collaborate with a number of sectorial and branch-specific partnerships, amongst others with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Asia Pacific Association of Research Institutes (APAARI), the Institute of Rice Research (IRRI), the Council for Rice Research in Asia (CORRA), the Food and Fertilizer Technology Centre (FFTC), and The World Vegetable Centre (AVRDC). We are also collaborating with many institutions across the region and are active contributors to many ASEAN and APEC programs. These not only present test cases for our own ideas but also identify global trends in the industry.</p><h4>How should rice production in Malaysia innovate?</h4><p>As a staple food of Malaysia, it is of great importance to sustain the rice industry. However, rice is a challenging industry for Malaysia by virtue of its high cost of production compared to the current world price. Over the years, MARDI has developed more than 40 rice varieties, and they are planted in more than 90% of Malaysian granary areas. However, with climate change and emerging pests and diseases, it is always recommended to cultivate new varieties to combat disease and have resistant yields. Flavored and colored rice are other products that we look into, especially since colored rice has many health benefits. We launched a program called Eat a Rainbow, for which we promote eating colored agriculture produce including red and black rice. As a rule of thumb, a diet comprising seven colors a day keeps the doctor away; therefore, it is part of a nutritious diet to introduce more colors into one's diet. Colored food has anthocyanins, which is important for combating cancer.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the years ahead?</h4><p>Leveraging from the success of the MySaveFood initiative, we wish to create new boundaries and make more positive impacts to the country's agriculture industry. There are many other initiatives we are working on but one global trend we are looking into at the moment is superfoods, which has attracted a great deal of attention. For example, we have developed honey from stingless bees or “kelulut," and seek to commercialize this unique product. This honey has quite a different composition and has at least four to 10 times the amount of antioxidants and a lower percentage of sugar compared to commercial honey. It has great health benefits and can treat ulcers or be applied to skin as well. We launched this product under our new brand and packaging; Nutrima by MARDI. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The budget announcement made a special call on the plantation and commodities industries. How relevant are these industries to the Malaysian economy?</h4><p>Commodities are an important sector as it was our second-largest export group after electronics in 2015. In terms of the net effect on the country, commodities are the biggest since it is a homegrown industry as opposed to electronics, where we manufacture for multinationals. The sectors cover all, from growing raw materials to downstream and upstream processes, and therefore value is added throughout the entire production chain. Also, it is not just an industry with a few big players; there are nearly 1 million smallholders. The total sector affects the livelihood of 3-4 million people in Malaysia, and because it is so vital for our economy and the inclusivity of society, our administration places strong emphasis on it. Commodities are set to receive a great deal of new investment in R&amp;D because we believe this industry is still the way forward for the country.</p><h4>What should be done to drive innovation throughout the industry's supply chain?</h4><p>We need to work together with the private sector to spur innovation. The largest researcher of palm oil is the government-linked Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), which is an active player in the field of innovation. The key priority for all research should be commercialization and findings should be applied to practice as soon as possible to reap the benefits of these investments. We seek to ensure that there is a robust public-private partnership (PPP), and we also call upon our universities to engage in research with private industry. This should guarantee that any breakthroughs can be commercially developed, thereby adding value throughout Malaysia. As an example, biomass is an exciting research area. In palm oil production, it is still treated as waste, but fortunately the perception of the industry is changing. About 20 to 30 years ago, at the end of their productivity, rubber trees were cleared from the land and treated as waste. However, today rubber wood is valuable and is used for premium furniture. This is analogous with the situation in palm oil, because the byproduct of the palm oil industry, which is much of the tree itself, can be used in a variety of applications, from generating electricity to furniture. Biomass is one of these applications, and because of our abundant resources, there is great potential for this industry.</p><h4>How has the rubber industry advanced, and how do you envision encouraging sustainable growth here?</h4><p>The example of rubber gloves is indicative of where the market is heading—Malaysia is the world's largest exporter of rubber gloves. There was a time when each glove weighed 5-6 grams, but technological innovation has allowed us to halve that weight. This means large savings in terms of resource use, safety, and strength; the product is substantially better today. The industry revolves around constant innovation; however, innovation is not just science—marketing is also a key component. Malaysia is also one of the biggest manufacturers of condoms, and our best producers can make a condom for USD0.03 and sell them for USD1. That value capture is a product of marketing and how we go about selling the product. The most important element here is technology and continuous innovation. We support the private sector in developing new technologies that can increase production. Recently, we launched the Rubber Research Institute Malaysia (RRIM), and now when factories purchase rubber from small holders there is a machine that measures the exact amount of dry rubber content, making pricing structures and purchasing processes more transparent and efficient. In the long run, we have to focus on industrial research and science in the various commodities markets. It is not a sunset industry; it is the future of the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your business advanced since you localized your operations here?</h4><p>We started our business in Malaysia in 2012, and before that we managed our projects here from Singapore. To date, we have invested more than MYR150 million, mainly in our stock and equipment. The construction sector, both in the public and private domain, is growing rapidly, and we believe that this momentum will continue. We have been growing by a compound annual rate of about 30% since our establishment, and anticipate this figure for the next few years. Looking at the healthy growth rate of the Malaysian construction industry, there are plenty of rooms to grow for the next decade. Business has grown significantly since our establishment, and we seek new premises for our headquarters and warehousing. The government-backed first metro line, MRT 1, is currently under construction, and the second and third line will follow. The MRT projects are among our main reasons to establish ourselves in Malaysia. The strong and clear outline of the government is to develop the country through initiatives such as the Economic Transformation Program (ETP), which is also a positive indicator for us.</p><h4>What is your involvement with landscape-defining, high-rise construction projects in Malaysia?</h4><p>At this moment, about 60% of our projects are on buildings, which include high rises and 40% are in civil engineering. The latter contain projects like dams, bridges, metro lines, and elevated platforms for public transport, which are generally developed with the government. We are one of the leaders in supplying formwork and safety system for high-rise constructions in the market because of our vast experiences, advanced technology, and construction management support. To date, we have been involved in more than 50 high-rise construction projects in the country, with notable examples being the PETRONAS Tower 3 (267m), the W Hotel (235m), the ILHAM Tower (274m), the Platinum Park — NAZA Tower (216m), and the recently constructed St. Regis Hotel (205m). Our latest and most prestigious project is Merdeka PNB118, the new signature tower in Kuala Lumpur. It will be approximately 630m high, thus becoming the tallest tower in Southeast Asia and among the top-five tallest towers in the world.</p><h4>Why did the consortium of Samsung and UEM decide to contract Doka for the Merdeka PNB118 project? </h4><p>We were involved in the tender process from the beginning and were the first to submit our proposals. We showed our commitment to constructing it faster, with highest safety standard and quality. Contractors are practical and pragmatic in the way they look at a proposal and the value they will receive. Our bidding was the highest, but we were chosen nonetheless for our know-how and innovative solutions. Out of the top 10 tallest buildings in the world, six have been constructed with the Doka system formwork. The Burj Khalifa (830m) in Dubai is one of our landmark projects, which was delivered on time and with great accuracy. For the Merdeka PNB11 project, we have brought in our latest innovation, Doka Intelligent Formwork, using Doka Concremote. This technology can measure concrete strength development and transmit this data to the relevant stakeholders, like consultant engineers, project managers, and the site supervisor. This ensures the high-quality construction of the structure, thus enhancing the lifespan of the asset. As a latecomer to the Malaysian market, we perceived two strategies to penetrate the market; either competing on pricing or delivering the best quality. We chose to implement the second strategy and surprised people with how well our modern technology works. Soon, developers and contractors realized that it is instrumental to use and invest in advanced technology in all stages of the construction process to build state-of-the-art, high-rise buildings. Often, we understand better than contractors how the building will look like and what the challenges will be. This is underlying our business principle as the “formwork experts." </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the opportunities for Malaysia with the One Belt, One Road initiative, especially with regards to the recreation of the Maritime Silk Road?</h4><p>Among Malaysia's strengths are its central geographical position in the economically vibrant and fast-growing ASEAN region between the major economies of China and India. Our nation's cultural diversity and political stability also plays a strong role in attracting FDI over the long term. Because of these factors and more, major sources of investments see opportunities in working with their Malaysian counterparts and this will develop into greater Malaysian economic integration into the global supply chains moving forward.</p><h4>How should investments from China be channeled to benefit Malaysian society at large, and how do you work to attract more investments into these structural growth areas of the economy?</h4><p>Certainly, as far as possible, we will urge for the skilled manpower and other local resources to be used in joint projects with China. However, in the large sense, large-scale FDI can be beneficial as a major catalyst to our smaller construction suppliers and auxiliary industries. The government will ensure that local SMEs and large businesses will not be left out of the mainstream of economic development and craft policies to that effect.</p><h4>SMEs are often seen as the backbone of emerging economies—especially for job creation—how do you encourage SMEs and young entrepreneurs to become more active in the international arena?</h4><p>SMEs currently make up 98% of all registered companies in Malaysia but contribute only 36.3% of the nation's GDP, and our administration's goal to reach 41% by 2020. It is crucial for SMEs to leverage information technology in order to make the leaps needed to compete sustainably in the global economic arena. Malaysia's overarching plan is to introduce a digital free trade zone in 2017 to further solidify the ecosystems that enable SMEs to scale up, from financing to human capital development. With ICT as an enabler of other sectors, hopefully this enhances technology absorption in SMEs in sectors such agriculture and manufacturing to legal and healthcare and to support the adoption of e-commerce by online platforms for micro-enterprises.</p><h4>Human capital development is a key enabler of an innovative society. What should be done to bridge the gap between education and industry demands?</h4><p>Malaysia is undergoing a revamp of its entire education landscape, from pre-school to post-secondary education via the 2013-2025 Malaysia Education Blueprint. The core objective of this restructuring is indeed to bridge the knowledge gaps between today's methods of teaching and learning and how they translate to future workforce needs. In terms of building core character, students should develop holistically and not only have academic achievements as a main criterion for good grades. Not only are students required to adopt at least one sport and co-curricular subject, they will also be given opportunities to equip themselves to learn global languages such as Spanish, French, or Japanese, in addition to Malay, English, and other mother tongues. On infrastructure, the national education system receives heavy investment with more laboratory and workshop facilities for the teaching of STEM subjects in more normal classroom and vocational learning institutions.</p><h4>What are your ambitions within your portfolio of SME, micro-credit, and Chinese New Villages for the year ahead?</h4><p>All portfolios are integrated at various levels and from village to village in their respective states. SMEs' needs for financing information and government-related procedures will continue to be served by the Secretariat for the Advancement of Malaysian Entrepreneurs (SAME), which is set up under my office. One major initiative under SAME, the Alternate Funding Program will continue to find promising SMEs and invite them to pitching sessions heard by our panel of 18 venture capital firms, angel investors, and equity crowd funding from Malaysia, Singapore, China, Taiwan, the US, and the UK. Chinese New Villages are growth centers with cottage industries and tourist attractions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>It looks like the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) project may finally happen. Are you ready to participate?</h4><p>Our past experience speaks for itself. Our air-rail link between Kuala Lumpur and the city's international airport (KLIA) was the first, and is still the only, HSR facility in Malaysia. We are fast, reliable, and safe, and we now have a solid 14-year track record of operating a world-class, award-winning service. Since 2002 we have been operating two lines: the KLIA Ekspres, which gets air travelers directly from KL to KLIA in 28 minutes—the quickest way to move between those two points—and the KLIA Transit for commuters, which stops at three intermediate stations. In August 2016 we transported our 75 millionth passenger. Our on-time performance for KLIA Ekspres is 99.7%, making us the second-best performing airport express operator in the world after Hong Kong Airport Express. If we were given the opportunity to be involved in the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore HSR, we would be more than ready.</p><h4>Why do travelers continue to choose Express Rail Link when there are cheaper options to get to the airport?</h4><p>Besides the speed, reliability, and safety of our trains, connectivity is another big plus. We are well connected with other transit systems in Kuala Lumpur, especially via KL Sentral Station, where one can transfer easily to the Monorail, the LRT, the KTM Komuter, and the soon-to-be-launched MRT system. At Bandar Tasik Selatan Station, there is a large bus terminal for north-, south- and east-bound intercity express buses out of Kuala Lumpur. The Bandar Tasik Selatan Station is also connected to the LRT Ampang Line and KTM Komuter. For travelers headed from KL Sentral Station to the airport, we have partnered with a number of airlines to provide flight check-in services at our in-town check-in facility at KL Sentral Station, one of very few city check-ins available in the world. If you take Malaysia Airlines, Etihad Airways, or Cathay Pacific, you can check in your luggage at KL Sentral. We check in around 1,000 bags per day, and we have not lost a single piece of baggage in our 14 years of operation.</p><h4>How has KLIA Transit benefited from the growth areas along the corridor, and vice versa?</h4><p>The KLIA Transit stops at three intermediate stations. Since our launch in 2002, there have been plenty of developments along the corridor, especially in and around Putrajaya, the administrative capital of Malaysia. Traffic through Putrajaya was initially low, but with the tremendous growth in the area and neighboring Cyberjaya—with its many multinational companies and universities—we have seen the number of passengers triple over the years. The area around Salak Tinggi Station was once an oil palm plantation, but it has seen rapid development in recent years. There is now a large residential area around the station, and early in 2016 the new Xiamen University Malaysia—its first branch campus outside of China—opened its doors. The connectivity factor via our transit line is definitely one of the reasons it opened there. We are happy that the stations we built have spurred growth in the surrounding areas.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the HSR connecting KL and Singapore?</h4><p>This has remained our greatest aspiration ever since we mooted the idea in 2000. But perhaps because of the sheer size of the project and the fact that it would entail a great deal of intergovernmental interaction, the country was only ready for it recently, when the Land Public Transport Authority (SPAD) was formed a few years ago and started a feasibility study. There is a lot work to be done on issues such as immigration, land use, and shared operations; however, we are happy to note that MyHSR and Singapore Land Transport Authority have been working hard on this. There will be an international open tender and we are definitely keen to participate. We are hopeful about our prospects in view of our expertise. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-missing-link]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The KL-Singapore line is a cross-border project between SPAD and LTA. How is this cooperation working out?</h4><p>It is going well; we deliver what we promise. The negotiations started a few years ago and it is a complex case because of the technical aspects, the financing, and the mapping. It is also important to note that 90% of the line is in Malaysia, and we had to ensure that we came up with an equitable arrangement in terms of financing. We agreed on a bilateral committee, overseen by SPAD and LTA, to ensure that the project will be executed properly</p><h4>How are you addressing new developments on the taxi markets, with peer-to-peer taxi applications like Uber and GrabCar?</h4><p>The taxi industry in Malaysia needs to be transformed. It needs to change to reflect changes in technology, as well as consumer interests and to be able to provide first class service. There have been many complaints from both tourists and locals about our current taxi service. Uber and Grabcar have jumped into this market with their commute sharing technologies. The key question is how to be fair. At the moment, they use unlicensed cars, and are, therefore, excluded from taxi regulations. This is a common problem around the world, with taxi drivers protesting everywhere. We have four principles of looking at this. The first is that we embrace technology, no matter if it is disruptive. We welcome competition and we support new players coming into the market. We also believe in a level playing field; what we impose on taxi drivers must also be adopted by any other new service, such as Uber or GrabCar—they must follow the law. The fourth is that we must be fair to taxi drivers and take their complaints seriously. If this business model is indeed outdated, then we should change it.</p><h4>What is your role in regards to the responsibility of “right of way" in the context of land use?</h4><p>Our first priority is rail alignment. The law enables us to acquire the land that the government has allocated for rail lines. We also talk to operators to ensure they include transit-orientated development in their construction plan that will enable us to capture the value of the land appreciation or even potential revenue in the future. It becomes endowment revenue, as we have learned it is possible to carry the costs by fares eventually. We increasingly look at such transport development: a mixed urban development is needed around rail stations. In the context of KL, the urban sprawl is not ideal because it still encourages the use of private vehicles, which we try to reduce. Integrated development is key here: if the development is 5km from the rail line, then there needs to be a connected bus network. We refer to this as “the demand, pull factor." We try to pull people into using public transport, improving the infrastructure. There is the push factor as well, like the price of parking.</p><h4>What is your agenda for the year ahead?</h4><p>Malaysia has achieved tremendous growth in the last five years, greatly supported by development in public transportation. I would like to see our current projects come to fruition in a safe and reliable manner and for us to start operations flawlessly. We need to gain the confidence of the greater public. I want to ensure that our planned projects, like the HSR and the East Coast Railway, will enter the next phase of development, and become finalized. We need to work on a sustainable financing model—we are building billion-dollar projects in the next five years and need to ensure that there are returns to the government. We have to remain competitive to induce people to use public transportation so we have to look at transit-orientated development and recoup the government's investment. For example, with the HSR, the mandate is not only developing the rail system but development around the stations as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did SCS evolve to become the key service provider on cyber security to the Malaysian defense industry?</h4><p>While I was working in the RND division of Sapura, we often received requests from the Ministry of Defense on matters of Command and Control (C2) and Electronic Warfare. The Malaysian Authorities at that time had purchased a military Command, Control and Intelligence system (C3I) from the British and there was little expertise within the military to oversee the implementation of the system. To deliver the proper support on this project, we decided to form a dedicated company and in 1993 we established as Sapura Consultancy Services, which we later rebranded as SCS. We started our operations with six consultants and developed rapidly from there. The government was keen on purchasing new technology, but needed technical advice and experts to maintain these complicated systems—the military alone did not have the capabilities to do so. The British could do it; however, the idea was to localize these services as having foreigners around our strategic defense infrastructure would present an unnecessary security risk. That is how we became the maintenance provider of these systems. Prior to 2000, we did a major software upgrade and in conjunction with the Y2K compliance upgrade, we revamped the systems at the Ministry of Defense across the board and have been maintaining them ever since. Software and hardware are not static systems and continued maintenance is of pivotal importance to ensure the continued reliable service.</p><h4>Would you also say that the security threats have changed?</h4><p>Security threats change all the time. You can be an expert on one system and educate yourself on all the available hacking tools; however, once a new system arrives or gets upgraded overnight, you are back where you started—imagine the consequences for the military. We need to maintain continued awareness of global developments in cyber security and electronic warfare. We train and provide technology updates and awareness to around 2,000 military staff each year to monitor the situation. In addition, we now offer our services to the national police and several town councils to enhance their public services and cyber security measures.</p><h4>Do you see an increase in demand for these services by private clients?</h4><p>Awareness is increasing though, unfortunately, not fast enough, as cyber security is a big threat to the whole wellbeing of businesses. There is no such thing as a free lunch—be careful when you get one. In the present day and age, technology like Facebook and WhatsApp are available for free, although it costs billions to set up the infrastructure and keep all the servers running. Without having vast assets, Facebook sold for USD 25 billion, which demonstrates how much data is worth these days. Commercial organizations that have valuable information should be aware of the power and the privacy risks, as the tools to break into this data have become much more advanced.</p><h4>What are your activities in the non-defense domain?</h4><p>Our mainstay, about 90% of our business, is in defense and in Malaysia. We plan to expand in non-defense industries like Light Rail Transit (LRT), because these systems have technical support systems where we can bring in our expertise in software management. We have vast experience in supplying the control system for the country's electricity grid company Tenaga Nasional and KTM, which is a key player in keeping the trains rolling. We are a service provider to KTM, LRT, and MRT, and in this regard we have a track record in providing technology and servicing these systems. Infrastructure in rail transport has to last at least 30 years, and during such a lifecycle, software needs to be upgraded multiple times. It is always better to have a local company involved in computer system servicing, i.e. a firm that can deal with problems within a two-hour timeframe. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a founding member of the OIC since 1969, what role has Malaysia played in the organization?</h4><p>In addition to the fact that Malaysia was one of the founding members of the OIC, the first Secretary-General of the organization was Tunku Abdul Rahman, the first Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya before becoming Malaya's first Prime Minister after independence in 1957. The role played by Malaysia in the OIC has been salient not only in terms of formulating the organization's policies but also in leading the economic development of the 57 member countries. What distinguishes Malaysia is its stable social structure despite its cultural diversity.</p><h4>What is your vision for Islamic finance, and why has it been gaining so much momentum in recent years? </h4><p>Malaysia has had the first mover advantage in establishing a strong basis for Islamic banking and finance. Several commentators hold the view that the industry will be taken over by other countries. This should not be a reason to worry. We have the foundations and companies will eventually come to us. At the same time, we should be happy that such a comprehensively strong system is being practiced in Muslim and non-Muslim countries alike. In fact, people around the world have been looking for an alternative to the interest-based financial system, which unfairly maximizes the benefits of the lender and puts the borrower in trouble. The Islamic perspective, on the contrary, protects both parties in the sense that they should share profits or losses.</p><h4>What are your thoughts about developments in the global halal industry and what needs to be done to ensure halal operations in the whole supply chain? </h4><p>Halal is a word that describes any act or substance that complies with the teachings of Islam and is not merely confined to food and beverage products. Islamic finance can be thought of as the halal way to embark on financial transactions. The reason behind the rise of the global halal industry is again the assurance it provides of safety, cleanliness, and hygiene along the supply chain. However, ensuring that various products and services are halal is not an easy task. Certificates and logos are not enough, although they are a necessity. Continuous testing of processes and sufficient training for workers are extremely important in every stage of the production. Other sectors that increasingly focus on halal include fashion, cosmetic products, and holiday packages in addition to health services and pharmaceutical products.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the volatility of the oil price, its challenges to oil-producing countries around the world, and Malaysia's relatively diversified economy?</h4><p>The impact of low oil prices has been inimical on the global economy in general and specific countries in particular. Should a country's economy rely only on its oil transactions, its situation will definitely be less favorable. Diversity is the key strategy to avoid being in such situations. The variety of products and services offered by Malaysian corporations help safeguard its steady economic growth. It is not wise to base growth only on one product or service alone, no matter how large a company's production is. Oil-producing Malaysia does not only export crude oil; rather, there are many downstream activities taking place.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for OIC Today?</h4><p>OIC Today has the objective of disseminating information on business and investment updates and opportunities within the 57 OIC member countries. It was the first platform founded by my late father Dato' Dr Raja Mohamad Abdullah in 2003 before he established the Muslim World Biz annual event in 2010. Following in his footsteps, we work to expand the reach of the magazine all across the Muslim world. Currently, the magazine is widely distributed in Malaysia and in the countries where our partners operate. Our ambition is to make the magazine globally recognized, and for this we take great care of the quality and diversity of the content and distribution channels. <strong></strong></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[an-exclusive-market]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why does iflix focus specifically on emerging markets?</h4><p>We are passionate about emerging markets. We believe the opportunities here are enormous. More than 3 billion people will enter the middle class over the next 15 years, and they will collectively purchase 1 billion new smartphones. This increasingly affluent group will be connected, and have access to information and cultural influences on a global scale. They will want to be entertained at a world-class standard. At the moment, for many of these people, their only option is piracy. We founded iflix with the aim of offering consumers an alternative that is better than piracy. We envision bringing together the world's best content, with thousands of first run exclusive titles, current hits, and iconic, award-winning TV series, blockbuster movies, popular local and regional content, children's programs, and more, on a world-class service where users can both stream and download programs, all for an unbelievably low monthly price. When it came to pricing, instead of asking how much people would pay for this service, we chose instead to calculate what was the lowest we could feasibly charge and still build a viable business.</p><h4>What made you decide to start your operations from Malaysia, and how is the startup ecosystem?</h4><p>Malaysia is an extraordinary country to do business in. We participate in a program called Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) that provides great incentives and support for international startup firms like us, including facilitating the recruitment of foreign talent through visa access, and connecting us with the larger ecosystem fostered by organizations like MDEC, from which we receive key assistance on education and promotion. Kuala Lumpur is a culturally open, global commercial and financial hub, with high educational standards and many international schools. This makes the city attractive for expatriate assignments. Furthermore, the relative cost of doing business is low while the ease of doing business is high. The pool of global talent available is also significant. Approximately 30,000 Malaysian graduates with an overseas tertiary degree, international experience, and business perspective repatriate each year with the aim of continuing their careers back home. A considerable percentage of our team fits this exact profile. As we continue our rapid growth, expanding into new markets, it is a great advantage to have this depth of talent, who are foreign educated with international backgrounds and networking experience.</p><h4>In addition to Malaysia, you are making progress on regional expansion. Could you brief us on the developments here?</h4><p>Our first bet was to attempt to build the entire product with world-class technology out of Malaysia, and we succeeded. Our experiences and learning here have given us an extraordinary understanding of consumer demands in emerging markets, and the challenges which need to be overcome to fulfil those. In Asia, we are now live in Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. Around the world, there is a band of countries that have a number of things in common; paid television penetration is low and internet connectivity is leapfrogging ahead—in some instances going from no connection at all straight to 4G. Myanmar, for example, has gone from 3 million mobile users in 2014 to 45 million this year, and almost all are using 3G or 4G. Unlike markets such as India, there is no incumbent base of old technology that needs to be upgraded here—everyone can and does immediately move to the latest technology available. Our footprint is a global set of markets which all meet these criteria, including Iran, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana. These countries are culturally diverse, but they all share similar levels of infrastructure development and market dynamics. The first phone that many people in these markets have access to is a smartphone that additionally has the capabilities of a supercomputer, and is used as a remote control for in their daily lives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the origins behind Saudi Aramco's IKTVA program, and how will it contribute to the long-term, sustainable development of the Kingdom's industrial sector?</h4><p>We identified a strategic need for a robust Saudi energy and industrial sector in order to capitalize on our true long-term value, but we knew it was critical that any solution was collaborative in nature with our international supply chain, the Saudi private sector, and of course the government. IKTVA is that solution. It drives key activities towards localization and job creation, by measuring the added value brought to the Kingdom by a supplier. The program was designed to positively change the way Saudi Aramco engages with its suppliers when procuring goods and services targeting primary goals that will enable a sustainable economy, supply chain, and energy sector. Put simply, we will double the share of Saudi Aramco spend allocated to locally manufactured materials and services to reach 70% by 2021. Our forecast spend, approximately 1.4 trillion Saudi Riyals over the next 10 years, for our goods and services is a huge opportunity for our suppliers and investors to capture. Our partnership with them will create the economic and industrial building blocks for the Saudi energy sector. It will also create hundred thousands of direct and indirect jobs for talented young Saudi men and women over the long term. To meet the new demand for skilled manpower for drilling and oil field services as well as the professional and craft labor jobs required to build our facilities, we are establishing training centers and programs in collaboration with the related government entities. Across the Kingdom we will have about 28 training centers targeting 360,000 graduates by 2030.</p><h4>Many within the business community have argued that the push by Aramco to promote local content up to 70% by 2021 has, in fact, been a long time coming. To what extent does IKTVA's launch coincide with the drop in oil prices and, by extension, the government's diversification reforms under Vision 2030?</h4><p>IKTVA and its launch in 2015 was a long time in the works, developed in-house within Saudi Aramco. It would have gone ahead regardless of market dynamics. Shortly following the launch, the Kingdom saw the announcement for Vision 2030 that provided much needed focus and drive across the economy, and to which IKTVA is Saudi Aramco's premier contribution. Beyond the specifics of IKTVA, we have been preparing for several years with a keen focus on business sustainability. We have been laying the economic groundwork to facilitate and enable success for our supplier network and enable the success of IKTVA and the transformation of the Kingdom's economy to a more diversified industrial base. As I highlighted, we have formed partnerships with training institutions, worked closely with government entities, and built industrial parks, value parks, and economic cities. We have done this to ensure that a high quality workforce is available. There is an investment-friendly landscape; and there are ready-made hubs of economic activity for businesses to set up shops here in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What have been some of the key early indicators of IKTVA's success following the recent one-year commemoration of its launch, and what are your short-term objectives going forward?</h4><p>We marked the one-year anniversary with real progress and results. In December 2016, we celebrated by gathering more than 700 attendees of our local and international suppliers along with the government entities and officials in “IKTVA Forum 2016.“ The Forum marked a major milestone in the trajectory to accelerate localization amongst Saudi Aramco's supplier community. We are very proud of what has been accomplished during the first year of the program. A major millstone of IKTVA was embedding it in our procurement process where all major procurements now include IKTVA targets, and proposals are required to be included in bid submittals and business allocation guidelines have been revised to reward IKTVA achievements. To date it has been embedded in approximately SAR60 billion worth of contracts. Alongside, we have boosted the share of materials procured from local manufacturers. During 2016, our spend on locally manufactured materials reached over SAR10 billion, representing 43% of our direct materials spend which is the highest percentage ever achieved in our history in Saudi Aramco. At the same time, we established baselines for companies and industries to be our starting step, engaging with our major suppliers, to mutually develop realistic action plans and IKTVA targets for the next five years. As well as in December event, we awarded our suppliers with the “IKTVA Excellence Awards“ in recognition of their steadfast commitment and significant contributions to IKTVA in areas such as Saudi workforce, localization of goods and services, supplier development, training and development, and employee recognition. We are very proud of how much ground we have covered since the launch of IKTVA last year, and going forward in 2017, we will continue to work closely with our suppliers and stakeholders to increase our local spending. Currently, there are different planned investments in forging, chemicals, casting, motors, steel plates and more. All these investments will contribute greatly to developing our local supply chain and us realizing our 70% localization by 2021.</p><h4>What impact will IKTVA have on multinational companies currently doing business with Saudi Aramco?</h4><p>Early movers have seen the same opportunities as us and some of our biggest suppliers have re-written their business plans, and are even asking their suppliers for IKTVA metrics. To us these are meaningful key long-term performance indicators. More generally, IKTVA is positively changing the way suppliers—multinationals and Saudi companies—are looking to their investments in Saudi Arabia. We want an increased presence in Saudi Arabia not only to final assembly operations, but rather, to establish and develop their manufacturing supplier base, and regionalize their research and development (R&amp;D) alongside their operations in the Kingdom. We facilitate this process by providing suppliers visibility into our 10-year demand in materials and services with the capability to drill down to specific details for serious investors. With this information and our proactive engagement we help investors develop their business case to localize. We are committed to those companies through our long-term agreements as well as through IKTVA primary objectives which are supporting the business allocation to those suppliers as well as rewarding their achievements.</p><h4>To what extent would you agree that Aramco's commitment to empower local industry could lay the groundwork for other major companies, perhaps even the government, to implement similar initiatives in the future?</h4><p>IKTVA program has the required elements to act as a localization program for the oil and gas industry. It can also be slightly customized to be implemented at the national level for different industries and services. Since IKTVA's launch, we have started an outreach program to increase the awareness of IKTVA for the business community as well as the government entities. We have seen a great interest in IKTVA from different the government organizations and major local companies that we have discussed the program with. Such discussion and collaboration is ongoing to ultimately adopt a localization program where we think that IKTVA can be the base of the national localization initiative.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has the power deficit meant for Zambia in terms of rethinking energy generation options in the country?</h4><p>Between early 2015 up to October 2016, Zambia's rainfall pattern was poor, and with low water levels in many of our hydro plants, generation capacity—of which 95% comes from water sources—fell by almost 50%. Subsequently, Zambia had to begin thinking outside the box. In 2015, we started driving a campaign to diversify into renewables, working together with the World Bank and its Investment Fund Corporation (IFC) on the Scaling Solar project, as well as investing in coal, geothermal, and nuclear power. Zambia has many coal deposits dotted around the country, and, in particular, a high concentration in Sinazongwe, in the southern province. We also developed the Maamba collieries project as part of a PPP, which is using geothermal technologies to produce energy for the nation. The long-term vision is for Zambia to emerge from the power deficit stronger than before, thinking intelligently and innovatively, to embark on a path to become an eventual net exporter of power.</p><h4>What is the significance of partnering with the private sector for the government's plan for energy development?</h4><p>The government alone does not have the fiscal resources to invest large amounts of money directly into power solutions; therefore, it is vital to partner with the private sector, which has these resources and is adept at managing them. However, to bring these players on board we need to make sure the business environment is attractive enough, which is what the government focuses on at the moment, with incentives and collaboration with the IMF and other global organizations. One of these success stories is the Scaling Solar project, which we began in 2015, setting the target for 600MW from solar generation over the next few years. However, we have already tendered 100MW of this and have started to look at increasing our target potential. We expect our work, in partnership with Enel Green and Neoen, to seriously begin developing in 1Q2017, with a view to float the second tender for about 250MW in January 2017. It is an exciting project, a first for Zambia and, when the tariff structure with its exceptionally low rates is considered, globally significant. Many energy projects in this country have been made possible because of debt financing and grants from international partners. The budget we have raised for energy creation so far is around USD10 million. However, we estimate that to reach our target of 51% electricity penetration in rural areas totals we will need more than USD50 million per annum, and for this reason we also need to forge strong ties with external parties. Many of these, such as the EU, World Bank, and African Development Bank, have been supportive so far, and we have successfully packaged some attractive and well-planned projects in exchange for grants and concession loans.</p><h4>Can renewables revolutionize energy generation and access to energy in Zambia?</h4><p>If we want to industrialize the country and meet our pledge to generate 1 million jobs for Zambian people, then we need sufficient direct supply of power. For this, we need to unlock potential in hydro, coal, and nuclear. Solar energy is a complement to this. While it cannot support large-scale industrialization, it can play a vital role in unlocking the potential of rural areas, which may be 10-20 years away from accessing energy through the national grid. Off-grid solutions have revolutionized life in these communities, where people can now use energy to open small businesses and access technology, putting them in touch with the rest of the world.</p><h4>What is the importance of interregional collaboration in Africa's energy future?</h4><p>Regional integration is key for the energy sector because African countries have different potential, different volumes, and varying levels of investment. For example, Zambia could capitalize on its historical relationship with South Africa and tap into their surplus power in order to mitigate the effects of our crisis. We could also look to the East, where countries like Ethiopia are bounding ahead in terms of power generation. We have launched some initiatives to encourage such connectivity. One such transmission line that will connect Zambia to the East is the Zambia Kenya Tanzania transmission project (the ZKT), and it is even hoped that this grid will connect Zambia to the Ethiopian grid in the long run. The planned project to upgrade the Kafue-Livingstone transmission line to 220kV by May 2017 will bring power into Lusaka and Maamba, as well as other provinces, and will enable Zambia and its regional neighbors in the southeast to trade excess power. There is another transmission line between Zambia and Zimbabwe that is instrumental in allowing Escom to bring in much of the excess power generated in Zimbabwe, and we are also in talks with South Africa and Botswana for further possibilities opening here. Finally, we are developing transmission lines to Ethiopia and to Tanzania, and hope that in 2017 we will have the financing to complete these projects.</p><h4>What are the main goals moving forward for Zambia's nuclear development in the medium term?</h4><p>Our first step will be to dispel the myths surrounding nuclear energy that make countries very cautious about bringing nuclear into the mix. And for this, we must encourage education and build capacity. I hope to have created a policy and institutional framework that will allow us to bring in developers within the next five years. At the moment, we focus on our collaborations with Russia and China, though this is just a starting point to allow Zambia to set sail on its nuclear journey. We want to start thinking about the international standards we should meet to commit to nuclear in the long-term: how to manage waste, or the eventual decommissioning of facilities, among other issues. We need to be able to satisfy the international community with our assurances that nuclear generation will power our industry, fuel our economy, and boost job creation, and it is for these reasons that we want to invest in it as part of our future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can we expect from your “ideation lab“ organized with Uber and DIGI and concluded at Global Entrepreneurship Community (GEC)?</h4><p>MaGIC has always had an ASEAN point of view in its approach to programs and topics. Even our parent accelerator program is inclusive from an ASEAN participation point of view. Partnering with two major players helped us spark interest from the whole region, and we received around 200 submissions from startups around the whole community. We shortlisted 10 of them for a presentation at the GEC, and we support them via a boot camp to refine their ideas and prepare them for a strong pitch to investors. Uber will take the final five to Silicon Valley to network with investors. This project is a pilot for us to learn how to harness entrepreneurs, and for next year we have decided on a more problem-centric approach. Our objective is to foster better corporate and start-up collaboration—corporate here not is the sense of a typical blue-chip MNC, but established players across all sectors. In finance and telecoms, the innovation ecosystem is relatively mature and we focus on other, less savvy sectors. For the GEC, we depicted 8+1 categories, the latter a more horizontal one, namely social innovation. The sectoral ones include healthcare, education, finance, lifestyle, creative industries, supply chain and logistics, biotech, and smart cities. Our organization looks at entrepreneurship development, not industry development, so our categories are not cast in stone. ASEAN has a young population, and young people tend to be more impressionable about working within the start-up ecosystem. We want to put our young and creative minds in touch with corporates. This can be driven by ideas from the corporates as well, especially problem-centric ideas that have the highest chance of being commercialized. Though we have an ASEAN focus, we invite companies from across the globe to use Malaysia as a creativity and innovation hub—the world of ideas is borderless.</p><h4>Is there a large enough supply of entrepreneurs and ideas?</h4><p>There are many aspiring entrepreneurs; however, viewing their ideas from a commercial point of view is less common. We tell entrepreneurs to be aware of this as they go out and validate their business ideas. Human beings having a tipping point threshold in paying for a new product or service to improve their lives. Entrepreneurs tend to wrongly assume that just because their idea is well received, people are willing to pay for it. Companies need to figure out the tipping point, no matter how advanced their application is—entrepreneurs need to size themselves up here. One success story comes in the form of our accelerator program, which is a four-month program that we run twice per year. For each batch we bring onboard 50 start-ups for a learning experience. The companies that have gone through get an average of 40% month-on-month growth at the stage where they come in, be it user traction or revenue traction. These are not huge revenues but they are traction to actually validate their business model. Within those four months, our goal is to put them in a solid position to present and pitch to a private-sector investor.</p><h4>How do you bring academia into your work, like you did with your Stanford partnership?</h4><p>Stanford has an excellent success rate of entrepreneurs coming out of its program, which is why we were keen to partner with it. We took some of its modules and teaching methodologies and now have guest speakers from its faculties here. Stanford has also hosted a two-week immersive program, an executive education skewed toward entrepreneurship for our participants. The net content is a week long, while the other week is for networking and being exposed to other startups in Silicon Valley. We will extend our global collaboration and partner with the Institute for the Future in San Francisco as well, in line with our conference's theme of reimagining the future of entrepreneurs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the key mentality change you would like to establish amongst Malaysians?</h4><p>Looking at the innovation mentality, our goal is to see how we can help cultivate a thinking culture and equip the next generation with creative and critical thinking abilities. We have embarked on three programs since we were established in 2011. The first is called I-Think, which aims to implement innovative learning tools in schools. Furthermore, we have introduced the International Baccalaureate (IB) program in 10 government schools in Malaysia, and eight of these have already received IB certification since the project started two years ago. These are not elite schools; these are a cross section of the country. We are studying how these new teaching and learning methods can influence the school system and ultimately change the mentality of our students. A third program is Genovasi, a design thinking school in Petaling Jaya that has already seen 2,500 graduates since its establishment three years ago. The school targets young working graduates who can follow the Innovation Ambassador Development Program, which was developed to introduce design thinking in the work place. Cultivating a culture of innovation among our future generation is a long-term objective, and we intend to combine elements of what we learn from I-Think, IB, and Genovasi into innovation skill programs for our secondary schools. Our agency is governed by a council of seven ministers, with the prime minister as our chairman. Innovation essentially cuts across everything, enabling us to help to move the agenda with all the relevant ministries.</p><h4>How does Malaysia fit into the global innovation landscape, and why would multinationals choose to have their R&amp;D here?</h4><p>Multinationals here are supported with various programs, such as CREST for the E&amp;E industry that actively links them with academia and local SMEs, often when looking for joint research models. Other programs we have put in place typically target SMEs, especially to support them with commercialization. We have PlaTCOM Ventures providing end-to-end facilitation for companies to take the important final step in commercializing their findings. Around 100 SMEs have been accepted into the program, of which 10 have achieved commercialization. We have access to global IP databases, and we teach people how to protect their ideas with IP strategy. PlaTCOM also oversees all the IPs in our universities and research institutes. There is a large flow of government funding for R&amp;D into these institutions, and we match these IPs with commercialization partners to get the licenses done. Another program that we started is Steinbeis, originally a German organization. It has been successful in providing a platform to link industry directly with subject matter experts. This is particularly useful for SMEs that run into a roadblock during their development trajectory where they need expert advice. Steinbeis uses its extensive network to find the right expertise, and is responsible for the agreement, pricing, and arrangement, making it cost effective.</p><h4>What will be the legacy of your work at the end of AIM's mandate in 2020?</h4><p>One of the reasons why we had this 10-year timeframe was to have some level of urgency to move the innovation agenda. We also did not want to become another government agency that would permanently require public funding, as at the end of the day innovation should be primarily driven by the private sector. Many of our programs will continue without AIM, either on their own or with the support of other agencies. Steinbeis was set up as a non-profit foundation and works to be self-sufficient; all fees that are collected cover the operating costs. This model is self-sustaining, does not need government funding, and will be part of the innovation ecosystem. Similarly, PlaTCOM is set up as a company and continues as a private limited company, collecting fees from IP advisory and other consultancy. Genovasi, the design thinking school, has been privatized and will transform into a university, supported by private sector investments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>According to World Urbanization Prospects, published by the UN, globally 54% of the world's population was residing residing in urban areas in 2014, and by 2050, 66% of the world's population is projected to be urban. The process of urbanization historically has been associated with other important economic and social transformations. Cities are important drivers of development and poverty reduction in both urban and rural areas, as they concentrate much of the national economic activity, government, commerce, and transportation, and provide crucial links with rural areas, between cities, and across international borders. By 2030, the world is projected to have 41 mega-cities with more than 10 million inhabitants. Several decades ago most of the world's largest urban agglomerations were found in the more developed regions, but today's large cities are concentrated in south Asia. There is a dramatic change in terms of demographic structure that brings a broad range of challenges, among them. That requires both the public and private sector to reconsider their policies and approaches. In this context, the concept of a smart city has emerged over recent years to provide citizens with better-quality services and opportunities. It is forecasted that the number of smart cities around the globe will reach 40 by the year 2020, and Asian cities are at the very heart of this phenomena. Smart infrastructure, smart energy, smart mobility, smart buildings, smart grids, and smart materials; smart is the new green. Yet, whereas green products and programs are aimed at environmental aspirations, smart solutions encompass and extend beyond these applications. Smart solutions are strongly based on use of information and technology. Smart solutions are seen as an opportunity to allow economies like Malaysia to benefit from such reforms. The path to these cities is always challenging and complicated. We should also take into consideration that if smart cities fail, the cost of damage will be none. We need to completely rethink our approach to peculiarities and challenges. We need to think more about long-term survival and less about short-term gain, more about cooperation than about competition, and, most importantly, we need to engage people and communities. That leads us to another question: what do we want a smart city to be? We need to focus on how we shape the technology to reach this.<br></p><p>Meanwhile, 74.5% of Malaysians are currently living in cities and urban areas, and this number is projected to increase to 90% by 2020. Therefore, demand for smart city infrastructure will be essential in the path toward a sustainable future. Moving forward, Malaysia is currently in the stage of shifting from an emerging market to a developed market, and “smart solutions" are seen as the key to growth. This developed market goal is supposed to be reached by 2020. The Malaysian government is proactive and ready to invest in smart initiatives that will push the country forward. The introduction of the Multimedia Super Corridor, a special zone for the development of information and multimedia technology, in 1996, was the first step on the way to smart cities in Malaysia. Recognizing the need to intensify domestic and international networks for research collaboration, strategic partnerships and business relationships, Malaysia established the Global Science and Innovation Advisory Council (GSIAC). An overarching goal of GSIAC is to assist Malaysia in the development of a high-tech green economy. One major component of this “green futures" initiative is the smart city and smart village program, which will see the construction of energy-efficient population centers across the country. This will be the first project of this kind in the ASEAN region. Smart City Iskandar Malaysia was endorsed during a meeting of the Global Science and Innovation Advisory Council. This pilot project aims to provide ease of doing business as well as improve living quality in Iskandar Malaysia. The focus is on three areas, namely economy, environment, and social, promoting six dimensions: smart economy, smart governance, smart environment, smart mobility, smart people, and smart living. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does this event open a new chapter in relations between Kazakhstan and Senegal, and with Africa as a whole?</h4><p>First of all, I would like to thank President Nazarbayev for his invitation and for the hospitality of the Kazakhstani people during my official visit to the country in May 2016. This is an historic visit as I am the first Head of State of a non-Arab African country to have made an official visit to Kazakhstan. This visit, part of the growing relations between Africa and Central Asia, demonstrates a common will to strengthen the bonds of friendship and cooperation between our two countries in areas of the economy and security on a regional and international level, and a common respect for the principles of equality, partnership, and dialog in international relations. Without a doubt, we have opened a new chapter in the relations between our two continents and particularly, between our two countries. I would like to mention, for example, the values of tolerance and respect for diversity in our two countries, where Islamic majorities coexist peacefully with other religions. Both countries are animated by a spirit of openness and dialog. There are many links that give us every reason to cooperate. Senegal embodies religious coexistence. We are a country in which imams and priests live side-by-side, and where political choices or the conduct of public affairs transcend ethnic and religious considerations. I would like to express my thanks to the Kazakhstani authorities for their support of our candidacy to the United Nations Security Council, where we are serving as a non-permanent member for the period 2016-2017. Senegal supported the admission of Kazakhstan to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, convinced that Kazakhstan would contribute to the spread of the religion in the world. I would also like to appreciate all the expertise of this country in the fields of energy and agriculture, which are of common interest to us in Senegal as we recently discovered gas and oil reserves.</p><h4>In what areas of economic activity do you see a particular potential for cooperation between the two countries?</h4><p>Kazakhstan, independent since 1991 and predominantly Muslim, is a country rich in oil and gas. It is also very respected for its leading role in the dialogue of religions and cultures, as I mentioned earlier. In our country, although small in size, population, and natural resources, we recently discovered oil and gas. There is already enormous potential for cooperation and sharing of expertise and know-how. The sectors of energy, mining, tourism, agriculture, infrastructure, and industry have been identified as key areas of the economy where I reiterate our commitment to cooperation with Kazakhstan. We have discussed with President Nazarbayev the forms of cooperation between our two countries in commercial, economic, and investment matters, as well as trade in different sectors of the economy. I want to highlight energy, of course, but also agriculture and infrastructure. Kazakhstan's great achievements, ambition, and know-how coincide with the Emerging Senegal Plan (ESP), which is the frame of reference for public policies launched since February 2014. The priority is to improve the performance of our economy with average growth of 7% per year. Because of this, we aim for a productive revitalization based more on partnerships than aid, and the optimal utilization of strategic sectors such as agriculture, energy, mining, infrastructure, tourism, ICT, and habitat. Major projects are underway, including highways, a new city, an international airport, and a high-speed. It should be noted that in 2016 Senegal achieved a GDP growth rate of 6.5% for the first time in 12 years. Between Senegal and Kazakhstan, the ESP offers an additional reason to cooperate aside from our existing affinities. We also hope to increase our cooperation in the fields of security and military technical assistance in the fight against international terrorism to combat and prevent religious extremism, and other forms of international crime, that represent a global challenge concerning us all today. </p><h4>Senegal is among the 100 countries that have confirmed their presence and expressed their enthusiasm for EXPO 2017 in Astana. How does Senegal intend to contribute to the event and what is your vision of its long-term impact on the Kazakhstani economy?</h4><p>It is with great pleasure that we confirmed our participation in the 2017 International Exposition in Astana to President Nazarbayev. I had taken part in the Exposition in 2015 in Milan where I met the organizers of future expos. I had visited the stands of friendly countries, including Kazakhstan, which I remember had centered its presentations on the problem of energy, and particularly, the energy of the future. This was a theme in tune with the climate challenges we face. Senegal intends to actively participate in Expo 2017 in Astana under the theme “Energy of the Future," aiming to promote alternative sources of energy. This initiative is aligned with the overall objectives set in Paris and Marrakech at COP 21 and COP 22 in which Africa, and therefore Senegal, stood at the forefront of the international commitment on the issue of climate. It is thus relevant to resolve the issue of energy and access to electricity on our continent, objectives that can be achieved with new technologies. We recently inaugurated a number of solar power plants, including the Bokhol power plant, which is now the first solar power plant in West Africa. On the environmental front, the contribution of solar energy is undeniable. For the Bokhol power station alone, energy production avoids an annual emission of 25,000 tons of CO2 compared to other more pollutant modes of production. Our strategy is to opt for a more sustainable energy mix and innovative, environmentally friendly ways to develop this sector.</p><h4>How do you envisage the future of diplomatic, economic, and trade relations between Senegal and Kazakhstan?</h4><p>First of all, this first historical visit to Kazakhstan was marked by a perfect convergence of views on all the subjects mentioned. This allowed us to lay the foundation for a new relationship between Senegal and Kazakhstan in trade, economic, and investment matters. I hope that we will continue our cooperation and that we will also extend it to the educational and scientific associations of our countries, for example, in order to facilitate the exchange of our qualified students and specialists. We also pursue dialog and coordination of efforts to find solutions for urgent problems through bilateral consultation mechanisms, and within the framework of regional and international organizations like the United Nations, the Organization Islamic Cooperation, the African Union, and other international institutions. In the pursuit of our cooperation, it was with honor and satisfaction that I accepted the invitation of President Nazarbayev to help Senegal become a member of the Islamic Organization for Food Security, to be headquartered in Astana. Finally, I would like to reaffirm my support for the candidacy of the Republic of Kazakhstan, proactive in the resolution of regional and international problems, for a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period of 2017-2018. I have invited His Excellency, Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of Kazakhstan, to pay an official visit to Dakar to continue and consolidate this stable cooperation. That invitation was accepted, and the date of the visit shall be fixed shortly via diplomatic channels. We have the common ambition to establish a cultural dialogue and to broaden the components of this dialogue in order to strengthen the bonds of friendship and economic, commercial, and security cooperation between our two countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the status of your order book? </h4><p>Our aerospace business had an order book of over GBP67 billion in 2015, which is more than 80% of our total order book. Of this, over 50% of our orders come from the Middle East and Asia. We built the Seletar Campus to increase our manufacturing capacity and we wanted to be closer to our globally located customers. The campus is our first facility outside the UK to assemble and test the Trent aero engine and manufacture our crown jewel technology, the wide chord fan blade. It opened in February 2012 at an investment of over GBP350 million. This is a complex business; each engine has around 18,000 components with 35,000 parts. We work with over 8,000 companies in 70 countries; each of them plays their part in producing our products. It is like conducting the world's largest orchestra.</p><h4>What is your strategy for managing this global process?</h4><p>We have three key principles for our global production process. The first is to have operational excellence in our supply chain, embedding a lean approach across all of our sites. Second, we want engineering excellence, and third we want to capture after-market value through customer satisfaction. Considering this context and in a bid to improve efficiencies, we are building a supply chain ecosystem to support our Seletar Campus. Some of our global suppliers have chosen to be closer to the campus by establishing their own sites in Southeast Asia, for example in Senior Aerospace in Thailand. In step, we are also on the look out to form new partnerships to strengthen our supply chain.</p><h4>How have you found the local production capacity to meet your demands?</h4><p>UMW is our first tier-one supplier in Malaysia, and so far our partnership with UMW is a success story. It was chosen after an extensive bidding process. UMW proved to be ambitious, able, and willing to manufacture and assemble titanium fan cases for our engines. We found them to be the right partner for us. This project also has the support from the Malaysian government, and with that we hope to extend the partnership beyond fan cases for the Trent 1000 and Trent 7000 engines. We are confident that this will lay a strong foundation for engine component hard metal manufacturing in Malaysia. This will be a major cornerstone for the Malaysian Aerospace Blueprint. Our vision is to work with UMW and the Malaysian government, and to build on this success to further the interests of the Malaysian Aerospace Blueprint</p><h4>How does Rolls-Royce tie into this Blueprint?</h4><p>We are proud to be making a major contribution to the blueprint's success. We hope that our partnership with UMW will be a catalyst for growth in Malaysia's aerospace industry over the next 15 years. We hope that our 25-year agreement with UMW will also create opportunities for more similar initiatives in Malaysia. The previous blueprint has already created high-income jobs and the aerospace industry contributes MYR11 billion to Malaysia's GDP, and it is projected to reach MYR55 billion by 2030. We need all players, big and small, to join this effort to support the blueprint for its success.</p><h4>Low commodity prices have impacted many oil-supplying nations across the world. How does it affect your strategy?</h4><p>We cannot escape the impact of commodity price changes whether up or down. It gives us an opportunity to look at how we do things and make changes to enhance efficiency. For example, we seek to procure components closer to Singapore as this reduces transport and sourcing costs. The other side of the coin is with falling oil prices air travel becomes cheaper; overall, it results in more demand for seats on the major airlines, and by consequence the aerospace industry. We already see Airbus and Boeing pulling in orders, so engine suppliers like us are benefiting from this demand. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your master plan for KLIA Aeropolis to incorporate the space around KLIA into an airport city was launched this year. Could you tell us more about what is envisioned here?</h4><p>The government of Malaysia moved the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) 60km away from the city center, and provided us with a total land bank of 100sqkm. Since 1998, we have built two terminals and three runways, utilizing approximately 35% of the available space. What is left is a huge track of land, which can be developed in support of the airport and the surrounding ecosystem. Our largest project was the construction of the low-cost carrier terminal, KLIA2, in 2014. Half of the remaining 14,500 acres of land is reserved for future airport expansion, and the other half is subject to our new master plan. Primarily, we envision this plan to be in support of the airport ecosystem including cargo, logistics, and aerospace industries and, secondly, to improve the airport as a leisure destination for travellers. Our current capacity with two terminals and three runways together is around 70 million passengers, and we are averaging 50 million per year now; hence, there is still sufficient room for growth. </p><h4>Does cargo demand factor into your expansion decision-making process?</h4><p>Cargo and logistics are just as important in the aviation industry, and today we move around 750,000 tons of cargo, which can double in the next 20 years. Anticipating the growth of the e-commerce industry and intra-ASEAN trade due to the AEC, one of our three pillars is focused on building a cargo and logistics hub. With all order books combined, there are 25,000 planes ordered over the next 10 years, and 40% of those will be delivered within Asia Pacific. More importantly, airfreight manufacturers are looking to bring their activities closer to where the customers are. In OEM, engineering services, and MRO, size does matter, and having facilities close to an airport makes sense. Many airports in Asia have expanded their passenger terminals, but not many have these large tracks to support non-passenger activities. Malaysia has been enticing aeronautical companies for the last 10 years. The industry has grown from 13 to 200 companies, including multinationals such as Airbus, Boeing, and Rolls Royce. These industry giants seek space, a supporting ecosystem, and the right partners, which is what we offer. Additionally, there is a growing trend in Asia of airports becoming destinations for entertainment and leisure. In response to that, we have also allocated a large tract of land for theme parks within our development plan. Airports have developed to become ecosystems of their own, instead of just serving as transport hubs. European airports, like Frankfurt and Amsterdam, are considered magnet destinations in their own right. We look to emulate this here and are keen to explore similar partnerships to develop the leisure side of the airport.</p><h4>How are you looking to expand your international activities?</h4><p>We have been working on joint ventures on other airports outside of Malaysia for the last 12 to 15 years, and we used to manage airports in Cambodia and Kazakhstan. Our largest international enterprise is Sabiha Gökçen, an airport on the Asian side of Istanbul, where we have been since 2008. Together with our partners, we just delivered a brand-new terminal, which currently processes around 29 million passengers per year. It was voted the fastest growing-airport in Europe for six consecutive years. In addition to acquiring assets, we also have service contracts, like the Hamad International Airport in Doha Qatar, where we have a large facilities management contract. MAHB has managed 39 airports, ranging in size from 45,000 to 50 million passengers annually, over the last 25 years, which gives us not only relevant expertise, but the breadth of learning required to execute such projects.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>What is your vision for NAICO?</p><p>One of the goals of the Malaysian Aerospace Industry Blueprint 2030 is to establish an independent agency under the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to look into the overall developments in the aerospace industry. MITI set up NAICO to take on this role before we establish a dedicated agency over the course of 2017. We aim to further engage with all aerospace-related agencies and stakeholders in order to consolidate the nation's aerospace industry development initiatives. We work closely with MIDA, MATRADE, and SME Corp, as well as MARA, as these are the main stakeholders in the aerospace industry. The Ministry of Transport, which oversees airports and aircraft operations, is also involved. We will focus mostly on the six pillars we have identified: aerospace manufacturing; MRO; system integrations; engineering and design; training and education; and research and technology, with support for defense industries as an additional area of attention. We want to develop the supply chain and the business environment for SMEs, as well as build up industry research and technology activities, the latter for which we will engage with Aerospace Malaysia Innovation Centre (AMIC).</p><h4>What is the vision behind the recent launch of the 3M Global Aerospace Future Landscape project between Malaysia, Mexico, and Morocco?</h4><p>We predict OEMs and tier-one companies will seek regional hubs in specific markets. In this regard, we anticipate that Mexico will be the hub for North America, Morocco for Europe, and Malaysia for Asia Pacific. Competition is still ongoing and open for the Asia Pacific market, and we can take the lead there. 3M is part of our effort to engage with Mexico and Morocco and develop Malaysia as the hub for the Asia Pacific region. We visited Mexico recently to discuss potential ways to collaborate and to draft the outline of 3M. We also exchanged best practices on developing the right aerospace ecosystem on a national level. Asia Aerospace City (AAC) has an MoU with the Universidad Aeronáutica en Querétaro (UNAQ), where we learnt how UNAQ became a one-stop center for training and development for all the surrounding industries, from technicians to master's-level engineers in manufacturing. In Malaysia we have several institutes around the country that are working on this, and the key strength of Querétaro is that it brought them all together in a single area, something we would like to emulate here. We will also visit Morocco soon to discuss its experience and vision on the future development of the aerospace industry.</p><h4>What is on your agenda in terms of R&amp;D and sustainable aviation?</h4><p>Together with AMIC, we have the Factory of the Future initiative, where we look to modernize in terms of technology and industry research. We recently signed an agreement with Airbus Group, University of Malaysia, and the French Embassy in Malaysia to develop and implement an online robotics project. At MITI we are poised for Industrial 4.0, which is in line with our policy here, where robots and information technology come together. We promote these activities under the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, providing funding to AMIC to engage in robotics and other new approaches for aerospace manufacturing activities. We also want to utilize natural raw materials. For example, we want to produce aviation biofuel and take the regional lead here. AMIC is embarking on the development of sustainable aviation jet fuel with its partners UPM, UM, and other research institutes. Another recent project is on macro-algae, looking into seaweed plantations and how seaweed can be used to produce high-quality bio jet fuel. Malaysia has abundant natural materials it could use, and we explore all the possibilities of developing and producing that. We are considering working with Indonesia and Singapore on this. In addition, we look at green materials for the composites industries as natural source products like bio resins. There is much potential in renewable and sustainable materials for the aerospace industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision for the newly launched Aerospace Blueprint initiative?</h4><p>The new blueprint is essentially the second phase of the first blueprint from 1997. We set a target of total industry revenue of MYR55.2 billion and employment for 32,000 by 2030. We want to see where we can go with this sector as we see great interest from players in other sectors like automotive and electronics. In 2015, we recalibrated and reactivated the Malaysian Aerospace Council, which is chaired by the Minister of International Trade and Industry. Aerospace is an exciting industry and we want to engage the private sector, including SMEs and Malaysian companies like WZS Technologies, Jec Metal, and SDMK. We also have a new outfit, the National Aerospace Industry Coordinating Office (NAICO), which will go beyond investment promotion and policymaking and bring the industry closer to us. We are in a good position to facilitate the right environment to boost the aerospace industry.</p><h4>What role do MITI and NAICO play in the establishment of the Asia Aerospace City (AAC) by MARA?</h4><p>Organizations such as MARA have been in the industry for a long time; however, the ministry is in a unique position to be a coordinator. It is our role to interfere; we are here to facilitate business. We monitor developments and share this with investors who come to us. MARA has a great value proposition with its aerospace parks initiative the Asia Aerospace City (AAC). With regard to AAC, we were involved in the early development stage, proposing more high-quality investment from OEMs/tier-one companies to accelerate the development of the global supply chain. AAC aerospace parks in Subang and Serendah are under development; all with their own value proposition. It is our role to inform the relevant parties about these packages, and together with MIDA and SME Corp we will continue to promote foreign and domestic investments into AAC. </p><h4>Do you coordinate with ministries from other countries in ASEAN that are also involved in the aerospace industry?</h4><p>There is no ASEAN aerospace council yet, as the industry has not matured to that level. Singapore is the traditional regional player, and Malaysia is gaining more prominence. In due course, I expect it will become more regionally oriented. We want to be the most significant regional player. Our Aerospace Industry Blueprint 2030 outlines how to capture 5% of the global market share while for manufacturing; we want to be the number one producer of parts and components in Southeast Asia. We want to be 70% self-reliant in system engineering, and for engineering services, we want to capture 3.5% of the global market share. Lastly, we want to become the number one supplier of skilled aerospace engineers in Southeast Asia. Malaysia has the infrastructure and the tailored aero parks, attractive incentive packages, the human capital, and the cost of doing business is low. The value proposition is there.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Malaysia has the potential to be a strong and successful aerospace nation based on its track record in implementing the previous blueprint, and will embark on a more ambitious path towards 2030, upgrading to more high-tech activities. The ball is rolling, and it is our job to keep the necessary infrastructure up-to-date. With NAICO, we are able to bring the needs of the industry closer to policymakers, thus aligning interests. It is important that we add value across the board in every component of the industry. We want to change the attitude from technology-user to technology-supplier by significantly investing in industry-led R&amp;D, and involving more local SMEs in this process. We will work closely with universities to supply the market with graduates who respond to the needs of the industry. The blueprint is a dynamic document and as we proceed, we will adjust our focus, but we are on the right path in moving this industry forward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you break down your operations today between public and private contracting?</h4><p>Our intention is to have a 50-50 division, but in reality in the last 10 years the commercial sector of the shipping industry has been on a continuous downward trend with little recovery. With that situation in mind, we have to adjust accordingly, and our long-term intention remains having balanced exposure. Our main focus at the moment is to enhance our productivity, improve our skills, and upgrade our infrastructure. The fact that the commercial and defense sectors are currently soft gives us the opportunity to implement our transformation agenda to be leaner. Our idea is to enter the global market.</p><h4>Are you actively tapping into new markets?</h4><p>We are in the midst of restructuring and up-skilling our people accordingly; however, we also have a fair amount of domestic work. We have a contract to build six frigates, which is one of our main activities at the moment. For the mid to long-term, we actively look to add to our order books, especially in the Middle East and Northern Africa. We believe we are competitive; looking at the prices of our frigates, we compete well with our global competitors, and are around 20-35% cheaper. We have invested a great deal in engineering and design and have our own designs that we can develop as they are our intellectual property. Previously, we used to partner with foreign parties for design; however, we are increasingly capable of doing this ourselves. We have had several successes, both in commercial and defense and have a good supply of engineering talent from our universities.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your activities in the aerospace division, BHIC Aeroservices?</h4><p>BHIC Aeroservices is a joint venture between BHIC Defense, Prestige Pillar, and Airbus, and is primarily targeted at servicing helicopters in the defense industry. At the moment, our focus is more on the rotary wing; however, we are also moving to the fixed wing. We are currently the main service provider of the Malaysian defense industry, maintaining new helicopters for the Air Force, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency, and the Navy. We are expanding our MRO activities into commercial components as well. In addition, we are also in the midst of forming a new company that is 100% owned by BHIC to look into the MRO of the fixed wing. We seek to extend these activities regionally; such MRO services are universal and can be applied to helicopters abroad, for example in the commercial market. We want to cement ourselves first in the local market, and if that works, there will be nothing preventing us from going overseas.</p><h4>How has the ecosystem in aerospace changed in the last few years?</h4><p>The ecosystem in aerospace is evolving. We intend to make Malaysia the regional hub for aerospace and the industry has several targets to meet there. Having a complete ecosystem, an all-round service for MRO, for example, means you can build and expand the industry from there. Singapore is competitive in aerospace and most other services because it offers complete service packages, unlike other nations that only have parts of the supply chain. You need a developed and comprehensive supply chain to develop volumes.</p><h4>What are your key objectives for the year ahead?</h4><p>Overall, 2015 was not easy, and our key objectives are to balance our operations in the next year and be profitable. We are keen to reinvest our returns in R&amp;D to grow through innovation. In order to reinvest, we need to be profitable, which is why we pursue our transformation agenda, re-energizing our workforce. By the end of 2017, we will be where we want to be in terms of staff and have lean operations. In the meantime, our perspective will be focused more outwardly, and we will invest in our manpower to increase our global footprint. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-hands-on-approach]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2016, Top Glove announced its second listing, this time in Singapore, after already being listed in Malaysia. What were its objectives in doing so?</h4><p>The main objective of the secondary listing in Singapore was to create and add value for our shareholders and stakeholders. Singapore is a good country for us to associate with, develop our business, and learn from. The financial market in Singapore is also larger than in Malaysia. As a business we want to ensure that we invest where we can get a good yield or return. The time and cost involved in this investment will pay off without many extra costs. We want our customers to see us as an international company. The image created is stronger as the regulatory standards are higher in Singapore than in Malaysia. Listing in Singapore is also a sensible long-term strategy for us, should we decide to acquire other companies or enter into any M&amp;As as the new listing opens up the market for us.</p><h4>Top Glove currently has 25% of the world market and you have targeted capturing 30% by 2020. What growth strategies do you have in place?</h4><p>We are the world's largest rubber glove manufacturer and currently export to 200 countries. It is not easy to be the world's largest producer of any product and maintaining that position is even more challenging. In business, you have to set a direction and target. Our target is to expand our market share to 30% by 2020. To achieve this target, we have to continue to expand. To this end, we have been building two or three new factories a year, but that has not been enough. Therefore, we also look to acquire new companies in order to grow faster. The cost of doing business is increasing every year and we need to grow as a company to keep up.</p><h4>Are there any particular geographical areas that you want to expand to next?</h4><p>We look to expand all over the world into numerous countries. The US is the country that contributes the highest percentage of our sales revenue at 28%. We are present in every country in Europe, which represents 34% of our sales revenue. We have customers in Latin America, including Brazil, which is a major market for us. After the US, Europe, and Japan, Brazil is our fourth-largest market. We are able to expand to almost every region around the globe because standards of living and life expectancy are going up.</p><h4>How is the ecosystem in Malaysia for glove manufacturers, given the country's numerous rubber plantations and the government's drive to develop the medical equipment industry?</h4><p>Malaysia is ideal for rubber glove manufacturing because we have the raw materials, good technology, and machinery for production. We also have high quality control in our manufacturing. Malaysia has sound infrastructure in terms of transportation, including seaports and airports, and in communications. The country has a relatively stable government, and is a safe country to operate in. This stability is important for business. The level of entrepreneurship in Malaysia is high and the country has a good banking system. Hence, Malaysia has many advantages that help make us competitive.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your recent product innovations?</h4><p>We have recently come up with some new products, for example, a new type of synthetic glove for people who are allergic to natural rubber (latex). Also, we have introduced a polymer coating that enables you to don a glove even with wet hands. Every year we introduce about five new or improved glove products and have expanded our glove range to serve the food industry. We manufacture color-coded gloves for use in different types of food preparation and have also expanded into gloves for hairdressing salons and households. We are always looking to innovate and expand into whatever consumers want. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the decision to open up the automotive industry?</h4><p>We had a clear vision to become the hub for energy efficient vehicles (EEV), a concept that covers the entirety of green technologies. EEV has two main preconditions: its fuel-efficiency and its carbon emissions should be up to standards. It is up to the manufacturers to decide on the type of technology so long as the end result meets these requirements. To reach our ambition to become an EEV hub, we need to develop the supply chain, human capital, and technology and innovation infrastructure. We encourage our manufacturers to produce at the set standards of fuel efficiency and carbon emission. When we outlined our EEV policy, we developed six roadmaps to guide this into practice, three of which are for the supply chain, technology development, and re-manufacturing. The latter is a global trend: to work with components that can be remanufactured. Other developed nations have a “road worthiness test," which is pivotal. If a car is deemed non-roadworthy, it can become raw material for re-manufacturing, which is another important objective of the EVV policy. The concept is no longer cradle to grave; it is cradle to cradle. Components can be recycled, reconditioned, or re-manufactured.</p><h4>What initiatives do you have for helping to develop human capital? </h4><p>We work with universities and training institutions to implement our human capital development roadmap, especially in terms of skill development for engineers. The objective is to bridge academia and the requirements of the industry, for example by introducing apprenticeships and implementing elements of EEV in new training modules. MAI plays a coordinating role to develop these modules with universities and centers of excellence while the OEMs trademark them. Demand for training is much higher than we can currently cater to, and we seek to expand on our partnerships. In Bukit Beruntung, we have turned an old factory into a job-training classroom, where we can provide a unique hands-on learning experience. In the last three years, we have trained close to 27,000 new engineers for the automotive industry and have committed ourselves to producing 25,000 every year until 2020.</p><h4>What are your expectations from the AEC, and how do you cooperate with similar institutes in other states?</h4><p>The auto industry can be a polluting industry, both the production and process and the vehicle itself. Malaysia understands that while investment is important, sustainable development is what we need. For the sake of employment, we cannot just sacrifice the conservation and preservation aspect of the environment. With the achievements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we can utilize big data management and the Internet of Things (IoT) for these environmental purposes. Our Malaysian-Australian FTA has good conditions, we can leverage its expertise there, and it can use Malaysia as its gateway into ASEAN. Australia is facing challenges in its competiveness, and we have the market but need a quantum leap in technology. Partnering with Australian firms helps us with this on the human capital, supply chain, and technology side. We focus on sustainable automotive design by means of big data analyses and implementation into practical solutions.</p><h4>What is the future of the automotive industry?</h4><p>The latest roadmap takes us to 2050 and includes autonomous cars. Evolution like this is the work of suppliers, rather than manufacturers, and we should keep an eye on what electronic companies such as Bosch, Delphi, and Denso are doing, especially in the field of autonomous driving. Current technology is sensitive and mature enough to function independently and recognize roads and road signs. However, before these vehicles take to the roads, other aspects of infrastructure should be taken care of. Regulations for road design should become global, for example, and these are nonexistent at the moment. Mobility will change and the notion of getting around by car will change. Perhaps we will no longer call it the automotive industry but the mobility industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>MIGHT is the coordinating government agency for high technology, which is a relatively broad term. What are your focus areas?</h4><p>In general, we have been involved in developing strategies for the high technology industries since 1993. Currently, we are looking at strengthening existing manufacturing and service industries through the development and implementation of strategies and actions that are aligned to the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPPA) and the ASEAN economic community (AEC). The strategies focused on the four elements of mobility, modularity, security, and sustainability, based on our National Foresight Study in 2010. We have a strong agricultural sector, with rubber and palm oil plantations, but these sectors could be more innovative. We are interested in developing the idea of the plantation of the future that utilizes the Industry 4.0 elements in sciences such as genomics and technology such as autonomous mobility systems and others to replace or improve the productivity of human workers. </p><h4>Malaysia is a strong regional hub for maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO). What efforts is MIGHT making to attract more investment to this sphere?</h4><p>There will be about 800 to 900 new aircraft on the market, the majority of which are for Air Asia and Malindo. This means there will be growth in terms of MRO work. New aircrafts are using composite materials, other than the metal aircraft bodies that previously dominated the market. Our MRO companies are excellent at metal works and have to change their activities into maintaining composites. We recently established the Malaysian Center for Composites to support the transition of these companies. We also want to bring that competency and transition into other sectors such as shipbuilding and ship repair, rail transport, and others. We need good industry partners for this that do a lot of R&amp;D. Malaysia is a good strategic location for MRO, since it has a central location in Southeast Asia and a developed workforce of skilled engineers.</p><h4>How is MIGHT taking the lead in developing innovation in the Malaysian aerospace industry?</h4><p>The aim of setting up the Aerospace Manufacturing Innovation Center (AMIC) was to bring innovation into the aerospace industry, because like any other industry it can be hard to rely on local companies to create their own innovation ecosystem, as it can be beyond their financial and human resources. Furthermore, when manufacturing from other people's blueprints, there is no room to be innovative, which is why we established AMIC with the help of Rolls Royce and Airbus. One project it is working on is bio-fuel, which may start to be used in the next five years. CTRM is a founding member of AMIC, and AMIC is providing great support to its R&amp;D activities. Furthermore, we support SMEs, planning partnerships, and sharing facilities.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are expecting the urbanized population to reach 80% by 2030. That means 80% of the population will be living in Malaysia's four largest cities. These cities need to be properly managed in terms of water, energy, and transportation, for which we are planning a Smart Cities Development for Malaysia. We are looking at how to enhance the standard of living, comfort, and wellbeing of our people in these cities. We believe these smart cities will be crucial for Malaysia in the coming decades. Technology and industry parks will be incorporated into the cities, not the outskirts. Skilled people don't want to live and work in rural areas; they want to have a good quality of life. Technologies like 3D printing will revolutionize and green-up the way manufacturing is done. Smart cities also require excellent infrastructure planning for utilities, water, and electricity, and an intelligent transportation system. This is what we are working on now, and more. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bilateral relations between China and Malaysia are deepening, with an active presence of Chinese companies in the construction and infrastructure industry. What is your assessment of this development?</h4><p>China joined the WTO in 2001. Before that, people in China were basically cycling, but today it is the biggest automotive manufacturers in the world, producing 24.3 million cars in 2015 compared to 12 million in the US or 9 million in Japan. China is our biggest trade partner, with an annual volume of USD100 billion. We signed an MoU with China called the Malaysia-China Five Year Program for Economic and Trade, one of whose goals is to achieve USD160 billion in total bilateral trade by 2017. To achieve this, we cannot rely on conventional sectors such as commodity exports. We must look into industrial cooperation and car manufacturing. For example, Malaysia's Proton manufactures about 100,000 cars a year, while China produces over 24 million. The automotive industry also needs a big market like China to gain sophisticated R&amp;D. FTAs not only facilitate trade and services, but also bring the integration of technology. For example, the Chinese company Geely acquired Volvo from Sweden. Sweden is innovative, but does not have the sheer market size of China. Before this transaction, Volvo had total sales of about 250,000; however, after Geely came into the picture, sales have already surpassed 500,000. As I said, Malaysia is a small country and we have no choice but to integrate into the world economy: we want market access and we want technology. Trade agreements provide us market access and help us move up the value chain by gaining knowledge and technological sophistication.</p><h4>What are your focus areas for technological advancement in Malaysia?</h4><p>In 2015, 80% of our total exports, or MYR625.46 billion, were manufactured goods. In the old days, Malaysia was a commodity-based country, responsible for 80% of our income. Today, this accounts for only 15%, including palm oil, crude petroleum, natural rubber, and LNG. We are transforming ourselves into a manufacturing-based country. Selling raw rubber will not make as much revenue as surgical gloves, for example. Palm oil can be processed into chemicals, bio fuels, and diesel to get better prices. Malaysia used to be a low-income nation as we depended on these commodities. By transforming into a manufacturing-based economy, we will be able to improve the living standards for our people. We are working hard on this, but still we export more individual components, for example to the US, where the final product is manufactured. We are lucky to be strategically located, with consistent climate conditions. Because of these conditions, we attract very interesting investments, such as in the aerospace industry. Malaysia is ideally located for aircraft maintenance; therefore, we have Boeing and Airbus here. Rather than selling our commodities, we must look into developing these sectors. To get there, we have to educate our people, bringing up the level of our universities. We must pursue high technology. This is the direction we are going and we will sign a many FTAs to facilitate this goal.</p><h4>In 2015, your administration launched the Eleventh Malaysia Plan. How does this plan influence the policy of MITI?</h4><p>The center of attention is still the urban areas, such as Kuala Lumpur, the Southern Corridor of Johor, and Penang in the north. This is where our graduates go, i.e. places with about 11,000 people per square kilometer, where in other areas there are just 100. One strategy for us to improve this disparity imbalance is to deurbanize. We promote SMEs to base them in smaller areas, rather than the major urban centers. This should create a great deal of economic activities in these areas rather than congesting the urban areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Following The Rules]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[following-the-rules]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do the current oil prices impact the advancement of nuclear energy?</h4><p>When we reported to the Economic Council chaired by the prime minister in June 2015, we mentioned that nuclear is marginally competitive against unsubsidized gas; however, we also see that nuclear has a high upfront investment cost. However, if the nuclear owner-operator can secure a low-interest, inexpensive loan, then nuclear is still an attractive option. As per an IEA-OECD-NEA report, nuclear is still competitive at interest rates of 3-7%. For example, Bangladesh will go ahead with its nuclear project with a loan from Russia for 90% of the project cost with an interest rate ceiling of 4%. Vietnam has also signed an agreement with Russia; however, in Bangladesh the political will and need for electricity is more compelling. The project site was already earmarked in 1965, and Russia will provide its safest plant to date, with EU-compliant design and double-walled containment buildings.</p><h4>How have you moved forward with ratifying the necessary international and national instruments?</h4><p>The Convention for Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials, for example, is already in force at the international level, including Malaysia. However, at this stage we cannot take further steps, as parliament needs to first pass the necessary bill. We held a meeting about this with all the stakeholders from various ministries and have committed ourselves to getting the bill approved in 2017. This law is not a green card for nuclear energy, which is a common misunderstanding, but replaces Act 304 of 1984 that already had a provision to develop nuclear energy. With new international standards and best practices, we need a new act. We maintain a close dialogue with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and have recently hosted an IAEA Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) mission to Malaysia. The INIR mission looked at the state of preparedness of our nuclear program and assessed the 19 issues that IAEA recommended in its guidebook. It evaluated our work over the last five years, the direction we are heading in, what is still lacking, the gaps we have to fill, and how to fill them, and hopefully the government can decide accordingly.</p><h4>How advanced is Malaysia in nuclear energy compared to other ASEAN countries?</h4><p>Vietnam is ahead because it has parliamentary approval to proceed with two projects, one with Russia and one with Japan. Fukushima impacted nuclear plans in many countries and delayed the projects, but they are not off the rails. Thailand was also looking at nuclear but because of the political uncertainty it has pushed nuclear energy to after 2035. We will not have a nuclear power plant in operation in Malaysia before 2030 as we had to make some adjustments to our original 2021 plan. Beside the nuclear legal and regulatory framework and government commitment, there is also a need to study funding and financing options.</p><h4>What is your roadmap toward 2030 to move toward nuclear in Malaysia?</h4><p>We first have to make the necessary preparations to get the bill passed by parliament. Malaysia has already used nuclear technology for non-power applications such as in medicine, agriculture, and industrial inspections, so the technology is not completely new. If we do not sign some of these nuclear conventions that are already in force, in particular the physical protection on nuclear materials, then we may not be able to access some of the nuclear and radioisotope materials for our medical applications. The second issue is to continue to engage the public and educate them on the workings of nuclear technology. The third one is selecting and acquiring a suitable site. We will also need a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to become the owner-operator; this cannot be MNPC because that would be a conflict of interests. We should remain a non-profit company playing the role of the designated Nuclear Energy Programme Implementing Organisation (NEPIO), as recommended by the IAEA. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Wide Base]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-wide-base]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the key achievements of PCG in recent years?</h4><p>In 3Q2016, we recorded a higher EBITDA margin of 41% compared to 39.5% in the same quarter in 2015 and 37.6% in the previous quarter. Operationally, PCG managed to deliver YtD a 96% plant utilization rate, up from the 85.1% achieved in the same period of 2015, as a result of improved plant reliability and higher feedstock supply. In addition, PCG recorded its highest overall sales performance, which has helped us to cushion the impact of low petrochemical product spreads. PCG has set clear goals for the years to come. While the journey ahead will remain challenging, we have successfully proven our resilience over the past year. In order to successfully navigate the challenges in the industry, we continue to pursue our two-pronged strategy of strengthening our basic petrochemicals portfolio while selectively diversifying into derivatives, specialty chemicals, and solutions. </p><h4>Around 37% of your revenue is sourced in Malaysia, with other markets—especially Southeast Asia—representing the other part. How do you envision further international expansion?</h4><p>We optimize our portfolio mix with a focus on domestic and key markets in Asia Pacific, where we have a geographical advantage. We have incorporated and operationalized two overseas marketing subsidiaries in Thailand and China, which are our key export markets, accounting for 16% and 9% of our revenue, respectively. The establishment of these overseas subsidiaries will enhance PCG's presence in these key markets while also developing customer intimacy through close customer relationship management and direct customer interaction. In addition, we have incorporated a new marketing subsidiary in Jakarta, which should be fully operational by early 2017. Indonesia is another key export market to PCG and we intend to further expand our market reach in the country. We also have representative offices in Vietnam and the Philippines and are keen to develop strategic collaborations with customers in other markets in Southeast Asia and Asia Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand. </p><h4>As a company predominantly active downstream, how has the current low price environment for commodities affected your plans?</h4><p>PCG is selective with our projects, ensuring they are executed in a cost-efficient manner. The current low oil price environment serves as a sharp reminder and an excellent opportunity for us to be much more prudent in looking at ways and means to reduce our cost of operations. Hence, PCG's challenge and our greatest priority is cost optimization and doing more with less. At the same time, it is also about planning and prioritizing projects. Sanctioned projects will be carried on as planned and funds will be allocated accordingly. We believe it is not about having “nice to have“ projects in hand but rather looking at growth projects that are instrumental in making PCG a leading petrochemical player in Asia Pacific. </p><h4>What are your ambitions and key objectives for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our strategy is to strengthen our basic petrochemicals slate while selectively diversifying into derivatives, specialty chemicals, and solutions. To strengthen our basic petrochemicals slate, we need to be cost effective, while maintaining our reliability and world-class standards. Currently, our nameplate capacity is 10.8 million tons per annum (mtpa) of basic petrochemicals products, and by 2017, we will increase our production capacity by another 2 million to 12.8mtpa. With this, we will further strengthen our basic petrochemicals, mainly in ammonia and urea, and add some specialty chemicals to our portfolios. Despite the current low market environment for ammonia and urea, we anticipate that urea consumption in the long run will continue to grow in relation to the increasing population, especially in Southeast Asia as well as Asia Pacific. By 2020, our petrochemicals projects, under the PIC project, will further add about 3.5 million to reach 16mtpa, providing a solid foundation to move toward derivatives and specialty chemicals. Beyond 2020, we will exert greater effort to assess our opportunities in downstream derivatives and specialty chemicals at PIC, Kertih, Kuantan, and East Malaysia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are financial services horizontally integrated within the Kenanga Group? </h4><p>Kenanga Investors Group is the asset management arm of Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad which consists of both conventional and Islamic entities. Kenanga is proud to be an award winning asset Management Company recognized for its investment performance and strong growth in recent years. We are one of only eight private retirement scheme licensed providers in Malaysia. We serve multi-segment investors from retail, corporate, institutional, and high-net worth individuals via a multi-distribution network. Our commitment to our clients drives us to achieve consistent top performance in our business. Previously, we were predominantly known as an institutional player. We managed pension funds, Malaysian GLCs, and large corporate clients. We have now diversified our strategies to include mass retail markets through multi-distribution channels. Over the past few years, our company has recorded consistent track records, solid investment strategies, and good risk governance for a more balanced value proposition for our clients. Moving ahead, we plan to further grow our clientele in the mass affluent to high-net worth segment market. In international standards, this includes individuals with assets ranging between USD100,000 and USD1 million. With the growing economy of Malaysia, there is also an increase in the segment of working and educated professionals with disposable income. We have initiated our private wealth arm to focus specifically on this segment market to provide financial advisory to meet their investment needs and accelerate their wealth accumulation.</p><h4>How do you position Malaysia within the larger ASEAN region?</h4><p>Our current strategy and strength is primarily for the Malaysian centric market. We do have a growing clientele across ASEAN; however, our investment focus has been Malaysia; therefore, we do build strategic alliances with our counterparts in other investment destinations. In today's volatile and highly specialized markets, it is much more efficient to work in this manner than to set up offices abroad; and this strategy has led to much better results for us. For example, Kazakhstan, a country that would normally look to London or Dubai as their financial hub, could now consider Malaysia as we are geographically and culturally closer. In practical terms, companies in the same time zone as their investors would have additional benefits; from Malaysia, we will be able work with Singapore, Japan, China, and Hong Kong with ease. The global investment world is not yet entirely borderless; working with specialized boutique investment mangers with on-the-ground knowledge reaps more benefits. We are a homegrown Malaysian investment firm with more than 40 years of experience, serving many international investors looking for a Malaysian strategy.</p><h4>How did Kenanga become the investor of choice for Malaysian GLCs and institutional investors?</h4><p>This is mainly due to concerted efforts across the group and to being focused with our strategy in delivering consistent top-performance, remaining true to our investment objectives and having a vibrant investment team. Also on the governance side, our investment risk management consists of a highly skilled team that monitors all the parameters in the Malaysian standards whilst adopting international standards and best practices into our system. Investors prefer this long-term vision and sustainable performance as it fits their investment appetite. For three-, five-, and 10-year mutual funds, we have consistently been recognized as the top equity manager in Malaysia. For the past two years, we have been building our expertise and track record for regional equities in Asia Pacific, ASEAN, and our fixed income (sukuk and conventional), which will continue to open new avenues and unlock funds among institutional and private investors in both the conventional and Muslim world. Our Islamic products are now focused on equities and fixed income funds whilst we believe there will be further growth in this area. There is a global Islamic wealth pool of around USD11-12 trillion that could be unlocked in the years ahead. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[With a Firm Hand]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[with-a-firm-hand]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the growth of the secondary mortgage market?</h4><p>We issued sukuk and bonds to the market to support our asset purchases in the secondary mortgage market. To date, we have issued approximately MYR290 billion worth of bonds and sukuk. Even during periods of economic crisis, investors were buying Cagamas papers; in fact, there were more buyers of Cagamas papers than usual, demonstrating the strength of Cagamas. We have never had a single technical default in our history, which is one of the reasons why we received a Moody's rating of A3 in 2013. We have entered the international capital market as we are seen as a market leader in the domestic capital markets. In terms of pricing, other corporate issuers use Cagamas as a benchmark. </p><h4>Malaysia is the global leading sukuk issuing country. How significant is this for Cagamas' portfolio? </h4><p>Some MYR43 billion of our total bonds were sukuks. Sukuks are popular because the Malaysian government, the Central Bank, and the Securities Commission have put together a complete financial ecosystem, including Islamic banks, Islamic securities companies, takaful operators, Islamic asset management companies, and Islamic pension funds, which provide ready demand for sukuk issuance. The demand for sukuk is greater than conventional bonds. Sukuk yields are often lower or the same as corporate bonds, whereas the reverse holds internationally. The Islamic finance ecosystem, the infrastructure, and the tax incentives all contributed to the success of sukuk. In 2015 and 2016, we issued sukuk in Singapore dollars— the first sukuk issuances in that currencies for both years. We can issue in any currency, depending on pricing and demand. We always issue in the currency that provides the most competitive pricing at that time.</p><h4>How do you anticipate and strategize on currency volatilities?</h4><p>When we issue in foreign currency to fund a purchase in ringgit, we make sure they are fully hedged through a cross currency swap; we would not take on any foreign exchange risks. In terms of foreign currency issuances, there are three variables; the first being the benchmark—for example, for dollars it would be the US Treasury. The second is the spread over the benchmark, which depends on our credit rating and investors' perception of the company and country. There is also the cross-currency swap. When the currency is volatile, the cross-currency swap rates are not favorable because the bank would take a bigger margin to hedge its own volatility as well. If a currency is more stable, it is probably easier to get a cross-currency swap at a more reasonable and competitive price. When the currency is weak, there are a number of foreign investors who come to Malaysia to buy Cagamas ringgit papers. Previously, foreign investors were only buying up Malaysian government securities, and not corporate papers. As a matter of fact, after Cagamas embarked on the Multi-currency Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Program, the investor base diversified significantly with its foreign investors growing to approximately 70% from the total of investors, with the remaining 30% comprising of Malaysian investors. As a consequence, foreign investors are now more familiar with Cagamas' name and are interested to invest in Cagamas ringgit papers. The weaker exchange rate attracts them, but when the ringgit is stronger, things may change again. </p><h4>What are your goals for the year ahead?</h4><p>We do expect to do a bit more than 2015 but that depends on the market. We can raise up to MYR20-30 billion in sukuks and bonds but we need to allocate these funds for purchases of loans. When banks sell us loans, we would tap the market and issue bonds or sukuk. To date, we have issued MYR3.4 billion worth of bonds and sukuk. Loan growth among banks is a little sluggish right now, and the banks' needs for liquidity have slowed down. We will still be able to do a bit more than we did last year. We issued around MYR6 billion in 2015, while in 2016 we envision about MYR8 billion. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Malaysia to your bank?</h4><p><span></span>Chartsiri Sophonpanich Our operation in Malaysia started as a branch in Kuala Lumpur with the aim of serving local clients and helping promote business flows between Malaysia and Thailand. Later, we incorporated the branch into a Malaysian entity as per Malaysia's regulatory requirements. Malaysia is an important trading partner of key economies in the world and also the AEC region. Thailand was the fifth top export destination of Malaysia in 2015, which presents ample opportunities for our Bangkok Bank Group to tap as intra-AEC region trade activities continue to grow. Through our AEC network, we support our Thai customers by encouraging them to participate in sectors promoted by the Malaysian government.</p><h4>Which are your primary areas of focus in Malaysia?</h4><p><span></span>Piti Sithi-Amnuai In Thailand, we are primarily a financial services provider for SMEs, and we also intend to grow in this area in Malaysia, concentrating on SMEs with capital structures of around MYR50 million. In Malaysia, we do not operate on the same scale as we do in Thailand; we have five branches here, including the head office. Consequently, we have to make smart choices. Going digital and creating solid mobile banking platforms is our strategic direction for future growth. We need to invest, learn, and build up partnerships with our customers. Our Malaysian clients include the Robert Kwok Group and the Genting Highland Group. Recently, we started to cater more to international clients in Malaysia whom we also serve in Thailand.</p><h4>What are the key differences between corporate banking in Thailand and Malaysia? </h4><p><span></span>CS Corporate banking in Thailand and Malaysia is similar in terms of a variety of products and services, advancement of technological platforms, challenges, and regulatory regime and requirements. Indeed, there is no apparent difference. Our overall strategy is to be a long-term and trusted partner of our target customers and seek to support them through thick and thin. Our Malaysian subsidiary bank, Bangkok Bank Berhad, strives to support our corporate customers' ventures outside of Malaysia and we are determined to attract new business. But above all else, our Malaysian entity exists to serve the banking needs of Malaysian business communities as the AEC develops further, recognizing that there will be greater investment into Malaysia, including from Thailand.</p><h4>What are your ambitions and objectives for Bangkok Bank Berhad in the coming years?</h4><p><span></span>PS-A It is my personal objective to enhance bilateral trade between Malaysia and Thailand in terms of agriculture and food, as I see enormous potential there. Malaysia has thousands of acres of palm oil plantations whilst Thailand is one of the world's largest rice producers. Together, both nations should be able to feed a quarter of the world's population. One of our clients in Bangkok has a fruit and vegetable market of around 10 acres, with a daily cash circulation of THB400-500 million. There is enormous potential in the food industry in both Malaysia and Thailand.</p><h4>You have opened a new office in the center of the financial district of Kuala Lumpur. What are your ambitions for Bangkok Bank Berhad?</h4><p><span></span>CS The new location will provide us with excellent opportunities to improve our visibility and enhance our presence, and at the same time broaden our customer base by connecting with the corporates located in the vicinity. This is an important move that will generate new corporate business for us, not just in the vicinity of the new office, but throughout Kuala Lumpur. The centralized location will also attract depositors from both the retail and corporate sectors, with spin-off benefits in credit business. The large size of the new office areas gives us potential for future expansion. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Our banking industry is facing the current rapidly changing and challenging economic environment from a position of strength, following the successful reform measures that were implemented. Given the high degree of openness of the Malaysian economy and the increased integration with the international financial system, external developments have continuously affected our domestic economy. But the economy has been able to weather these challenges and have remained on a steady growth path of 4-6% over the past five years.</p><p>In recent quarters, economic growth, however, has moderated. This was attributable to a number of external and domestic shocks affecting the economy since late 2014. As we move forward, these shocks will gradually dissipate and growth of the Malaysian economy will improve. Further support is also forthcoming in the form of government measures to increase disposable income, thus, facilitating households and firms' ongoing adjustments. The assessment is therefore for the economy to grow by 4-4.5% for 2016. Importantly, our financial system remains resilient and supportive of the economy. It is important to recognize the underlying reasons for the resilience of the Malaysia economy. This resiliency has been as a result of the continued strength of our fundamentals and the successful reforms and structural adjustments we have undertaken over the last decade.</p><p>Going forward, continuity in Bank Negara Malaysia's financial sector policies will be preserved. We will continue to strengthen our prudential regulatory framework in line with global standards, while introducing new developmental initiatives and maintaining a strong focus on the fair treatment of financial consumers. Following transformational measures taken in the past few decades to significantly strengthen the financial system, the banking industry in Malaysia is managing this transition from a position of strength. This strong position has been an important element to facilitate orderly adjustments in transitioning towards global standards without disruptions to financial intermediation, thus ensuring the smooth flow of financing to the economy.</p><p>To enhance Malaysia's growth potential, several initiatives had been identified that will help boost productivity, improve the income-earning potential of Malaysians, and expand opportunities in new markets. Building from Malaysia's leading position as an international Islamic finance center, efforts to promote the sustainable growth of Islamic finance supported by a dynamic ecosystem will create opportunities for high-income employment. Meeting the e-payment targets that Bank Negara has set is also vital to enhance our economic efficiency, competitiveness, and productivity. Bank Negara Malaysia is also taking some measures to support growth in the financial services sector, encourage innovation and strengthen resilience, especially in the field of regional financial integration, fintech development, systemic focus on regulation, governance, and the role of banks in ensuring an inclusive financial system.</p><p>Bank Negara will introduce a framework for fintech firms to test innovations in the financial services operational environment. Bank Negara has long recognized the power of technology in driving the financial sector forward. Over the years, banks have harnessed the power of technology to reap significant benefits. Bank Negara has supported this development on many fronts, including in the areas of payments, internet banking, agent banking, Islamic finance and money exchange, and remittances. Fintech will be a new addition to the list.<br>Because of the profound implication of new technology, we require a re-think of the regulatory framework in addressing consumer protection and market conduct issues as well as the technological impact on the orderly functioning of financial markets. We expect that the framework would enable fintech firms to provide regulated financial services directly to the public, or in partnership with financial institutions, and to operate under more flexible regulatory arrangements.</p><p>The bank also expects the framework to deliver a number of key benefits. It will provide regulatory clarity for fintech start-ups and for banks and consumers that use their services. It will also lower barriers to entry and accelerate the time-to-market for productive innovations. Our aim is therefore to support fintech firms that go on to upscale their activities, and aid fintech firms to better anticipate and adjust to appropriate regulatory expectations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaysia holds more than a quarter of the world's Islamic assets. What is your vision for moving the industry forward and making Malaysia the global driving force?</h4><p>Malaysia's decades of work in Islamic finance has created a leadership position and led to the mainstreaming of the industry globally. In the Malaysian context, Islamic finance has become a key segment in the domestic financial system. Islamic banking assets now stand at about 27% of total banking system assets, surpassing the 20% target as originally intended in Bank Negara's Financial Sector Masterplan. There is also greater acceptance of takaful, with its increased penetration rate to 14.8% of the population. Backed by a robust sharia screening methodology, more than 70% of total listed securities in the country are sharia compliant, thus providing a wide array of selection for investors. Globally, Malaysia, with a consistent global sukuk market share of more than 50%, over the last 10 years, has sustained its position as the market leader. Progress is also evident in our agenda toward becoming the center for Islamic fund and wealth management. We emerged as the largest hub, with 35% market share and the highest number of Islamic funds. While achievements in various market segments have placed us at the forefront, more ground-breaking initiatives are needed to seize the opportunities in new growth areas and to re-energize the industry. An honest assessment of the existing business models and product offerings must be undertaken to recognize gaps and issues, which is a crucial step toward realizing the true value propositions of Islamic finance. The Malaysian brand of Islamic finance must also transcend beyond borders and beliefs as the industry has become part of growth strategies of global financial players, indicating greater appreciation of its value proposition. This is evident by the increasing presence of global banking players from diversified regions, including Japan, Europe, and the Middle East, in Malaysia.</p><h4>Recently, Bursa Malaysia launched the Bursa-I platform, creating a sharia-compliant marketplace. What are your thoughts here?</h4><p>It is worth noting that sharia-based equity investing has become a significant contributor to the growth of the domestic equity market in the past decade. Sharia-compliant securities in Bursa Malaysia now amounted to MYR1.1 trillion and account for about 64% of total market capitalization. Continued efforts and initiatives of the Securities Commission Malaysia as well as its Sharia Advisory Council not only have played an invaluable role in enhancing the depth and breadth of the Islamic capital markets but also facilitating the development of innovative products that we have today, such as Islamic REITs, Islamic ETFs, and retail sukuk. As such, it is encouraging to see Bursa Malaysia taking this leading role in strengthening the ecosystem by championing exchange-based, sharia-compliant investing and providing new options for those who wish to invest based on the principles of Islamic finance. Indeed, principled investing practices based on sharia are one part of the equation to living life responsibly, through investing responsibly. It is envisaged that this new platform will position Bursa Malaysia as the leading exchange in the Islamic capital market for sharia investments, and to be globally recognized as “The Marketplace" for sharia-compliant trading activities among domestic, regional, and global issuers and investors.</p><h4>What role do you envision for Malaysia in driving Islamic finance across ASEAN?</h4><p>Further intensification of financial linkages within the ASEAN region will indeed position Malaysia in good place to reap the benefits from the recently envisioned ASEAN Economic Community. ASEAN is home to a rapidly growing capital market, in which total market capitalization amounted to about USD2.3 trillion or 90% of GDP in 2015. With ASEAN households having one of the highest savings rates at about 30%, there is tremendous opportunity to bring sharia-based financial services to the 600 million people in ASEAN. Malaysia is now positioned at the forefront of international developments with increasing connectivity between financial centers, and more cross-border Islamic financial transactions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the opportunities for Malaysia with the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative, especially with regards to the recreation of the Maritime Silk Road?</h4><p>The OBOR initiative will open up many opportunities for Malaysia and its ASEAN neighbors. In particular, we see opportunities in the infrastructure area, as the main objective of OBOR is to improve the connection between China, the rest of Asia, and strategic regions in the world like Europe. We would be able to benefit from a great deal of interest from China in the development of ports, railways, and power plants here. There is significant participation by China in two large-scale infrastructural projects, the East Coast Expressway and the high-speed rail connecting Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. As the interest is mostly on the maritime road, most of the investments are diverted to our ports, which will benefit our economy and position it as the Southeast Asian hub for maritime transport.</p><h4>How active should the government in Malaysia be in business given the view that a high-income economy should have a dominant private sector?</h4><p>The government should take a leadership role to promote investments. In particular during low periods of the economic cycle and when private investments slow down, the government has a role to take over certain investments in the public domain that can help restart economic activities. We are currently in this phase, requiring more involvement from GLCs before the private sector can take on more responsibilities there. In the construction of the LRT extension packages, we already see the involvement of many private companies, which are all good signs.</p><h4>How should Malaysia position itself within ASEAN, especially in light of attracting foreign investment? </h4><p>Malaysia is an attractive investment hub not only for ASEAN, but also for the Asia Pacific region at large. We share more borders with ASEAN than any other nation in the bloc: Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Brunei. Having half of the community as a direct neighbor already makes us a good regional hub for multinationals seeking to establish themselves in the region. In addition, Malaysia has an active and dynamic private sector that invests abroad. Particularly, our financial sector has an established presence in ASEAN and Asia Pacific. AirAsia, a Malaysian enterprise, is the leading Asian low-cost carrier. Increasingly, we see international manufacturing companies setting up shop in Malaysia, as we have proven to have an efficient, productive ecosystem, combined with business-friendly policies. The government is willing to listen to the needs of investors and to draft policies to meet investors' needs. It is easy to use Malaysia as a springboard to export to other ASEAN countries, especially as we are moving towards the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC).</p><h4>What needs to be done to drive innovation forward and enable the digital economy to flourish?</h4><p>In terms of education strategies, we need to do some rethinking. First of all, there is a great need to improve English in Malaysian schools, and having our students become more proficient at an early stage would boost our competitive advantage over other developing economies in the region. Other than that, we should focus more on vocational training and prepare more people on the right and needed skills. Too often we have graduates in non-specialized fields. There needs to be a combined effort from the government and the private sector in order to achieve this.</p><h4>How do you envision smart cities to be a driver of economic growth and wellbeing?</h4><p>We organize annual smart city conferences because we see the potential and because it brings together many interesting and innovative voices. Malaysia is a rapidly urbanizing country and the base of urbanization is growing as more people move to cities. This means we need to transform our cities into smart cities. That would mean smart graphic systems, smart security, and a more integrated transportation system. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[silk-road-of-the-high-seas]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have relations between China and Malaysia advanced in recent years?</h4><p>The world is in an era of turbulent transition. Much of the conventional wisdom of the previous century is being challenged in the new world that is emerging in this 21st century. The Brexit vote in the UK and the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency are but two examples. Added to that are shifting geopolitical interests and alliances, plus the unsettling and unpredictable economic upheavals. It is therefore pleasing to note that amidst this rather troubled global context, ASEAN and China are demonstrating what can be achieved through a strengthening of mutually beneficial economic, trade, and diplomatic relations. Within ASEAN, China is Malaysia's largest trading partner and has been since 2009. Bilateral trade exceeds USD100 billion, with both governments committed to a target of USD160 billion in total trade by 2017. Ties are being established not just at the national level, but also at the state and provincial levels. One example is the signing of the MoU between the Malacca state government and the Guangdong provincial government in 2015.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the One Belt, One Road initiative?</h4><p>China is now ASEAN's largest trading partner and ASEAN is China's third-largest trading partner. But I believe the prospects are bright for the economic relationship to grow even bigger. One reason for my confidence is the One Belt, One Road initiative, mooted by President Xi Jinping. The economic potential of this initiative that connects Asia, Africa, and Europe is immense. It encompasses 65 countries with a combined population of 4.4 billion people, more than half the population of the planet. In 2014, China's annual trade with countries along the One Belt, One Road exceeded USD1.1 trillion. The One Belt, One Road initiative fits well with what is happening in our own region in Southeast Asia. In January, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) came into effect. The AEC seeks to create a single market and production base in the region. When fully implemented, the AEC will deepen the economic integration of ASEAN's 10 member states through a seamless, cross-border trading and investment regime. As a single entity, ASEAN is currently the seventh-largest economy in the world, home to a consumer market of more than 620 million people with a combined gross domestic product estimated at more than USD2.5 trillion.</p><h4>What are the major takeaways from the World Chinese Economic Summit (WCES) in this regard?</h4><p>The WCES has become a successful and institutionalized international platform to promote the One Belt, One Road initiative, as well as foster closer China-ASEAN relations and connectivity with the global Chinese diaspora. In fact, this year's summit in Malacca carries a special historic significance, as it was here where Admiral Zheng arrived more than 600 years ago when he first sailed from China, marking the beginning of the Maritime Silk Road. Now here we all are, working together to create a 21st century version of that original sea corridor. We believe WCES will provide a timely opportunity to assess the challenges and opportunities in the One Belt, One Road initiative. We seek to provide the platform for the best minds to share knowledge and experience, and I am confident that the WCES can play a major role in shaping the future of our region and ASEAN's relationship with China. A mutually beneficial China-ASEAN relationship is vital for regional peace, stability, and prosperity. As this year marks the 25th anniversary of China-ASEAN relations, let us strive to further enhance our bilateral relations to derive maximum benefits for all sides. It is my belief that we can deepen ASEAN-China relations by focusing on the 4Es: economic cooperation, education partnership, energy security, and environmental sustainability. The WCES is not about politics, but about business, friendship, culture, and education. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Economic Transformation Program (ETP) affected the investment potential for Greater KL, and what is your key strategy for the second leg of this plan?</h4><p>The transformation program listed Greater KL as a National Key Economic Area (NKEA), with nine Entry Point Projects (EPPs) under that. Greater KL is EPP 1, as it contributes 30% of the total revenue and this is expected to grow to 40% by 2020. It is our role to attract investment into KL, and more specifically companies that will use KL as a hub to expand in Malaysia and the region. We have recorded 52 multinational companies to date, which is on course for our target of 100 by 2020.</p><h4>How will the High-Speed Rail (HSR) between Singapore and KL affect further business?</h4><p>Connecting the two capitals over 330km from KL to Singapore is complementary to the infrastructure we develop in KL. There are the MRT lines 1, 2, and 3 and the LRT extensions 1, 2, and 3, comprising 200km in total. The federal government has spent over MYR50 billion just on that. This improved interconnectivity, together with the HSR, presents a game-changer as it further promotes KL as a hub. </p><h4>Singapore and Malaysia have traditionally complemented each other. Due to the higher cost of doing business, have you seen more companies moving from Singapore to KL?</h4><p>There is friendly competition between KL and Singapore as well as the will to cooperate. Recently, some companies in the oil and gas sector have moved to KL. The cost factor is an important element, but they also see the talent here, the interconnectivity of KL, and the high living standards.</p><h4>Do you cooperate with the Asia Aerospace City (AAC) and the sector as a whole?</h4><p>There is still growth in the commercial aviation sector. In the region we are one of the largest low-cost hubs, chiefly because of airlines like Air Asia. The falling oil prices have given the industry some space to breathe and airlines are making profits again. In the aerospace industry, we have to catch up in certain areas—playing the aerospace game by definition means moving up the value chain. MARA and its AAC are great proponents of this strategy, focusing on engineering design services and human capital development.</p><h4>Are you working to attract more business from China?</h4><p>The Chinese themselves have pushed this trend, and are eyeing a large number of infrastructure projects in the region and in Malaysia. They are actively lobbying for the HSR and a Chinese consortium for the tender is making its presence felt. In addition, the Chinese are pushing for a reserve currency, for which the Bank of China recently launched a clearing center in KL. Both as a financial standpoint and in terms of infrastructure, it is interested in using Malaysia as a hub—we have only seen the tip of the iceberg. Furthermore, Xiamen University will open its first campus outside of China in Malaysia with a capacity for 10,000 students.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your activities in the creative industry sector?</h4><p>Malaysia has consistently tried to push the creative industries, such as multimedia development. These industries have the potential to serve international markets. Japanese companies, for example, have been traditionally strong in automotive manufacturing and E&amp;E and in 2015 we managed to attract a large Japanese publishing company Kadokawa, which was looking for a strategic location for its multimedia development.</p><h4>What would you like to achieve with InvestKL in the next one or two years?</h4><p>We are on a mission to spread the story of KL and we work extensively with international chambers to engage with multinational companies and to tell them about our transformation agenda. Under the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, the federal government wants cities to compete against each another, and KL currently contributes 30% of Malaysia's total GDP. In cooperation with the federal government, we will further develop the infrastructure to build a globally competitive city. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[no-such-thing-as-a-free-lunch]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can MATRADE help Malaysia gain recognition for its quality and innovation?</h4><p>Malaysia is a strong exporting country; it has the raw materials, production, talent, and ingredients to develop. It is not an OPEC member; however, it produces and exports oil. Around 80% of its exports are manufactured goods. It has a strong foundation; however, it needs to develop the ability to turn its resources into products and services that are exportable. Secondly, we want more Malaysian SMEs to export. At the moment, their proportion of total exports accounts for 19% and we want to increase this to 33% by 2020.</p><h4>How do you help SMEs to flourish?</h4><p>We recently organized the ASEAN Youth Entrepreneurship Carnival, which was an inaugural event in ASEAN. This is a good platform for startups and young entrepreneurs to meet with investors and venture capitalists. They can also meet their counterparts from other ASEAN nations and exchange best practices. We want to expand entrepreneurship beyond borders. Countries have passports but ideas are borderless. People are increasingly working through online platforms, and payments are done electronically, while logistics companies can deliver anywhere, so there are no issues. Entrepreneurship is the driver of our economy.</p><h4>What are the advantages and disadvantages of FTAs for Malaysian manufacturing?</h4><p>The advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The most important benefit is that import and export tariffs will be waived, which is a big cost for SMEs at the moment. It will drive innovation and make our products more competitive and it also becomes easier to find partners both for trading and product development. We want to ignite the stamina in our entrepreneurs and encourage the exploration of opportunities abroad. We can help them manage the risks. Currently, there is only one Malaysian company on the Fortune 500 list: Petronas. We have the potential to have more giants and we should invest more in branding ourselves and our quality.</p><h4>Aerospace is often mentioned as a key industry for Malaysia to move up the value chain. Is MATRADE actively promoting the nation's strength abroad?</h4><p>The aerospace industry is growing globally. Mexico has transformed its automotive industry into aerospace. We are looking to do the same in Malaysia, as having an aerospace manufacturing industry will bring the highest standards to our country. We have the ecosystem in place and we already have some industry giants who have chosen Malaysia to be part of their global supply chain. We can transform our manufacturing industry into a higher value industry and grow our human resources along the way. We need to transform our mindset to go for the niche market. This is one way of making Malaysia more competitive. In aerospace, we are number two in ASEAN after Singapore and because of our size we can aspire to become number one.</p><h4>How do you envision moving the services industry forward?</h4><p>We have a deficit in the services sector at the moment and have to study more closely how we can push the sector forward. We have many talented people, often with study and work experience abroad, and we should encourage them to take their experience to develop our services sector. There is a private initiative called Malaysian Incorporated, a consortium that jointly bids for projects abroad, at the moment mostly in the construction and oil and gas industries. This practice can be expanded and emulated into other sectors. Secondly, we believe franchising is another good way to introduce more momentum into our services. A third component is tourism, including medical and preventive care tourism.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on your activities in promoting medical tourism?</h4><p>We can learn from Japan; its people have a healthy lifestyle and, therefore, a higher life expectancy. After their retirement, Japanese people still have 20-30 years that they spend without creating value in the economy, but are often still affluent. There are opportunities for us there; we can support healthy ageing and provide healthcare to the elderly.</p><h4>What do you envision for the new convention center that is currently under construction?</h4><p>We are building the Malaysia International Trade Exhibition Center, the biggest in the country. Malaysia can become the top destination for MICE in the region, and having a state-of-the-art convention center within the city limits of KL will help us with that. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>From an economic and a policy perspective, what have been the most important achievements in the past year?</h4><p>In 2015, we were concentrating on the preparing the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, which was approved by parliament in June 2015, seven months ahead of the implementation date. By January 2016, every government ministry and agency could focus on executing the plan. In terms of the global markets, we experienced a continued decline in the oil price: the average before 2014 was USD100 per barrel, dropping to about USD15 in 2015. That means there are more challenges for us but fortunately we have taken measures to reduce our dependency on commodities, particularly oil and gas. In terms of the commodity sector's contribution to GDP, including agriculture and mining, it was only 18% of total GDP. Government revenue coming from oil and gas activities went from 40% in 2009 to 30% in 2014. We were prepared for the worse; hence, when we started to implement GST in 2015, we were able to bring down the dependency to 19%. This has prepared us better to face the additional challenges from low oil prices. The third landmark event was the signing of the TPPA in February 2016</p><h4>What will be the main impact of the Eleventh Malaysia Plan and how will it change business for investors coming to Malaysia?</h4><p>The main theme of the Eleventh Malaysia Plan is anchoring growth on people, with emphasis on growing the economy. It is important to ensure that economic growth translates into real benefits for the people, meaning better business and employment opportunities, in turn translating into higher household income and enhanced wellbeing for the people. This is why we have chosen the theme of anchoring growth on people, for which we have outlined six strategic thrusts, namely: enhancing inclusiveness for an equitable society; improving well-being for all; accelerating human capital development for an advanced nation; pursuing green growth for sustainability and resilience; strengthening infrastructure to support economic expansion; and re-engineering economic growth for greater prosperity. In order to implement the strategies, we have also identified six game changers, namely uplifting B40 households towards a middle-class society; enabling industry-led technical and vocational education and training (TVET); embarking on green growth; unlocking the potential of productivity; translating innovation to wealth; and investing in competitive cities. This is in line with our New Economic Model (NEM), which aims to achieve developed nation status by 2020 with the three components of high income, inclusiveness, and sustainability.</p><h4>As we embark on the last leg toward Vision 2020, what are the main challenges ahead?</h4><p>The three core components of the NEM are high income, inclusiveness, and sustainability. To achieve a higher income for our households, we have embarked on the Economic Transformation Programme. This includes promoting and supporting new economic areas and sectors, and we have put in place catalytic projects to boost the growth of these sectors. Our main challenge is to translate economic growth into better living conditions. One of the initiatives is by embarking on a number of new infrastructure projects, such as the development of the Pan-Borneo Highway in Sabah and Sarawak, which will allow more Malaysians, especially in rural areas, to participate in economic development. This is the inclusiveness element. We also need to improve labor productivity. We have been relatively over-dependent on cheap foreign labor, which is not necessarily productive for the medium term. In terms of sustainability, Malaysia has been responsible in terms of managing its natural resources. As we move forward, we should follow through on our early commitments and look more into green growth and conserve our natural resources for future generations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your business portfolio ranges from palm oil, healthcare, hospitality, and property development to oil and gas. How do you manage such disparate operations?</h4><p>JCorp focuses on three core activities—business, economic development, and CSR. New policies and initiatives are introduced to enable innovation to catalyze new wealth generation and attain sustainability. In carrying out business activities, we are mainly focused on several key business areas such as palm oil plantation, property development, specialist healthcare, quick service restaurants, and offshore support in the oil and gas industry. Three of our companies are listed on Bursa Malaysia, namely KPJ Healthcare, EA Technique, and Al-'Aqar and Al-Salam REITs, with several others currently in the pipeline. Apart from revenue generation, these key business clusters provide substantial employment opportunities and help to generate domestic internal liquidity through their robust business undertakings. For the economic development role, JCorp is currently developing the Tanjung Langsat Port as an alternative gateway into Johor and Malaysia, as well as the development and management of industrial parks. We also develop suburban and rural areas in Johor, often as a result of our industrial activities, for instance generating employment in the furniture industry in Muar. In addition, the government has identified Pengerang as a new hub for the oil and gas industry, where the construction of the Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex (PIPC), spearheaded by PETRONAS, is underway. JCorp is tasked with catalyzing and providing strategic support in the development of the Pengerang area and we are looking at several avenues to achieve this.</p><h4>How do you envision shaping economic growth via the new Ibrahim International Business District (IIBD)?</h4><p>The recent IIBD brand launch is a key milestone in the development journey and we worked with Bangsa Johor to create the master plan for this international business district. The project was first envisioned by HRH the Sultan of Johor Sultan Ibrahim Ibni Almarhum Sultan Iskandar. IIBD is envisaged not only as an international focal point for investment, commercial, and corporate pursuits, but also as a launch pad for enterprises. As an emerging opportunity and market for investors, IIBD is ripe for development as part of the greater Iskandar region. It encapsulates the state government's aspirations for IIBD to shape economic growth by attracting talent and investment and encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship. JCorp will serve as the key enabler for the development of IIBD, and we are currently setting up an entity to operate as master developer, after which we will manage, promote, and market IIBD to the global investment community. We are also working closely with the state and federal governments to structure and benchmark financial and tax incentives, which will make IIBD a compelling business case. JCorp also endeavors to ensure a balance and good mix of foreign investment interests and local ownership. By prioritizing the co-creation process of IIBD with Bangsa Johor, we seek to ensure that the rising generation of talent and entrepreneurs are empowered for wealth creation and have equal opportunities to reap the benefits that will come with the accelerated investment in the state.</p><h4>How do you see the trend of China driving economic growth in the region?</h4><p>For Johor, there has been an upsurge in Chinese investments in the last two years, especially in mega property developments like Country Garden and Greenland. This trend can be attributed to China's “going out“ policy, which has encouraged Chinese investors to acquire assets and businesses overseas. The recent China-ASEAN FTA has further boosted this trend. For the manufacturing sector, based on figures released by MITI, Johor registered the highest investment for the past three years, from MYR21.2 billion in 2014 to MYR31.1 billion in 2015. There has been growing interest from Chinese manufacturers to set up facilities in Johor. In fact, JCorp itself has received investments of over MYR300 million from China in 2014 to 2015 and we are confident that this will increase to MYR1.5 billion by the end of 2017. This confirms that Johor remains an attractive investment destination in the region, especially in the manufacturing sector. JCorp offers strategic industrial locations supported by complete infrastructure facilities and connectivity with enablers such as port facilities, a skilled workforce and training institutions, and bonded facilities to facilitate manufacturers. Our proximity to Singapore further boosts its advantage over other states. There has been a continuous effort by the government of Johor to attract Chinese manufacturers, with several recent trade missions. Our target market is to attract investments in chemical, machinery, petrochemical, and offshore as well as engineering support services. With Chinese manufacturing investments set to expand, we expect our services and tourism sectors to grow as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the intent and achievements of the National Transformation Program (NTP)?</h4><p>We plan to transform Malaysia from a middle-income to a high-income nation by 2020. The creation of wealth, inclusivity, and sustainability are the three pillars, with quality of life at the center of these pillars. We are currently on track and are overcoming the middle-income trap. Our actual GNI per capita had a gap of 33% and was not closing for five years. Since we started the transformation programs in 2010, we have narrowed it to 13%. The key factor of becoming a high-income state is to have the private sector as the biggest investor. Government investment is currently 40% versus 60% private investment. Secondly, we wanted to address inclusivity, making sure that we lift the bottom 40%. We changed the way we work here, reducing subsidies and instead providing cash transfers to those whose income is below MYR3,000 per month. Furthermore, we have introduced a minimum wage. We have lifted 2.9 million people out of poverty. Many of our rural living population did not have access to electricity, water, and basic infrastructure. We have touched the lives of 6.1 million people here. The third component is sustainability, where the shifting of the investment balance also plays an important role. Another aspect is diversifying our economy to ensure we do not rely heavily on income from natural resources and instead become more service oriented. Sustainability is often associated with the environment, and here we are making progress. We have invested heavily in urban public transportation, especially on the MRT project—our greenest project.</p><h4>Does becoming a more service-oriented economy mean increased collaboration with Singapore?</h4><p>The key to collaborating with Singapore in the coming years is the development of the High-Speed Rail. Having the two countries connected means an easy flow of talent and capital, and a general boost of the relationship. We already collaborate with it on other issues; for example, on the construction of our new oil and gas hub in Pengerang, Johor. Singapore has a similar hub just across the border; hence, we will find ways of working together rather than competing with each other.</p><h4>How does PEMANDU work to push the NTP agenda forward?</h4><p>Our first role is to promote a new way of working, for which we have designed labs. For example, we ran a series of labs, amongst which was the oil and gas sector, where we invited people from the public sector, as well as the private sector like Shell, Chevron, Exxon, and Talisman. For eight weeks, their representatives were locked inside the lab together with our team from the government service to collectively move the agenda of their industry forward. This is how the plans for Pengerang came along. We also introduce transparency. We want to show the public what we try to establish as greater transparency creates support. The third thing is the introduction of dashboards. Every Friday we have evaluation moments where we measure our progress by means of a traffic light: green for completed, yellow for partially done, and red for incomplete. This helps us institute a new way of working and creates discipline. If an item is red for two consecutive weeks, there is something wrong. Every month, we have committee meetings with the responsible minister. At the end of the year, we publish a report of what has been delivered and what has not. Ministers and the other responsible agents receive scores; the ownership is clear.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for PEMANDU?</h4><p>The next five years will be key to ensuring that these new ways of working become institutionalized. We want the private sector to take up responsibilities to continue catalyzing growth, and have government agencies adopt the lab technologies and rigor in dashboard monitoring. Once this is achieved, PEMANDU's role will naturally diminish and have served its purpose. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-boon-for-airborne-behemoths]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent do you continue to highlight the investment potential in Malaysia's agricultural sectors?</h4><p>When we started in 1969, the economy was more oriented toward agriculture and less toward manufacturing. Currently, the manufacturing sector has a much larger contribution to the economy. Nonetheless, we have consolidated our strengths, which include the plantation and commodity-based industries. We want to be an enabler for investments in the downstream area.</p><h4>How will MIDA participate in enacting the plans proposed by the Eleventh Malaysia Plan and “re-engineering growth for greater prosperity" in particular?</h4><p>We are very much involved in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan and have identified our so-called “3+2 formula." The first three are the catalytic sub-sectors: chemical, electrical and electronics, and machinery and equipment. The other two areas with high-growth potential are aerospace and medical devices. These sub-sectors were selected due to their strong inter-linkages to other sub-sectors and will support the overall growth of the manufacturing sector in the country. We also look at the services sector—ICT, oil and gas, healthcare, higher education, tourism, halal,  construction, and professional services. Another focus is on smart manufacturing. Industries must adopt smart manufacturing as quickly as possible because we believe the future is all about connectivity.</p><h4>What is MIDA's perspective and goals for aerospace? </h4><p>We have the Malaysian Aerospace Industry Blueprint, and it is also further reinforced in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan. This hinges on the demand for future aeroplanes in Asia and the Pacific. We expect to see a great deal of manufacturing and service providers; therefore, we have to be closer to the market. Malaysia is well positioned in terms of new infrastructure and facilities that we have developed over the years. We see aerospace as a growth sector in Malaysia and have been successful at attracting MRO, for example.</p><h4>Is the medical equipment industry becoming more technical?</h4><p>Traditionally, it focuses on the manufacturing of medical gloves. However, today the industry has evolved with the latest technologies and we see development in new products such as cardiovascular devices, orthopaedic devices, and imaging equipment with a growing number of facilities in Penang and Selangor. We have big names like B. Braun, St. Jude, Boston Scientific, and Abbott in Malaysia and have been receiving interest from local and foreign companies. Some will invest in greenfield projects, while others look for Malaysian companies to outsource their production or to undertake joint venture projects.</p><h4>Malaysia is taking the driver's seat in the halal industry, especially in terms of Islamic finance. What is MIDA's strategy?</h4><p>Malaysia is a reference point for the halal industry. It started with our Islamic finance many years ago, and we have been promoting the World Halal platforms for many years. At the World Halal Summit in 2016, Malaysia attracted quite a bit of attention for its halal investments and we even discussed some investment proposals. In 2017, we will mark 50 years of Malaysia providing infrastructure development such as industrial estate services. Malaysia can be a growth catalyst for the halal industry in the region. The halal supply chain can be extended to other countries, to source for raw materials, for example.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>Our economy is resilient. 2016 was a tough year. China still shows no signs of recovery, and Japan basically has a 0% growth rate. Malaysia is at 4-4.5%, the US at 2.3%, and Europe less than 1%—globally there are challenges. Commodity prices are volatile but fortunately they play a relatively small part in the Malaysian economy, representing just 11-12% of total exports. I am more optimistic about the manufacturing sector, particularly aerospace and medical devices. The Malaysian ringgit has strengthened, which is a positive sign. We implemented the necessary policies in times of challenging economic volatilities. We achieved 5% growth in 2015 and in 2016, we expect it to be between 4 and 4.5%. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision on the future of ASEAN economic integration?</h4><p>ASEAN is a dynamic region with excellent growth prospects, a large growing young population, and a rising middle class that is becoming more affluent. Within ASEAN, we compete to attract multinationals to set up their regional or global headquarters, and this drives us all to build a great infrastructure and a strong and attractive business ecosystem. In addition, having prosperous and stable neighbors around is great for any country, and an increasingly stable ASEAN benefits all countries. Intra-trade within the EU currently stands at 70%, compared to 24% within ASEAN as we do not have seamless trade of goods and services across borders yet; however, we are moving toward convergence, uniform standards, and reducing barriers. In December 2015, we declared ourselves an ASEAN Community with three pillars: political security, economy, and social development. The levels of development are different, and we have different cultures and languages; however, we have expressed our commitment to achieve closer integration. </p><h4>Malaysia is in the process of signing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the China-initiated Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). How will an open market of 3 billion inhabitants affect the Malaysian economy and its competiveness?</h4><p>As a trading nation with a limited domestic market of 30 million people, we need to constantly look beyond our borders for trade, investment, and economic growth. To date, Malaysia has signed and implemented 13 FTAs that have boosted our trade and opened up numerous opportunities for our local companies. Malaysia currently ranks as the 23rd largest exporting nation; however, we cannot be too reliant and should continuously aim to diversify our trade. Our entry in the TPP, together with 11 other nations and a combined GDP of USD27.5 trillion, would mean a significant expansion of our trade opportunities, particularly in Canada, Mexico, and Peru, with whom we currently do not have preferential access. We need to wait for a clearer picture on the TPPA but Malaysia is prepared for any eventuality. </p><h4>Malaysia is in the midst of a 10-year long, MYR100 billion investment in infrastructure. How will this enhance the attractiveness of Malaysia as an investment destination?</h4><p>Infrastructure and connectivity are critical in supporting economic growth as they improve production and logistical efficiency. Our network of first-class infrastructure now includes multiple nationwide highways, seaports, airports, 4G networks, industrial parks, and integrated economic zones. The North-South highway over peninsular Malaysia was a game changer and a starting point for further highway development in the country. In 2014, the World Bank ranked us 25th in the global Logistics Performance Index, in particular because of our strategic location in the Straits of Malacca and our sophisticated ports. With a compound annual growth rate of 20% in our cargo and container volume, we are currently working to increase capacity, for example at the Malacca gateway project. In Kuala Lumpur, we have made strategic investments in the expansion of our public transport system, with a recent extension of our LRT network and the opening of phase one of our MRT system in December. The projected High-Speed Rail (HSR) to Singapore, for which both prime ministers concluded an MoU in 2016, will cut travel time between the two capitals to just 100 minutes—another major boost for our bilateral relations there.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The ministry is optimistic about the overall prospects of Malaysia's economic growth, and we expect that private investments will continue to be the key growth catalyst next year and will keep growing at 9.4% per year. In 2016, we anticipate a combined total of almost MYR300 billion. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do WIEF and its conferences make the most impact?</h4><p>Around 10 to 12 years ago, the Islamic world, in particular those under the umbrella of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), was neglecting issues relating to the economy and economic development. The OIC was mainly geopolitical, a UN restricted to Muslim countries. With that objective in mind, the WIEF was established on the sidelines of an OIC summit. We organized an annual economic symposium for several years until the initial issues became politicized. When the OIC came under the chairmanship of Malaysia, our prime minister decided to set up this economic cooperation under a separate organization—this was the beginning of WIEF, though still under the patronage of the OIC. A research organization was assigned the responsibility of organizing the launch and I was appointed chairman. We had our first meeting in Kuala Lumpur in 2006, where we addressed a broad range of topics with 400 high-level executives from all over the world. It was my vision from the beginning to improve the livelihood of Muslim society at large. None of our activities, therefore, touch on issues related to religion or political ideology. The word spread that we were truly interested in talking about business, and thus we could bring a large number of Muslim and non-Muslim businessmen together. For politics or religion, there are already hundreds of other think tanks; we strictly discuss business, and that is our unique selling point.</p><h4>How can we evolve the discussion forward between Muslim nations and what is the ultimate goal of the forum?</h4><p>The ultimate goal is to have all participating countries align agendas for the economic development of their respective nations and to enter the mainstream global economy. The conference has five main topics. The first is infrastructure, which is a primary enabler of economic development. Second is halal tourism, and we increasingly look at global destinations to build this tourism segment. Third is Islamic fashion, which is undergoing rapid development, with global demand for modest fashion. Furthermore, we look into Islamic finance and creative industries. With this broad range of topics, we will find enough common ground.</p><h4>Do you think the process for making that happen should mirror the ideas of this forum?</h4><p>We need the willpower of the countries concerned to be all-inclusive; their business and political leaders should recognize the relevance of this global discussion. We want them to show their concern for the wellbeing of the people. Economic development should not recognize boundaries or have limitations—that is as political as we will go during this forum. Regardless of their religion, region, or country, anyone participating should accept this basic principle. Non-Muslim businesspeople join our events as well. The obvious objective is development at the highest level. Islamic should not just mean religious, but rather good corporate governance, green, and environmentally friendly. Employment should be fair as well, and this is one of the reasons we are pushing forward the agenda for Islamic finance. The western well-established financial system has suddenly collapsed and we want to move the financial industry to operate ethically again.</p><h4>How do you think Muslim nations can work together to convey their ambitions to investors around the world?</h4><p>Islamic finance and banking are still relatively new because the western system has been established since the early beginnings of the banking industry. In 2013, we held the WIEF in London—the first time we did it in a non-Muslim country—on its invitation. A year later, the UK government launched a sukuk fund totaling GBP200 million, which was 10 times oversubscribed. This made it clear that the demand for honest and ethical lending systems, for safety and security, and for wealth sharing in the system is large in many places. Although we keep WIEF a low-key conference—we hardly advertise—in 10 years we have grown to become a global reference point. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How far has the bloc come in fostering economic integration throughout the region, and to what extent does the recently launched AEC signal a new dawn for inter-regional cooperation?</h4><p>Since the establishment of ASEAN, its economic integration has been strengthened and deepened through the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Service (AFAS), the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement (ACIA), and the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Mutual Recognition Agreements, just to name a few. In addition, the establishment of committees and working groups on trade and investment issues, as well as cooperation in the areas of customs modernization and trade facilitation, have assisted ASEAN well in reducing trade barriers among themselves.</p><p>Furthermore, ASEAN has entered into a number of free trade agreements with other non-ASEAN partners around the world. Important among these are agreements with China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand. These initiatives are an indication that ASEAN, as a single community playing an active role in the regional and world economy, is expanding ASEAN trade influence and using these agreements as tools for improving ASEAN trade competitiveness. Currently, the negotiation under Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) initiative aims to be an ASEAN-led process through which ASEAN would broaden and deepen its economic engagements with its six FTA partners. The RCEP has the potential to transform the region into an integrated market of more than three billion people (over 45% of the world's population), with a combined GDP of about USD17 trillion, about 27% of the world's current annual GDP. In summary, since the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint's inception in 2007, there have been four targets: first, a single market and production base; second, a business-friendly and innovation-supporting regional environment through the adoption of a common framework or standards; third, equitable economic developments; and fourth, full integration into the global economy. ASEAN intra-regional trade between 2007 and 2014 almost doubled from USD1.6 trillion to USD2.5 trillion. At present, with the fast-changing nature of world trade and new commercial challenges, Thailand gives priority to strengthening its internal economy while enhancing ASEAN's trade stability. Under the “ASEAN as one market" strategy, we seek shared prosperity in international trade, particularly through building and connecting the regional value chain with the global economy.</p><h4>In February of 2016, Malaysia initiated its first step toward implementing TPP. How will that partnership affect trade in the region and the economic relationship between Thailand and Malaysia, should it be ratified? </h4><p>Thailand and Malaysia have long been important trading partners with each other. In 2015, Malaysia was ASEAN's second-largest trading partner with Thailand, with trade of roughly USD22 billion. The products to be traded include automobiles and parts, computer components and parts, chemicals, crude oil, and integrated circuits. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would play an important role in the region as four ASEAN countries (Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam) are now potential signatories. It would have positive effects on the economy, trade, and investment of member countries and lead to an increase in trade volumes among them.</p><h4>What do you think needs to be done to unlock the full potential of Thailand-Malaysia trade relations?</h4><p>Thailand and Malaysia have enjoyed a long, intimate, and cordial relationship based on a solid foundation and deep bonds of affinity and trust. Both countries are active and founding members of ASEAN. Since 1967, Malaysia has been a major trading partner of Thailand. In the past five years, total trade between Thailand and Malaysia has averaged USD25 billion per annum. In 2015, Malaysia was Thailand's fourth largest trading partner and the largest in ASEAN. This is primarily attributable to cross-border trade, which accounts for 60-70% of the total trade value between the two countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>2016 is gearing up to be another challenging year. Eight years after the global financial crisis, the world economy remains fragile and global trade is at its weakest since WWII. In 2015, global exports declined by 14% compared to the year before. Of USD10 trillion of government bonds outstanding in the world, around two-thirds carry interest rates below zero. Terrorist attacks big and small wrack the world. The politics in many parts of the world are the most unpredictable since the beginning of this century. In global conditions such as this, we as Muslim societies around the world must make use of our fundamental strength. We have the most promising demography and the highest proportion of young people. The medium age of Muslims worldwide is 23 years old while the medium age of non-Muslims around the world is 30 years old. </p><p>Sharia finance is now a multi-trillion dollar global industry; Islamic players in fashion, culinary arts, and art and architecture are rapidly growing and have huge potential to create a world new economy, but we must admit that we as Muslim societies also face huge challenges in many of our communities. We suffer from high unemployment, especially among our young people. In many societies, we are pushed to the side, unable to integrate well with others; we are less prominent in media, social media, and technology; therefore, we are not winning the battle for hearts and minds. If we do not educate and train our people, the world will leave us behind. We live in an age of unprecedented innovation, artificial digital intelligent, genetic engineering, and 3D-printing. Yet at the same time we live in an age of unprecedented instability. There is unprecedented income in equality, and we are seeing security threats all around the world, the world economy is soft, and economic recovery is fragile. We must admit that innovation creates winners and losers and innovation will only create bigger and bigger winners. If we are not careful, we will also create bigger and bigger losers. We need to be careful of innovation for the sake of innovation and innovation that is motivated mostly by greed. We must be sure that innovation really contributes to the welfare of the people. Innovation will make certain people extremely rich, but only government can make sure that the benefits of innovation are fairly shared.<br>There is no shortcut or magic button; we must engage with a difficult world, the complex world of building industries that create jobs, of building systems to educate our children, to train our youth in the skills and attitudes that are required for the 21st century. For those of us who still carry among us swathes of poverty, we must solve the basic problems of electricity, clean water, and transportation, and we must ensure that our people can live in places that are clean and safe. We must make sure food is available and affordable. More importantly, but also more difficult, we must build a culture that is open, that not only tolerates differences, but genuinely respects them. How can all this be done? The answer is simple; step by step and one by one. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mutually-beneficial]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sri Lanka and Malaysia have held cordial bilateral relations for many decades. How is this relationship mutually beneficial for the economies of the two countries?</h4><p>Sri Lanka was one of the first countries to commence diplomatic relations with Malaysia soon after it became a sovereign nation. Ever since, ties between our two countries have grown better and stronger with increased trade, investment, education and people-to-people connections. As our economies are rather complementary to each other than competitive, Malaysia has been and continues to be a perfect economic partner for Sri Lanka. In the last decade, there has been a significant growth of commercial ties between the countries. In the light of the Asia-centric foreign policy that my government has practiced, many new avenues of corporation between us have emerged in the recent past, and I am certain the growing relations between the two countries bring economic dividends to the citizens of both countries.</p><h4>The recent visit by Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Dato' Seri Dr. Ahmad Zahid Hamidi to Colombo has helped to restart discussions of an FTA between Sri Lanka and Malaysia. What would be the impact of such an FTA?</h4><p>Trade builds strong and reliable connections between peoples. A few positive moves have been made in relation to cooperation between Sri Lanka and Malaysia. When I visited Malaysia in December 2016, Malaysian Prime Minister Dato' Sri Najib Tun Abdul Razak and I agreed to explore the possibility initiating the Malaysia-Sri Lanka FTA. We are keen to develop a platform on which our economic ties can grow further. Sri Lanka looks forward to improve the existing trade balance with Malaysia while increasing the overall volume of trade. Sri Lanka's existing trade agreement with India will be further expanded soon, making Sri Lanka a preferred investment destination for Malaysia's businesses. In the same way, Sri Lankan businesses will benefit from the many FTAs Malaysia has with ASEAN countries. Sri Lanka's workforce also has shown interest in working in Malaysia, while education exchanges are also on the rise</p><h4>What are important areas of focus to bolster trade growth between the two countries?</h4><p>Sri Lanka and Malaysia signed several bilateral trade and technical corporation related agreements in December 2016. They focused on tourism, youth development, employment, agriculture, and heritage and culture. We are keen to develop a broad spectrum of trade links with Malaysia, including apparel and textiles and processed food, which have shown much growth since recently. Malaysian businesses investing in Sri Lanka have increased, benefiting from the conducive environment in Sri Lanka. The volume of trade between the two countries has much space for growth. The existing negative trade balance between the countries reflects the opportunities available for Sri Lankan businesses to export to Malaysia competitively. Agricultural and textile exports will lead Sri Lanka's exports in the near term.</p><h4>What are your hopes for Sri Lankan-Malaysian relations in the near future?</h4><p>Malaysia has achieved sustained economic growth over the last few decades and emerged as a high middle-income country. Sri Lanka values the experience of Malaysia and ready to learn from it in our path to achieve development, that is inclusive and sustainable. In many fields, including agriculture, education, tourism and technology, a strong dialog is taking place for collaboration. With these collaborations, government-to-government relations will get still stronger. Businesses from both sides have a shown an unprecedented keenness in exploring opportunities in each other's markets following the business forum we had recently in Kuala Lumpur. An increasing number of business delegations have been visiting Sri Lanka led by key personalities in the Malaysian government. Malaysia is a preferred destination of education for an increasing number of Sri Lankan students. Tourism has seen a surge in the recent years and there are about 60 flights between Malaysia and Sri Lanka every week. That develops people-to-people relations that are strongest. Sri Lanka is a friend of Malaysia and looks forward to mutually benefitting relations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Foundations of Progress]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-foundations-of-progress]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Without political stability and without peace and security, there can be no economic progress. There has been far too much turmoil in the Muslim world in recent years. The invasion of Iraq in particular set in motion a disastrous series of events, bringing possible destruction and the possible break-up of nation states such as Iraq, Syria, and Libya. The so-called Arab Spring yielded a harvest of instability across the region. Thousands have paid with their lives, and terrorists and armed militias now roam freely over once-secured lands. A Pandora's Box of sectarian conflict has been unleashed. Foreign interventions in Muslim countries have led to intended and unintended consequences that are still being felt today. By comparison, majority Muslim countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, which have not been subject to foreign intervention, are an oasis of peace and stability.</p><p>This is why the leaders must work to solve our problems and issues together and seek cooperation and collaboration. However, we must insist on respect for our own sovereignty, respect for our laws, and respect for our own democratically elected governments. We have seen the devastating results of foreign intervention in the Muslim world, often based on incomplete, wrong, or partisan information. We must make clear that we reject it, and we must reject those who out of political motivation call on foreign powers to intervene in their own country. As the ummah, we must take responsibility for ourselves, and we pray for the guidance to do so.<br>Why is the European scenario so different from that of ASEAN and the global Muslim economy? There are several reasons for this. Firstly, the pace of recovery in Europe since 2008 has been sluggish, and eurozone GDP is still below its pre-crisis rate. The euro weakened when the European Central Bank went ahead with quantitative easing to create more money after introducing negative interest rates in June 2014. Secondly, in contrast, ASEAN's economic growth has been rapid and stable since 2000, recoding a combined GDP of USD2.6 trillion in 2016, making it collectively the seventh largest economy in the world. The region has become a major global hub for manufacturing and trade, and it is also one of the fastest growing consumer markets in the world. Thirdly, the global Islamic economy is thriving. More Muslims are becoming increasingly active as investors, manufacturers, bankers, traders, competitors, and suppliers. Muslim consumer spending is also rising as demand increases for ethical finance, investment, and insurance services, for halal food, modest fashion, and halal tourism. Even non-Muslims are attracted to the Islamic economy's underlying socially conscious ethos. There is an opening here for dialog with the West, which has longed in some sectors for a just and compassionate economy of its own. I am glad to say that in Malaysia, since 2009, we have created 1.8 million jobs, increased GNI by nearly 50%, capped inflation, and boosted FDI to record levels. We continue to record good economic growth despite the steep drops in the price of oil and commodities.</p><p>The Muslim world has some serious issues to address. Education, poverty, and female participation in the workforce remain challenges and only 2% of GDP is spent on R&amp;D. All of this is despite the fact that collectively the Muslim world holds 70% of the world's energy resources and 40% of global natural resources. While we acknowledge the issues we must address, we believe it is good to focus on vital topics relating to sukuk infrastructure development, halal industries, female empowerment, and disruptive technology. We must encourage more merit-based economic opportunities in the Muslim world. We seek a world that includes all our citizens and shares the proceeds of growth with all. One that educates all our children; one that supports all our entrepreneurs and SMEs; one that prizes knowledge and innovation, and one that appreciates that our diversity is also our joy and our strength. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Steady Hand]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[sheikh-faisal-bin-abdulaziz-bin-jassem-al-thani]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which segments currently offer the most potential for Ahlibank?</h4><p>Retail banking continues to be a key focus area, as under the new capital rules there is an advantage over capital deployment. However, to be honest, the bulk of growth remains in the commercial banking side of our business. We are close with the business community and have been scoring high in terms of winning opportunities. Regarding the sectors in Qatar's economy which have the most potential for commercial growth, we have been selectively supporting the real estate sector before moving on to infrastructure. However, we always maintained close ties with commercial trade, capital expenditure, and related businesses to be our core segments going forward.</p><h4>What new initiatives do you have to push the trade side of the business?</h4><p>We have invested in the trade finance department to advise and train customers on how to operate across borders using their letters of credit rules and other tools. We work with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and are active in terms of advising the business community of Qatar about the valuable role played by the ICC. The primary motive is to voice our opinion and advise on the new rules, which Qatar should and will play in cross-border trade. The ICC is an important element of this.</p><h4>How have your e-payment channel products impacted operations?</h4><p>It takes time for these products to take off. It is gradually growing, but we wish that it grew further and faster as there is competition on all sides. We have made investments in the local payment gateway, which is called Q-Pay, developed by the Qatar Central Bank (QCB). We made these investments and the Qatar Central Bank just upgraded it so we have a good pipeline in providing services to businesses to help them with their customer offerings, for which they need a bank. These businesses must also upgrade their websites in order to integrate this additional payment capability. They have now taken over and we have put in local and international names which they are happy with. We are leaders in this business, and we recognize considerable growth opportunities in the area.</p><h4>What is Ahlibank doing to protect their customers through cyber security initiatives?</h4><p>At the Cyber Security Convention that just took place we released two films, which dealt with internet security and “phishing" on the website and through WhatsApp. We are creating awareness not internally but also externally, and we continue to advise and send messages to customers to make them aware of it. We are the first if not only bank that went to request certification which is good to have in cyber security. All the banks are audited by the Qatar Central Bank (QCB), but there are bound to be gaps that need to be closed. We are working on ISO certification, so this is not a stagnant position we are in. We do not stop as the risk is too high. Those hackers are always trying to get one step forward, so we need to constantly match them in order to avoid being compromised.</p><h4>What opportunities do you expect to come from your raising of USD500 million in international markets?</h4><p>First of all, this is a debut debt issue for the bank. We lacked visibility in the international market and this was because we wanted to address the liabilities under the balance sheet and to strengthen our liability ladder. This liquidity is stable, but we wanted to have a mix of short-, medium-, and long-term funding because we need to match the asset side of the business. We also have to follow the Basel III rules to source stable funding requirements, so our issuance in the market was extremely successful, though it came at a cost. This improves our liquidity position and compliance with the regulators' ratios, which is why we went there. We have plans to do the same thing again and will announce it to the market when the time is right.</p><h4>How has Qatar's FTSE upgrade affected Ahlibank?</h4><p>A lot of the shareholders like to buy and hold rather than trade, hence our liquidity in the shares is limited in terms of where other banks are. It does add liquidity to the market in case our shares are traded more. As we grow and our shareholder base expands it will have a positive effect.</p><h4>How do you see potential US Federal reserve rating increases impacting the bank?</h4><p>It is bound to increase the cost of funding which is something that is bothering all the banks at the moment. The potential increase is also going to affect banks and the cost of liquidity has gone up and will have an impact. These particular medium-term loans that we have issued have stabilized it. We have seen in advance that things will go up and if we do our homework right and do medium fixed term funding then the benefit to the customer will come later. At the moment, we will pay for it but later on we will see that what we have done is right.</p><h4>What strategies does Ahlibank have to increase its brand awareness?</h4><p>We have been focusing on training our customer facing staff in the branches on how to create the right first impression. It starts with the first interaction with customers, as at the end of the day no matter how well gadgets work you still need people at the end of the line to help you, speak to you, and guide you. These staff members are the most important human capital for us.</p><h4>What were the reasons behind the IPSOS brand recognition improvement of Ahlibank?</h4><p>We invested in getting this and have been noticed. We have the technology, people training, results, participation, social responsibility, and recently received the Asian Banker recognition award. We are doing it the right way. It is a combination of things, but the fundamental is that first impression when you start dealing with the bank.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Ahlibank and the banking sector in Qatar in 2017?</h4><p>I look at 2017 with caution. If we continue looking at quality and select our opportunities and look at efficiencies in operations then we will be fine in 2017. The industry at large might not record the levels of the good days, but it is all about sustainability rather than big gains. That is what we are aiming for.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Kazakhstan's growing importance as a strategic partner for Turkey?</h4><p>Relations between Turkey and Kazakhstan are deep rooted. This year we proudly celebrate the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. During these years, we have maintained mutual will to further develop our bilateral relations. Kazakhstan is one of our leading partners in Eurasia and we continue to strengthen our relations through various mechanisms. The establishment of the Joint Strategic Cooperation Council in 2011 is a testament to the importance of our relations. I am pleased to see the growing role of Kazakhstan on the international scene. Kazakhstan has made remarkable contributions to the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts. I should also mention President Nazarbayev's praiseworthy initiatives to strengthen ties among the friendly and brotherly countries. I am confident Kazakhstan will further contribute to international peace and stability as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in the 2017-2018 period. We will continue our cooperation with our Kazakh brothers in international fora.</p><h4>What measures are being implemented to  increase bilateral trade to USD10 billion?</h4><p>I strongly believe that this target is realistic as Kazakhstan is our leading trading partner in Central Asia. As a matter of fact, we have the necessary economic and trade mechanisms between the two countries. For example, the Joint Economic Commission (JEC) provides a useful venue to explore the ways and means to further expand cooperation. The last JEC meeting in Ankara in March 2016 was fruitful. I should also mention the Joint Road Transportation Commission Meetings and Business Council Meetings as valuable instruments in this regard.</p><h4>Which sectors of Kazakhstan's economy have the greatest potential for Turkish investment?</h4><p>Kazakhstan's economic developments are on our radars. We not only support Kazakhstan's “Strategy 2050," which aims to place Kazakhstan among the world's top-30 developed economies, but are also ready to join hands with Kazakhstan to pursue that strategy. Turkish direct investments in Kazakhstan reached USD2 billion, which makes us the fourth-largest investor in Kazakhstan. The total volume of the 475 projects that Turkish contracting companies have thus far undertaken in Kazakhstan is around USD21 billion. We are confident that Kazakhstan's ongoing efforts to modernize the country's infrastructure, transportation, and logistics will further provide favorable conditions to attract foreign investments. Energy, mining, transportation and logistics, defense, agro-industry, health tourism, information communication technologies, and software in particular are promising areas of cooperation. Another area where we support Kazakhstan's efforts is its aspiration to become a regional hub for transport and logistics. In this regard, the Central Corridor through Caspian Sea will be instrumental in enhancing our trade relations. It would be mutually beneficial to connect the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway to the Kazakh railway network through the Caspian Sea and Aktau Port.</p><h4>How do you envision the future of bilateral relations between Turkey and Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Suffice it to say, development and peace go hand in hand. We follow a foreign policy that takes initiative for peace and development. To that end, we are active at UN platforms, G-20, and many other international organizations with like-minded countries. Our bilateral relations will certainly be brighter and stronger. In the last 25 years, we have made many achievements to further and deepen our relations. Yet, there is still great potential. Both sides have the will and determination to strengthen ties. We look forward to holding the third session of the Joint Strategic Cooperation Council this year in Turkey. At this meeting, which will be held under the co-chairmanship of President Erdoğan and President Nazarbayev, we will review the current state of our relations and set new goals. Boosting our cooperation in mutual investment and increasing our trade volume are among our major goals. Furthermore, we will make every effort to enhance our cooperation in culture, education, and tourism. As we celebrate the silver jubilee in our diplomatic relations, I take this opportunity to convey the warmest greetings from the Turkish people to the people of Kazakhstan and wish many happy returns.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Public Interest]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[public-interest]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the only indigenous bank in the country, Investrust has a rich history in Zambia. How has the bank developed since its establishment?</h4><p>The bank has now reached a level of maturity. Investrust Bank was established 20 years ago, initially as a merchant bank and then as a universal bank, under private ownership. Around 2007 Investrust Bank was listed on the Lusaka Stock Exchange and it became a public company. 2015 was the peak of our expansion in terms of the bank's footprint. Prior to that, we spent more than five years investing in the network. We are a medium-sized bank with 27 branches, three agencies, and 60 ATMs across Zambia, making our presence here highly competitive. Another key factor for the bank is that there has been significant investment in various platforms, to a point where our capability is similar to foreign-owned banks. We have invested particularly in alternative channels, such as mobile and internet banking.</p><h4>From 2010 onward the bank's strategy has been one of consolidation. How do you seek to expand in the coming year?</h4><p>Now that we have built up our network, it is a question of sweating these assets to get a return. During the years of investment, obviously the returns are quite challenged, and now we hope to reap the benefits through profits. The other consideration is that bricks-and-mortar are not the only form of expansion. Investrust Bank is one of few banks that offer agency banking and this will be quite defining moving forward, as it speaks to the financial inclusion agenda. We have some of the large retailers as our agents in communities where the bank is not directly present. They can open accounts for customers through our mobile platform and our customers can make withdrawals and deposits. These are mostly supermarkets, because we are aware that that is where footfall is, as well as other vendors and cooperatives. We try to select agents with high levels of liquidity so there are no issues in terms of offering the services.</p><h4>How has the middle market grown in the last two years?</h4><p>Prior to 2016, the Zambian economy was growing close to 7% annually. There was a bit of a slowdown in 2015-2016, but the middle market has been growing in spite of this. This is especially true of the productive sectors. The other factor impacting the middle market is the emergence of SMEs that we have seen over the last 10 years. Those businesses contribute to a large extent the rise in activity we have witnessed, not just adding to economic activity, but also to employment. A third notable factor is a growth in entrepreneurship; we now see people in full employment who are also doing other activities or investments at the same time.</p><h4>In what ways does Investrust, and Zambia's banking community as a whole, engage with the SME sector?</h4><p>If there is any area of opportunity and growth in Zambia, it is still the SME sector. In the private sector, as well as the public sector, this is widely recognized. Fortunately for banks, the fact that the central bank increased our minimum capital requirement in 2012 meant that financial institutions had to find better ways to make returns. Historically, banks sought to avoid the SME sector because of the associated risks; however, these capital requirements have encouraged us to look twice at SMEs and how we can offer further support. To a large extent this has started to address the issue of access to finance. The second important consideration is that the largest contribution to GDP in most African countries comes from SMEs. For us, in the financial services sector there is always the desire to go where the flows are; therefore, we are opening up more and more to SME markets. The third important thing to bear in mind is that the Zambian economy is a trading economy. Most of these traders have sprung up in the SME sector. Finally, it is important to note that multilateral institutions now better support these economies. There is funding from Europe that is specific to SMEs, through lines of credit. As Investrust bank, we have accessed these funds for on-lending to SMEs in specific sectors.</p><h4>Which of Investrust Bank's solutions for SMEs make you a strong competitor in this sector?</h4><p>To date, we have relied on the technical assistance that comes from multilateral institutions because the biggest issue is risk management: corporate governance, how an SME is structured, and whether it has a bankable proposal. We are in a unique position because we do not just look at providing financing to SMEs; we provide capacity building. Furthermore, since we are local, we can apply our local knowledge to this business. There is also the goodwill created by the government and its peripheral institutions. It says it wants to work with local partners and that is where we naturally become the partner of choice. We also pride ourselves on our competitive turnaround, because most SMEs face time constraints. Our solutions range from working capital finance, leasing, and term loans to off balance sheet items like offering letters of credit and guarantees, therefore cartering for a diverse range of needs.</p><h4>What measures, other than supply through agencies, does Investrust take to reach out to a largely un-banked population?</h4><p>We have some alternative, simple products. For example, in 1Q2017 we launched a VISA prepaid card that is available also to non-customers of Investrust Bank. Anyone can walk into one of our branches, purchase and load this card, and use it to complete transactions. This product is not as onerous in terms of requirements as other financial tools, and thus acts as a way of making sure people have access to certain banking products in the market. We also do money transfer services via our ATMs, meaning, again, that someone who is not a customer can still receive funds. Finally, many mobile networks have come up with innovative mobile money solutions. Rather than compete with them, we have decided to collaborate, working with Zamtel to bring bank-to-mobile and mobile-to-bank services.</p><h4>What key ambitions do you have for Investrust Bank?</h4><p>In 2016, Investrust Bank raised capital twice and that will give us extra capacity to be able to do more going forward. Consequently ZCCM-IH became the majority shareholder, and we also have Meanwood Venture Capital, other institutional investors, and more than 600 individuals. We are also optimistic that in 2017 the central bank will loosen its monetary policy, which has inhibited growth and causing a liquidity strain in the market. Following this, Investrust Bank is positioning itself for growth and we have been particular about managing our value chain. We want to ensure we are present in the entire ecosystem, right from industries through to suppliers and consumers, and that we tailor our products to suit their respective needs. We ambitiously seek above 30% growth on average in 2017. We are look to support SMEs, with some external funding to augment our internal resources.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2016, RDCL celebrated its 30th anniversary and, earlier this year, we have seen the launching of RDCL World. What is your main mission and how would you evaluate these 30 years?</h4><p>We are proud to be an elite group, and new members must first receive an invitation from two existing members and be subject to a vote requiring a two-thirds majority of the board before they can join. In this way, we ensure that we attract and retain the most influential Lebanese business leaders in Lebanon and in the world. Additionally, our organization is totally apolitical and does not engage in any political activity. This would entail that if any member becomes a minister or a political representative, their membership is temporarily frozen. This helps us maintain complete independence. Many of our members become active in the political realm, because we believe that it is important to have the Lebanese private sector play a key role in the direction of the country and in its various decision-making processes. Economically, Lebanon has survived several episodes of instability, essentially thanks to its private sector. Our major objective is to bring different business people together at the same table. We participate, in one way or another, in almost all major economic decisions in Lebanon, and in the course of the last six years we have sent delegations all over the world.</p><h4>How are you promoting greater cooperation between the public and private sectors, with a view to a more stable socioeconomic development?</h4><p>We are active in both the public and private sectors. With regard to the public sector, we have successfully lobbied for a number of new laws, and over the last two years we have presented five laws. I would like to stress that, as a lobby group, we are able to pass several types of economic laws. Whilst general public-private partnership laws (PPPs) are difficult to pass, highly technical economic laws are much easier to gather support for, and, as a matter of fact, many members of parliament (MPs) frequently ask for our input. In Lebanon, business-lobbying groups can present laws on condition they are signed by 10 MPs. We, however, usually gather up to 50 signatures on the laws we present. Politicians understand that we have no political agenda; rather we are solely focused on business. We are particularly interested in bringing many people together from different backgrounds of expertise. While Lebanese business people have innumerable strengths, one of their weaknesses remains their persistence in working independently. Our purpose is to try and change this way of thinking, and encourage them to work together in groups. The points of strength that have fueled the success of Lebanese companies in the last 30 years have dramatically shifted, and a change of mentality is now necessary to survive. Business people need to heed the lessons of the past, while at the same time developing their mindset to evolve into a more powerful and reliable platform in the modern era we live in. Most of the successful Lebanese companies were developed and have grown in times of war, which means they are resilient and able to be flexible. These companies now simply need to adjust to the new environment.</p><h4>After 29 months without a President, the election is expected to boost the confidence of investors, both local and foreign. What are your prospects on its economic impact?</h4><p>What we witnessed at end-2016 is what we have been hoping and waiting for during two and a half years. It is completely unacceptable to have the constitution disregarded and the power of the government frozen the way it was. The 29-month presidential vacuum halted the economic cycle of the country, and we have seen a decrease in foreign investments by 50%. At the end of 2010, we roughly had USD4.85 billion in FDI, and we ended up with USD2.4 billion The long-awaited political agreement was a tremendous positive shot in the arm for the economy and the country as a whole. We have been paying a high price for regional tensions over the last five years. It is the first time since WWI that so many armed conflicts are simultaneously raging in the region, and let us not forget that our economy is based on the region's growth. This is an important test. As business people, we want to see tangible results. We require new laws that can fuel an expansion across the region. Our expectations are high. We are in a period of testing and analyzing, but are hopeful nonetheless.</p><h4>What are the main attractions and challenges for investors?</h4><p>Lebanon's sovereign risk has been quite stable over the last 30 years. In Lebanon, we have an acceptable judicial system that ensures the protection of investors' rights. Furthermore, we are working to increase the return on investment. Currently, the ROI in the country is only 5-7%, which is alarmingly low. Our major objective is to reduce sovereign risk and collaborate with different companies to boost the ROI. We want to reduce costs and improve infrastructure across the country. Lebanon is a hub for the region, hence multinationals with regional ambitions would be wise to operate out of Beirut. We are focused on attracting international companies —interested in relocating here— that could play a major role in the rebuilding of Syria. The reconstruction of Syria is poised to take place out of Lebanon. Naturally, we will not rebuild Syria all by ourselves, but will play a major role in facilitating its reconstruction. Any company that wants to efficiently operate in the Middle East would sooner or later strategically choose to headquarter in Lebanon. We are hoping that the country's natural assets and our focus on stability would appeal to investors, while also recognizing and endeavoring to fix our problematic public system and the high levels of corruption.</p><h4>What are some of RDCL World's main goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>Firstly, we are looking to close 2017 with substantial growth (2-2.5%). This is vital for the economy. Secondly, we want to create new micro companies. The most dynamic engine of a small economy like ours revolves around new entrepreneurs and SMEs. Our economic ecosystem must be changed, and here comes the necessity for new blood ready, willing, and able to tackle complex issues. We are living in a shifting economic environment marked by fierce competition, and in order to survive we have to arm ourselves with courage and focus on creativity and development. We aspire for investments not merely coming to Lebanon, but also going through Lebanon. Finally, we are yearning to stimulate M&amp;As across the economy. Again, we should not be working individualistically, but rather cooperatively. This is key. The golden opportunities, however, lie in our Expatriates' Network, and we are keen to leverage the latter to successfully stimulate the Lebanese economy. You could say that this is RDCL World's major goal and objective.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you envision future housing developments in the country and could you tell us more about current projects?</h4><p>In the short term, the Public Authority of Housing Welfare (PAHW), which I chair, has set an ambitious target of allocating 60,000 units over a five-year period, from 2015-2020, as per the second development plan. Furthermore, PAHW has succeeded in maintaining close coordination with other government entities to implement the government program and its ongoing strategic plan. In doing so, PAHW has exceeded previous targets and managed to distribute 45,746 units during the period from 2014 until 2016, compared to 96,938 units for the period from 1956 until 2013, representing 46% of the units of the past 58 years in just three years. In the long term, since PAHW is fully convinced that continuing the current approach in the provision of residential care is too expensive and unsustainable and will not solve the housing challenge. We are concentrating our efforts on the development of a sustainability strategy. For this, we work with the Kuwait Credit Bank (KCB) and other relevant parties. This requires a fundamental shift in the philosophy of providing residential care from securing the housing units through PAHW to the activation of public-private partnerships and developing sustainable communities with a social environment that complies with best industry standards. The practical application of this vision would result in the creation of investment opportunities, lift the burden from the state budget, and set the plan for long-term financial sustainability by converting the non-residential lands into income-producing assets to transform to a self-financing entity. In city development, PAHW typically engages in housing projects through the development of comprehensive new cities. These cities are designed according to a master plan, outlining an attractive value proposition and besides housing including social and economic components such as schools, hospitals, commercial and retail areas, and in some cases industrial zones. PAHW liaises with key government stakeholders to design the appropriate scale of infrastructure including roads and utilities based on the expected demand from these projects. These projects will be developed through a constructive partnership with the private sector that consider the end users' needs in terms of standard or affordability.</p><h4>How would you describe Kuwait's progress in achieving its 2020 objectives, and what is the role of the Ministry of Housing affairs here?</h4><p>In 2015, PAHW signed a program strategic consulting (PSC) agreement to provide technical and strategic support for the former housing programs and manage PAHW's megaprojects. These projects include the new Cities of Al-Khairan with 35,000 housing units, South Saad Al-Abdullah with 25,000 units, and North Al-Mutlaa with 52,000 units, amongst others. These will be executed by creating urban communities on best international standards and funded by public private partnerships. Through these partnerships, we strive for an efficient utilization of resources an alleviation of the burden of financing projects away from the state and to leverage on the expertise of the private sectors and transfer the skills, knowledge, and abilities from the private sector to the public sector. In addition, we seek to adopt a smart cities agenda where we also aim to rationalize energy usage. We are investing in attracting highly skilled calibers for all level of positions to enhance the efficiency and the delivery of these projects.</p><h4>How do envision more involvement of the private sector in the construction and housing sector?</h4><p>To drive private-sector participation in the development of housing projects, we plan to adopt a PPP framework that relies on an existing legislative setup, adoption of best practices in PPP project structuring, as well as close interaction with the private sector throughout development and tendering life cycle. The new legal setup provides the necessary tools for attracting investors and lenders such as allowing for foreign ownership of project companies, providing lenders security over the project contracts, and dictating a clear and transparent procurement process. Applied in several ongoing PPP procurements in Kuwait, PAHW does not envisage any major challenges in implementing the PPP law for its real estate and housing projects. In terms of PPP project structuring, PAHW will adopt appropriate risk allocation between the public and private sector, which aims to allocate the risks to the party best able to manage them. Finally, PAHW is engaging the private sector throughout the development and procurement of PPP projects, and will be organizing roadshows for prospective bidders to outline up and coming opportunities and how these will be tendered. Since May 2016, PAHW has the authority to tender PPPs without involving the Kuwait Authority for Partnerships Projects (KAPP) and will we be fully responsible for the tender process.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for foreign investors, and global construction firms, to participate in the country's housing projects?</h4><p>With the implementation of new regulations, we strive to attract new investors to Kuwait by providing a more comprehensive road map and guidance in the implementation and operation of future megaprojects. The new investment resolution allows joint ventures, partnerships, and BOTs now fully licensed. Investment and commercial zones include private schools and universities, private hospitals and other medical centers, malls and entertainment parks, logistics parks, museums and cultural centers, hotels and resorts, and residential complexes.</p><h4>What are you ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p>For the year ahead, PAHW is planning to tender five investment packages in Jaber Al-Ahmed and Sabah Al-Ahmed cities, for which a team of advisors, from PwC, Dar Al-Handasah, and Al-Markaza has been appointed. The developments include plots for residential and retail plots, as well as malls, business centers, and industrial and storage zones. The intention is to encourage suitably qualified local, regional, and international companies to invest. PAHW's one-year plan is to continue in meeting the demand for housing and reduce the waiting list backlog, as well as accelerating private-sector engagement. Another ambition is to build our first smart and environment-friendly city in Kuwait and in line with international standards, the Saad Al-Abdullah project.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Takamol?</h4><p><span></span>Set up in 2013, with a specific aim to drive positive impact on the Saudi Arabia labor market, Takamol's priorities are directly linked to those of government, particularly the Ministry of Labor and Social Development. We take a problem, we manage the lifecycle of the solution, and we create sustainable value for the Saudi economy.</p><h4>How does Takamol address the fundamental changes that are taking place in the Saudi economy today?</h4><p><span></span>Takamol is not only focused on the today. Our drive is to generate sustainable socio-economic solutions, and employment is fundamental to this. People will naturally flow to the easier ground—following the path of least resistance. If it is easier to get a government job, people will take these jobs. If most of the opportunities are in the private sector and there are less opportunities for government jobs, then people will naturally drift towards the private sector. A key objective of ours is to make potential employees more attractive to employers whilst stimulating employers to create more job opportunities. Firstly, in the last year alone, we delivered online training for more than 200,000 Saudi nationals to prepare potential employees to fully meet the demands of employers across the Kingdom. We also developed a program that will generate jobs for 13,000 Saudi nationals in some of our most remote locations by securing private sector investment in five targeted regions. By 2020, we aim to support an additional 100,000 Saudi nationals to work remotely through this specific program. </p><h4>Part of Vision 2030 is to have government agencies meet KPIs. What is Takamol doing to meet the aspirations of Vision 2030? </h4><p><span></span>Takamol is driven by two key strategies: Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Programme. These national priorities set the baseline from which we have set our strategies and our KPIs. Our focus is on social value creation, enabling public private sector partnerships, increasing government efficiencies, and designing and delivering sustainable labor market solutions. The ultimate aim of everything we do is to reduce unemployment and increase employment, particularly for Saudi nationals. We are paid by results. If we do not achieve, we do not get paid. We are essentially contractors for the government. For example, we manage an on-the-job training program for unemployed graduates. We place them with employers for up to six months and the government pays a salary subsidy. Takamol is only fully paid if that individual ends up getting hired. We get paid a lower amount if the individual does not get hired. We get paid nothing at all if we do not support enough unemployed graduates. Not only are we driven by our internal KPIs, we also strengthen the decision-making capacity of other core labor-sector focused government agencies. For example, we analyze complex economic and labor market data, providing insights to key stakeholders, enabling them to make evidenced-based decisions on programs, policies, and initiatives. Therefore, all Takamol activities are directly linked to the Vision 2030. </p><h4>What impact does low levels of female employment have on the Saudi labor market? </h4><p><span></span>We know that 70% of unemployed Saudi nationals are female, and that the age most negatively impacted is the 20-29 year old age group. We really need to do more for the Saudi females, particularly as they are highly educated and motivated, so we need to get more females into work. We know that there are multiple barriers for women wanting to enter employment. These include transport and childcare. Therefore Takamol has developed multiple programs and initiatives to support females to enter sustainable employment. Today, the cost of transport is a challenge for female workers, transportation can cost between SAR1,500 and SAR2,000 per month. We have developed a female transportation solution based on positive engagement with multiple transport providers who provide safe, accessible, and affordable transport for female employees, particularly for unemployed women moving into employment. A lack of accessible and affordable childcare is also a challenge for females who wish to enter and stay in work. We therefore provide subsidized childcare for working women, enabling more females to enter employment. We realize that there are not enough high-quality childcare facilities, so we assess and accredit childcare centers based on a set of parameters, qualifications, and inspection visits to ensure they meet robust quality criteria. We also empower women to set up more childcare facilities across the Kingdom. We do this in two ways. Firstly we train women to fully meet the quality criteria and achieve the accreditation required to create additional childcare facilities. Secondly we provide access to investment funding and loans. These programs are in their early stages, but we are confident that the measures we have taken will continue to provide support for women to enter and sustain employment. </p><h4>What efforts has Takamol made, to support SMEs and to aid them in their journey?</h4><p><span></span>Based on our analysis of the economy, we realize that our SMEs contribute only 20% of our total GDP, while other high-income countries average a contribution of over 50%. SMEs also contribute to about 34% of employment in the Kingdom, compared to 60-70% in OECD economies. Having explored this further, we recognize that the greatest challenges for our SMEs include lack of access to finance. They do not have funding because the financing market in Saudi makes it extremely difficult for SMEs to secure financing opportunities. At the same time, entrepreneurs may have great ideas and may need some support to translate these ideas into on-going sustainable businesses and also support with access to appropriate markets. To support these entrepreneurs, we have created a SME support team called “Nine-Tenths." The first challenge this team took on was to eliminate funding barriers. We designed a program where we match venture capital equity investment with the financial requirements of each business startup. We do not match the investment through a direct financial contribution, instead we act as a guarantor for a loan that is provided by a Commercial Bank. The total amount that we have guaranteed to date is SAR922 million. To help SMEs and new businesses access opportunities, we have set up a portal called 'Access to Bids.' We have already signed up 30 government organizations and large private sector companies to commission their direct purchases via this portal. These include the Ministry of Labor and Social Development, of course Takamol, STC, and many others. Our third solution is 'Access to Markets.'  We know that not every entrepreneur can simply create an online business and immediately generate high demand for their products and services, so in August Takamol launched this e-commerce platform. Its effectiveness lies in its simplicity. Entrepreneurs simply need to upload visuals, prices, and descriptions of their products and services. The portal then provides instant access to new potential markets. Hundreds of home-based businesses have already subscribed. Takamol designed the portal, we enable the logistics, we manage the payment gateway that collects from the buyer and pays the seller. These examples are only three from the ten additional initiatives that we are currently developing.  </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017? </h4><p><span></span>We have just experienced two challenging years. We have absorbed the shock, and have gone through the worst in 2015 and 2016. The economy continues to change and it is likely that 2017 will be a plateau year. Of course, 2018 will be the year that things will improve substantially. For us 2017 is the year to develop additional sustainable solutions to help long-term economic recovery. Takamol will continue to monitor the changing economic and labor market trends, develop targeted programs and initiatives to reflect the needs of both jobseekers and employers in the public and the private sectors. We will accelerate our activities around our key customer groups, particularly youth, females and SMEs. Overall, our challenge is to continue to support more Saudi nationals into more sustainable employment through 2017.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>BASF West Africa Limited opened in Nigeria in 2012. What have the main achievements been for the company since then?</h4><p>Our focus on Nigeria is due to the size of the country and the confidence we have in its future. We are involved in a wide range of industries spanning from agriculture, construction, appliances, shoes, hygiene, and beauty to construction and oil and gas. Being actively involved with these industries, BASF acts as an enabler for our customers to create value for the man on the street.</p><h4>In which of Nigeria's sectors can BASF West Africa create the most value?</h4><p>We have eight business units operating in Nigeria currently. However, looking at the specific needs of Nigeria, our focus is on developing a project for sustainable and affordable housing through our Construction Chemicals business unit. And, our agricultural and food nutrition business units will add value and offer solutions for food security within the country. We are engaged with various stakeholders to ensure we target the right industries ensuring advanced life sustaining benefits to every individual.</p><h4>Which of BASF's products hold the most potential in terms of future demand from the Nigerian market?</h4><p>Infrastructure is perhaps the biggest but also most important area of development in Nigeria.  That means anything related to construction, infrastructure, roads, and the renovation of existing buildings, bridges, and other structures are key for us. This is why our Construction Chemicals unit was the first one to establish a footprint in Lagos by opening a manufacturing facility during 2016. The agricultural business unit is growing due to the need of food production and crop protection, and working alongside the agricultural division is our plastics unit to combat food spoilage caused by poor storage of perishables. The plastics division's cold-chain solutions can ensure preserving and keeping fruits and vegetables fresh during the crucial period before they reach customers.</p><h4>What role can the company play in helping Nigeria reach the governments' objective of diversifying the economy?</h4><p>BASF is involved in innumerable industries; our products may not be seen, but they are used in people's everyday lives. For us, localizing is key and there are many ways to contribute; however, we have started by developing local teams within all the business units and from a business point of view, to take the time to understand the local environment and dynamics. We are creating opportunities and unlocking industries, with an understanding that we will need to be flexible and adapt our solutions as needed.</p><h4>How can BASF achieve its strong sustainability objectives here in Nigeria?</h4><p>Sustainability is at the center of everything we do. This concept runs throughout our business units. We are actively scouting for projects by engaging with local authorities, agencies, and NGOs, thereby working in partnership with all our stakeholders on the importance of sustainability. Over and above the economic and environmental dimension in sustainability, there is also a social element that is critical to us. Because we operate among communities, we create value not just for our customers, but because we are truly driven to find value for the country itself.</p><h4>What is the significance of West Africa, and the Nigerian market in particular, for the overall strategy of the company worldwide?</h4><p>Nigeria is an important market for reasons, such as the size of the country at 180 million people, as well as it being rich in natural and human resources and culture. Also, we understand that Nigeria is one of those countries that actually has an impact not just on itself and its people, but also on its neighbors, as stated by Christine Lagarde of the IMF in June 2016. BASF will continue investing in resources, its people, and our assets in Nigeria as we envisage helping to drive the Nigerian market to become fully captured both from an investor and consumer point of view.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2017?</h4><p>Our goal is to continue on our path of growth regardless of the current turbulent conditions. With the right focus and our dedicated team leveraging its capabilities, 2017 will be even better than 2016. Like for our peers and customers, addressing the foreign exchange topic will remain a priority for us, however our experience from 2016 showed that mastering this challenge can contribute to business development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the 2016 Global Competitiveness Index, Panama ranked 42 out of 138 economies worldwide. What is the country's strategy to continue improving its competitiveness?</h4><p>Panama improved its position in the World Economic Forum rankings by an impressive jump of eight positions. We are only nine positions away from Chile (33) and overall, this has been a massive success for Panama. The main objective of the secretariat is for Panama to become the most competitive economy in Latin America in 2019—Chile tops that list at the moment. However, it is worth mentioning that in the World Bank's Doing Business Report, Panama lost three positions—we currently rank 70th and are the sixth Latin American economy. By 2019, we want to be in the top three in the region in terms of doing business. At the moment, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Chile top the chart in Latin America. We want to be a part of that group. These are our objectives and my goals as National Secretary. Achieving all these will enable us to complete the Strategic Development Plan for the country that our President has implemented, namely to grow our economy from USD40 billion to USD68 billion by 2019. In this context, we have a competitiveness plan at the national level that we follow. Currently, our fiscal deficit is around 0.5% and the country's debt is just below 35%. We have increased the per capita income of Panamanians and GDP by almost 40% since we have been in office. We have identified three main challenges to improving the business environment in Panama. These include governmental bureaucracy that stifles entrepreneurs and businesses, the lack of highly specialized workforce, and a certain lack of institutionalization at several levels. The secretariat works to improve such conditions in Panama. One such project is the Panama Digital project: we want to make Panama the Silicon Valley of Latin America. We have put together joint efforts with other entities and organizations at the national level to boost the arrival and presence of tech-led companies to develop new projects and technologies in Panama. We coordinate and facilitate this project alongside SENACYT Panama and the Panamanian Chamber of Technology. One of our main advantages is that we are part of the Presidency of Panama. There are four secretariats under the presidency of the country: the Secretary of Objectives, which takes cares of the achievement of the government's goals; the Secretary of Legal Affairs; the Secretary of Social Affairs; and the Secretary of Competitiveness. Our role is to coordinate efforts from the presidency with all involved parties in each particular project. For example, with the joint efforts in terms of the lack of highly qualified workforce, we coordinate activities with the Ministry of Labor and other such institutions. We plan during our term in office to create over 120,000 new positions and train more than 232,000 people. Additionally, we have established the country's first technical and professional schools.</p><h4>How is establishing new technical schools important for the country's efforts to increase the availability of qualified human resources?</h4><p>Companies arriving here face a lack of technically qualified human resources (in some areas). At the same time, certain companies have also raised concerns over the lack of soft skills in people. We can see the consequences of this: in most customer-facing jobs such as in the hospitality industry, we have people from other nationalities working there. The development of these technical schools is in response to the needs and concerns of companies operating in Panama. The creation of these schools was also intended to help increase the number of expats allowed to work in a given company, and to prove to foreign companies that we are working to reverse the situation. We wanted to encourage them to stay in the country. There is also the Panama Bilingual project, which will allow us to have a completely bilingual primary education system by 2019. The budget for this project is about USD130 million.</p><h4>What are other of the top priorities for the Competitiveness &amp; Logistics Secretariat?</h4><p>The governmental bureaucracy is far too tedious and long for both Panamanians and companies operating here. Therefore, one of our top priorities is the facilitation of bureaucratic processes, including the issuing of national documents and the payment of taxes. We prioritized either the revocation of certain processes or their digitization. Our efforts in the logistics sphere have gained momentum over the most recent government term, as the secretariat had another name before that and was more focused on the economy overall. However, we have appointed several positions within the secretariat that work only and solely within the logistics industry: boosting technology and increasing synergies between ministries and institutions working in the logistics industry. We are an organization that tries to facilitate business and we do a great deal in terms of boosting new regulation and implementing new sector strategies.</p><h4>How has the Panama Papers impacted the country's image at an international level?</h4><p>The Panama Papers had an impact on the way people see Panama across the globe. However, it did not affect our performance in economic terms. Our government unwaveringly faced this case and we understood that only by being transparent could we reverse any negative impact. Panama signed the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters with the OECD. We have boosted efforts against drugs trafficking and money laundering. The signing of the above-mentioned convention with the OECD is a clear example of this.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for 2017?</h4><p>We will make sure the country grows by 5.8-6% in terms of economic competitiveness. We will continue facilitating the fact that the private industry drives economic growth in Panama, supported by the public sector. We will work on consolidating a country in which doing business for private companies will become easier than before. The country currently invests USD19 billion in public infrastructure. Most of this budget is channeled through the private sector. It needs a collaborative government and public sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tourism is a major growth sector in Oman and one that will be at the core of the government's reform agenda. How is Omran supporting the sector?</h4><p>Omran's current development projects include Madinat Al Irfan Urban Centre. Creating a new downtown area in Muscat, the mixed-use development will establish a new business community, as well as leisure activities for tourists and residents. Madinat Al Irfan also includes the recently opened Oman Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre (OCEC), which opened last year and, when fully opened in 2018, will be a world-class venue that has been specifically designed to meet the needs of modern global events but framed within rich Omani culture and traditions—a truly unique events venue in the Middle East. At the center of Oman's business development program, OCEC will act as a catalyst for business events in Oman and will have a major impact on the national economy. We have also recently launched Phase I of the Mina Al Sultan Qaboos Waterfront, the regeneration of Muscat's old port, connecting centuries of maritime heritage with a contemporary vision for the new Oman. The project will not only add enhanced lifestyle benefits for residents and visitors to Oman, but will also create up to 12,000 direct and 7,000 indirect jobs across the areas of hotels, residential, F&amp;B, and real estate management. There are other diverse projects in progress as well, such as Ras Al Hadd Development in the eastern region of Oman and the recently opened Anantara Al Baleed Resort in Salalah. Our aim is to create new destinations across the country that will enhance the tourism experience for local, regional, and international visitors, as well as add long-term benefits for local communities and national economy. All of these projects provide long-term investment solutions, which will help Oman's drive to make tourism and infrastructure a key part of its economy. The projects offer secure and sustainable financial returns for investors, which also creates a stable platform for the future prosperity of Oman and its people.</p><h4>In the past, much development in Oman has focused on luxury accommodation and activities. Is there a strong case for more mid-market projects?</h4><p>Our aim is to accommodate all tourists in a smart and creative manner, ensuring that all hotels are crafted with an authentic ambiance. Atana Hotels are a perfect example of this; the local hotel chain has a range of three- and four-star properties that reflect the values and culture of the Sultanate. A number of rest houses run by local Omani families, like Misfah Old House at the village of Misfat Al Abryeen, are situated close to key attractions, such as the Al Hoota Cave, and promoted by Omran. Originally traditional homes, they have been transformed to accommodate travelers and provide unparalleled cultural experiences. Also, as Oman gains traction as a central hub for business events in the region, a number of well-known, international hotel brands will open within Madinat Al Irfan and the OCEC precinct, including the Crowne Plaza and JW Marriot hotels, providing more options for business travelers.</p><h4>Salalah in Dhofar is a growing destination. Where are other locations of interest?</h4><p>Measuring market trends and pinpointing upcoming areas is a key component of each of our projects. It is great to see areas, such as Salalah in Dhofar, recognized for its natural beauty and unique offerings. One of our key milestones in 2016 was opening the Anantara Al Baleed Resort in Salalah, in partnership with our local partner “Musstir,“ one of the leading real estate development and investment firms in the country, as well as adding the Crowne Plaza Salalah to Omran's hospitality portfolio. The Ras Al Hadd Development, which held its groundbreaking last year, is being developed in partnership with the real estate investment company, Qatari Diar. Due for completion by end of 2019, the eco-themed development will feature a number of unique tourist attractions, hotels, residential units, natural parks, a heritage village, and souk, which will celebrate the rich history of Omani culture surrounding Ras Al-Hadd. This eco-friendly development makes a significant contribution toward maintaining the continued growth in the tourism sector and provides many opportunities for SMEs in Oman.</p><h4>How will Omran continue to work in developing urban communities?</h4><p>As well as Mina Al Sultan Qaboos Waterfront, we have a number of projects currently under construction including three hotels in Muscat (W Hotel [five star], JW Marriott at OCEC [five star], Crowne Plaza at OCEC [four star], and the completion of the Oman Convention and Exhibition Centre (OCEC). The OCEC is part of the first phase of development of the broader Madinat Al Irfan Urban Development Center. Establishing a new urban center within the heart of Muscat, Madinat Al Irfan will create a new world-class central district that will increase Muscat's international offering, with a financial district, residential, commercial, retail, recreational, and tourist facilities. Through public-private partnerships, the project will offer investors a unique opportunity to partner with the government to realize capital gains, significant inbound revenues, and increased capital retention within the local economy. The flagship project reflects the government strategy in harnessing Oman's tourism potential to help diversify the economy, while creating sustainable jobs for citizens, a significant stimulus for the growing SME sector, and a catalyst for the regeneration of Muscat that creates a positive social impact on generations to come.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>For 2017, we are focusing our efforts on the progress of Madinat Al Irfan development. One of the key components of the development is the Oman Convention and Exhibition Centre, which we are currently working on the launch of the next phase. This includes the four-star Crowne Plaza and the five star JW Marriott hotels, to be completed this year along with the Convention Centre and the 3,200-seat auditorium, along with 22,000sqm of exhibition space, and more than 55 different meeting space options. Tourism, and particularly business tourism, is expected to increase significantly in Oman throughout 2017 and beyond. The WTTC stated that Oman is the fastest-growing tourism destination in the Middle East, and with the new Muscat International Airport to be completed and open for an increasing number of international flights by the end of the year, we will have better access to over half of the world's population. We intend to capitalize on the increased flights by creating innovative communities, designed to create memorable and enjoyable experience for visitors to Oman.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the performance of Cushman &amp; Wakefield/AB Advisory over its six years in Costa Rica, and what strategy are you following to maintain such results?</h4><p>My partner was initially based in Mexico City, then about six years ago he moved here and saw some opportunities for the company, though he did not necessarily start developing a fully operational office. Approximately two years ago, I joined the company as Managing Director and partner of the Cushman &amp; Wakefield alliance to develop a full service office here, which includes our brokerage services, investment sales, project management, and facilities management, as well as valuation and consulting. We are the only fully operational commercial real estate office within Central America. We have a team of approximately 25 people and are number one in terms of revenue and market share.</p><h4>In 2016, the company plans to open an office in Panama. Can you describe your plans for expansion and your five-year investment?</h4><p>We are covering projects in Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, and will realize some other projects in Guatemala, though this is not yet active. Those markets are not yet large enough to support a formal office. It is easy for us to take day trips to support our operations. When we partnered, the board of directors asked me to prepare a five-year business plan with a corresponding investment plan. That five-year plan essentially outlined and indicated the way that we want to expand the business over the coming five years in terms of geography and service lines.</p><h4>What are the challenges and opportunities presented by doing business here in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Of the negative things that are said about Costa Rica, infrastructure and bureaucracy are the two most clearly recognized challenges. Bureaucracy is more of an issue, as infrastructure, though it was lacking for several decades, is a relatively easier problem to solve through adequate investment plans. We need a structural reform to truly solve our problems from the roots; however, I do not see that happening in the next 10 to 20 years. On the bureaucracy side, we can do some things to improve the situation, but we cannot change it at the root. The size of the economy may be an issue sometimes, as some of our larger clients thinking about bigger investment projects in the medium to long term are investing millions of dollars in small countries. The Costa Rican workforce is one of the most educated and hardworking workforces in the region, which is a huge asset to have. In addition to that, the culture of the people here is quite open to American culture, European culture, and other Latin American cultures. We do not have the cultural barriers that are found in other areas of Latin America.</p><h4>What are your expectations and goals and priorities for 2017?</h4><p>Our main goal is to be well positioned as the leading commercial real estate firm in Central America; that is our first and foremost objective. Our clients also say that we are the leader in the region, which is our clear target. In 2016, we have completed eight major private bid processes with our competitors in Costa Rica, and we have won all eight. We just want to keep on that track and work as hard as needed to do so. That is our culture; we work hard and play hard. We want to go the extra mile not on paper, but in reality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>During your official trip to the Kingdom last month, the Serbian delegation proactively met with HRH King Salman Bin Abdulaziz, the Council of Saudi Chambers, the Saudi Fund for Development, the General Commission for Tourism and National Heritage, and various ministries. What did you take from your most recent visit to Riyadh, and do you hope it will contribute to a new era in Serbia-Saudi relations?</h4><p>Our visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was crowned by the meeting with H.R.H. King Salman, with whom the possibility for Saudi Arabia to finance a joint infrastructure project between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina was discussed. Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina will  come up with a concrete proposal of what kind of project it is going to be in order to jointly apply to the Saudi Fund for Development which offers great opportunities for obtaining the funding needed for the project. We also agreed to form a Joint Trilateral Committee which will deal with the creation and monitoring of joint activities related to increasing trade and the implementation of Saudi investments in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the area of agriculture we agreed to organize a joint fair in Riyadh, where Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina will present their agricultural and food products as well as other potential products for the sector. Construction companies from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were invited to participate in tenders in KSA, since the construction of more than 1.5 million housing units is expected there over the next seven years. Furthermore, an excellent business forum was held during this visit, organized by the Council of Saudi Chambers, which brought together more than 30 companies from three countries. In addition, a visit for tour operators from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in April this year was agreed with the host, H.R.H. Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, President of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage, during which the tourist potential of the two countries will be presented to the Saudi Arabian market.</p><h4>With trade ties between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Serbia standing at a modest USD31 million for the previous year, which economic areas of cooperation will you look to strengthen in the years ahead?</h4><p>Although the volume of bilateral trade exchange between the Republic of Serbia and KSA is still very modest and much below its real potential, it should be noted that during the past few years it has been constantly increasing, and that in 2015 it reached USD54.3 million, which is twice what it was in 2014. That year, due to a sudden increase in exports from Serbia (an increase of 493.2% compared to 2014), a trade surplus was recorded for the first time on our side. The growth trend continued last year, in 2016, with the total exchange reaching USD97.9 million which is an increase of 79.6% compared with 2015. For us this is a great result, especially bearing in mind that our exports have increased by 30 in the past five years, from a modest USD1.3 million in 2011 to USD31.1 million in 2015. In 2016, our exports also continued to grow, reaching USD72.3 million, increasing by 132.4% as compared to 2015. Serbia is very interested in the improvement of overall economic relations with KSA. By maintaining the continuity of the established direct contacts at a state level with KSA, being one of the most influential economic leaders of the Arab and Islamic world, and bearing in mind the needs and plans for comprehensive development of the country on one hand, and the potential and interests of our country on the other, there are numerous possibilities for establishing cooperation in areas that are mutually identified as promising: trade, agriculture, tourism, health and education, participation in infrastructure projects, and military-economic cooperation.</p><h4>In recent years, Serbia has been forging an ambitious, sector-wide foreign policy in the Middle East, especially with the UAE. What is behind this strategy and what is your vision for Serbia's cooperation with the region going forward?</h4><p>The United Arab Emirates is the first Middle Eastern country that has recognized Serbia as a new economic partner and an excellent investment destination in the region of the Western Balkans. Good political relations are accompanied by improving economic cooperation, both in the field of investments and in the field of trade exchange: UAE is an important investment partner of Serbia, especially in the field of air transport (the national airline “Air Serbia" was formed by the agreement on strategic partnership between the Government of Serbia and company “Etihad"), agro-industry (UAE companies “Al Ravafed" and “Al Dahra" are already present as investors on the Serbian market) and construction (UAE company “Eagle Hills" has started the realization of the project “Belgrade waterfront"); bilateral trade exchange has increased several times in the past five years, from a modest USD30.1 million in 2012 to USD122.3 million in 2016. The contractual and legal framework of cooperation has been established between the two countries, giving an additional impulse for the further improvement of overall bilateral and particularly economic relations. The President of Republic of Serbia H.E. Tomislav NikoliÄ‡ paid an official visit to State of Qatar in November last year. On that occasion, very important agreements were signed between the two governments, regulating the area of economic relations: on economic, trade and technical cooperation, on mutual enhancement and protection of investments and on cooperation in the field of agriculture, as well as the agreements on cooperation in the field of culture and youth and sport. During this visit we discussed the possibilities of cooperation between Serbian and Qatari companies with the renowned “Qatar Investment Authority" (QIA), and an official invitation has been made to their senior representatives to pay a visit to Serbia during this year in order to discuss concrete possibilities for the enhancement of bilateral economic cooperation with Serbian counterparts, especially in the areas of agriculture, energy, ICT, health, and tourism. The work on building contractual and legal framework of economic cooperation with KSA has started immediately after the establishment of diplomatic relations in 2013. The first agreement between two states, on cooperation in the field of tourism has been  was signed in  Belgrade in 2015 during the visit of H.R.H. Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, President of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage. The agreements on economic and technical cooperation and on mutual enhancement and protection of investments are currently in the process of negotiation, as well as the Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in the field of ICT.  Once completed, they will open a vast area for improving bilateral economic relations, currently taking place exclusively through the trade exchange ( in the last five years, from a modest USD8.7 million in 2012, the exchange has increased to as much as USD97.9 million in 2016 ) while maintaining direct bilateral contacts between the two countries at the highest level. We are very interested in seeing KSA becoming a significant economic partner to Serbia, since obtaining the deals in this country would have a major impact on our presence in other economically important countries in the Gulf. This would also allow us to expand regionally and in Europe, but also at a wider international level. One of the visible results of this approach has been a significant improvement in relations with the countries of the Middle East.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What benefits have recent upgrades brought to the Qatar Stock Exchange?</h4><p>We had two significant upgrades from the global index benchmark providers MSCI and FTSE. The upgrade to emerging market status brings significant benefits to the market including companies, brokers, and investors. We are effectively the largest emerging market in the MENA region as per MSCI and FTSE. We saw capital inflow of more than USD2 billion as a result of these two upgrades. It has also opened up the Qatari market to a number of long-term global institutional investors like pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and large emerging market passive investors. Our listed companies now have access to a global institutional investor base that will facilitate them in further capital raising should they wish to increase their capital in the future. I would say that we still haven't completely realized the full potential of becoming an emerging market given all of the uncertainty surrounding us—the wars in Syria, Yemen, and the declining oil prices. But in short, the upgrades have really served to bolster our key measures.</p><h4>How is the Qatar Stock Exchange working to provide a diversified range of investment and trading opportunities?</h4><p>Our strategy is to provide a platform to our customers where they can trade multiple asset classes with varying trading strategies. We have been working on a number of things to improve the investment environment and to support our global investors. We are developing new tools and introducing them into the market. For example, in the past year we have introduced the LP, which is the liquidity provision. We also introduced margin trading and are planning to list ETFs in the first quarter of 2017. There are few things that still need to be implemented, like regulated covered short-selling, securities lending and borrowing, and omnibus accounts. We are trying to provide our investors with all of these tools. One of our achievements last year was that we managed to list Qatar First Bank. We are also working with a number of family-owned companies to bring them to the market. There are a few in the pipeline with potentially two IPOs in the first quarter of 2017.</p><h4>How is the Qatar Stock Exchange supporting SME development?</h4><p>We recognize the importance of SMEs and their contribution to the market and to GDP. Most of these companies are family-owned companies that are trying to grow, and their growth potential is much faster than other sectors. Therefore it is important to provide them with financing opportunities and the ability to access business and sector expertise. The Qatar Stock Exchange offers all of these opportunities to SMEs. There is also an opportunity for SMEs to network with potential foreign partners through the stock exchange. Most of the employment in Qatar comes from these SMEs and we are therefore trying to assist them in as many ways as we can. SMEs often play an integral role in the smooth operation of some of Qatar's largest companies, and we are therefore highly focused on ensuring these businesses are given the opportunity to thrive.</p><h4>What drives the creation of new products like the capital markets for SMEs and the new ETFs you have unveiled?</h4><p>The idea is to provide our customers tools to diversify their portfolios via investment opportunities at QSE. We are working on SMEs, equity, and commodity ETFs, Real Estate Investment Traded Funds (REITs) and other tools like covered-short selling and securities lending and borrowing to unlock the liquidity and allow it to flow into different asset classes. We are working within the framework of Qatar National Vision 2030, and this is the guiding light for many of our initiatives. We are trying to create a modern economy, and that means the QSE needs to facilitate a vibrant efficient financial market in Qatar. We understand what the market needs to achieve this development and we are trying to facilitate its transformation in every way. Our expertise in capital markets also directs our program and product development.</p><h4>What activities and programs does the Qatar Stock Exchange have for promoting investment awareness in Qatar?</h4><p>We have a number of education programs directed at public and private high schools and universities that promote market awareness. For the last two months we have also been holding seminars with brokers and other stock exchange participants to teach them about the new ETFs and how they work. We have programs with most Qatari universities. We have a program with some of our university partners whereby we hold weekly public information sessions aimed at teaching them about markets and investments. Over the course of the year, more than 2,000 people attended these seminars. We want to make sure that we have educated investors who are fully aware of the machinations of the market and the available investment tools and technical analysis techniques.</p><h4>What effects will potential US Federal Reserve rates increases have on the Qatar Stock Exchange?</h4><p>An increase in rates will give investors across the globe more options, and an increase will influence every aspect of the global economy—currencies, oil prices, everything. However, given the strength of the Qatari market, the stock exchange offers enticing yields for investors, and it will continue to draw international investors.</p><h4>What is the goal behind the Qatar Stock Exchange's Investor Relations Excellence Award Program?</h4><p>The program is important to improve investor confidence. We have found that investors are more willing to invest in firms that are accessible and open. They prefer companies with strong transparency whose management teams are welcoming. This award aims to stimulate this sort of openness by generating a sort of transparency competition among Qatari firms. Simultaneously it is aimed at increasing awareness. We are trying to encourage companies to have IR departments, and we are trying to show them the importance of courting investors.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the next 12 months?</h4><p>I am looking forward to the coming year because we will be unveiling new products like the ETFs, and we will be taking at least two family-owned companies public. I expect to see more family-owned companies approaching the exchange and asking about the process for going public, and I hope to be able to assist as many companies as possible in this. Next year will be a good year for the Qatar Stock Exchange. We hope to see an increase in oil prices as well, which will serve to boost both the sector and our business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>NATPET began as a distinguished producer with some key advantages in the sector. What is the background to your growth and diversification?</h4><p>We specialize in the production of polypropylene. We chose this particular polymer product because there is high demand for it around the world—close to 62 million tons per year. Additionally, annual growth in demand is around 4%, or an additional 2.5 million tons per annum. This product goes into industries like car manufacturing, construction, packaging, food packaging, health and home appliances, and so on. It is a versatile product that is in high demand. Although NATPET was only commercially operational toward mid of 2010, we decided to go further downstream almost immediately—a sound strategy for a number of reasons. We no longer depend solely on a commodity product that would leave us open to price fluctuations caused by macroeconomic shifts.  For instance, our first joint venture is with a British listed company, Low and Bonar. Our product is geotextiles that primarily go into infrastructure projects like roads, rail, buildings, airports and seaports, etc. We also went into partnership with an American company A. Schulman, a significant player in the field of polypropylene compounding. The process makes our product useable in many different applications such as cars, home appliances, and more. This project is underway and will be operational by 3Q2017. The other reason we went to downstream is also to meet the government's objective of diversification of income, add value and have more employment opportunities for Saudi nationals. Additionally, we recently invested USD15 million in an American company, Siluria Technologies, which is working on new technologies to produce petrochemicals. For a company of our size and a limited history of seven years, this is a major step forward. It shows that we are thinking of the future and taking early steps to benefit from the technological developments happening in our field.</p><h4>Chinese consumption has slowed in recently months. Has that trend or other macroeconomic changes affected your business?</h4><p>We sell on average in 70 countries per year. That protects us from any economic issues with one specific country, like China, or region, like Europe. However, we are not fully protected; when China sneezes everybody gets a cold, and when it started to have problems last year with a lower GDP growth, the effect on us and everybody else was clear. Less demand in the Chinese market means products will be diverted into other market, reducing everybody's margins. We have all seen that the world is not only volatile in geopolitics, but also in economics. Europe has very low GDP growth, China's growth is lower than earlier years, and lots of emerging markets are facing problems as well.</p><h4>As a company, you have succeeded in diversifying your products, as have other petrochemical firms. Is there significant momentum for investment downstream?</h4><p>The government's objectives to significantly increase the industrial sector contribution of GDP, more employment in the industry, and increase volume of exports from Saudi Arabia are all going to be extremely difficult. The petrochemicals contribution to the industrial GDP in Saudi Arabia is about 33%. Add to that the many downstream convertors that take the material from the petrochemical plants in Saudi Arabia and convert it to downstream products. So this makes the petrochemical industry a significant contributor to the industrial GDP, also the petrochemical sector constitute the majority of Saudi non-oil exports. We employ around 35,000 employees, 70% of them are Saudis with another 110,000 indirect jobs and these jobs are highly paid with managers, engineers, skilled workers, and more. And their income is way above the average pay in all other sectors. The world is changing and fast, and today Saudi petrochemicals face serious threats and challenges, among them: potential production of shale gas in the US with very competitive feedstock costs; high logistics cost to transport our products world-wide; increasing protectionist measures by most countries/regions, with Saudi products facing very high customs duties; he petrochemical industry facing an increase in feedstock prices in 2016 and this coupled with the above challenges and many more, will lead to lower or no investment in this industry in the country. This will negatively and greatly affect the country's efforts to employ more skilled and educated Saudis and will not help in increasing Saudi non-oil exports as the government is planning.</p><h4>What is your outlook for next year, and what are your plans?</h4><p>We have invested in two downstream ventures; we have invested in an American company for new technologies and are looking for other ideas. We are finding it difficult to invest in local expansion or new petrochemical projects due to the above reasons. Our Saudization rate is 60%, which is excellent for a company like ours. We are also engaged in social programs, and have won the King Khalid Foundation award four times. We are proud of what we do for society.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your current service portfolio offering, and which services have the biggest demand in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We are a full-service Dominican law firm. Our services include, among others, corporate law, real estate law, intellectual property, international business and commerce, litigation and alternate dispute resolution, labor and employment law, and immigration. We serve a wide range of clients in different industries such as consumer products, real estate, advertising and media, banking and insurance, industrial manufacturing, and oil and related products.</p><h4>How does Esquea &amp; Valenzuela stand out from its competitors?<br></h4><p>We are the oldest non-family-owned law partnership in the Dominican Republic. The experience of our senior partners is an important differentiator: our members have held relevant positions in public office and the judicial branch, having worked as ambassadors, official representatives of the country at international congresses and organizations, legislators, directors of government entities, and justices. Furthermore, we have an unleveraged firm structure that allows for a more intimate attorney-client interaction. This, coupled with the firm's perfect balance of senior and junior partners, permits us to provide the client with high quality and timely advice.</p><h4>What is the current state of legal security for foreign investors in the Dominican Republic, and what can be done to improve it?</h4><p>Legal security for foreign investors in the Dominican Republic (DR) is strong. The DR has a special Foreign Investment Law that recognizes foreign investment in its many tangible and intangible forms as well as its varied uses and destinations, establishes free capital mobility in inbound and outbound capital flow, and provides foreign investors with national treatment in all their investments. Moreover, the country is part of a considerable number of Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (IPPAs) and Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) with various countries such as Argentina, Korea, Chile, Ecuador, Spain, Finland, France, and others, which provide foreign investors with national and most-favored-nation treatment along with allowing for international arbitration for the settlement of disputes. In this regard, it is important to highlight that the Dominican congress ratified the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958.</p><h4>What main challenges do law firms face in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>An important challenge when assisting a foreign investment client is providing timely services when dealing with regulating entities. This is due to the way certain ministries and municipalities establish various procedures for granting the permits that some client activities require (municipal permits, construction permits, environmental, etc.) In many occasions the procedures hinder the firms' capacity to move the deal forward.</p><h4>What are Esquea &amp; Valenzuela's main objectives in the Dominican Republic for 2017 and how does it plan on achieving them?</h4><p>In 2017 we will continue to focus on adding value to our clients' business dealings as well as adding value to society through the further development of the legal and business profession. This we will achieve through our partners' contributions to the industry groups and organizations of which we are members and their time devoted to lecturing at our country's most prestigious universities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dominican-antitrust-law-is-coming-of-age]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The objective of the Dominican Antitrust Law is to guarantee the wellbeing of consumers and prevent companies already established in the Dominican market from limiting the entrance of new products or companies into the country.<br></p><p>To achieve its objective, the law makes effective competition a matter of public order and makes its dispositions applicable to all economic actors (domestic or foreign) that carry out activities in the national territory, or whose activities originate outside the country but impact it.</p><p>The law forbids: (i) concerted practices and anticompetitive agreements, such as price agreements and production limitation agreements; (ii) dominant position abuse; and (iii) disloyal competition.<br>To ensure full compliance with the law, the National Commission for the Defense of Competition (CNDC or Pro-Competition) was created. This organism, which has jurisdiction to administratively be informed of claims and controversies that arise on the occasion of the application of the law, has the purpose of promoting the prevalence of effective competition.</p><p>For the provision of this guarantee, the CNDC can recommend initiatives that promote the simplification of administrative formalities, especially when regulating entities and municipal authorities in the fulfillment of their duties, and identify obstacles or undue interferences to individuals that may block their right to free enterprise and competition. In turn, administrative actions of the remaining market regulatory entities that dictate regulations or resolve sanctioning administrative purposes must be forwarded to the CNDC for review.<br>An important faculty of the CNDC is its sanctioning capacity. The CNDC can impose fees of up to the equivalent of 3,000 times the minimum wage of the economic sector in question through the commission on agreements and practices against free competition and the abuse of dominant position.</p><p>However, the CNDC has precarious time restraints in which to do its job; it only has 30 business days to carry out its investigation once a complaint has been received. If the given period of time is exceeded without ruling on its origin, the complaint is considered unfair, which implies that a meritorious complaint could be declared unfair by the lack of time to carry out an adequate preliminary investigation.</p><p>Equally, the maximum duration for the CNDC's sanctioning procedure phase is 12 days, counted since the formal beginning of this period until the case is transferred to the Directive Council for its resolution. When this term expires, it will proceed ex officio or at the request of any interested party to be declared expired.<br>Entry into force of this law constitutes an important challenge, not only for the CNDC but to market participants as well. The CNDC has ordered many investigations of various sectors of the national economy and the findings indicate that there has been abuse of dominant positions by economic agents; that the dispositions of a regulatory entity have constituted a severe restriction to market competition that the given entity regulates; and that the structure of the distribution channels and existence of vertical restrictions (exclusive dealing) in certain markets could constitute obstacles to new companies, among others.<br>These findings should not be taken as a negative representation of Dominican economic activity. Rather, they represent the health of the country's legislative and commercial practices and processes and the desire to comply with the standards followed by other business partners.</p><p>Moving forward, commerce and the law in the Dominican Republic are even more related to each other, and economic agents need legal teams whose orientation and advice allow them to continue developing their businesses without participating in anti-competitive practices. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-cut-above-the-rest]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is JW Marriott's customer attraction strategy in the Dominican Republic, and what new services are helping the hotel improve its regional and global reputation?</h4><p>The JW Santo Domingo is a luxury hotel and brand leader in the eyes of its guests. These same loyal guests acknowledge the JW Santo Domingo as the best JW in the world in overall satisfaction and are keen to recommend it. The attention we pay to guests is what we pride ourselves on and is what distinguishes us from the rest. We provide a service crafted to anticipate each client's needs and exceed their expectations at every interaction. This is what we call the JW treatment and remains the focal point of our strategy. In 2016 the JW Santo Domingo became the proud recipient of the World Luxury Hotel Award for the Best Luxury City Hotel in the Americas. At the beginning of 2017 we received the AAA 4 Diamond award for the third consecutive year. We also won TripAdvisor's 2017 Travelers Choice Award for the best Hotel Service in the Caribbean for the second consecutive year, in addition to being named the third Best Hotel in the Caribbean. </p><h4>What challenges are hotels facing in the Dominican Republic and what can be done to meet them? </h4><p>A constant challenge is selling Santo Domingo as a destination within the leisure segment, as most people associate the DR as a resort and beach destination. The new road connecting the capital to resorts in Punta Cana and Cap Cana has greatly reduced the transfer time, but more awareness must be made about what Santo Domingo has to offer, particularly for those seeking leisure and culture. To this end, the JW Marriott Santo Domingo has been positioned predominantly as a corporate hotel in the business district of the capital that offers guests a central location for work, rest, and adventure depending on their mood.</p><h4>What are JW Marriott's main objectives in the Dominican Republic for 2017 and how do you plan on achieving them?</h4><p>As success is never final, it is our constant goal to remain the market leader by offering a unique and exclusive discovery. The JW Santo Domingo's privileged location offers stunning views and features the Vertygo 101 Lounge &amp; Bar, with its one of a kind glass deck perched 101 feet above the main avenue below and overlooking the city skyline. Beckoning guests and locals alike, it is ideal for enjoying a handcrafted cocktail prepared by our expert mixologists and a great place to socialize or simply unwind. The hotel's signature restaurant Winston's Grill &amp; Patio is in the hands of our award-winning chef, Alberto Martin, considered one of the best in the Dominican Republic. Alberto and his team offers a gastronomic adventure by way of his seasonal tasting menu, complemented with an excellent selection of wines. The luxurious marble-draped main lobby is the backdrop for the hotel's own original art collection. Our property is located in the sophisticated area of Piantini, the heart of the capital's business, entertainment, and shopping district. Positioned over the exclusive Blue Mall, it gives our guests another world to explore by way of high-end shopping with brands such as Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Rolex, and Cartier. There is no reason for guests to leave, but with the old town and museums a few minutes away, the cultural aspect of their trip is also complete. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the impact of DGCINE on the Dominican economy?</h4><p>DGCINE has evolved as a result of the film boom that took place in the Dominican Republic five or six years ago. The growth of the industry made it necessary to create an agency that would oversee its operation, which is how this office came into existence. The first film commissioner, my predecessor Ellis Pérez, did a wonderful job, and it is my responsibility to continue promoting the growth of this industry. It is important to keep in mind that film in the Dominican Republic was an informal industry and was neither taxed nor taken into consideration by the legal system. It was rather challenging to have an active film industry without the incentives we have today, but DGCINE is here to ensure the law is used to make certain it prevails.</p><h4>What is the main driver of growth in the industry in the last one year? </h4><p>The industry experienced significant growth over the course of 2015 and 2016, thanks to the security of the Dominican Republic. In the five years, it took us to build the DGCINE and strengthen the national industry, we have made the Dominican Republic a prime filming location for a number of international film giants. This growth took place thanks to films such as “xXx: Return of Xander Cage." Vin Diesel is a great advocate for the Dominican Republic, and it was important for him to have a film produced here. The film received production services from Pinewood Canada in conjunction with Pinewood Dominican Republic, a local branch of the international film giant, which was a major factor in establishing a strong film industry in our country. In 2016, Dominican Republic also served as a filming location for the Netflix film “True Memoirs of an International Assassin" starring Kevin James. We must also acknowledge all the reality shows that are filmed in our country each day; we have “Survivor Turkey," “Survivor Greece," and MTV's “Are You the One" for the US and Latin America. </p><h4>What opportunities will DGCINE have in the Dominican Republic in 2017? </h4><p>I recently had lunch with Andrew Davis, director of “The Fugitive." He has a wonderful project that he is pushing to be filmed here, as is the case with Andy Garcia and the Hemingway film he wants to make, to name just a few. All in all, we have great expectations for this year. We have ongoing projects not only with filmmakers in the US and Canada, but also in the UK, France, and Germany. We are growing quick and steadily and are optimistic for 2017.</p><h4>How do you attract investors and those interested in making movies in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We are the leading economy in the Caribbean and are right in the middle of the world. It also helps a lot that basically everybody here speaks English. We have the manpower and some of the most beautiful tropical natural locations in the world, as well as studios and a state-of-the-art world-class water tank. There is a lot going for us at this point.</p><h4>What challenges have you had to surpass to get to where you are today? </h4><p>We have had an industry since 1922, but only 106 films had been made until the Film Bill. We have since exceeded those numbers and made 125 films in only five years. This is thanks to the filming incentives provided in the Film Bill. Everyone needs to be registered here at the film commission in order to be granted permission to engage in any filming activities. We currently have approximately 3-4,000 registrations, which is a huge number considering how recent the law is. Then, there are the services, catering, transportation, and other industries that enter the market that also have to be registered. Every international star or crew that enters the country needs to be signed up for statistical reasons. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the local insurance market evolved in the last few years and how has ARS Palic adapted to that?</h4><p>The sector is growing quickly, due to the fact that the country's social insurance system is still relatively young. It was only set up eight years ago covering around 500,000 people. Today, 67% of the population—6.7 million people—is covered. One of the main challenges we faced was adapting to a fast growing and changing sector. We always predict and adapt to the increasing number of affiliates and medical services provided and covered by the system. We have put a great deal of effort into being ready to capture these changes from a human resources and technological point of view. Our target was always to grow faster than the sector, which we have achieved year after year.</p><h4>How has technology transformed the way ARS Palic does business?</h4><p>Technology has been one of the leading drivers behind ARS Palic's growth and expansion. We believe technology has a vital role to play in different spheres of our daily activity and interaction with customers. We were the first insurance company with our own native app and the first with a digital transactional system for service providers and intermediaries. Internally, we have implemented CMR software with Salesforce to manage relationships with our customers. New technologies enable us to provide high-quality services to our more than 800,000 affiliates. We always bear in mind in our strategy that we live in an increasingly demanding and ever-growing world in terms of technology. All in all, better technology makes us more competitive.</p><h4>What are some main challenges the country faces in expanding coverage among the population?</h4><p>In order to expand social security coverage to a larger portion of the population, we need to tackle the informal economy in which half the population is engaged in. We also need to keep in mind that not everybody within that group can contribute to the system and some might need subsidies. We need to better understand their situation. This will be one of the main topics of discussion in the near future as we start discussing the fine details of legal and labor reforms in the country. We need to find the tools and strategies to reduce informality in our economy, encourage these micro entrepreneurs and SMEs to regularize their situation, and help people subscribe to the social security system independently. Health insurance is a great way to start reducing the informal economy before moving on to things like pensions and other insurance products.</p><h4>What do you see the insurance sector looking like in five years' time?</h4><p>We need to tackle the challenge of independent workers as well as micro and other small enterprises as quickly as possible. Once we do so, the sector will open the door for many growth opportunities. We should also see fewer industry players in five years, which will lead to a further concentration of providers and more advancement in treatment methods as well as technologies. I also foresee changes in the provision of services and access to service models. Today, we have a completely open model where anyone can go anywhere. This is not economically sustainable in the long run. Nonetheless, I see more people being covered by a higher quality of services in the years to come. </p><h4>What are ARS Palic's goals for 2017?</h4><p>We want to consolidate our growth above the market rate and do so in a sustainable and socially responsible way. We have been certified by A Great Place to Work Institute as one of the top companies in the Caribbean and are committed to offering the best environment to our employees. We want to continue our technological transformation and maximize the possibilities of our CRM platform. We foresee more technological changes related to risk management in order to better prevent chronic diseases, which is one of the key health challenges in the world right now. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[healthy-concerns]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the major health concerns regarding massive flooding in the northern part of the country, and what has been the ministry's response?</h4><p>When floods occur, disease and health issues can increase. There is the deterioration and/or contamination of water supply systems in various locations, which interrupts supply. This increases the chances of contracting acute diarrhea, cholera, malaria, and leptospirosis for example, or the reproduction of the Aedes aegypti, known for transmitting dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. In these cases, the Ministry of Health, in coordination with the National Health Service (SNS) and the service network, develop a series of actions to guarantee prevention and control of these events with epidemic potential. Some of the actions that we help implement are the strengthening of epidemiological surveillance and monitoring of environmental risks, intensification of disease outbreak surveillance, development of actions to guarantee water potability, activation of the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Group (GASH), intensifying the risk-communication strategy, development of home visits in affected areas, diffusion of educational messages through mass media outlets, coordination with the Emergency Operations Center (COE), coordination between the DPS/DAS, regional health services, and establishments to treat people in need, among many others.</p><h4>What is the current progress with some of the other UN Sustainable Development Goals related to health?</h4><p>With regards to transmittable diseases, the Dominican Republic is advancing; in 2016, 6,645 probable cases of dengue were notified, with a 61% decrease in cumulative incidence compared to 2015 when 17,051 cases were notified. One year after the Zika epidemic started, levels of reported cases lowered until the end of the epidemic in 2016. In the last four weeks of 2016, the levels of acute diarrhea were stable and leptospirosis cases caused by flooding in the north are showing a decreasing tendency. Furthermore, there were no cases of human rabies, poliomyelitis, measles, or rubella, and there was a significate reduction in whooping cough cases.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the wage-increase agreement signed with the Dominican Medical Association?</h4><p>There will be a huge, positive impact in the quality and quantity of services offered to the population, especially for citizens who use the Public Network, as well as a significate improvement in the quality of life of health workers. The agreement impacts seven of the main axis on which an efficient health system should work on. In few words, the agreement looks to develop an integral attention model, create conditions that allow the system to overcome the deficit of qualified human capital in less favored communities, have an autonomous Single Network of Public Services capable of offering efficient attention, innovate to surpass health insurance deficiencies, develop a wage policy that surpasses imbalances, recognizes merits, and stimulates good performances. The agreement will increase base salary and variable salary by 25% and incentive payment by 60%, per geographical location, performance, antiquity or years of service, and recertification. In addition, a single salary was consolidated for doctors or health personnel that worked in the two institutions of the public system, after unifying hospitals in a single network directed by the SNS. Finally, the agreement includes pension with full salary for all health personnel.</p><h4>What are the main priorities for the Ministry of Health during the current administration?</h4><p>Our main priorities as Ministry of Health are the reduction of maternal mortality from 106 to 70 per every 100,000 live births; the reduction of the mortality of children under five years from 27 to 18 per every 1,000 live births; the reduction of the mortality of children under one year from 23 to 16 per every 1,000 live births; the reduction of teenage pregnancy by 20%; the reduction of mortality associated with dengue by 20%; the reduction of premature mortality by transmittable diseases by 20%; the reduction of cancer-related mortality by 20%; the reduction of mortality associated with accidents by 25%, or 41.7 for every 100,000 habitants; the reduction of morbidity and mortality caused by HIV in vulnerable groups; and the reduction of family health expenditure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Milking The Land]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[milking-the-land]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Grupo Rica respond to the pressures facing milk producers around the country?</h4><p>Since I started working at the company in 1989 here at Grupo Rica, we have had four main pillars to our philosophy. We want to be a company that you can trust, a company that is close to the customer, a company that is socially responsible, and, of course, a company that is innovative. Grupo Rica buys most of the milk in the Dominican Republic and offers farmers ways to improve quality. One constraint for farmers is producing feed. Feed production is challenging in this type of weather; therefore, we need to find the correct type of grass for this area, one that has enough protein and other nutritionally important components. Another issue is the competition coming from other countries like the US, which provides USD4.5 billion in incentives to farmers every year. The US produces 100 billion liters a year, which means USD0.045 in incentives per liter. Right now, the Dominican Republic needs 1.3 million liters of milk a day and is producing 60% of that. We should be able to produce better milk at higher quantities. </p><h4>What types of technology have been crucial to transforming milk production? </h4><p>In the 1980s, we had many energy shortages and could not refrigerate fluid milk like in the US, and roughly 80% of the market was powder. Tetra technology completely changed the landscape because it meant we could provide milk and it could maintain its quality without refrigeration. It was transformational in terms of distribution as well. Companies could purchase large quantities of milk that lasted six months and let it sit for a week until they had to distribute it. That allows the possibility not only of distributing but also exporting. </p><h4>How is consumer demand currently changing in the Dominican market?</h4><p>The Dominican market is becoming like any other sophisticated market. It is a market where 60% are below 30, it is a population that is demanding. It is a population where companies need to adapt to consistently because consumers keep changing their needs and behavior. It is a market where there are households where everybody works. They need things that are on-the-go and ready to consume, which the main trend that we see. They seek things that satisfy their lifestyle needs. For example, if they exercise they do not want a product that makes them fat but that complements their exercise. In a segmented market, it is key to also having our distribution segmented in response to these changing demands.</p><h4>What are your expectations for growth in 2017?</h4><p>2017 will be a good year; the country will grow between 6 and 7%. The government will have to do some adjustments in fiscal policy, and we will make some adjustments. We will be going full speed ahead in 2017 and have a lot of investments planned for logistics and capacity. We are in the process of installing two new machines and starting a new coconut water line. We are hopeful of this new venture as well. We have people knocking on our doors, so hopefully we have the right price and can sell a large amount of coconut water in the US and in Central America. We have to incorporate several new markets in the Caribbean and the States. We have new products planned for export to Europe. This is part of a five-year strategic plan in which we want to come close to doubling our sales. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[developing-organically]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	How does Grupo CONACADO contribute to the Dominican economy, specifically through its interaction with small, local producers?
</h4><p>
	CONACADO was founded in 1985 when small, medium, and even large producers were abandoning the cultivation of cocoa due to the unprofitability of the sector. With the assistance of the German Agency for International Cooperation, we decided to promote the improvement of the quality of the cocoa produced here. At the time, our cocoa was only exported to the US, where it was treated as a low-quality product. We decided to organize the producers into groups and educated them in the management of the product as a means of preserving and enhancing the quality and provided them with tools and logistical capacity. After much effort, the world began recognizing the potential of Dominican cocoa. We started in Europe, where high-quality cocoa was best appreciated and after a few years we managed to penetrate other markets on a global scale. Further international exposure came with the realization that most of our national cocoa producers did not treat the crops with industrial insecticides or chemicals, which gave our product even more value. We penetrated the international market at a time when organic cocoa was not common and created a niche for organic cocoa and our country remains number one today. We export around 17,000 tons per year, and 80% is certified as organic, fair trade cocoa.</p><h4>How have your production numbers changed in the past few years?</h4><p>
	Our associates are mostly small local farmers, and productivity rests at about 400kg per hectare, or 50lbs per load. This can be considered low productivity in relation to our potential; every hectare can yield up to 2,000kg compared to the approximately 400kg produced today. We must now move backwards in the production chain in order to improve this aspect of our productivity and have started an initiative to provide our associates with the technical assistance they need to sustainably maximize efficiency and improve our productivity without affecting quality. One of our farmers has gone from producing 400kg to almost 1,200 and we are expecting it to reach its potential in about two years.</p><h4>What measures has the Dominican government taken to promote the production of cocoa?</h4><p>
	The government has supported us in the past but there is no public policy as such directly dealing with the industry yet. We have proposed the implementation of measures that will protect not only our small local producers and associates, but also anyone wishing to invest in the sector hoping that they will find an adequate legal framework to protect their interests and continue investing. We are looking to become a low-risk investment to promote the sustainable growth of our industry. Our country needs to preserve the environment to sustain the production and export of cocoa. Since we promote organic farming, we inherently wish to protect the quality of our water supply, forest, and farmland.</p><h4>Who are your main competitors, and what are your expansion plans for 2017?</h4><p>
	We are investing in a plant that will be the most modern in the Caribbean region with a production capacity of 20,000 tons a year. We want the Dominican Republic to not only export the raw material but also diversify into other by-products of cocoa in order to make the national market more resistant to market fluctuations. We are brainstorming ways to increase production through projects made to create the “producer of the future." These projects are aimed at keeping rural youth interested in agricultural traditions such as cocoa farming and keeping the industry alive.</p><h4>What are the group's objectives for 2017?</h4><p>
	Our basic objectives are maintaining and improving our rate of growth, strengthening the technological aspects of the industry, creating the Dominican Institute for Organic Cocoa, and continuing to collaborate with our associates and the government to create the legal framework that our industry needs to ensure its competitiveness and sustainability. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Nestlé in the Dominican Republic changed since it got its start?</h4><p>2016 marked Nestlé's 150th anniversary and 2017 will mark the centenary of our products' presence in the Dominican Republic. Four decades ago, the government came to us to help develop the dairy sector and we focused specifically on helping farmers enhance the quality of their milk. This is something we did district by district and farm by farm. We provided loans, training, and technical support and, today, we buy milk on a daily basis from 1,100 farmers. Other companies have followed our path, which we are proud of. Secondly, our two local factory application groups research local tastes, which allows us to develop products specifically for Dominicans. One example is the Maggi Gallinita, which is powder bouillon, the first in the Dominican market. This is how we have adapted over the years, by developing alongside the local community and helping to create jobs in agriculture. </p><h4>What advantages of the Dominican Republic contribute toward the success of Nestlé?</h4><p>It started 100 years ago when there was a large demand for condensed milk, which was really a novelty at the time. The biggest factor is that Nestlé is well embraced locally. We did a survey and seven out of 10 people believe that Nestlé is a Dominican brand, which shows how well entrenched we are in the country. It is also well situated for us and allows us to have a small hub in the Caribbean, for example, from where we can export to Trinidad, Jamaica, and Cuba. This makes a huge difference—the historical presence, our local knowledge, and a burgeoning consumer base. </p><h4>Which products see the most growth and how do you see the Dominican market's demand changing in the next five years?</h4><p>The Dominican consumer is demanding. They are proud of their origins and what is produced here. At the same time, the Dominican consumer is modern and follows trends in the US and Europe, like lactose free, gluten-free, low cholesterol, and high-protein products. Therefore, we need to listen to them and adapt. Today, we rely essentially on three categories, which are dairy, infant nutrition, and culinary. The categories that are growing the most are coffee, particularly our newly launched Nescafe Dolce Gusto, Purina pet care products for cats and dogs, and Nestlé Professional, which are tailor-made products for hotels and restaurants. </p><h4>What do you see as the biggest future obstacles to food production and distribution in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Productivity has been improving since the CAFTA-DR agreement but at a slow pace, and this is something we continue to focus on and train farmers accordingly. One problem is the dry season; the hot weather makes the output of milk seasonal. There is nothing you can do to solve this issue 100%, but you can do things like give farmers more access to water through pumping and drilling. If producers can learn how to use water more efficiently, there are a lot of opportunities in the productivity of milk. One of the challenges is to have products produced on a larger scale and with higher quality, as they are in the US. It is going to be critical because agriculture is so important for the Dominican Republic. </p><h4>What are some of Nestlé Dominicana's projections for growth in the next five years?</h4><p>That the economy is growing between 5 and 7% is enormously helpful; therefore, we will likely see high, mid-to-high single-digit growth in 2017 and double-digit growth in 2018. For that to happen, the key priority must be to innovate and create shared value. We want the innovations to represent a minimum 15% of our sales; therefore, we are restructuring our innovation, marketing, and sales teams to accelerate insights coming from the market. There will be many new products coming out in the next few months. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Supporting Growth]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[supporting-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the ministry supported the improvement of agricultural technology in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>One of the most important projects is the expansion of greenhouses. In 2004, we had around 200,000sqm of greenhouse production; we have now increased that to 10 million sqm. The Dominican Republic has many advantages in terms of climate and microclimates that allow us to produce high-quality products throughout the entire year. In greenhouse production, we have had specific issues with post-harvesting management. Therefore, we created a public-private partnership to resolve that issue and improve our export products' quality, particularly their shelf-life once they reach other markets. That is why we have been working with the private sector to standardize these post-harvesting management procedures. Another important project is our in-vitro laboratory, BIOVEGA. We established this lab with the aim of producing plants with high-quality genetics while focusing on especially important commodities, such as bananas and plantains. We had the goal of improving productivity and resistance to diseases and have teamed up with researchers from Belgium and France to do so. </p><h4>How does the ministry support the promotion of agricultural exports?</h4><p>We have identified plant and animal health as a cornerstone for exports here in the Dominican Republic and we are working with different institutions like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and many others to ensure our animal and plant health protocols are standardized and open for any market. When we took office, we had to face two difficult issues. The first was the detection of the Mediterranean fruit fly in Punta Cana. When we started working in 2014, we had just 200 traps in the whole country to capture the medfly. Now, we have around 14,000 traps and have seen encouraging results. The second issue that we had to face here in 2014 was the audit carried out by the DG Santé, the EU plant health authority. On this audit, our country was found to ship too many products not meeting EU health standards. This meant we were threatened with losing access to the European market, an immensely important one, if things did not change quickly. We sanctioned exporters, suspended exporter licenses, installed systems of hard and cold-water treatment in companies, and implemented prerequisites for them to export. A year later, we went from 176 notifications to just 32, and have increased exports. </p><h4>What are the benefits and disadvantages that CAFTA-DR has brought to the Dominican agriculture sector?</h4><p>The CAFTA-DR agreement has brought many advantages to our national economy but it has also negatively impacted some of our most economic and socially important products. As a country, we are trying to compete, but sometimes it is difficult to compete against much larger economies and their subsidies. Commercial trade and agreements are important, but it is also important to ensure the wellbeing of all parties involved. Total trade with the US is worth more than USD10 billion a year and, as allies, we need to take care of each other. </p><h4>What are the goals and priorities of the Ministry of Agriculture?</h4><p>We want to go from the current agricultural system to a precision one. For starters, there is less water and we need to switch to precision irrigation systems in the banana, bean, and vegetable industries. We also want to introduce high- quality and genetically strong seeds into every farm and every product. We also want to increase technical services to small and medium-sized farmers by rebuilding our eight regional offices and becoming more of a technical service institution. That will enable farmers to get help at every stage through to the end of production and is what we must do. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[strengthening-the-foundations]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Grupo Sención's mission and its current objectives?</h4><p>We are a Dominican family business committed to providing innovative and quality services and contributing to the social, economic, and environmental development of the Dominican Republic across different industries. We are now in a phase of uniting all our operations. For that, we have been working with several international consultants and created a family council and protocol in 2016. At the same time, we are in the process of professionalizing our companies and are working on executing the best corporate government practices for all companies and the group in general. Simultaneously, we have worked on the issue of group image because the companies are currently individual, though we intend to turn them into a holding company. </p><h4>You have built the largest convention center in the country. What is the significance of this and what other important projects are you considering?</h4><p>The convention center has a great deal of relevance since there was no center with that kind of capacity in the capital of Santo Domingo (approximately 4,000 people). It was meant to house the 46th OAS convention; therefore, we built it in a record five months, which was the result of a terrific and engaging team of engineers working day and night to achieve this. With this construction Constructora Global has set a higher standard to guarantee the quality and efficiency of Dominican constructors.</p><h4>What are your additional key projects for 2017?</h4><p>We have a construction service company called Antillean Construction. It is in charge of the construction of the road infrastructure of the city of Juan Bosch, which is a government project. This has the peculiar feature of having 25,000 housing units under development for an estimated 100,000 inhabitants, while occupying a land area of 3 million sqm. Our company is in charge of the road infrastructure and we completed Phase I in late 2016. We just started Phase II and will be working on that over 2017. We are looking for developing projects of private-public partnership (PPP) because we understand that is necessary for this country to continuing the development of infrastructures. In the Constructora Global sector, which is real estate development, we intend to build approximately 2,000 housing units in the next few years. We already have projects designed in the eastern zone, in an expanding area called San Isidro, and there we will develop approximately 1,400 units. Then, we have a residential tower on Avenida Nuñez Cáceres at a slightly higher level called “Panorama 310."</p><h4>What is your vision with this redefinition of the company in the next five years?</h4><p>We have the vision and are working on creating a holding company and a solid corporate structure. Now in each of the companies we see many opportunities. We plan to build 2,000 housing units and expand to 10 stations per year. In Macrotech, we will continue to expand the programs we have locally while also internationalizing. As for renewable energy, we created the Sunergy Company and have a portfolio of projects worth USD70 million that we intend to develop in the next four years. Even at our fuel stations, we are setting up solar plants, both for economic and environmental reasons. Many institutions submitted a request to change the law, which allows banks to accept collateral to be able to finance 80% of solar installations. As of today, it only recognizes 30%, which limits the financing capacity of such projects. We are at the point where if approved, there will be a renewable energy boom in the Dominican Republic whose wave we will ride. We also see the possibility of moving into other markets. We have been in talks, for example, with friends from Colombia on renewable energy there, which is still in an exploration phase, but we see something interesting there. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been DHL's success strategy in the Dominican Republic and Caribbean?</h4><p>Part of DHL's success in the Dominican Republic has been the consistency and alignment with our corporate global strategy, which focuses on three bottom lines: become the provider, employer, and investment of choice in the express shipping and logistics sector. These three bottom lines form the basis of four important pillars; motivated people, great service quality, loyal customers, and a profitable network. Thinking globally and working locally based on customer needs has been a key success in our local strategy.</p><h4>Which areas in the transport and logistics sector have the biggest growth potential and how will DHL impact these areas?</h4><p>With technology and e-commerce growth in recent years, B2C solutions are an area that DHL sees as an important source of growth for the express business. Many SMEs are focusing on e-commerce as a way of selling not only locally but also cross border. Manufacturers are also an important part of the e-commerce chain, so the M2C is also an area where we are working to provide new solutions. For these businesses, partnering with a strong logistics brand and offering time definite premium shipping is an excellent way to face the new challenges that e-commerce brings. Premium logistics services—specifically high-speed, time-definite international solutions—are where DHL Express can shine</p><h4>What are the main challenges that DHL faces in improving air, ocean, road, and rail logistics in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>There are a few challenges in logistics processes that DHL Express in the Dominican Republic still faces. Despite many improvements made in Dominican Customs in terms of technology and programs focused on facilitation, there are still opportunities to improve the lead time for the customs processes. Now that the Authorized Economic Operator Program (AEO) has been launched by customs, the processing of organizations certified by the program should improve. This instrument aims to mitigate the security risk in the supply chain but also helps to facilitate trade with the implementation of more expedited processes. DHL seeks to be part of this list of entities certified by the program to assure a smoother customs process that we know will help improve our customer's experience.</p><h4>How will the go green solutions help reduce the company's environmental footprint, while keeping itself competitive?</h4><p>We consider Go Green, or the “green aspect" when it comes to all of our activities, especially on new projects and investments. In the Dominican Republic, every fleet renewal has a focus on assuring CO2 emissions are reduced. In the case of new facilities, they should have features that help reduce energy consumption. Recycling is an important factor in our offices, especially for items like paper. At DHL Express Dominican Republic, Go Green solutions are not as developed as in other markets. It's one of our focus areas going forward to adopt some of the Go Green practices we are using in other countries.</p><h4>What is DHL's expansion plan for 2017 in the Dominican Republic and the Caribbean in regard to fleet and workforce?</h4><p>As a result of consistent growth in the express business, DHL Express in Dominican Republic over the last three years has expanded in terms of its workforce by 24%. In terms of its fleet for 2017, we have a fleet renewal plan of about 15 new and more energy-efficient vehicles with a first class corporate image. At the same time, we will expand our route coverage in zones with growth potential in the national territory. This confirms the company's commitment and confidence in the investment climate in the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>What are DHL's main objectives in the Dominican Republic for 2017 and how does it plan on achieving them?</h4><p>The main objective for DHL Express Dominican Republic is to continue its growth through quality customer service and products that meet our customers' needs. We have focused our growth on different sources such as SMEs, retail and B2C. But growth isn't possible if we do not focus on quality in everything we do. To achieve that focus, we expect to drive service improvements in all areas of our operations. We will continue with employee training so they are motivated and empowered and we will continue to develop the tools to simplify our customers' lives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the history of Maritima Dominicana?</h4><p>I started Maritima Dominicana in March 1971 with the help of my brother-in-law, Gustavo Tavares. Then, in 1973, I founded another company called Caribetrans, which was involved in warehousing and air-freight forwarding. Caribetrans today has warehouses in every airport in the Dominican Republic, and also 10,000sqm of warehouses in the city. We also created a company called Terminales Haina, which has custom warehouses where consolidated cargo is taken from every port once it has cleared customs and is then delivered to the receivers. Then, we began a firm called Almatrans Logistics that operates fiscal warehouses and logistics centers, before forming an inland transportation company called Equipos y Transportes, which today owns more than 1,200 chassis and many trucks and other equipment to handle containers in the ports and off-dock facilities.</p><h4>How are you involved in the Port Caucedo logistics terminal, and how is it affecting the wider landscape of transportation in the region?</h4><p>If each company had its own warehouse with a large inventory, it would be quite expensive. Therefore, they outsource this to service providers such as Almatrans and Caribetrans, because we can bring in whatever they need each week and deliver it in time for manufacturing. This is what happens at the logistic centers. This is the essence of supply chain logistics where we handle ocean and airfreight transportation, custom clearance, and warehousing. We are also one of the first companies certified as an OEA or Authorized Economic Operator, which is where external auditors determine that our procedures are accurate and honest. We are also certified ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18.001, not to mention by the World BASC Organization with respect to the security of all our activities. Every government entity, such as the port authority, customs, and security, wants to be sure that we as service providers in the ports and airports do this correctly and honestly.</p><h4>What is the essential cargo that MarDom handles and where do you see future growth?</h4><p>We believe the agricultural sector will be able to increase the volume of exports to the US and Europe. Around 20 years ago, we handled between 50 and 60 containers every week of pineapples bound for the US from Dole and Chiquita. Back then, these large fruit and vegetable suppliers had their own shipping companies, but many now outsource this to container shipping companies. This is also how we became the service provider for the entire banana export and handled three weekly fixed-day services of vessels to take them to Europe. We believe not only that the Dominican Republic will be able to increase production of fruits and vegetables for export around the world, but also that the production of manufactured goods in the free zones will continue to increase—especially given the new decree that simplifies these supply-chain logistics. This will make it easier to bring in the materials these manufacturers need to produce local products like clothing, shoes, and electrical equipment.</p><h4>How do you see the shipping industry playing out over the next five years?</h4><p>More large shipping companies are going to start consolidating, a trend that has already begun over the last two years. Many global carriers are now working closely together or are buying other companies in order to reduce internal costs of their operations and survive the economic crisis within the industry. We could also have other incidents like the insolvency of Hanjin, which has created a lot of uncertainty within the market. All of their ships were suddenly stopped, and the cargo onboard was not discharged at the port of destination until the port terminals could determine whether they were going to be paid for their services. Hence, there is some fear within the sector that other carriers might have to declare insolvency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some important stories in the Dominican Republic not being covered by the international media?</h4><p>I believe the controversial relationship with Haiti is not appropriately covered and understood by the media or international organizations. Also, the Dominican Republic has not been active in its communication strategy to gain a better position abroad. We still need to work more clearly on the country's tourism image and as an attractive scenario for investments in many sectors of the economy.</p><h4>What are some of the main reasons the Dominican Republic is attracting greater foreign investment than other countries in the Caribbean?</h4><p>The country has the economic stability that is crucial for investment. We can say the same about Dominican democracy, which has been able to celebrate its internal processes in order.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges the economy needs to address?</h4><p>We must work on the creation of new sources of wealth in the tourism, industry, and technology sectors. Education is vital to our economic and social development as well, so it is necessary to work with citizen security and social equity. I also consider it appropriate to correct the fiscal deficit and the issue of public debt.</p><h4>What are some other sectors in the Dominican Republic's economy with opportunities for foreign investors that might be overlooked? </h4><p>Agriculture has great potential, but we have to rethink it. Energy and mining have many possibilities to improve in the areas of exploration and exploitation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017?</h4><p>The country's outlook for 2017 is good. However, we must deal with the damage caused by the floods of November, which will force the government to reorient large resources from its budget in order to deal with emergencies in infrastructure and social assistance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Ideal Convergence]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-ideal-convergence]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities drew Altice to invest in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>It is no secret that the Dominican Republic is one of the fastest-growing markets in Latin America. There was an interesting opportunity that seemed to fit well with Altice's vision of where telecoms are going. We are a company that has a strategy of convergence between fixed and mobile, and there were essentially two companies up for grabs, Orange and Tricom. We are a company that believes in convergence between media and telecoms, and the Dominican Republic is a country that loves its entertainment. We also saw a great opportunity not only to invest more in networks, bring connectivity to the people, and democratize access to the internet and telephones, but also to boost employment, education, information, and entertainment. </p><h4>What benefits come from converging different forms of media? </h4><p>One of the most important benefits is that we are good at it. We are good at running networks, investing in networks, and have a good understanding of what products are the most suitable for a given network. We also have a proven track record in Israel and France of producing high-quality media that is attractive to the end user. We believe there are synergies between both industries. Obviously, there is an ongoing shakeup in the industry with the arrival of Netflix and others, and in the future it will be difficult to extract the most value out of your broadband connection if you are not also offering the content that is being delivered on it. This does not mean we want to be the only provider of content because there is great content already out there, but we do think it is important that we are somehow a part of that value chain. This is how we deliver the best internet experience, the best smartphone experience, and create a meaningful and sustainable relationship with our customers. </p><h4>Will your strategy with Tricom and the cable services you offer evolve in the coming years?</h4><p>In fact, we already have. Just this year we have taken some interesting steps. We have a partnership with Discovery Kids and Fox, and we have an app available here. Additionally, users can extend their viewing onto their tablets or smartphones. We have also initiated exclusive partnerships with existing content producers. We have a long relationship with Caribbean Cinema, which is the leading movie theatre chain in the entire Caribbean. This relationship has now morphed into a more direct relationship, and we have recently launched a TV station together. Caribbean Cinema has a long history of buying traditional Hollywood offerings, but it also purchases smaller scale Dominican productions. We have configured a TV channel with the best premium entertainment content in the market, which is available exclusively to our customers. So in a way, we have embarked on the first step in encouraging local content tailored for our customer base.</p><h4>What are the broader economic implications of expanding the network and getting more Dominicans regular internet access?</h4><p>There is a clear correlation between internet penetration and GDP growth, but on a smaller scale the effects are more profound. If we take the example of the small organic banana farmers in the northern part of the Dominican Republic, the internet has dramatically changed their entire economic existence. Their opportunities to market and sell their product and to understand the dynamics of the entire market have shifted in profound ways. From a micro perspective, the internet creates extraordinary opportunities for the most underprivileged. The internet lowers the barriers of entry for the small entrepreneur in ways mankind has not before seen. Of course, information asymmetries persist, but they are the smallest they have ever been. We all now have a responsibility to ensure that everyone with access to information also has the tools and capabilities to use this information. We believe internet and education are the two fundamental cornerstones of building a model economy and democracy.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-consumer-is-always-right]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has changed the most within the organization since the recent acquisition by Grupo Telemicro?</h4><p>The short-term strategy and focus is definitely to take Viva to the next level in terms of profitability and technology. In order to do that, there have to be some significant changes in our technology and an expansion of our network in the Dominican Republic. With acquisitions there are generally cost-cutting measures taken and employee reductions, but so far this has not happened with Viva. Since we want to become more competitive in the market, we are aware that people are one of the essential parts in making this happen. Viva's personnel is capable, experienced, and knowledgeable. Therefore, there has been no reduction in staff; in fact, we are planning to expand.</p><h4>What is Viva's strategy in a market that is heavily dominated by two companies?</h4><p>Right now, the Dominican market offers a good opportunity to grow for Viva. The penetration of the mobile industry in the Dominican Republic is around 90%, which is below Latin America's average. There is opportunity to grow in unsatisfied segments, where Viva can deliver outstanding convenience and high levels of satisfaction. Viva is going to keep the same strategy of offering great value to the customer. The good thing about the competition here is that it makes the consumer the winner.</p><h4>Around 50% of Dominicans do not have regular, adequate internet access. What are the broader implications of bringing this to more of the population here?</h4><p>There are two aspects to this, and the first is political. The government is leading a nationwide effort that involves every telecom operator, the education and energy sectors, and various other players. The goal of the project is to ensure that everybody has access to quality internet services with adequate web security and high-quality content. We congratulate the government for taking this step and getting all the players to the table to share their views and contribute to this project. In terms of Viva, the vision of the group is to provide access for everyone in the country at an affordable price. It is part of our expansion plan to cover the whole country with our mobile and internet services, but this will take time.</p><h4>What specific investments will be the most beneficial under the government's República Digital campaign?</h4><p>From Viva's perspective, the government needs to put in place some fiscal incentives for the private sector. The reason there is a gap in mobile and internet penetration levels today is because it has not been profitable for telecoms companies to reach those places that currently do not have coverage. An equal obstacle is that these people do not have sufficient income to pay for these services. Thus, the joint public-private approach the government is taking is the right one. The investment it is now putting into building the country's fiber-optic network that will definitely help reach more areas and people. Nevertheless, the government still needs to look at what the private sector's participation will be. Currently, we are in the first stage of talking about plans and ideas, but there has not been anything specific. The concern of the telecom sector is definitely a fiscal one because we are a sector with some of the highest taxes in the region.</p><h4>What do you see Viva's role being in contributing to República Digital?</h4><p>One thing we can contribute is good coverage, which means people will have more access. We are also looking for synergies with the cable company, Aster, to provide internet to remote areas. There are opportunities for everyone in this market, and that is why Viva has been able to remain in this market, even with 2G technology and this is why we are taking Viva to the next level. We offer consumers an excellent price and service and are also investing in infrastructure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[internet-for-all]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since the inception of Indotel in 1999, how would you evaluate its contribution to the development of the IT sector in the country?</h4><p>Indotel has made significant contributions to the development of the telecommunications sector. With the passing of the Telecommunications Bill in 1998, conditions were created for international carriers to come to the Dominican Republic and develop their business. Today, the telecoms market in the DR has a dynamic market with multiple  companies continuously investing and growing, bringing the Dominican Republic to the top of the region. We are one of the biggest markets in terms of traffic and we are fourth in the world in long distance. As for specific contributions, Indotel's market regulation has ensured a competitive environment that promotes investment in new technologies and a strong legal framework for local and multinational companies that decide to operate here. Customer protection is also another important piece of our regulatory agenda. Part of a healthy market is a customer base that is properly informed of its rights so it can properly gauge offers and select the carrier that best fits its needs. Nonetheless, trends in technology are constantly changing. We are now working to regulate the data market so our operators have better conditions to invest more in infrastructure and connect the whole country. As of the end of 2016, a little less than half of the population is not actively using ICT services like the internet, and with this in mind one of the goals of this administration is to provide universal access to said services. To that effect we have created a program called República Digital, or Digital Republic, with the express goal of connecting all Dominicans to the internet.</p><h4>How are you going to achieve this transformation?</h4><p>Steps are being taken toward a new regulation in internet services that enforces infrastructure sharing and a standardized fee payment structure. This strategy aims to maximize the use of the existing telecoms facilities and reduce the entry costs in areas that are already being served, so that investment goes toward positively increasing the service footprint, impacting communities instead of redundant construction work that will neither add value to the telecommunication network nor contribute toward universal inclusion. Additionally, as part of the DR Digital initiative, we have two projects geared toward infrastructure. One is the National Fiber-Optic Network, which has been constructed by the Dominican Electrical Transmission Company (ETED), making this government-owned infrastructure; however, we are proposing a public-private partnership (PPP) for the operation and exploitation of this resource. The service providers will be able to access the most remote regions of the country with a significantly reduced entry price tag. This plan includes a scheme of subsidies for service providers willing to engage lower-income communities. The second project that relates to infrastructure is the creation of a public spaces Wi-Fi network, which will  encompass 5,000 schools and more than 1,200 public areas. The government will monitor access and regulate content consumed, but the service will be offered free of charge to the public.</p><h4>With this mass adoption of the internet by Dominicans, what areas of regulation and education will you focus on?</h4><p>We will have new internet regulation that ensures quality and consumer safety. Cyber security is another big issue regarding the DR Digital initiative. A cyber event response center is being created for the Dominican Republic in order to properly measure and study cyber attacks, help detect vulnerabilities before they are exploited by malicious elements, and generate proper policies and regulations taking into account how dynamic the whole cyber environment is. The other big regulatory element is the OTTs, especially considering the challenge that foreign companies present as they bring services to consumers in the Dominican Republic without any regard for local laws or regulations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

What do you expect from your Yamaha brands in 2017?</h4><p>The market has changed drastically. The motorcycle market is now mostly dominated by Chinese brands. As a result, Yamaha has decided to go a little bit upscale to differentiate itself from its Chinese competitors. That has resulted in a decrease in volume, but the image is still intact for them. The big motorcycle market here is below 150cc. Motorcycles are also mostly used for public transportation, in contrast to other places, where they may have more commercial uses. There are some brands that make larger motorcycles with four wheels and recreational vehicles, which is the market that Yamaha is concentrating on now. We inaugurated a new Yamaha store to focus on the recreational bike market. Yamaha had been the market leader for many years before the Chinese brands came in. Even though Yamaha has a manufacturing facility in China, they mostly manufacture for the local market. In the export market, they source their products from a variety of locations and facilities, but they do not want to go down-market to compete with Chinese brands. They want to go up-market; hence, the recreational and four-wheel bike segment they are now focusing on, which requires a little more customer service. </p><h4>As a distributor of Nissan, Suzuki, Chevrolet, and Infiniti, how do you see growth evolving in those four brands?</h4><p>The market is still recuperating. Looking at the last 10 years, we are still about 9% below the all-time high for total industry sales volume, which was in 2007. Even that year, we were only talking 30,000 unit sales, which is still low compared to places like Puerto Rico. To give you an idea, Puerto Rico has one-quarter the population of the Dominican Republic and is a significantly smaller country in terms of land, yet its all-time high in the last 10 years was total sales of 140,000 units. The market is pretty small here and part of the objective of the new car importers is to help make this grow. The big challenge is the used car market in Dominican Republic, which is increasing faster than new car sales. The outlook for Nissan and Chevrolet is positive. Nissan now has three automotive plants in Mexico, which is a common regional manufacturing hub for automobiles. It also has two manufacturing plants in the US and one in Brazil. So that is six manufacturing plants in this hemisphere, which is considerable.</p><h4>What is holding back the growth of the market in the Dominican Republic, and what factors could drive expansion?</h4><p>The big factor is used car imports, be they from Asia or the US. Used car imports from Asia are sourced from two main markets, Korea and the US. There is also a tremendous diversity of fuels in Dominican Republic. Most used cars are propane based, which is a rarity in the automotive business, because most of the non-diesel and non-gasoline fuels are mostly natural gas. Some are propane, but most are natural gas. If you try and go into a shopping mall in Bogotá, for example, they will check if you have propane tanks or natural gas tanks in the trunk of your car, because tanks offer a higher security risk. Propane was made available here to serve as a substitute for coal, which had a major effect on deforestation. First used as a cooking fuel, it is now being used as transportation fuel.</p><h4>Grupo Ambar is also present in various other markets in the region like Puerto Rico, Cuba, Venezuela, and various small Caribbean islands. Can you tell us about your regional distribution and the importance the Dominican Republic has in your overall strategy?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is the originator of the market for us, and this is where my grandfather originally came, before going on to Cuba until the revolution. We also have our operation in Puerto Rico where we sell Kia, Nissan, and Infiniti, but we do not do retail there. We just sell wholesale from our stocking warehouse. Therefore, we do not sell directly to the public there, we sell it to independent retailers, with the exception of Infiniti. In Venezuela, we are also stock distributors for Nissan. But of course, operations in Venezuela are difficult now, to say the least. In Venezuela, we are now surviving primarily due to the parts business, but there has been a total collapse of the automobile market in Venezuela. Cuba is the largest landmass in the Caribbean, and it will take a considerable time for that country to open. There is an acute need for transportation in both those countries, though. At one point the Venezuelan market had reached 600,000 units. That is enough to bring the attention of all automotive manufacturers, and the potential is definitely there, but we have to wait for things to change for the better in that country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Yazoo Investments fit into the overall strategy of the CABC Group?</h4><p>
	CABC Group began operations in 1992 and Yazoo Investments was born in 2004. So, we have 12 years of experience operating our core business of manufacturing the raw materials to produce bulk rum. Our main activity is to export to Venezuela, and 97% of production is allocated for export. The situation in Venezuela in the export sense has not been ideal, not for political but for economic reasons, so we were looking for a geographic area where it would be easier to export. This is why we chose the Dominican Republic, thanks to its free trade zones. The country fulfilled all the conditions, and we targeted a goal of 10,000 barrels at the beginning, repeating all the processes of manufacturing that we had applied in Venezuela. This was done within six to seven years in collaboration with the Hazin and Santoni families, who are sugar cane producers in the Dominican Republic. We were soon able to produce all the raw materials needed to manufacture the final rum. Nowadays, we have a weekly quantity of 32,000 barrels, far outpacing our original figure of 10,000.
</p><h4>Where are the most important export markets for Yazoo, and where are you looking to expand?</h4><p>
	Three years ago we only exported to six countries. In 2015, we were in eight countries and we will finish 2016 in 17. In Europe we export to Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany and also have great volume in the US, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Honduras. We are very proud of the fact that we send products to China. We have three clients in Spain and one in the US and hope to soon have another in the latter. The whole strategy is to expand not only in the countries and destinations where we are exporting but also the volume of clients. No matter the size of the country or client, we focus on the quality of the product. This is incredibly important for our long-term strategy. We have been able to expand our space in the free trade zone in San Pedro to 4,700sqm in order to do the bottling process for private labels. At the moment, we are working on the development of new clients in Central America and for this we have to do market research to understand the flavor and specific features of the product we need depending on the market.
</p><h4>
	<strong></strong>What aspects of the San Pedro Free Zone have contributed to your success?
</h4><p>
	First are the facilities to operate our entire operations: the imports, supplies, ability to do the bottling, and the facilities to export our brand. This gives us the ability to reach greater levels of efficiency. Within 48 hours, we can achieve a whole delivery and even have the customs process and officers within the free zone, so that helps facilitate the speed of the delivery process. The second advantage is economic, as we do not have any taxes on our export operations. The third advantage is the fact that we have had the opportunity to purchase the land. Some of the companies are renting the area and experience high costs, which is why we decided to locate to the area.</p><h4>What does Yazoo Investments hope to accomplish in 2017?</h4><p>
	This year we will complete two new areas. The first is to replace our old barrels. The barrels are 10 years old, so some of the elements are broken and we need to replace them. The other strategy is to improve the bottling process. Nowadays, we have only one line of bottling but used to have many in Venezuela. We were bottling 14 different kinds of sangria for 14 different customers and would like to implement that here as well. For the moment, the main goal is to add 2,000 more annual barrels to the 40,000 barrels we already produce. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Barrick Pueblo Viejo for Barrick Gold's portfolio and the Dominican economy?</h4><p>A concrete indicator of the importance of our operations is the fact that in 2016 we were ranked first in our sector in fiscal contributions to the economy as measured by corporate tax payments. Therefore, not only does that position us as market leaders, it also means that over 51% of the corporate taxes collected by the government came from us. Our company has a great impact on the regional economy not only because of its fiscal contributions; we have also generated over 11,000 jobs during the construction period and currently have 2,200 direct employees. In terms of the indirect impact that our operations have, it is safe to estimate that for every one direct job we create, another five indirect jobs arise. Some of the highlights of the study that positioned us so well in the regional economy include an increase in the number of micro businesses from around 30 to more than 330 since our arrival in the country, in addition to the number of loans made by banks. We have invested over USD30 million through CSR activities in the country.</p><h4>What was your production for 2016, and how will it evolve in 2017?</h4><p>In 2015, we produced 974,000 ounces of gold and 1,161,953 ounces in 2016. Our processing plant started operations in August 2012. To date, we have produced more than 4.1 million ounces in just over four years of production, with numbers increasing every year. Our expectation based on the feasibility study was originally 1 million ounces per year for the first five years of operation. We have adhered to the numbers and yielded positive results, with the exception of 2014, which ended about 26,000 ounces under the projections. The expectation for 2017 is consistent with the last four years; we expect to produce just over 1 million ounces by December. This is promising, considering that the average productive life of the mine is about 25 years. Nevertheless, we are working to extend the life of the mine to the best of our abilities. The current reserves are estimated to be 12 million ounces.</p><h4>What are the risks and challenges of the mining industry and how has Barrick Gold faced them so far in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>So far, the biggest issue has been the lack of a mining tradition on the island. This makes a difference because the Dominican economy has been mostly dominated by services, tourism, and agriculture. Because of this, mining in the region is associated with a large negative environmental footprint. Thus far, our operations have taken place in a mine that was once managed by the Dominican state; these operations left high negative externalities that we have worked to remediate as we operate.  As we continue to operate in strict compliance with the highest environmental standards, one of the greatest challenges we continue to face is changing society's general perception of the sector. In our experience, conducting our operations with the highest ethical standards and commitment to transparency, not only at a fiscal level, but also on every level of society, is the way to mitigate this. Now, we have actually been officially recognized for our relationship with the community. In 2008, we had a valuable experience in which we collaborated with different municipalities on different projects as mandated by law. This immersion into the communities helped us create many communication channels to carry out our social responsibility projects and make a difference in the community. Furthermore, our relationship with the government, our biggest stakeholder, is currently strong after a contract renegotiation in 2013. At an internal level, the greatest challenge is cost reduction. For the past three years, we have been working on an initiative to maximize efficiency in which employees make suggestions to improve our operations.</p><h4>What are your objectives for 2017?</h4><p>At the global level, we are focused on cost and debt reduction. At the local level, we intend to finalize the current project financing to cover our debt by the end of 2017. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[strengthening-our-capabilities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Dominican Republic publicly announced its commitment to green energy and reducing gas emissions. What are its main short-term projects?</h4><p>Since the Paris Convention, countries with higher emissions assumed a series of responsibilities toward reducing these and boosting green energies. There are various so-called vulnerable countries, and the Dominican Republic is among them; we need to get ready to take that step forward and better understand the funds available for these kinds of projects—public, private, multilateral organizations, and non-governmental organizations, for example. The overall objective is for Central America and the Caribbean to strengthen our capabilities for the formulation of projects. We need to keep in mind that sometimes the presentation of the project is one of the key parts of the same because a bad presentation can ruin its potential. Additionally, we work on the projects we can implement in our country in accordance with the Paris Convention. In this context, we prioritize those projects that can have an impact on both us and on neighboring countries, especially Haiti.</p><h4>The Dominican Republic is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. What is the government's long-term strategy to mitigate risks such as heavy rains?</h4><p>President Medina labeled the next four years as the years of water. In this context, we are set to put a lot of effort on everything surrounding water protection and generation, with special attention on forests. Therefore, our medium to long-term strategy to mitigate risks focuses on taking care of our forests. The government has taken the lead in many areas and started to implement actions such as reforestation efforts across the country, especially in mountainous regions as well as vulnerable communities along river basins. Trees in these latter areas work as a sponge when we have heavy rains. The Environment Ministry is the main channel for implementing such actions. Taking into account the current situation in the country, our top priority is reforestation. However, we do not limit ourselves to reforestation; the sea and coral reefs are another of our priorities. We are trying to prevent fishing activity that can destroy coral reefs.</p><h4>What is the future development of the Falcondo mine in Loma Miranda?</h4><p>In this context, none of the studies or research developed by the ministry foresee the exploitation of Loma Miranda in the short to medium term. Requirements for the mine foresee the need of other technologies, which means the project has stalled. At the same time, we are waiting to see whether or not congress will designate the area a national park.</p><h4>What do you see as the best way to incentivize the private sector to work towards sustainability as much as towards profitability?</h4><p>One of the challenges we face is finding a balance between profitability and protecting the environment. Every company must have as one of its goals the protection of the environment. It is pointless to generate a lot of money as a company if at the end of the day we destroy the world we live in. But it is possible to develop a sustainable industry respecting life and the planet.</p><h4>What are the priorities of the ministry for 2017?</h4><p>We want to continue implementing our reforestation efforts and continue promoting investment in farming and agriculture. We want to increase protection efforts of those areas that the law describes as protected natural parks. We need to focus on protecting the rivers around these areas. We need to put a lot of attention on the protection of endangered species as well as sanctuaries and coral reefs. This is vital to ensuring the long-term sustainability of the areas. Finally, we need to continue working on the regulatory framework as well as the licensing and bureaucratic process. The main purpose of this is to make sure we facilitate the legalization of certain activities for companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the reasons behind the company's success, and what are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We always begin from our strategic plan. We basically focus on two fundamental aspects of the plan: investments and securing our existing assets. We also cover our backs through the appropriate maintenance programs, as the company is the one responsible for the systems that it manages for supplying the energy distribution centrals. We are the key to a smooth flow between energy producers, suppliers, and consumers. Thus, we face the great responsibility of sustaining the interconnected national energy system in real time. For that purpose, we have an Energy Control Center from which we carry out our various functions under the program of our Sistema Eléctrico Nacional Interconectado (OC-SENI). It is important that we program for the short, medium, and long term according to the most important investments so that the program works according to the needs of our clients. In our case, customers fall into the category of generators, distributors, and unregulated users. We always pursue a strategic goal to serve citizens by providing them with quality energy under the international standards established by the Superintendency of Electricity and stipulated under the General Energy Law 12-01. Citizens are our main focus. For this reason, our company must be organized under the best standards for our contribution to the development of our nation.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the progress made by different distributors like EDESUR, EDENORTE, and EDEESTE?</h4><p>Our expansion plan must take into account the increased demand from distributors. Each party, including the National Energy Commission, periodically conducts a separate study. In addition, when we establish an investment plan in projects that drive the development of the electricity sector, it must be subject to scrutiny by regulators and customers. Once we incorporate their observations, we create an expansion plan, similar to the one for 2013-2020. These plans contain the needs of our investments to serve both generators and distributors in relation to the demand for the product.</p><h4>How much of ETED'S reinvestment is used in security and post-natural disaster relief?</h4><p>Approximately 20% of our budget goes to the maintenance area. Fortunately, we have not been affected by any natural disasters in recent times. The last time we faced such a disaster, we dealt with the infrastructural damage with our own resources and through the means of financing, so we received a USD11 million loan from the World Bank to rebuild the affected networks in the southern region of country. We count on investment projects with the European Investment Bank (EIB) for transmission networks and substations in the south region. The senate recently approved a financing agreement with KFW, a German development bank known for its presence in the energy sector, for a loan of EUR17.7 million for the construction of a major substation of about 400MVA, 345/138kV in San Antonio de Guerra, Santo Domingo province.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that the sector is facing today, and what opportunities do you predict in the coming years?</h4><p>The problems with the electric power sector go back many years, because for many reasons the different governments have not dealt with the issues with the correct vision. However, the innumerable advances made in all aspects are undeniable. Many years ago, when I was in college, I had to use gas lamps and candles. Today this situation has changed and the energy service covers about 85% of the demand. The other part of the plan is that the clients receive the energy of the highest possible quality in sufficient quantities. Therefore, we must have access to a national transmission network adequate to the national development needs of the generators' investments and according to the growth of the demand that the distribution companies have the responsibility to satisfy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the competition in your sector?</h4><p>Competition is fierce, not necessarily for customers selecting the best price but among customers selecting new sites, locations, and brands. The last 10 years we have grown from having six traditional brands to now having more than 12. In oil distribution, there used to be six companies but are now 40. We embrace the companies that join the market with high standards like Sunix, Next, Sigma; however, there are also others that do not have those high standards or the same work principles, and, therefore, have been able to grow in a way that is not orderly. There have been many complaints about their growth because the required permits have not been acquired.</p><h4>What would the effect of regulating the fuel supply market in the country have on Esso and the market in general?</h4><p>For Esso and the members of SEC, this would be a beneficial measure because we want an organized free market. The fact that the new minister is trying to introduce some order into the market has the support of all of these companies, especially Esso. We have met with the new minister several times and have promised to support the effort to organize the market. One of the first steps he took was the elimination of the subsidy for the transportation union. The leaders of the union were not using that subsidy to help members of the union but instead were cashing that fuel and then sending it back to the market without taxes. This has created a distortion in the market for several years. We understand that the minister is pursuing several other measures into the market. For example, if a company has a license for distribution of fuels and petroleum products in the country but does not comply with the requirements of the ministry of industrial commerce, they will be reevaluated and given some time; if they do not fulfill the requirements their licenses will likely be cancelled. Any effort to introduce some order into the market has the support of Esso and any organized company because at the end of the day we benefit from such policies.</p><h4>What is your current market share and what is your outlook for growth in 2017?</h4><p>There several ways to see the market share. There is a total company market share or retail market share. Retail market share concerns service stations, namely a 15% market share on the Esso site. The order would be Total with 28.27%, Texaco with around 22%, Esso and ISLA each with 15%, followed by others with 5%, 3%, and so on. Hence, we are third in retail market share. When we talk about the total company share, it goes: Total, Texaco, Esso, and ISLA.  </p><h4>How do you see the sector developing in the next five years?</h4><p>The sector is changing a great deal in the mind of consumers. Sunix and Next have done a great job bringing a youthful look, energy, and products into the market. Something that might be reshaped in the future is convenience retailing. In the future, we also see the introduction of more products as a potential benefit to the market. I see more order in the coming years, and not such disorganized growth, because with so much growth there has been some atomization in volume. </p><h4>What are your main goals for 2017?</h4><p>We will continue to consolidate Esso as a strong brand. We have plans to add several sites next year that are already ongoing works. We also want to grow in the areas where we see that the Esso presence is needed, such as in the east and the north. We also have a strong presence in La Romana, San Francisco de Macorí­s, and Santo Domingo, but east Santo Domingo might also be an area where we need to increase our presence. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[vision-for-development]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities has the decline in oil prices brought to the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The drop in oil prices enabled the country to reduce its current account deficit to a more manageable level, which was important. In 2014, oil imports represented 7.5% of our GDP, whereas in 2015 it was 4.4%. This enabled us to invest in other areas such as education, where we increased investment by 4%. Therefore, the savings in terms of oil prices allowed us to invest in other areas very important to the country. The total oil bill is also down by more than USD1.3 billion, according to the Central Bank. This has helped to reduce inflation levels and reduced the government expenditures on electricity subsidies.</p><h4>What is your vision for the development of the local hydrocarbons industry?</h4><p>When we arrived at the ministry, there was no regulatory framework in place for the hydrocarbons industry. The Dominican Republic could not continue being a net importer of oil. It required a joint effort to explore the reality of potential oil wells in our territory, as had proven the case in the past. We started a process to open bidding to have foreign companies explore oil potential in the Dominican Republic. We also started to digitalize all the necessary data and make it available online to make it as easy as possible for companies. We started to capture seismic data of the ocean floor up to 200km below the surface in several different parts of the country. With that data now available, foreign companies have been analyzing to determine which blocks have the greatest potential and how to proceed. This entire process has been transparent and placed the Dominican Republic on the radar for international oil companies. In mining, the country has given out plenty of concessions, whereas in the oil industry, we are still brand new. We thus put in a great deal of effort at the beginning to create the regulatory framework the oil industry lacked and developed a strategy for the country's energy resources, including renewables.</p><h4>What role do renewable energies currently play in the country's economy?</h4><p>There are currently 187MW installed of renewable energies—solar, wind and biomass. The country's objective is to have over 400MW of renewable energies installed across the Dominican Republic. I am optimistic in this regard. There are commercial agreements in place for projects that represent more than 230MW. For example, Monte Plata currently represents 30MW, but its full potential is around 60MW. When it comes to hydroelectric energy, we currently have an installed capacity of 204MW. For example, we recently recorded a day in which 30% of the energy used came from just this source. We want to continue to promote its usage and the necessary regulatory framework behind it.</p><h4>How do you find the proper balance between attracting foreign investment in mining and promoting the development of local communities?</h4><p>The country is rich in minerals; however, this comes with great risk to the environment and thus requires a vision of sustainable development. Our challenge is to exploit current resources while investing in sustainable growth and development for future generations. We need to promote the development of the mining industry within a clear regulatory framework and with a common vision to protect the country's ecosystem. Large mining projects today are better managed from both an environmental and social point of view. The challenge remains in the small-scale mines. In the last few years, we have seen the arrival of foreign buyers and intermediaries coming to exploit certain resources, not caring about the environment or community. Hence, we work hard to structure and better manage the small mining industry. We also seek to develop a better ecological awareness, while trying to improve working and living conditions. This is one of the main challenges we have in the industry today, as there are over 5,000 miners in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has CADOAR's role changed since it started in 1972?</h4><p>CADOAR is an institution that brings most of the insurance companies in the country together. I say most because only those that comply with the laws are permitted to join. It has an important role in the legal development of the different measures taken by the insurance sector because it maintains contact with public institutions, such as the public tax regulators, and promotes the sector and works to ensure good practices by all the insurers in the country. It also provides financial statistics about the sector and boosts education about the benefits of insurance throughout the country.</p><h4>Five insurance firms control 80% of the Dominican insurance market. What advantages and disadvantages does this bring?</h4><p>In the past, there was a problem of giving away too many licenses to insurance companies. In the 1980s, they were 54 companies operating in the Dominican Republic. This was too many and the quality of services dropped within the sector. The population might sometimes think that all insurers are the same, but this is not the case. The issue with those smaller companies is that they may offer lower premiums but have a higher risk of insolvency compared to bigger insurers. Bigger companies have the largest market share because clients prefer the security they provide. The low prices of smaller or newer companies are a threat to bigger companies' stability. Hence, it is important to prevent instability in the sector and watch the activities of all the different companies in the market closely to ensure that customers do not suffer.</p><h4>What factors hold back growth and further penetration of the market?</h4><p>The insurance sector's contribution to GDP has fallen. Nowadays, we only have 1.19% penetration, the lowest figure in all of Latin America. This is because the life insurance sector is really small. While other Latin American countries are exempt from paying taxes on life insurance, we pay a 16% tax. This results in increased prices for the customer and is why the market is so small. In 1992, the life insurance industry totaled USD17.5 million; today, it only amounts to USD4 million. This drop corresponds directly with the increased tax rate for those years. The tax on life insurance in 1992 was 5.48%; however, today it is has increased to 16%.</p><h4>Has there been any progress in getting this changed?</h4><p>CADOAR is in talks with the authorities about the importance of boosting the life insurance sector and changing the tax system. Another negative element is that not all the requirements that should be implemented are being done, particularly with vehicle insurance. There are 3.6 million vehicles in the Dominican Republic, but only 60% of cars and merely 10% of motorcycles have insurance. Even the Dominican government has few insurance policies. Almost all the public infrastructure works and government buildings are not covered. We have to be reminded that we are in a country that is exposed to earthquakes and hurricanes. Hence, if there are disasters like these, we would lose almost all of these critical investments that make the city work. This is the main barrier that we encounter in boosting the insurance sector.</p><h4>What direction do you see the insurance sector heading toward in the next five years?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is growing and the government, especially the Superintendancy of Insurance, wants to make the population more aware of the benefits of insurance as a defense against risk. Such is its commitment to educating the population that it is even trying to include the subject in children's academic curriculum to get young people to understand how important it is to get an insurance policy. It is also working with financial institutions, introducing micro-insurances, and trying to get SMEs covered with different policies. According to the National Statistics Office, there are 3 million homes in the Dominican Republic, but only 14,000—or 0.5%—are covered by an insurance policy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been BVRD's main achievements in the past year?</h4><p>This past year's developments were significant, considering the maturity of some projects promoted by BVRD in comparison with the exponential growth of the local securities market in recent years. BVRD focused efforts on continuing with its strategic pillars, which are important to ensure a better development of operations, systems, technology infrastructure, and adequate risks and contingencies management of its internal processes, as well as initiatives aimed to promote the securities market in the DR and abroad. In 2016, we celebrated the second anniversary of the implementation of the SIOPEL technological platform as a trading system. Meanwhile, RDVAL, the first price provider for financial instruments in the DR, was born as an additional service by BVRD and today is an independent company; principal participants in the market came together to form an institutional committee to conduct an integrated study of the industry and identify best market practices to develop our market; and we signed a new agreement with local university PUCMM to develop educational programs to expand, promote, and train in securities market affairs.</p><h4>What is your view on developing a capital market regulatory framework, and how will this affect the local equity market?</h4><p>The current legal framework dates back from 2000. Since then, as a financial market we have grown, new products had been released, there are new players, and accordingly there are new needs for the market. This is precisely the main reason why the regulator and participants are working on a new legal framework to adapt the market to new times and opportunities. A new law has been discussed since 2012 and we hope it will receive congressional approval in 2017. This will definitely help the equity market develop as well.</p><h4>What factors make the Dominican Republic a safe and stable place to invest in?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic has been recognized as one of Latin America's fastest-growing countries in terms of economic growth over the past decade, averaging real GDP growth rate of 5.4% between 1992 and 2014 and a GDP that is expected to be above 7% in 2016. This is the result of a mutual effort by the government and the private sector to transform our business model with more competitive and developing industries such as construction, banking, tourism, and others growing at a rapid to steady pace, boosting our economy in these past years. Annual inflation, measured from June 2015 to June 2016, stood at 1.91%, remaining below the lower limit of the objective established in the Central Bank Monetary Policy of 4%. The Dominican Republic has also become the regional attraction center for FDI, for a total of USD17.6 billion in the last nine years, reaching unprecedented annual flows since 2004. These factors along with local banks and the rapid growth of the securities markets industry, with extremely capable participants and enforcement laws in place, have improved our credit ratings and our capacity to handle efficiently more resources. It is definitely a great time to invest in the Dominican Republic and professional foreign investors have capitalized on this opportunity. Statistics are great indicators of a country's transformation, and we are no exception to that rule.</p><h4>What is your vision for the capital markets and the development of BVRD in the long term?</h4><p>BVRD should become a catalyst for the Dominican securities market in order to move to the next stage of its development. The future of the securities exchange looks promising for many reasons: the launch of new investment instruments, greater participation of the general public and new companies, the inclusion of new marketplaces and functionalities of the platform, and a regulatory framework in the process of approval that will allow the exchange to participate in other markets. All these will allow BVRD to provide greater additional value to participants and the market as a whole. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the reasons behind World Finance selecting Banco Popular as the best Dominican bank for the fifth straight year?</h4><p>In 2016, Banco Popular Dominicano continued its growth trend, with excellent results and improvements in its main financial indicators. As part of our purpose of greater customer engagement, we expanded our offerings of products and services and strengthened consulting programs for individuals and businesses. In order to support our operations in all channels, important investment and initiatives were carried out to strengthen our technological infrastructure, which guarantees stability and availability of services to the clientele and improved the response times and orientation of the organization towards the future of banking. We have made available to our customers new digital solutions based on technological platforms and channels, which facilitate their interaction with our bank at any time and from any device and place. Our institution also introduced a new generation of ATMs, 204 units in 25 provinces, which allow customers to deposit cash with or without a debit card to their own or third-party accounts. In the same manner, in 2016 we continued the expansion of our sub-agent network Subagente Popular, a pioneer financial channel in the country. Today, this channel is present in all provinces of the national territory, with 1,620 affiliated points; this channel allows the client to make transactions and payments from a retail store, a drugstore, or a fuel station with the ease and availability expected. Within our segment of business clients, we have strengthened our leadership as the main lender of resources for the tourism sector, with a market share close to 50% of the total volume of loans granted, actively participating as a catalyst for the extraordinary performance of the Dominican Republic's offer as a world-class tourist destination. Banco Popular Dominicano achieved significant quantitative gains at the end of November 2016, registering total assets of DOP329,549 million while total deposits presented DOP267,761 million.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about Banco Popular's leading role in internet and mobile banking and how technologies are transforming the way Dominicans bank? </h4><p>The mobile has rapidly become the main channel for transactions, inquiries, and product acquisition. Therefore, Banco Popular Dominicano has developed plans to meet those expectations with the launch of our new apps Popular and tPago and the wallets Claro eFectivo Móvil and Orange mPeso. Popular has transformed our clients' mobile experience with a new and more practical design that improves navigation for a better user experience. From their mobiles, our customers can withdraw cash from an ATM without a debit card, logging in with their fingerprint for easier and more secure use, make payments and transfers. New functionalities are developing to continue enhancing user experience for our clients. In addition, tPago has become the main platform for mobile payments, with more than 353,700 clients who can make payments, money transfers, or pay and disburse loans and other functionalities from their mobiles. We will incorporate new features in order to continue innovating on this platform as mobiles become the main transaction channel for our customers.</p><h4>What is needed to allow better access to the formal banking sector for the high level of informality in the economy?</h4><p>The high levels of informality in the country present an opportunity for the banking sector to contribute in the establishment of mechanisms that increase financial inclusion. A good example is the recent emergence of bank sub-agents, which have been designed so that people can conduct financial transactions in easily accessible commercial establishments such as pharmacies, grocery stores, and hardware stores; this, in turn, translates into lower transportation costs and easier access for customers. This mechanism also increases bank coverage at a lower cost in places where it is not feasible to set up a branch, as is the case of remote communities in the rural areas of the country. They have the potential to reduce the informality of the economy, because it encourages the formalization of businesses that work as partners of financial institutions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Guiding Hand]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-guiding-hand]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What economic sectors have contributed the most to the country's growth this year?</h4><p>By September 2016, the country had growth of 6.9%. Basically, the trends in commodity prices such as oil and gold, as well as the recovery of the US economy, have been two beneficial factors for our strong performance. In reference to gold, we have a joint venture with Barrick Gold and production volumes are at full capacity at 1 billion metric tons. The extraordinary evolution of the tourism industry has also been a key factor, showing 9% growth so far this year. We believe we can reach over 6 million visitors this year, which will generate more than USD6.5 billion. At the same time, FDI has maintained a positive trend over the last decade, with an average of USD2.4 million every year. In 2016, we expect to close with USD2.5 billion in FDI. The construction industry has also had a great positive impact on the growth of the national economy and the agricultural sector has experienced double-digit growth in 2016.</p><h4>What are the main risks the Dominican economy faces in 2017?</h4><p>We expect the oil price to stay between USD55 and USD60 per barrel, but we face risks if the price goes above that, as hydrocarbons represent about 30% of our imports. High oil prices can also lead to high inflation. What's more, the interest rates set by the US Federal Reserve are a factor we always have to consider. Those interest rates have an impact on debt payments, as well as other factors in the economy. Finally, there is always the risk of climatological factors and catastrophes due to the geographic location of the country. On the other hand, I want to highlight our macroeconomic and microeconomic stability and social peace as elements that are key to attracting FDI. In this context, we recently changed our monetary policy by raising interest rates, which is set to help us cope with the expected Fed rate hike.</p><h4>What other policies will the Central Bank pursue in 2017 to combat these risks?</h4><p>The Central Bank has to create the conditions under which the productive sectors have access to financing tools that enable them to develop their activities. In this context, our priority is macroeconomic stability in terms of the exchange rate, the strength of the financial sector, an increase in reserve requirements for the banks, and above all, control of the inflation level. We will finish 2016 with an inflation rate that, in the worst-case scenario, is around 1.3%. At the same time, exchange rate depreciation must not reach 3%. I would like to add also that bank credit has expanded by 12% in the private sector this year. We tried to manage the monetary policy so that this is inclusive, enabling SMEs to have access to credit lines and further develop the conditions to attract business to the country. We expect to close 2016 with GDP growth of around 6.5%, positioning us as the leader in Latin America for yet another consecutive year. The last two years we managed to grow our GDP by 7%. The potential growth of the national economy stands at 5.5% in 2017, a goal we are fully committed to reaching. The current account deficit stands at 1.7% of GDP this year and will be 2% in 2017. In this regard, the government has a fiscal objective to have in the budget a deficit of 2.3%, which includes a 0.8% primary surplus of GDP.</p><h4>What role do remittances play in the Dominican economy?</h4><p>In general terms, our economy generates between USD24 billion and USD25 billion in revenues. Of this, the tourism industry generates USD6.5 billion, FDI generates USD2.4 billion, and remittances generate USD5.1 billion. Remittances are an important contributor of hard currency for the economy and will always be important. As long as the US economy stays strong, that figure will increase. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Making The Right Moves]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[making-the-right-moves]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which mergers and acquisitions have been the most strategically beneficial for Grupo SID?</h4><p>Our history as a company is filled with strategically advantageous acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships. As an oil manufacturer focused on producing edible oils and fats our process, by the very nature of its chemical interactions, left us with a derivative product; the raw material of most soaps, which led us into the detergent and soap industry. In the 1970s, we formed a strategic alliance with Unilever, which gave us the license to produce its brands here. In the 1990s, we began to realize that FTAs would play a much larger role in shaping the economic activity of the future and that we needed to expand our product portfolio to take full advantage of this system, so we started to explore strategic alliances with multinationals, especially American corporations, and became the exclusive distributor of Kellogg's, General Mills, Hershey, and Kimberly-Clark products. After our success with Miller, Diageo approached us in 2014-2015, and our fastest growing business is now alcoholic beverages. Just last year we ended our non-compete agreement with Unilever. Serendipitously, the Colgate factory across the street recently closed, and we were able to purchase both the site and factory. In 2017, we will celebrate out 80th anniversary, and over those 80 years we have grown from a humble oil company into a large, diversified conglomerate that offers a huge variety of leading consumer products. </p><h4>What latest innovations and technologies are changing the productivity and efficiency of your brands and processes?</h4><p>We try to have state-of-the-art technology in all of our plants. Most of our processes are automated, standardized, and fully certified. The most important technological innovation, at least in the last 10-12 years, has been the automation of our warehouse management system. The layout of the warehouse, the loading and unloading, the shipping processes, and the storage methods are all considered. Handheld devices also give salesforce employees the ability to not only take orders, but to see real-time inventory information and client history too. The distribution system is also automated to a degree, leveraging GPS, complex territory planning methods, and highly tailored management plans to help us efficiently deliver products to our more than 45,000 points of sale. As a country, we have many inefficiencies, with electricity being number one, education being number two, and the capriciousness of the government's taxation and regulatory schemes being number three. As a company, the only way we can overcome these inefficiencies is to have the best technology in place in every process of our business. </p><h4>What is your long-term vision for Grupo SID?</h4><p>One of our main goals is to maintain strong levels of innovation. Innovation, in my view, must continue to develop regardless of whether we are talking about products, manufacturing facilities, or distribution systems. This emphasis naturally translates into great products, which, at the end of the day, is what keeps us thriving. Our future lies beyond the Dominican Republic; we have strong brands and international quality products, and there is no reason why we cannot export many of our products. In the future, I want a consumer in New York to be able to go into any supermarket in the city and find one of our products. Additionally, demographic trends illustrate that American consumers are likely to become more ethnically diverse, and we are well positioned to capitalize on that diversity. We constantly strive to add high-quality products to our already sizable portfolio. We are committed to expanding our reach across the Dominican Republic, the Caribbean, and, eventually, the globe. We have a young, dedicated team here, and it is focused on taking this firm to the next level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[providing-the-framework]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is ANJE's role in linking the public, private, and academic spheres to spur innovation in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Since its inception, our association has proposed a more unified link between government, academia, and the private sector. From a business and academic standpoint, ANJE has published studies in recent years that have identified opportunities to better align current university curriculum offerings with the demands of the labor force, specifically in business areas. This synergy is necessary in order to have a supply of young talent that is in tune with the capacities required to be successful and meet modern standards. The government should participate actively in these initiatives by integrating the public university system and the National Institute of Professional Technical Training curriculum in technical training with these same goals. In this day and age, innovation and entrepreneurship should be at the center of the discussion between these sectors of society. </p><h4>What are the long-term economic benefits of eliminating the government fuel subsidies to transportation syndicates?</h4><p>Any measures taken by the government to guarantee an efficient and competitive transportation sector, for both commercial and passenger use, is welcome news. We have always advocated for the right to freedom of enterprise and the abolition of monopolies as expressed in our Constitution. The actions taken to eliminate the taxpayer-funded diesel subsidies to certain transportation entities states a clear and definitive interest of the government to resolve issues that have proved troublesome due to the lack of a pertinent regulatory framework. The elimination of this subsidy will represent close to DOP200 million in monthly savings. It also eliminates the illicit trade of almost 3 million gallons of diesel that as part of this subsidy went directly into the informal sectors of the economy. </p><h4>Which of the latest government reforms will make the country more competitive?</h4><p>The Education Pact will have the biggest impact on the country's competitiveness and overall projection towards the future. Dedicating 4% of the country's GDP toward the country's educational budget in 2013 was a huge step toward changing the “status quo." We do have to state that changes in this sector will only be possible with the prioritization of investment in areas that provide a significant return of value. A specific effort must be made in the education of our teachers and performance evaluations tied to compensation. We trust that the effective implementation of this reform will have a positive impact on the Dominican Republic as a whole and will move the country toward becoming more competitive internationally. With the government's lead, we will be able to claim that the country's education system will be up to par with our international peers.</p><h4>What are ANJE's institutional goals for 2017?</h4><p>The association aims to become an agent of dialogue by creating forums to articulate and discuss ideas towards reaching an agreement on comprehensive tax reform as dictated within the National Development Strategy. An overhaul of the actual tax structure would focus on increasing tax revenue, decreasing government expenses, and more effectively investing public funds and controlling the national debt. These should also be accompanied by initiatives to lower tax evasion and improve formality in the economy. We are also focused on competitiveness. Here, we want to execute initiatives that promote policies that contribute to the competitiveness and profitability of local business and start-ups. This includes the elimination of bureaucracy within the formalization process, the impact on businesses due to insecurity, and challenges in the commercial transportation sectors with the intent of making these companies sustainable, competitive, and profitable. Thirdly, we want to focus on institutions. We want to contribute to strengthening our national institutions and democratic system by promoting the reforms necessary to guarantee social and economic development in the future. These include promoting the election of non-partisan individuals to key positions in the judiciary branches of government and the promulgation of a Political Party Law and Electoral Law. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-strong-introduction]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Following the Brexit vote, what are the biggest concerns from Dominican businesses, exporters, and investors?</h4><p>The main concerns regarding Brexit are related to the incentives established in the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA). The Dominican Republic and the UK have strengthened their trade relations through the EPA. A gradual tariff clearance has been observed for the products covered under the agreement that has benefited both countries. The concern is whether those incentives are going to be maintained. We understand this is an opportunity to strengthen the business relationship between the two countries. The UK is aware that we are an important commercial partner and the government had expressed that they are willing to maintain and strengthen this relationship. We also see this as an opportunity for the Dominican Republic to negotiate a stronger bilateral agreement rather than a regional agreement. BRITCHAM will continue to incentivize a business relationship between both countries and serve as a platform between the private sector, the Dominican government, and the British government to ensure and motivate negotiations on this new opportunity and challenge.</p><h4>What is the chamber's role in the development of the hydrocarbon industry here and how will petroleum exploration take off here in the coming years?</h4><p>The chamber had a chapter for oil and gas this year on the fifth edition of the Dominican Week in the UK. We had several important meetings with law firms and potential investors, along with the World Petroleum Council, and the Foreign Secretary's Special Representative for Climate Change. There is a great deal of potential for this industry and important exploration data has been made available free of charge by the Ministry of Energy and Mine of the Dominican Republic. We have had feedback from the British Embassy in the Dominican Republic that British companies on this industry are keen on investing in this sector and seeking long-term business. Hydrocarbons will need a great deal of attention from the private and public sectors. </p><h4>What are some of the biggest challenges international companies face when they set up a business here?</h4><p>One of our chamber's main objective is to support foreign investors interested on investing in our country. Among the main challenges facing foreign companies, are those concerning legal security, which should always be strengthened. In this regard, BRITCHAM works closely with the British Embassy and the representative bodies of the public authorities to guide and facilitate the process of establishing operations in the Dominican Republic. We offer advice and share statistics about the market and also arrange meetings with key people in both the public and private sector.</p><h4>What sectors offer the greatest potential for international investors over the next five years in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We have had the most growth of any regional country in recent years and we also have  several legal incentives in various sectors; for example, renewable energy and the film industry. Sectors such as energy, film, oil and gas, infrastructure, agriculture, and security, among others, have the most potential. Settings such as these motivate BRITCHAM to continue its efforts to promote the advantages and opportunities of trade and investment.</p><h4>What are the chamber's key objectives in 2017?</h4><p>To continue working on increasing commercial trade between the Dominican Republic and the UK, creating and identifying business opportunities for both countries, and attracting British investment, working together with the British Embassy and the Dominican government, are the main objectives of BRITCHAM for 2017. We will continue to promote and facilitate the development of business relationships between the Dominican Republic and the UK, and create networking opportunities between our partners and potential investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>FDI has steadily increased in the last few years, reaching over USD2.2 billion. What factors make the country such as an attractive destination for investors?</h4><p>One of the main points of attraction our country offers foreign investors is macroeconomic stability, something we have enjoyed for a long period of time. Additionally, the current government undertook a fiscal reform that enabled us to progressively reduce a moderate fiscal deficit. We stabilized things and increased the amount of foreign capital, which has boosted our international profile. On top of that, the country has registered high growth rates, well above the average in Latin America; we have grown at over 7% in the past three years.</p><h4>How do you make sure the country's growth levels are inclusive and contribute to a reduction of the 32% poverty rate in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Some 12 to 13 years ago, the country was affected by a severe internal economic crisis that drove up poverty levels nationwide to unusual levels. However, we have done a great deal to reduce these in the last few years. The government implemented special policies to tackle this and we already see the results. Two examples are our social assistance policy and the investment in education infrastructure. We have done a great deal over the last few years, but we need to continue making sure that growth in our country is inclusive and that we continue to reduce poverty levels, which is why it is important to continue working to improve competitiveness indicators across key economic sectors as that will promote inclusive growth and bring development to all regions and every community. Competitiveness means reducing informality levels and increasing salaries.</p><h4>How do you balance efforts to collect taxes from large companies and maintain the attractiveness and competitiveness of the country for foreign investors?</h4><p>We understand that competitiveness levels are not directly related to tax problems; competitive companies pay their taxes with no problem. The most competitive countries are those where companies pay high taxes. In the Dominican Republic, there is a perfect example of that in the difference between tourism and FTZs. Companies in the tourism industry pay relatively high taxes and that sector keeps growing, whereas FTZs do not pay taxes and their growth has come to a slow down. The recent growth in the latter has been a result of the arrival of new industries. Competitiveness can be reached through other actions the government can implement like infrastructure, resources, training, and support in the expansion to new markets.</p><h4>What are the administration's main goals for 2017?</h4><p>One of our main goals is to make economic growth more competitive and inclusive, meaning those sectors with stronger growth levels reduce the levels of informality and increase salary levels. At the same time, another priority for 2017 is to improve social programs in areas such as education and health. We also have to further reduce poverty levels. We will further improve the country's tax base, which must start with certain improvements in the administration already taking place. We will need to reach a fiscal pact between the government, the main economic actors for which the government commits to using public funds more efficiently, and the main economic actors committed to paying more taxes.</p><h4>What is your overall outlook for the Dominican economy for 2017?</h4><p>We need to keep growth and development at the same levels as the last few years. Economic stability is a must to keep current levels of development and FDI. We just need to make sure this development is socially inclusive. The tourism industry has played a key role in the economic growth of the country and will continue to do so, for it shows high levels of dynamism. Thanks to its development, we have seen other sectors such as construction, telecommunications, and finance following suit. The agricultural industry and FTZs will also drive the country's economic development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Republic of China and the Dominican Republic established diplomatic ties in 1941. How have their economic and trade relations developed since that time?</h4><p>Taiwan and the Dominican Republic enjoy solid diplomatic relations. Bilateral trade has increased steadily over the years and both countries are committed to advancing economic and trade exchanges. Each has its own industrial advantages, which are complementary in nature. We would like to help the DR develop markets for its commodities in Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia-Pacific through the Taiwanese business network. Dozens of Taiwanese companies provide over 3,000 jobs in the Dominican Republic. The largest Taiwanese investment project, which amounts to USD110 million, is a new solar power plant in Monte Plata. </p><h4>What advantages does the DR have to offer Taiwanese companies?<br></h4><p>As of June 2016, domestic and overseas Taiwanese businesses had invested a total of USD168 million in 57 companies in the DR, creating about 3,000 jobs. Such investments were concentrated in solar power generation, the manufacturing and processing of footwear, plastic bottles and bags, toilet paper, construction materials and the import and marketing of automobile components, computers, and peripheral devices. As of July 2016, there were six cases of investment totaling USD3.1 million from the DR in Taiwan's electronic component manufacturing, wholesale and retail, hospitality, and catering industries.</p><h4>Taiwan and the DR have held several talks on an FTA. Bilateral trade reached USD139.5 million in 2015 and rose 11% in the first half of 2016. What are the prospects for Taiwan signing an FTA with the DR?</h4><p>An FTA would not only help the DR expand its business opportunities in Taiwan and other parts of Asia, but also attract Taiwanese investment in the DR. This would enhance bilateral industrial cooperation and increase both countries' global competitiveness. Taiwan and the DR are complementary in terms of their degree of economic development, industrial structure, and technical level. Neither is a major trading partner of the other. Signing an FTA and opening up market access to one another would contribute significantly to economic development and bilateral cooperation, while giving an edge to competitive Dominican products in the Taiwanese market. Taiwan, which enjoys geographic advantage between the Americas and Asia, is situated in the center of East Asia with such regional neighbors as mainland China, Japan, South Korea, and the Southeast Asian nations. The signing of a Taiwan-DR FTA would facilitate the establishment of strategic alliances between our industries that would open up avenues through Taiwan's marketing network for Dominican products to reach other Asian markets.</p><h4>What are your views on Taiwan's relations with the DR?</h4><p>We attach great importance to our longstanding and cordial diplomatic relations with the DR. We hope to strengthen bilateral economic, trade and investment cooperation, implement projects that bring economic prosperity and improve people's livelihoods in both countries, and create a win-win relationship based on reciprocity and mutual assistance. Taiwan and the DR could build on their amicable relations to promote cooperation programs that meet the development needs of both countries, leverage the comparative advantages manifested in their technical expertise and practical experience, offer mutual assistance, and yield mutual benefits. This would not only help realize the policy of steadfast diplomacy introduced by President Tsai Ing-wen, but would also be in the spirit of paso firme, which President Danilo Medina has upheld throughout his administration and which has brought about economic success, social stability, a higher quality of life, and more job opportunities. We hope that such efforts will help deepen bilateral cooperation while also adhering to the principles of reciprocity and mutual assistance. To encourage Taiwanese businesses to invest in the DR and form partnerships with local companies, we have introduced concrete administrative measures and offered incentives under the Regulations Governing Financial Assistance to Encourage Business Entrepreneurs to Invest in Countries Having Diplomatic Ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan). Several investment mechanisms have also been established, including overseas investment financing and credit guarantees by the International Cooperation and Development Fund and the Overseas Community Affairs Council, as well as an overseas investment loan fund set up by the Overseas Export-Import Bank of the ROC. These efforts have not only contributed to Taiwan's industrial development and greater global presence, but have also increased our diplomatic allies' national strengths and contributed to our diplomatic synergy. Given that both our countries enjoy geographic advantages, Taiwan could serve as the gateway to Asia for Dominican products, while the DR could serve as our bridge to the Latin American market, thereby creating a win-win situation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact will the election of have on regional and Mexican politics?</h4><p>We are, as a matter of principal, respectful of the democratic processes of every country. It is in this sense that we will discuss the economic policy measures to be implemented in the US in the coming year. We will have to wait and see if all the proposals made during the campaign are indeed translated into economic policymaking. In any case, we must be aware of the possibility of a renegotiation of the NAFTA and how discussions about immigration control and border security might change in the US, since these are central to President Trump's agenda. In the following months, we will observe the orientation of various migration issues. This includes: the policy toward documented migrants already living in the US; the actions and programs around the estimated 12 million undocumented migrants living there; and the policy on the separation of families by deporting undocumented members. </p><h4>Are Mexico's wide-ranging economic reforms consistent with the UN's agenda for 2030?</h4><p>The structural reforms represent an opportunity for the Mexican economy to reach economic growth rates above 2.5% in the coming years, as well as reduce poverty. A less dynamic economic scenario makes these reforms even more necessary. One of the aims of the structural reforms is to improve wages and increase employment, which will impact outmigration and generate opportunities for renewed dialog with the new US administration. Greater efficiency, production, and formal employment that is well paid is the key to strengthening domestic demand. Telecommunications sector reform has already contributed to the entry of new players and reduced tariffs. Meanwhile, financial reform has led to an increase in credit and investment, and tax reform has succeeded in increasing public revenues in line with the UN's focus on domestic resource mobilization for development. </p><h4>In contrast to stagnant GDP growth in most of Latin America, Mexico is expected to reach 3% in 2017. What factors have enabled it to do this?</h4><p>ECLAC estimates that in 2016 the Mexican economy will expand by 1.9%, below the 2.5% registered in 2015. Among the factors that directly affect this deceleration are: the negative performance of the US manufacturing sector (highly linked to Mexican exports); international economic and financial instability; and the decline in public revenues (mainly from oil) and public spending, which led to a slowdown in domestic consumption in the second half of 2016. In 2017, the ECLAC estimates economic growth of around 2.2% because of a slight improvement in external demand, mainly from the US, which is expected to be offset by lower investment and public spending as a consequence of lower public oil revenues. We must be attentive to the evolution of US economic policy measures and their impact on the Mexican economy. </p><h4>What differentiates the Dominican Republic from many of its neighboring Caribbean nations in terms of its political and economic structure?</h4><p>Despite the slowdown in global growth, trade, and investment flows around the world, the Dominican economy has continued to grow at noteworthy rates. This is due to a variety of factors. On the external side, despite the increased uncertainty in international financial markets, FDI to the economy has remained strong, and the government continues to see an over-subscription for its sovereign bond issuances. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What direction is the Dominican Republic's foreign policy taking it?</h4><p>The Chancellery should play a more active role when it comes to management, not only encouraging bilateral political dialogue with different nations and regions, but also contributing through cooperation, commerce, and investment, which are fundamental objectives of the chancellery. One of the first schemes we implemented was in the Netherlands and its territories in the Caribbean such as Aruba, Curacao, and Saint Martin. We have also negotiated an agreement to promote commerce with Haiti, which has been making progress. Other countries have also taken an interest in establishing preferential agreements with us such as Cuba, Chile, Paraguay, and Colombia. In the first quarter of 2017, we will have a mission from the Cuban government that will come to the country to implement this agreement as quickly as possible. We have also initiated talks with Chile and Paraguay.</p><h4>An agreement was recently signed between the US, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic to modernize the border. What will the impact of this be? </h4><p>This project is important, and the impact will be significant for the development of the border and the living standards of citizens. Creating conditions for the development of bi-national companies will create employment and an industrial barrier to migration. In December 2016, we signed an agreement in Laredo, Texas, which was attended by the US.</p><h4>What effects will the air transport pre-authorization agreement for travelers from the US have?</h4><p>We signed an agreement in November 2016 with the US for immigration and customs pre-checking, which will have a significant influence on tourism and the country's economy. This means we are the first Spanish-speaking country to enjoy this facility, and the seventh country worldwide. We started with the airport of Punta Cana, which fulfilled all the requirements and had requested participation at the beginning of the initiative. This could be established in other airports of the country that request it and meet the requirements. Every person who leaves to the US from Punta Cana will have their papers in order for customs and immigration, which also makes things easier for the traveler. We will also be able to fly to airports that we previously had no access to, including 65 additional cities.</p><h4>What new efforts are being made to attract investment and boost the country's image abroad?</h4><p>We have been holding numerous bilateral meetings such as the EU CELAC summit, where we implemented bilateral unions with nearly all the countries that attended. Additionally, we created the right conditions to focus on different aspects of cooperation, investment, commerce, and tourism. It was a privileged scenario for such negotiations. We also had different encounters in the UN General Assembly that were favorable to the promotion of tourism, commerce, investment, and cooperation, not to mention CELAC and Russia. Furthermore, our commercial offices inside our embassies and consulates around the world are essential to these objectives.</p><h4>What is the role of the Dominican Republic in the region, and what actions are being carried out to increase its sphere of influence?</h4><p>2016 was our turn to temporarily take on the presidency of CELAC. With the 23 countries that form Latin America and the Caribbean, we made a joint effort to reinforce ourselves regionally and with Europe, Russia, and China. They are favorable for regional economic growth.</p><h4>What is your vision for the economic future of the country?</h4><p>We need to continue strengthening our political security. If we could bring more investment, we would be able to continue this sustainable development. Our treaties have contributed to our strengthening in commerce, and today we can see this reflected in a commercial balance of USD11.34 billion with the US, our largest commercial partner. Even though it was difficult at first, we have made significant progress. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the CARICOM agreement helped to increase trade and commerce between Jamaica and the Dominican Republic and contributed of the development of the region in general?</h4><p>CARICOM is an important arrangement. The Dominican Republic is not a part of CARICOM and its main form of interaction with CARICOM is via the trade agreement. We view it as extremely important and Jamaica supports CARICOM in this situation. We have been leading our trade negotiations between the region and Europe and it has been helpful, particularly in the transitioning away from sugar for many countries within the Caribbean region. It has also given us the opportunity to create dialog on a bilateral basis with the Dominican Republic. We see the Dominican Republic as part of a larger Caribbean market that includes Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti. It is a significant market that does not operate in the sense of trade bloc but could potentially develop into a trade bloc with the loosening of trade and diplomatic issues between the US and Cuba. Jamaica has taken a positive view of the Dominican Republic as a potential trade partner. I will visit the Dominican Republic on an official visit sometime in April. I have made direct attempts to interact and interface with the government of the Dominican Republic and within CARICOM we are in agreement that there should be greater interface and engagement with them. There is quite a bit for us to share and develop. </p><h4>What opportunities are there to increase trade and commerce activities between Jamaica and the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We have great interest from the Dominican Republic in investments in Jamaica and we welcome them. We will look at how we can cooperate in tourism and develop an agreement about multi-destination tourism. Tourism is the biggest driver of economic growth in this region; 29 million visitors came to the region last year and it is projected to grow significantly. We have not truly sat down as a community to figure out how we will grow the sector. We compete against each other but need to work together to grow the competitive field. That is an area where Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, two of the leading tourism areas in the Caribbean, could have a positive outcome if we work together. When I go to the Dominican Republic, this is one area that we will look at. The question is how we can attract more people to our country and have the region open up for them so that they have options. When tourists come to the region we want them to have an easy time shuttling between Jamaica and the Dominican Republic; the idea is to have a multi-destination strategy to market the Caribbean. We can have strong links with the Dominican Republic. There are other areas of cooperation that could work as well. Jamaica has a solid financial system that works hard to be compliant with all regulations. We have a stock market that has a deep history and we can offer financial products and business services to the Dominican Republic as its financial sector emerges. There are options there with strong cooperation. In the business process outsourcing sector, Jamaica has great potential there and it is an option for investment by people coming in from the Dominican Republic. There are great options between us for foreign investment.</p><h4>What regional issues are the most pressing and should be pushed to solve?</h4><p>Tourism is a major economic driver and every step must be taken to protect tourism. The Caribbean cannot be oblivious to the global threats. A part of dealing with the multi-destination strategy must be the security of the region. Many of the countries in the region suffer from high debt; Jamaica in particular has a large debt and fiscal constraints. There needs to be a rethinking of the way the international and multilateral community deals with middle-income countries that have high levels of debt. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>We have achieved what seemed impossible; 7% growth for three consecutive years. As indicated by the central bank, our country's growth between 2013 and 2016 has been eight times larger than CEPAL's average growth estimate for Latin America. In four years, our economy has grown 1.5 times more than what we proposed in our 2012-2016 government program. Above all, the Dominican Republic has grown in optimism, self-esteem, and equality, since growth is reaching more and more people every year.</p><p>This model has allowed us to move more than 900,000 Dominicans out of poverty, more than any other four-year government in 153 years. This model also allowed us to surpass our 400,000 new jobs target, having created 462,000 new positions by July 2016. Our middle class grew 9.3%, and now encompasses 30% of the entire Dominican population; this new middle class will receive a special boost to make sure that it consolidates, receives a decent income, and abandons a condition of vulnerability. This is the result of economic stability, but in order to incorporate more and more Dominican families we have to continue exhibiting the excellent macroeconomic indicators we currently have as a nation.</p><p>The country's economic expansion has been achieved through price stability and the reduction of non-financial public deficit. Average inflation during the 2013-2016 period was set at an annual 2.5%, constituting the lowest historical average for a four-year period in 46 years. In addition, the country's balance of payments checking account deficit was reduced by approximately five percentage points, from -6.6% to -1.9% by the end of 2015. FDI during the 2012-2015 period maintained an average annual flow of USD2.4 billion, making the Dominican Republic the main FDI destination in Central American and the Caribbean. The country's remarkable performance was reflected in a significant drop in country risk, an indicator associated with international investor perceptions of risk and economic security—lower than the regional average.</p><p>It should also be noted that the Dominican Republic settled all of its commitments with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This means that since 1975, it is the first time the nation has no pending debt with the IMF. This was recognized by the organization through a letter of congratulation to the country.<br></p><p>All of these facts and figures are important for two reasons; first, they are the base on which we can build a stable country with employment, well-being, and progress. Second, these benefits are actually reaching people and changing their lives for the better. We hope to continue to achieve this growth in the coming years in the service of the entire Dominican people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the strategies behind GeoPark's aggressive drilling at a time when exploration investments overall have been down in Colombia?</h4><p>We had a challenging 1Q2016. Several activities were conducted in order to mitigate the effects of lower oil prices. In this sense and although we delayed our drilling campaign by several months, it was considerably re-started earlier than many companies in oil industry. We were successful at drilling in the Jacana field, with consecutive success in three wells. We also had a workover campaign that increased our production. Consequently, the results we got were moving the boundaries of Jacana fields, so we began extending them into the northwest. In that sense, the target of increasing our reserves will probably be achieved. Of course, we are happy with the results: a 100% success rate in the 2016 drilling campaign, reaching the top benchmark of the industry. Altogether, these wells are producing approximately 2,000 barrels out of a total 34,000-35,000 barrels per day that we are currently operating. Therefore, the Jacana field is bringing us positive results. Several tests and activities will be developed in this area in order to boost our production for 2017 and coming years.</p><h4>Colombia needs an estimated USD7 billion annually over ten years to maintain exploration operations and production levels. With a 2016 budget of USD3.5 billion, how can this gap be closed?</h4><p>It is not going to be closed, or at least not in the near future. Exploration levels have certainly decreased and, of course, reserves are getting closer and closer to their limits. Unless there are more incentives for the company to invest in this environment—including social and financial encouragement—then companies will not invest what the country needs to catch up with its needs. But, as they say, better late than never. Looking at the results of seismic studies and the number of wells being drilled, it is unlikely there will be aggressive exploration or that there are enough economic signs from either regulators or the general financial environment for people to risk it and explore. But every company has its moment, so despite what the rest of the industry is doing, we will continue to move forward.</p><h4>What are some specific regulatory changes that would encourage investment in this field?</h4><p>There are two opportunities right now, the first of which is tax reform. This could be a game changer for the industry, considering that Colombia's state take is approximately 70%, probably the highest rate in the region. We are aware of the government's income needs, but we trust that equitable solutions will be found to encourage the oil industry to continue taking risk in Colombia. The second opportunity is of course the new bidding rounds, but the new regulations and the rounds themselves have been announced for months now without much result. Once the final regulatory draft is issued, we will be able to determine our participation. We consider that there are still enough opportunities in Colombia for companies of our size to move ahead.</p><h4>If a newly negotiated peace deal is eventually implemented, what effects do you expect to see in the energy sector?</h4><p>Our operators are out in the field and not in the cities. Depending on the area, you feel the presence of different groups, so the industry is definitely going to be affected by the changes from any decision that is made. It is hard to speculate on what is going to happen next. However, we have a strong social responsibility with our neighbors and with the territory in which we operate, so we should be responsible for working jointly with the authorities in whatever scenario that is. Of course peace is better than war, but it is going to take a while.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Colombia in regard to its shale and offshore resources?</h4><p>Colombia needs to open new areas to exploration. Exploring the Pacific was an option, but previous rounds were not very successful. Colombia needs more offshore exploration, for which regulations has been successfully enacted. Then there is shale, which only a few companies have committed to explore. There are still regulatory, environmental and social concerns, but if we want to continue extending the bounds of our self-sufficiency, we are going to have to find an alternative, and shale gas seems a quicker solution than offshore. However, it is more expensive and a lot more controversial. In any case, it won't be economical until the price picks up.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of the FIRS over the past year?</h4><p>In the last year, we have reached 99% coverage in terms of administering taxes. Within this period also, we have been able to identify a large number of corporate organizations that were not in the tax net. In 2015 alone, added about 100,000 new taxpayers' accounts. We know these new taxpayers and several others have a backlog of penalty and interest. To address this and ease the burden of tax payment for those who have not been complying, we decided, following requisite approvals with a tax amnesty scheme, we waived penalties and interest for late returns and late tax payments for the years 2013 to 2015 for all taxpayers. The tax amnesty scheme will also provide companies with an opportunity to make incremental payments for outstanding taxes, after an initial payment of 25%. We have also signed an MoU with State Boards of Internal Revenue Service and have agreed to work together on joint audits and joint taxpayer education and enlightenment through programs, training, and data sharing. In addition, we have deployed the use of technology and this has increased the level of compliance and transparency. What we utilize presently is a technology that directly sweeps VAT from the aviation and power sectors into Federal accounts. We have also installed systems in all of the state governmental bodies so that any federal tax that is due from any state government can be directly taken by the Federal authorities. We have also reorganized FIRS to become more customer-oriented, giving taxpayers the opportunity to choose the location of where they could file their returns. Prior to this, taxpayers had to travel for an hour or more to sort out their tax issues. Now, they can choose a location that is more convenient for them. We are also positioning our staff to make sure they can provide the type of service delivery that taxpayers expect. We have deployed communication campaigns on VAT in all the major Nigerian languages of Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, as well as Pidgin English on radio and television. We have also given our staff all of the equipment and work tools necessary, from vehicles to computers, to ensure that, apart from having a conducive environment to work in they also have all that is required to do their jobs well.</p><h4>You are the Chairman of the African Tax Administrations Forum. How can collaboration among African tax bodies impact taxation on the continent?</h4><p>The mandate of ATAF is first of all to promote taxation in Africa. It is there to build capacity among all the African tax administrators. Presently, it is made up of about 38 African countries. We also have council members and a chairman who is elected. At the last General Assembly Meeting, for the first time, Nigeria was elected, and, of course, being the Executive Chairman of the FIRS, I was elected on behalf of my country. Collaboration is key to improve awareness.</p><h4>What role does FIRS play in the socioeconomic development of the country?</h4><p>Our main focus truly is on revenue generation. When it comes to current expenditure, I certainly believe Nigerians know that the present government has their best interest at heart. What we do is to provide revenue, particularly non-oil revenue to enable the government fund its programs and provide the dividends of democracy. Nigeria is a federation. There is the Joint Tax Board, JTB—an umbrella body for all the tax authorities in the country. The FIRS Chairman is also the Chairman of JTB. FIRS worked with the State Boards on Internal Revenue, under the JTB, to add about 3.4 million new taxpayers to the individual taxpayers' roll for all states. These new taxpayers are for states. This JTB did under six months. What this means is that the national taxpayers' roll came to about 13 million, the first time in Nigeria.</p><h4>What will be the key reforms to be implemented in 2017?</h4><p>Our objective is to make taxation the financial bedrock of Nigeria such that we no longer rely on revenue from oil or other oil sources. Currently, we have been able to derive 70% of our revenue from non-oil source and we believe that in 2017, revenue collection from non-oil source will go up to 80%. In terms of our relationship with the taxpaying public, we intend to work so that they will accept us as a service-oriented organization that is mandated to fund the government.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the changes that have occurred in Kazakhstan's economy in the last decade?</h4><p>There have been several stages of development in the Kazakhstani economy. Due to the high investment activity of domestic and foreign capital and the consistent implementation of socio-economic reforms in the first half of the 2000s, the economy of Kazakhstan grew rapidly during that period (real GDP growth for 2000-2006 was 10.3% on average). However, such rapid growth strengthened the raw material orientation of the economy and increased its vulnerability to external shocks. During the 2008 crisis, growth slowed to 1.2% in 2009 and spread across all sectors, which was accompanied by a drop in domestic demand and falling investment. The main drivers of economic growth during this period were government measures to stabilize the economy and support the financial sector. The macroeconomic situation in 2010-13 gradually began to stabilize as a result of the recovery of the global economy and growing demand for Kazakhstan's basic export goods. From 2014 to the present, Kazakhstan's economy experienced significant shocks from falling oil prices, reduced exports, and a depreciation of the national currency. The situation was further exacerbated by geopolitical crises and the slowing economies of Kazakhstan's main trading partners, in particular Russia, the EU, and China. In 1Q2016, real annual GDP contracted by 0.1% for the first time after the 2009 crisis. However, the measures taken by the government within the framework of anti-crisis programs to stimulate and diversify the economy partially offset the impact of shocks, maintaining employment and contributing to the development of non-oil sectors. According to preliminary statements from the Ministry of National Economy, in 2016 the economy grew by 1%. Such sectors as construction industry, agriculture, manufacturing, transport had a significant contribution to the positive dynamics of the GDP. In addition, growth of investment in fixed capital financed by both the government and the private sector remains high. The dynamics of domestic consumption indicate a gradual adaptation of the population and businesses to the new economic conditions. In general, we can talk about a transition to a gradual recovery of the economy, however this trend is unstable and depends largely on the stability of the external economic environment.</p><h4>How is the situation with the de-dollarization of the economy progressing?</h4><p>In January 2016, our statistics showed the share of FX-denominated deposits of individuals amounted to 80%: no one trusted the tenge and people were converting their savings to dollars. In that situation, monetary policy became ineffective and credit channels and the state securities market did not work, meaning no one knew the tenge price. At that point, NBK started providing concrete measures to restore confidence in the tenge. First, we increased the recommended interest rate for tenge deposits from 10-14% and reduced the recommended interest rate on FX-denominated deposits from 3-2%. After some confidence was restored in the oil market as prices gradually increased, the tenge started to appreciate. Between January 2016 and January 2017, the tenge appreciated by 16%. People see tenge deposits as a more appropriate instrument to save money. Overall the share of FX-denominated deposits was 70% in January 2016 and at the end of 2016 it was 55%, so tenge deposits grew by KZT3.3 trillion over the last year while FX-denominated deposits decreased by KZT1.1trillion which is roughly equivalent to USD3.2 billion. We analyzed the experiences of other countries and found that many countries that had a high level of dollarization took many years to achieve the same results. For example, in Turkey changes in the deposits dollarization of 10 percentage points were seen only within five years. My task is to bring this value back to the historical levels of 40% dollar-denominated deposits.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the consolidation talks in the banking sector?</h4><p>GDP volume in dollar terms in 2014 was roughly USD221 billion, which fell to around USD133 billion in 2016. This represents a dramatic decline of more than USD80 billion in just two years. Therefore, room for business activity has decreased significantly, which is why we talk about this consolidation, not only in the financial sector but also in construction, mining, and other sectors. The situation has changed and business models that were successful last decade no longer work. The period of easy money has ended, so there is a need to find additional capital injections for the banks to provide liquidity. If a company does not have funds, it needs to consider some options to merge its assets and the distribution of the market to achieve some effect of optimizing and reducing cost through optimizing management and others. Consolidation of the banking sector is therefore inevitable. However, I would like to mitigate the risks as some players might start an aggressive policy of attracting deposits of individuals' assets to try to save their institutions on the market. This is why I recommended being more careful in terms of asset allocation and providing more safeguards in such conditions.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the domestic economy over the medium term and in which sectors of the economy do you see the biggest growth and development potential?</h4><p>The NBK estimates growth of the Kazakhstani economy in 2017 to be 1.5-2%, with oil prices set at USD40 per barrel. The positive—but still quite weak—trend in 2017-18 reveals the slow adaptation of the economy to the new economic reality. The economy will operate below its potential level until 1Q2018, reflecting deflationary pressures from domestic demand side. External demand is expected to be in the positive zone with respect to its potential by mid-2018, primarily due to the acceleration of economic activity in Europe and Russia, which will have a positive impact on the exports of Kazakhstan. In addition to the oil sector, there are industries whose contribution to GDP dynamics remained stable over the past few years. Among sectors with significant potential are agriculture and agro-industrial complex, in particular the development of animal husbandry, food production, and light and textile industries. In addition, our geographic location creates opportunities to improve transport and logistics infrastructure and develop our transit potential. Projects in these areas will attract foreign investments, particularly those of strategic partners such as China, Russia, India, Iran, and others. Currently, the government is actively involved in the development of potential sectors of the economy through financing the enterprises of the real sector at the expense of budgetary funds, supporting small and medium-sized businesses.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017 and what will the main focus of the NBK be?</h4><p>The main objective of NBK's monetary policy is to ensure price stability. In 2017 we set the inflation target range at 6-8%. The main tasks are to overhaul the monetary policy instruments, as well as to create the pleasant conditions for lending recovery. Key measures will be taken to strengthen the role of the base rate. Moreover, the question about the clarification of the target rate in the money market will be considered. In order to adequately reflect the cost of money in the economy, the official refinancing rate will be equalized to the base rate. In addition, reserve requirements mechanism will be improved. NBK plans to continue working on the formation of the risk-free yield curve, which is an indicator of market expectations on interest rates. NBK will continue to issue its own securities—NBK notes—with various maturities. If necessary, it will use its own portfolio of government securities for the purchase and sale of government bonds on the secondary market. Along with short-term notes and the auction for the purchase of securities with reverse sale (credit auction), NBK plans to introduce deposit auctions as part of open market operations. We are also highly focused on communication. We will continue to work on the disclosure of information on monetary policy directions, publishing decisions about the base rate and other instruments, also explaining the rationale behind the decisions. In addition, NBK will continue to publish forecasts of the main macroeconomic variables and analytical and statistical information, as well as the results of conducted research.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The latest edition of the International Water Summit just took place in January 2017. How would you assess the event's contributions to the work and promotion of ADSSC?</h4><p>This was the sixth edition of the International Water Summit, and it has become larger year after year. As part of the World Future Energy Summit (WFES) that summons some of the top speakers in the sector, we find it a great platform to promote the work of ADSSC, our projects, and our commitment to the development of the conscientious use of utilities in the country. Part of our activities in the event included a stand in the exhibition, managerial presence to inform people about what is happening at ADSSC, and an opportunity to build up relationships with international suppliers and contractors who attend the summit. ADSSC also participates in some of the presentations and panel discussions. We use the event to help promote our investment program with the intention of finding synergies with other like-minded institutions and companies. It is a great PR event to introduce the newest technologies available in the industry. Moreover, it is an ideal platform for Abu Dhabi to showcase its achievements regarding wastewater and water usage, which are particularly important for the country.</p><h4>The deadline for the ADSSC Master Plan was recently met. What have been the major changes brought about by this plan? </h4><p>The main idea of the master plan is to look at the continued growth of Abu Dhabi and what its future needs are in terms of meeting customer requirements. This includes the capacity within the network and treatment plants, and where we need to develop our capability. One area of emphasis is SCADA, which is a data collection and instrumentation tool that allows us to evaluate the performance of our system. The outcome of this evaluation helps to optimize our investment plans to those sectors where they are needed the most. Another major element we picked up from the master plan is the incorporation of a new KPI in our contracts to look specifically at our carbon footprint and the importance of introducing green energies. We are big energy users for the sole nature of our business, so this implementation aims to establish an innovative approach to working with our partners in Abu Dhabi, as well as with international contractors, to improve our practices in that regard. Another part of the plan was to improve our customer services by raising our standards and increasing our capacity of response. Although not part of our master plan, we aim to extend the customer understanding about what we do and educate them via open days, school visits, and community talks to enhance the awareness about the environmental friendly use of utilities.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the approach of the average person to efficient water usage and how do you encourage a more conscious use of water utilities?</h4><p>Most people do not think too hard about the utilities they use, including water. Concerns only arise whenever there is a problem in receiving the service. We still have an important role to play in conveying to people that water is a limited resource and that its usage has a huge impact on the environment. One of the ways to do this is to make water valuable to consumers by charging a realistic price for it. A cost reflective charge makes people more careful about how they can stop wasting resources like water and power. We seek to get people to understand this through education and the interaction with community groups. The increase in water tariffs has already resulted in a reduction in water usage, but the numbers still need to go further down. ADSSC's flow has dropped in the last two years, but it has been more due to the downturn in the economy than the reduction in tariff supplement. We also work with other partners such as Masdar to develop new technologies, reduce energy costs, and utilize any waste products that come out of the process. We have made a great start, but we can make further improvements with continued cooperation.</p><h4>One of your flagship projects is the Strategic Tunnel Enhancement Program (STEP), which is reaching completion. How will STEP enhance your performance in the market?</h4><p>STEP has been a feature of ADSSC since we started in work on it in 2008. Construction work started with our first tunnel contract in 2009. At the moment we are at the tail-end phase of its construction, which ran a little longer than anticipated due to construction issues at the pumping station. The pumping station is now substantially complete and we have now successfully introduced sewage on a small scale to test some of the pumps and technology. We expect the station to be fully operational by the last quarter of 2017. The next phase entails the decommissioning of 35 pumping stations that are associated with STEP and the sewerage systems. This project pushes pumping standards to the limit in terms of size and volumes and is a major global scale achievement for Abu Dhabi. We are confident that commissioning will be completed in the next few months and that it will be fully operational by the end of 2017. Once completed, STEP will have a huge impact in terms of reducing the carbon footprint with our calculations showing that the new pumping station will be much more efficient than the 35 pumping stations it replaces.</p><h4>One of the biggest novelties introduced by STEP is groundbreaking technology thus far unseen in this market. Can you tell us more about these technologies and how they will add to energy efficiency?</h4><p>STEP involves a standard gravity system that has been already proven but that is different in terms of scale. Only around half a dozen manufacturers in the world can make the pumps we have brought in for this project. On top of that, the state of the art control systems will ensure effective pump management and maintenance. The power to run the pumps requires us to have our own sub-station, along with our own large standby generators in case we have a failure in the electricity grid system. STEP has 42km of gravity tunnel with a pumping station at the end and another 43km of linked sewers of up to 3m in diameter that feed into the main tunnel. The tunnel is 85m below ground at the deepest point and this technology is entirely gravity-based and will replace the 35 pumping stations in the current system. This centralized system with a deep sewer gravity tunnel was first used in Singapore and we have adopted a similar approach but with changes to match the needs of Abu Dhabi and the UAE as whole. This project will serve Abu Dhabi for over 80 years.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi has a target of 100% recycled water by 2018. With less than two years to the deadline, how feasible is this target?</h4><p>We have received approval for the design of three major pipelines to be put in for treated sewage effluent (TSE), which is the irrigation water. These contracts will start in 2017 and the aim is to have them completed by the end of 2018. Our intention is definitely to achieve as close to 100% recycled water use as technically possible throughout the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. We know the demand is there and we will have 100% recycled water to all intents and purposes by the time the deadline was set.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Total Zambia's performance over the past year?</h4><p>Total Zambia performed reasonably across several areas in 2016. The first is safety. Fortunately, we did not record any fatalities within the scope of our business in Zambia in 2016, and we can be proud of that result as our trucks covered over 20 million kilometers by road, and this was achieved through tight links with Zambian registered transporters, the implementation of an adequate safety management system, and regular interactions. This approach ensured security for goods and human beings, reduced the number of on road accidents, reduced negative environmental impacts, and guaranteed the quality of products sold to our final customer. Safety for us is not just an utmost priority, but rather a value within our group, and as such 10% of our staff strength is dedicated to health, safety, environment, and quality. We are also an active member of the Global Road Safety Program (GRSP) Zambia, which aims to improve road safety among Zambia's growing youth population, through a road map endorsed by the government for partnership with “Cherise Children's Road Safety Park." The second is business. Economic factors meant the year on the whole was tough. The Zambian economy faced a lot of challenges. These included low commodity prices for products such as copper, electricity deficits, high inflation for most part of the year, a deteriorated external sector, and the government's challenge to fully finance its commitments. Hence GDP growth was 3% against a target of 5%. With a long history and deep roots in the country,  and the requisite expertise and personnel, Total Zambia was able to navigate this challenging environment, remaining the market leader in the oil marketing sector and strengthening its leadership position in the market by growing from 23% in 2015 to 24.2% in 2016. This was achieved thanks to our strong investment and aggressive growth strategy in Zambia's downstream market, which led to us to record steady growth in the retail sector. Unlike its international oil major peers (IOCs), Total Group is present with consolidated downstream affiliates in all SADC Countries and is a shareholder of Natref Petroleum Refiners of South Africa (Pty) Limited ('Natref'). This refinery was commissioned in 1971, and is the only inland crude oil refinery located in Sasolburg, Free State Province, in South Africa.</p><h4>In addition to retail, which other sectors represent key areas of growth for Total's business in Zambia?</h4><p>After retail, the two key sectors are agriculture and transport. Developments in agriculture tie in with the government's targeted strategic approach in the next five years to diversify the economy. What is more, because of Zambia's location at the heart of SADC and COMESA, transport needs to be boosted in order to successfully link the country up with its neighbors. The government's plans see Zambia become a hub for the sub-region, with all products, goods, and services in transit to neighboring countries passing through here. The government confirmed their emphasis will be on the construction of roads that support economic growth and foster regional trade as well as feeder roads and bridges to ensure connectivity for the farming communities to markets. In line with this, Total has plans to harness the opportunities in this sector with tailor made offers such as our Integrated Services Approach which removes the burden of fuel management off the client, thus the client can focus on her core business and is guaranteed high safety level on site, high quality of products, availability of products through reliable supply chains, and value added services which brings improved cost management and savings. We have also introduced the Total Card, a rechargeable, electronic card for purchase of fuel and goods in Total stations, perfect for fleet management, as it reduces the incidence of fraud associated with buying fuel, and improves the safety of personnel by removing risks associated with carrying cash.</p><h4>Do you see also the aviation sector picking up in the next year?</h4><p>With the government's determination to boost tourism in Zambia by implementing the Tourism Development Fund, which will support tourism products development, tourism infrastructure and tourism marketing, this should reverse the trend noticed in the last couple of years that led to major international carriers like British Airways and KLM aborting this route. Also with the planned reforms in the petroleum downstream sector, I expect a collaborative review of the supply and distribution scheme of aviation fuel with the stakeholders to address any weak points and offer solutions to strengthen supply of aviation fuel to all airports within the country at competitive prices. Lastly the Ministry of Transport continues to discuss developments at KKIA International Airport, and there are plans underway for infrastructural projects in Ndola and in Kafue. In 2018, these benefits should trickle down into the system and we should see the aviation market doubling.</p><h4>What makes Zambia an important region for Total's overall operations?</h4><p>Zambia is an integral part of  Total's history in Africa. We have had a presence here for 67 years now and we operated Indeni refinery which is the only refinery in Zambia between 2002 and 2009, a government-owned holding in which we had a 50% share. From a business point of view, we also see Zambia as one of the countries in Africa that will experience exponential growth. Under its present administration, Zambia can realize its economic potential in the coming years. As a fast growing company mobilized around a deep transformation journey, we have been preparing for this: we recently commissioned a world class invariants compliant fuel depot in Lusaka, investing USD7 million in total in the project. Furthermore, our conviction that real growth will come from rural areas has led us, in the last three years, to spend over USD30 million purchasing and reconstructing sites in these outlying areas that lack fueling stations. As of today, we have about 52 active sites across the whole country. However, we are not stopping there, and in 2017 we have plans to invest USD12 million in constructing and buying new stations in rural and urban areas. We continue to develop expertise and build up the capacities of the communities where we operate, with initiatives such as the Total Young Dealer Scheme, the Total Young Graduate Program, and the Total Start Upper Challenge for Young Entrepreneurs. We are also an active member of the Business-Linkages program, organized by PEP-Zambia and aimed at reinforcing links between SMEs and larger companies.</p><h4>How have petrol subsidies had an impact on your business in general?</h4><p>We noticed a sharp drop of about 15% in volume at our retail outlets when subsidies were lifted in October and prices increased. However, I am confident that the government will soon put palliative measures in place to protect the purchasing power of Zambian citizens, and, therefore, this lower demand should not affect us in the long term. Lifting the subsidies will also allow the government to invest its budget more wisely. This is further supported by the government announcing its planned exit from the market and also change in pump price policy, prices shall now be revised upwards or downwards every 60 days. Factors to be considered will be exchange rate and oil price on the international market.</p><h4>What plans does Total have for 2017 to diversify into other markets?</h4><p>We plan to strengthen our footprints in renewable energy. Our vision is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, especially for the low income population as we know that there are 1.1 billion people in the world without access to electricity, and 2.9 billion people without access to clean cooking solution. We shall continue to foster partnerships with big players in other sectors like Lafarge. The Awango Lafarge dual branded partnership in Zambia allowed the Cement Company to install mobile shops in our service stations. Since Total and Lafarge are both market leaders in their respective industries, we saw an opportunity to grow sales of solar lamps and cement distribution points across both networks. Most of our service stations will be 100% solar-powered within five years. This is part of Total Group's initiative to solarize 5,000 Total service stations in the world by 2021. We also have our sights on the second round of the Scaling Solar project, hoping to work with the government to come up with renewable energy through solar at the right rate. Finally, Total Zambia is in partnership with Emerging Cooking Solutions, a company committed to replacing charcoal for cooking with waste biomass pellets powered by healthy and high-performing stoves, thereby providing a more environmentally friendly solution which in the long run is also mere economical.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Schlumberger's results from 4Q2016 show a revenue increase despite global volatility on the commodities market, partly due to strong testing and process activity for reservoir characterization in Kuwait. What was behind these activities?</h4><p>The last two years were challenging, as they were for any other company in the oil and gas industry. The effects on the Middle East were not as dramatic as in North and Latin America. In fact, the activities in Kuwait have increased for us, party due to a tender we won from KOC to build early production facilities. We made our bids in the beginning of 2016, and we were awarded with three projects; one in heavy oil and the other two in Jurassic oil and gas. These projects are progressing well, and that is also the result of the great synergy between Schlumberger and Cameron, which became part of our company and has brought manufacturing expertise. We strive to deliver the first gas facility this year, and the second before the end of the year.</p><h4>Have you seen a strong appetite for new technology from KOC?</h4><p>KOC has always been thirsty for technologies, and for the past 78 years we have been in Kuwait, we have been a major supplier of technology in the country. It is my personal ambition to get Kuwait to be the first users of the new technologies that Schlumberger bring to the market. There have been several projects that we executed with KOC, where part of the technological development took place in collaboration with them, thus creating great value. For example, in directional drilling, we have deployed our PowerDrive, which increases the efficiency of drilling into these high temperature and high pressure reservoirs, delivering wells much faster. We have introduced new highway and broadband technologies to frack tight reservoirs and bring extra oil from existing wells, and we have received a number of awards from KOC for exceeding production expectation, mainly because we fracked wells that they had already given up on.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the future of the discovery of natural resources in Kuwait, especially as the number of rigs had been announced to grow from 80 to 120? Do you anticipate offshore drilling?</h4><p>Schlumberger and KOC have jointly developed a new seismic technology bringing a very high resolution for the sub surface geological formations. This has contributed to the discovery of the new fields in Kuwait, still mainly onshore. The offshore is not fully explored yet, but KOC is planning to venture into this and we happily join it on these explorations. There certainly will be rigs and other IPM activities. Offshore has not been the top priority for KOC for some time, though it is not the first time that Kuwait will be exploring the offshore; there have been some wells already drilled. KOC is currently looking into two rigs to be contracted, so we are awaiting the tender to come out.</p><h4>In December, OPEC producers agreed to cut production, leading Kuwait to reduce total output by 130,000bpd. What are your expectations for this agreement for the industry, and what is your strategy?</h4><p>We do not expect the strategy of KOC to change or that the activity will be affected with the new agreement. Post-agreement, most activities have been maintained. It is a challenging target for KOC to produce 4 million barrels in 2020, which is their main objective, so to steer in that direction, most activities are continuing. They could utilize the production cut as an opportunity to do some extra maintenance, but as far as surface and sub-surface activities for Schlumberger and for other service companies are concerned, there has not been much of an impact.</p><h4>Schlumberger has embarked on an ambitious global transformation plan to reduce inventory, increase asset utilization, increase human productivity, and decrease unit support costs. How does this plan translate into you strategy in Kuwait?</h4><p>The transformation itself is our CEO's vision. We want to be the best-run company in the entire world; not the best oil and Gas Company but best company in the whole world. Here, in Kuwait, we want to deliver the best service quality, and for that we are always looking at creating more efficiency and limiting any service issues that may arise. With the transformation plan, we are looking at every aspect of our operations, the procurement cycle and the organization. The lower oil price has incentivized us to increase our competitiveness. Although this Schlumberger initiative came before the global downturn in the market, we see there are a lot of improvements that we can make by following the program in our organization on the ground.</p><h4>How will the commitments made by the Kuwaiti government toward the Paris Agreement influence government policy?</h4><p>It has surprised me how quickly the government introduced initiatives here, and KOC has already inaugurated the solar electricity generation project to fuel the oil production operations. This project is the first of its kind in Kuwait and has the potential to drive other projects in the field of green power generation. The industry is one of the largest consumers in the country, and with well-organized projects, the energy cycle can be internalized with the usage of green energy.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p>Schlumberger operates 15 of its global business lines in Kuwait at the moment, and over the past three years we have added two more. The drilling rigs services is an integrated part of our portfolio. Today, the flagship project for Schlumberger is the Rig of the Future, which is intended to revolutionize the way and the efficiency of the drilling process. The prototype should be out in 1Q2017, and it is my ambition to have KOC be the first user. We have recently conducted a workshop for KOC and see good momentum and opportunity to have this new project here, as well as to showcase the robustness and efficiency of the new technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the firm offers a wide range of legal services in many areas, what are the main fields of activity for Al Yahyaei &amp; Salt in Oman?</h4><p>Al Yahyaei and Salt provides commercial litigation and dispute resolution services, as well as transactional/advisory legal services. On the conventional litigation and arbitration service side, we represents all the major financial institutions and several insurance companies in the Sultanate of Oman and provide them with top notch legal service in areas of civil and commercial litigation. On the transactional side of the practice, we have a fully staffed advisory department that advises businesses and institutions. Some of our clients in this area of practice include banks, the oil and gas sector, automobile distributors, insurance companies, universities, and mid-size private corporations. Our advisory service is usually needed in the areas of business formation, contract drafting and negotiations, taxation, intellectual property law, real estate, construction, and employment law. </p><h4>What are the key legal issues that businesses interested in coming to Oman need to understand before setting up operations here?</h4><p>Oman is a unique and promising market that has many advantages for many companies. First, in order to do business in Oman, a company must be formed. The company can be formed with a local partner holding equity in the company or it can be formed as a free zone company with no local partner. Second, once a company is formed, investors need to understand that Oman has a tax regime that does not differentiate between local and foreign companies. The tax rate is the same across the board at 12%. </p><h4>What can be done in the legal field to improve Oman's position as a preferred location in the region for international businesses? </h4><p>Now that Oman is witnessing unprecedented economic development and the size of commercial business-to-business transactions has exponentially multiplied, Oman needs strong, impartial, and fee-controlled commercial dispute resolution centers in Muscat. I also believe that businesses need to utilize the mechanism of arbitration more often to resolve disputes. Currently, many arbiter-able cases go to the court and resolution through conventional courts takes time. If such dispute resolution centers existed, we would be able to lift some of the pressure from the court system and resolve disputes efficiently. </p><h4>What competitive advantage does Al Yahyaei and Salt bring to the legal service market?</h4><p>We are known as top tier firm in the country, with high caliber attorneys and counselors. We are also in partnership with the Baitulhikma Law Firm. Baitulhikma is a prominent UAE firm with offices in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. We also have associations with offices in Turkey, Baghdad, Libya, India, Switzerland, United States, and Taiwan. Attorneys and staff in our offices speak more than ten languages. We have attorneys who speak Chinese, Dari, Dutch, French, Italian, Punjabi, Amhri, Swahili, English, and Arabic. With all these qualities, we offer legal services that are unmatched by any local firm. </p><h4>How does the firm utilize its numerous international partnerships to benefit its clientele?</h4><p>In addition to working in the GCC, our firm more often collaborates with international firms in cross-border transactions. For matters within the GCC, our firm works with the several offices Baitulhikma has, as well as a network of other local offices in areas where we do not have presence. In Oman, we have the network—we are the network. We maintain three offices in Oman: the main office in Muscat and branches in Salalah and Sohar. These three offices cover the Sultanate from Yemen to Al Birimi. With our vast network and partnerships, our clients are well served. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does RSM fit into the Omani market and how do you assess the evolution of your operations since its establishment?</h4><p>George Mathew &amp; Co has been operating as a chartered accountants firm in Oman since 1988 and presently changed its legal status to George Mathew LLC and is a member firm of RSM international, the sixth-largest global audit, tax, and consulting network, operating in 120 countries, from over 790 offices and a combined staff of over 41,400. RSM International being a global Network, we at RSM in Oman, George Mathew LLC, adopt all the RSM methodologies and techniques for audit and other professional services. George Mathew &amp; Co has been associated with international networks from the inception of the firm in Oman, including with Spicer &amp; Oppenheim, Arthur Young, and MSI. With effect from January 2011, George Mathew &amp; Co became a correspondent firm of RSM and from May 2014 has become a full member firm of RSM International in the Sultanate of Oman.</p><h4>How do you distinguish yourselves in such a competitive audit firm market and what type of clients are you targeting?</h4><p>George Mathew LLC's adoption of the RSM global standards, availability of expert consultants from the network worldwide, and personal attention by our senior professionals to the clients' needs are our distinct advantages. We are one of the few audit firms in Oman accredited by the Capital Market Authority of Oman, which entitles our firm to act as a statutory auditor of public joint stock companies, investment funds, licensed companies operating in the securities market, and insurance companies registered in Sultanate of Oman.<br>George Mathew LLC, with local and international expertise, targets the provision of services to entities in all major sectors, whether private or public, domestic, or foreign.</p><h4>What makes Oman considered a business-friendly economy, capable of attracting billions of dollars in direct and indirect foreign investment?</h4><p>Oman's economy has seen a steady transformation to a stable economic and financial destination. Oman has a business-friendly environment, a modern business law framework, respect for free markets, contract sanctity and property rights, and relatively low taxes. The government of Oman has steady and ambitious long-term investments in the country's infrastructure, including free zones, seaports, airports, rail, and roads, as well as in its healthcare and educational systems and facilities. Oman actively seeks foreign investment. Oman promotes higher education, manufacturing, healthcare, fisheries, transportation and logistics, mining, renewable energy, and tourism as areas for investment. The Public Authority for Investment Promotion and Export Development (Ithraa), the inward investment and export development agency, is tasked with attracting foreign investors and smoothing the path for business formation and private-sector development. Confidence of investors is reflected in the FDI inflows to Oman, increasing by 11% in 2015 as compared to the previous year. Oman is considered as one of the ideal destinations for FDI.</p><h4>With your experience in the market, is Oman walking on the right track toward economic diversification with initiatives like the 9th Five-Year Plan and Tanfeedh?</h4><p>The key goals of the 9th Five-Year Plan are to achieve an average annual GDP growth rate of 3%, create job opportunities, encourage SMEs, and activate public private partnerships (PPPs). The 9th Five Year Plan (2016-2020) maintains focus on economic diversification, welfare, and enhancement of social benefits, and at the same time drives to boost the private sector. To support this view, five prime sectors have been identified: manufacturing, transportation and logistics, tourism, fisheries, and mining. These five sectors represent untapped potential and the country's determination to diversify its economy. The National Programme for Enhancing Economic Diversification (Tanfeedh) is a working mechanism to achieve the goals of the 9th Five-Year Plan, and overcoming the obstacles, if any, facing economic diversification. The Tanfeedh program is an excellent opportunity to develop national talent and expertise, and to optimally utilize natural resources available in Oman. These initiatives are leading Oman to diversification, growth, employment generation, and reduction in dependence on oil. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[through-good-times-and-bad]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This was the first year for NTI's new campus. How has it worked to improve services offered and business overall?</h4><p>Moving to the new campus has been a long-term vision for us and it comes at the right time because the country is going through a hard time at the moment. Despite living in these difficult times, we have invested in our future and our new campus is a fit-for-purpose facility that is up to world-class standards. We also see the potential for capitalizing on this opportunity because this is a time when a nation should really focus on its people. Oman may have other natural resources like oil, mining, and fisheries, but it is people who make things happen. We are well situated to bridge this gap.</p><h4>What are some of the most in-demand and highly subscribed training programs at NTI?</h4><p>Our trainings are diverse and not really focused in one area simply because we operate in a smaller market. Therefore, we get clients from many different industries and segments. We need to cater to all of them, which is why we have a flexible model where we can quickly respond to the needs of the market and the needs of individual clients. </p><h4>Last year, you mentioned the difficulty in filling private-sector jobs because many people seek government positions. Has progress been made in combatting this?</h4><p>We are seeing a major change in mindset. We have about 300 people receiving vocational training with us in the center here, and they are quite conscious that jobs are precious. They are keen to take private-sector jobs. People are beginning to feel the pinch of these economic times. The private sector could be more attractive if it was more structured in its approach for emptying the local workforce. Over the years, it has managed operations using an expat group force, but the local workforce needs a different management structure. </p><h4>As the country takes more steps to diversify the economy, has there been an increase in the amount of non-oil and gas-related courses at NTI?</h4><p>We have seen a surge in the power sector and the need for workers in the construction sector has always been growing. Manufacturing is another industry that is next to power. We have not taken concrete steps toward development in the areas of tourism, mining, and agriculture; however, as momentum picks up in these sectors, we will respond. Before we were owned by Babcock, we had a sister company called the National Hospitality Institute and until now we had left tourism and hospitality to it. Now that we are owned by a different company; we are deciding whether or not we should pursue something in this sector.</p><h4>What are your expectations for NTI over the next 12 months?</h4><p>We are still dependent on the existing framework for training in the country, which is recruitment training followed by employment. Still, employment is crucial and we have to find employers. Under the current economic situation, this is difficult, as the number of new projects is not as high and the number of employers is slowly going down. If we continue to operate under the existing framework, we might have an issue with this. I am hopeful that people in positions of responsibility will see the need for developing their workforce, and get them ready for when things get better. They might need to change the framework a little for when the jobs come, which will have to happen eventually due to the large population coming out of schools and colleges. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Developing human capital has been a priority for the Sultanate since the 1970s. How did Oman's education system grow to more than 50 higher education centers?</h4><p>The development of human capital has been a key policy of the Omani government since the new renaissance of the Sultanate. In His Majesty's speeches from 1970 onward, he always emphasized human resources as a cornerstone for the development of Oman. General education as well as higher education has been funded generously by the government, and we now have more than 131,000 students enrolled inside and outside Oman. We have over 6,000 students studying at the government's expense overseas in different countries, such as US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Austria, or Ireland to name a few. It is a good sign that both students and parents in Oman value education and aspire for the best education whether inside or outside the country. That puts lots of pressure on the Ministry to deliver high-quality education and other services the students need. Not only the number of institutions increased, but also the number of students has jumped to more than 130,000 currently enrolled in higher education. With that figure, Oman has been the fastest country in human development from 1970 until now according to international reports.</p><h4>How do you align higher education programs with the needs of the labor market?</h4><p>We are always focused on the needs of the labor market, modifying our programs and introducing new ones accordingly in the local universities as well as providing licenses to feature new programs as a result of sound feasibility studies. Besides, the students sent on government scholarship to study programs abroad are needed by the private and the public sector. We try to read the market through surveys and official letters we send to government and non-government organizations. We ask about their needs for human resources and different specializations and plan our scholarships and licenses accordingly. Out of the 131,000 students studying in higher education, 30% are studying engineering.</p><h4>What initiatives are you implementing to boost cooperation between Omani universities and foreign academic and research centers?</h4><p>Most of our private universities and colleges have some sort of academic affiliation or cooperation with foreign universities. With such academic affiliation, local institutions get international expertise  to develop new programs. International collaborations with different universities and agencies are made as a criterion of quality. All Omani institutions strive for such collaboration and they heavily invest in academic and student exchange. In terms of research, the Research Council strategy has earmarked renewable energy, health and diseases, and oil and gas as top research priorities for the country.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future generations of the Sultanate who will need to find alternative sources to sustain Oman's growth?</h4><p>There are a lot of plans going on to diversify the economy. From the higher education side, our mission is to prepare Omanis to be independent learners to learn new skills and knowledge. Having graduates that are narrowly specialized in certain areas are not the right graduates for the future; graduates should be capable of expanding their education and learning new subjects in order to adapt to future changes in the economy. These are the kind of capabilities we are trying to emphasize in higher education so our graduates will not have any difficulties in finding jobs and adapting to upcoming challenges. Oman has come a long way in terms of education, but its ambitions are still high. We will continue working to have global Omani citizens who can compete in the international labor market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of the domestic pharmaceutical industry over the last year, and what more needs to be done?</h4><p>In the last year in the domestic pharmaceutical industry, there was a royal decree that regulated pharmaceutical work in Oman. This has given pharmacies double the space to sell non-prescription products, so they can generate more income. As a result, it has reduced the prices of a majority of drugs, some by more than 50%. There was a decision among GCC countries to unify the price of drugs in all member states. Oman had some of the highest prices for drugs in the region, and now prices are much cheaper. Our aim is to have more of this industry based in Oman. </p><h4>What are some of the new objectives pursued by the Ministry of Health as part of the government's ninth Five-Year Plan for the country?</h4><p>This is my sixth year as the Minster of Health and my goal is to improve the quality of healthcare in Oman. When I was appointed in 2010, the Ministry of Health had just over 4,000 doctors. Today, we have more than 8,000. The number of nurses and professionals has doubled as well. Between 2010 and 2015, we introduced 80 new clinical services, and we opened more than 16 health centers and facilities. We opened a cardiac center in Salalah, in Muscat, added a genetics center, and expanded the oncology center. We just signed a contract to build four facilities, and there are about 16 more in the pipeline to be built by the end of 2016. This is part of our plan, but our concentration is still building the capacity in human resources. </p><h4>Do you see the health sector as a good location for future PPPs in Oman?</h4><p>Absolutely. I would start with the medical city. It will be open for private investors to build, own, and operate there. At the moment, the private sector does not have the capacity to provide the services I want to buy. For example, we are still buying renal dialysis. We have units all across the country, but the demand is increasing. We want to encourage the private sector, but it is slow to respond. We started buying services from the private sector to encourage it to expand. Secondly, we provide it with statistical information about the needs of the country and locations for healthcare expansion. Everyone wants to be in Muscat, but there are certain parts of Oman that are heavily populated, and the private sector is still lagging behind. In addition, there are other incentives, like plots of land. </p><h4>How does the Ministry work to safeguard the population against new diseases and epidemics?</h4><p>We have had outbreaks of Hepatitis A and also Crimean-Congo fever. We abide by international laws and report every case that must be reported to international agencies like the WHO. Protecting the public from outbreaks of disease is the responsibility of the country and the Ministry of Health plays a leading role, but it cannot be achieved by us alone. Both of these outbreaks were infectious diseases. One is an animal-to-human disease; there is a necessity to ensure that animals imported to the country are clear of diseases. Before the outbreak of Hepatitis A, we did not vaccinate our children for this because it was not considered a necessity, but we are considering it now. The vaccination rate in Oman otherwise is almost 100%. There is still a threat in Oman from some international viruses, such as Zika. We have taken steps to prepare just in case of outbreaks. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the affordable housing residential projects NMH has in its portfolio?</h4><p>NMH uses the term affordable to refer to the middle-income segment of the housing market, which is the one we target. In Oman, these are people with a monthly income of between USD1,800 and USD5,000. These buyers will need between USD150,000 and USD200,000 to be able to buy a unit or villa. In terms of our projects we have completed Phase I of Areej Residential Community, which comprises 69 units. All units have already been sold up to a maximum of USD170,000, which is a very affordable option for middle-income buyers. Work on Phase II of the project has already begun and this will consist of another 69 units, and we have been very cautious and listened to the feedback from Phase I buyers. We have improved the size of the units from 226-234sqm and have added some services and facilities that are required to create a community, such as a central park, mosque, and so on. NMH has future ambitions to build small towns with a maximum of 200 units. This ensures the inhabitants will have easy access to services and a pleasant lifestyle. While Phase II of Areej Residential Community is already under construction, we are looking at building another project of a similar size that will also target the middle-income segment of the housing market.</p><h4>How would you assess the current affordable housing options in Muscat?</h4><p>When we established NMH, we conducted a study across Oman analyzing income per capita and people's housing requirements. The profile of the middle-income homebuyer in Oman is generally someone who has recently graduated from university and just got married or started a job. Most of this segment lives in Muscat; people have migrated from other parts of Oman to the capital, so renting a flat here is expensive. A two-bedroom apartment costs at least USD750-900 per month, and at the end of that property is not theirs. Muscat being a cosmopolitan city does not offer a great deal in terms of affordable housing, owning a house in Muscat generally requires a large amount of investment and the middle-income homebuyer may not be able to afford this. We understand that young couples want to have their own independent space and raise their kids hence what we are offering these people is the opportunity to own their property instead of paying rent. Furthermore, we are giving them a lifestyle where they can raise their family in a peaceful and spacious environment. The land we are buying is just outside the city in order to make it affordable. By doing so, we are ensuring both the quality and the cost when we build. In addition, we are also taking the risk away, as buyers will not have to deal with the building contractor and the hassles of construction. Having said that, we want to implement our projects in Muscat first; then we will study the options for expanding outside Muscat to centers like Duqm or Salalah and other areas all around the Sultanate.</p><h4>In your view of sustainable development, what role would you like to see the private sector play in Oman within the real estate industry?</h4><p>The private sector has a big role to play in this regard. Besides decent job creation the private sector can create long-term value in the tourism and real estate sectors. With regards to affordable housing, private-sector companies such as ours can strive to build future communities that bring a place to life and help it to gain its own particular identity. The current economic situation in the country, however, requires the government to join hands with the private sector to achieve this. The cost of land for these types of developments has gone up by 20% and the infrastructure costs by another 20-30%. Therefore, PPPs have to be implemented, with the government providing the land and some of the infrastructure. As a developer, I cannot afford to build 600 units and then wait for the government or someone else to buy them; the government should set up a pilot project whereby it gives land to a developer and tries this type of scheme. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the idea behind the creation of Alargan Towell Investment (ATI) as an alliance between the Kuwait-based Alargan international group and WJ Towell in Oman? </h4><p>Before the merger in 2003, both entities were enjoying outstanding achievements in their respective markets. ATI has combined the vision, goals, and values of both companies and has brought together the extensive real estate experience of Alargan International, as well as the strong reputation and business diversity of WJ Towell. We have witnessed a lot of success in the field of real estate as a developer mainly for the middle income and affordable housing segments and, for the past 13 years, this has been the main market segment that we have addressed. Our partnership has been strong and long lasting and has resulted in many successful developments and projects consisting of hundreds of residential projects, some of which have received regional recognition and awards. One example of the company's projects is Beyout Al Faye, which is an area consisting of 126 semi-detached residential villas. Another significant ongoing project is in Waha, which is in Barka, stretches over 680,000sqm and consists of hundreds of residential units and community and commercial components. </p><h4>What are the project details for the integrated tourism complex (ITC) project in Barka, and what are some of the attractions in place that are designed to draw in potential residents?</h4><p>We want to contribute to positioning Oman as one of the world's most desirable destinations by not only providing creative middle-income housing solutions, but also through tapping into the ITC real estate market, by providing a tourism oriented mixed-use and commercial development drawing on modern interpretations of authentic Omani and Islamic architecture. Our upcoming Nakheel project will be a unique, mixed-use ITC to be developed in the Rumais area on the coast near Barka. The project is around 20 minutes from Muscat international airport, has direct access to the regional road network, and covers around 500,000sqm of land and over 800m of waterfront overlooking the Gulf of Oman. </p><h4>What is the impetus behind ATI's focus on the middle-income population in Oman for real estate developments? </h4><p>New trends are occurring across all the housing segments, especially in the middle income segment, driven by the relatively young population, which has led to increased competition in product design, price, and amenities. By developing the right properties at the right time, ATI maintains its strong position as a market leader in this industry. We are conscious of customer needs and we always strive to provide innovative and streamlined units with sleek designs, combining practicality with affordable quality at competitive prices.</p><h4>Is ATI thinking about expanding its developments into different parts of Oman?</h4><p>At the moment, we have the Waha and Nakheel projects and a couple of large plots to consider developing, so we are mainly considering concentrating on Muscat and the immediate surrounding area. This includes Barka, because it is a natural expansion of Muscat; things are all moving to the west.</p><h4>What changes made at the government level in the real estate sector would increase the attractiveness of the real estate market in Oman?</h4><p>His Majesty is committed to the policy of having an open market economy based on free competition in the private sector. He has provided world-class facilities and infrastructure, attractive tax incentive packages, corporate tax holidays as procedures for doing business, and encouraged transparent corporate governance. The new foreign investment law will provide a more conducive environment for investment and make the Sultanate more attractive for both local and foreign investment, including opening up more of the housing market to expatriates. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the profile and composition of the Group as a multifaceted construction firm?</h4><p>Al Turki and Al Tasnim Group are comprised of several companies incorporated during the last four decades. My father, the founder, always believed in backward integration to ensure that the core value of product and service quality are maintained within the group. The group functions through six main verticals, which are: oil and gas; civil construction; building finishes; cement products; roads and infrastructure, and product dealership training. The group also has rotomoulding, catering, and housekeeping, and health and fitness divisions.</p><h4>What are some of the current and ongoing projects within the portfolio of Al Turki Enterprises and its group companies?</h4><p>We are proud to say that at least one division of the group is or has been a part of every major landmark in Oman. If we have not carried out the construction works, we provided concrete or blockwork or did the carpentry, the glass reinforced concrete (GRC), the marble or stone activity, or in some cases everything. Some of the key projects currently under construction that we as a group are involved in include Al Mouj (The Wave Muscat), PDO's Ras Al Hamra, National Bank of Oman's new headquarters, the Off-plot Development Contract with PDO, a number of prestigious construction projects for Royal Oman Police across Oman, as well as several other government construction projects. We are also carrying out a lot of decorative finishing works such as stone cladding, the construction of GRC domes, and the manufacturing of carved doors, for example, across Oman. </p><h4>How do the joinery and carpentry services provide strategic value in the one stop shop idea? </h4><p>In the construction field, the use of wood and wood products is of high importance and visible in the finished product. Our clients attach great importance to carpentry and joinery works, such as manufacture and installation of doors, pergolas, and windows, for example. Being a large part of the construction process, it was becoming a challenge for us to ensure that the promised or expected quality was achieved when working through smaller subcontractors. It therefore made perfect sense to start our own in-house carpentry &amp; joinery division to ensure that quality as promised or expected could be delivered. Currently, 40% of the production of our carpentry and joinery division is for external customers, with 60% being for our in-house projects. </p><h4>What are your expectations over the next 12 months of business for Al Turki?</h4><p>Over the course of the next 12 months, our focus will be on three major areas. First, to ensure that we maintain our competitive advantage. We are working hard as a group across all divisions and departments to make our processes lean and therefore become more efficient in all areas of our activities. Increased optimization will also enable us explore possible business opportunities outside Oman. The second is to develop a mentorship program for SMEs where, after an initial screening process, we mentor companies to set up operations with Omanis, help them with recruitment, financing and monitor their performance on a monthly basis to ensure they are profitable within a two-year horizon. We are currently mentoring two existing companies in our oil and gas division and one that is in the process of setting up. Our final focus shall be working out how we, as a private sector company, are going to invest in a country that has given us so much in the 40 years since the group started its operations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will your recently launched iTower project change the business landscape in the city and help SMEs and corporations increase their business activity?</h4><p>Muscat does not have enough available quality office space, and these offices are generally based on rental agreements. We have created a project whereby investors and companies can purchase office space on an easy payment plan. We have huge demand for office space because Oman is increasingly seen as an opportunity for investment and many companies are coming here. These businesses need office space and, for this reason, we started the iTower 1 project and expect to follow up with the iTower 2 and iTower 3. We will start the construction of the second iTower in September, and the first iTower is on target to be completed in May 2018. The iTower 2 is a bigger project, built on a plot double the size of the first project.</p><h4>The iTower is said to be the smartest and most energy efficient business hub in Muscat. What are some specifications that give it this title?</h4><p>We call this tower the smartest building in the Sultanate. It has a power-saving AC system, which is fully automated. We also used cost-effective and specialized light building materials that are energy efficient and insulating. We are using a special glass and aluminum and we employed smart designs to save energy. We have a smart system, which means the air conditioning system, for example, can be monitored and controlled from smartphones. We will also install a fully automated voice-activated system, which turns the lights on when people arrive in the morning, for example, and the automated system also adjusts the air conditioning during quiet times, such as lunch time when people are out of the office.</p><h4>What are some other residential and commercial property developments taking place at Gulf Muscat United?</h4><p>We have two companies here: one is for development and the other is a construction company. In construction, we have built projects for clients including a hotel, hospital, and a small shopping center in Muscat. We currently have around 20 projects on hand around the country and employ 1,500 people. We are involved in different types of construction projects, including schools, commercial developments, hotels, and government buildings. We are currently building our sixth accommodation project for the police, which is a residential project designed to be occupied by members of the police force. We also have the al Azaiba project, which is situated on 4,000sqm of land. As part of our 2020 development plan, we conducted an in-depth study into the real estate market and looked at areas where we can expect high growth until 2020.</p><h4>How does your company help contribute to the export potential of Oman in various sectors?</h4><p>There is a shortage of cement factories in Oman and around 2 million tons of cement is imported annually for construction. Our plan is to build three cement manufacturing facilities in Oman. One is in Duqm, which will be constructed on 2,000sqm of land and is already under construction. It is expected to produce 1,000 tons of cement a day starting in February/March 2017. We have another project in the Salalah Free Zone and one in Muscat. We also have a future plan for Sohar. For cement production, we expect to reach 3,000 tons per day within two years to satisfy local demand. We are still exporting cement to Somalia, Tanzania, and Kenya, but we are doing that as a trader, not a producer. We are purchasing cement from the UAE and selling it to Africa. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the impetus behind BRF's decision to invest in Oman?</h4><p>We at BRF have been present in the Middle East for the last 45 years, and we have been following a long-term strategy based on three main pillars to sustain our success. Pillar number one: leveraging the equity of our brand, Sadia. Sadia is the leading brand in the frozen chicken category in the GCC, with an extensive range of whole chicken, chicken parts, and ready to prepare products, and holds a strong preference with the consumers in this region. Pillar number two: strengthening our production capabilities in the region. We opened our first factory in the region in Abu Dhabi at the end of 2014, investing USD160 million. Our UAE facility is the largest food processing plant in the Middle East, focusing on value added products. Pillar number three: controlling distribution, to achieve what we call “from farm to fork."</p><h4>BRF recently moved to acquire 100% of Al Khan Foodstuff. What is the strategic value in this acquisition, and how will this move bring new benefits to BRF in Oman?</h4><p>In Oman, we invested USD64 million into the full acquisition of Al Khan Foodstuff in June 2016. In 2014, we acquired initially 40% of the operations with an option to acquire the remaining 60% within three years. We strongly believe in the opportunities this market will bring to BRF this year. Our objective is to use local distributions as our entry point to strengthen our ties with the local retailers and consumers. It is our duty to understand our consumers to develop products that will answer their needs and tastes. With this in mind, we have created an R&amp;D and innovation center within our Abu Dhabi set-up to work on such propositions for us. For example, we listen to several consumers in the Middle East, including Omani ladies, who told us that they did not like the current chicken breasts in the market. The products were all stuck together and they had no choice but defrosting the whole pack, even if they needed only 1 or 2 pieces. As such, we launched this year our new “Frozen 1 by 1" chicken breasts where each breast is frozen separately. Consumers now can defrost each piece separately and keep the rest fresh for later thanks to a convenient zip-lock bag.</p><h4>How would you assess the ease for foreign firms to enter into business in the foodstuffs sector in Oman?</h4><p>We are only a few months into our direct operations here; therefore, it is too soon to provide a comprehensive overview. However, one thing that we can say is that Oman has great infrastructure in terms of roads, utilities, electricity, and water, even though the country is large geographically and has a low population density. This helps us to distribute our frozen food products to the farthest regions of Oman, while ensuring proper food safety. Another point to highlight is that we have been active working together with the Omani authorities to build our future and long-term plans, as we are already doing regionally with the GCC Standardization Organization (GSO) for example. We are actively collaborating with authorities by participating in group discussions to develop a future stance for the industry in Oman. Our vision in Oman is to become a truly local company, managed and operated by locals who will coordinate our actions within the region.</p><h4>What are your targets and expectations for the next 12 months?</h4><p>We are currently engaged in our strategic planning cycle for the medium to long term with a broader vision to build a base of future sustainable growth in Oman. This base is focused on the people. We want to have the right people with the right talent to leverage our brand and distribution channels to grow the country. Our main objective now is to hire, promote, and train the local Omanis who will be the future leaders to drive this business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What initiatives has the ministry put in place to drive the development of the fisheries sector over the past year?</h4><p>First, we have added a greater logistics framework within the sector. We opened a new fishing port in Barka, which was completed in 2015 at a cost of USD36 million, and it will accommodate not only fishing, but also tourism opportunities. That project was launched last year to help Oman increase its catch of fish, which reached 257,000 metric tons, representing an increase of 20% from the previous year. This volume of catch was worth USD447 million. When we include the entire value chain, the figure becomes around USD1.1 billion. That is the value of the fisheries' contribution to GDP. These are the two main improvements in the sector: the big increase in production and an increase in the value of the fisheries as well. The number of registered Omani fishermen also rose to 46,000.</p><h4>Can you provide more details on the country's first land-based fish farm in Sur?</h4><p>We have many applications for land-based systems, one of which is for shrimp. These farms will be located close to the beach just south of Sur. This particular project is an investment from a joint venture company from Singapore, Lim Shrimp, and it will farm local species of shrimp. It is aiming to farm 4,000 tons of shrimp annually. </p><h4>What are some key changes that need to be made at the local level to ensure that the desired development can occur?</h4><p>The first thing we need to do is complete the necessary infrastructure. We are missing a few ports on the Arabian Sea, so we are designing ports in Masira, Mahut, Shwaymeyaa, Sadah, and Rakhyoot. They are in the final stages of design and we hope we can tender and build those ports soon. All of the logistics needs will be available in these ports, including markets, storage, ice production, and any other services a fishing fleet would need. We hope to complete all of the planned fishing ports in the next two years and renovate the old, smaller fishing ports along the Arabian Sea and the Sea of Oman. </p><h4>What are some of the ministry's plans for further development in the coming years?</h4><p>By early 2017 we will have completed two sizeable ports that can accommodate fisheries, coastguard, and tourism in Masnaah and Liwa along the Sea of Oman. We are also completing fish markets in Al Suwaiq in 2016, we just opened a fish market in Seeb, and we will open a fish market in Barka as well. For 2017, we hope to float the big port in Duqm and in other coastal towns on the Arabian Sea. Our aim for growth over 2016 is 10%. In 2015, we saw 22% growth. We do not want to push the stocks to the extreme, but at the same time the government is keen to support the sector. We want to keep our promise to the government that this sector will achieve the promised growth rate, which is 10-20%. By 2020, we are targeting 480,000 million tons of fish production, and we feel that we can achieve that. Another major project that is awaiting final clearance on financing is a huge artificial farm in the Sea of Oman. It will be the biggest in the Middle East, measuring 16,000ha, 8x20km, and located at a depth between 15 and 30m. Our production could see a 10-fold increase once it is complete. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-readership-for-all-seasons]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is OEPPA positioned in the media landscape of Oman? </h4><p>OEPPA is unquestionably one of the largest integrated media organizations in the Sultanate of Oman, with interests spanning print newspapers and magazines, advertising and marketing, online and social media, digital platforms, and even strategic research and consultancy services. Around a decade ago, it made the successful transition from a state-managed publishing house to a quasi-autonomous, commercially driven media organization. In line with this transformation, various departments within the organization now function as business units that must be substantially self-funding and profitable—a mandate that requires each unit to put an emphasis on professionalism, quality, efficiency, and customer value. </p><h4>How do you strive to attract readers of many different interests and lifestyles? </h4><p>Our primary strength is in the government and public sectors, as well as private businesses. While our two flagship papers were initially patronized by readers at their workplaces, we have diversified our editorial content to appeal to readers of various professional backgrounds and interests. Through customer feedback surveys, we have identified shortcomings in our editorial offerings that we are continuously working to address. For instance, we have expanded our coverage of local events and stressed credible news, investigative reporting, and interviews, so readers see the benefit of subscribing or reading a local newspaper instead of depending on the Internet or social media for their information. Further, in an effort to connect with our readers, we invite them—whether teenagers, adults, professionals, or academics—to share their thoughts on topics of general interest. This form of engagement with the local community, with Omanis and expatriates alike, is helping to sustain our readership levels in the face of the ongoing onslaught by the internet and social media.</p><h4>What has been the main focus of your growth strategy to keep your news outlets relevant in today's world, especially as online media increases its presence each year? </h4><p>Our principal strategy is to strongly position our two flagship newspapers as local dailies. In line with this strategy, we have strengthened our coverage of local developments across the board, most notably on the economic, business, social, cultural, entertainment, sports, shopping, and retail fronts. We know that our newspapers can do well only if we can strengthen, enliven, and broaden our coverage of local developments and introduce a strong local flavor to our products. Also making a significant difference to this goal is the recruitment of young, talented Omani boys and girls who are providing us with content from their neighborhoods, towns, and cities around the Sultanate. </p><h4>Do you find that the wider audience in Oman prefers the English or Arabic newspaper? Does printing in English bring unique advantages or disadvantages? </h4><p>These are two distinct audiences with their own distinctive interests. The English paper is popular with the business class, the sizable white-collar expatriate community, diplomatic corps, students of international schools and community institutions, visitors and tourists, and importantly, Omanis in the private sector. The Arabic paper, on the other hand, is hugely popular in government ministries, government schools and colleges, private businesses with predominant Omani managers, and Omani readers in towns and villages around the country. </p><h4>What is your outlook for OEPPA over the next 12 months?</h4><p>We see the current fiscal downturn as a short-term setback. Budgetary constraints and cost-cutting measures have forced us to put on hold initiatives and projects that require a substantial upfront investment. Our focus has shifted to becoming a leaner and more efficient media organization. The goal is to eliminate waste while boosting the quality of our editorial and professional content. OEPPA plans to further enhance its online and other social media activities, and place more emphasis on digital than print journalism. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your business adapted to changes in Oman in the last year, and what is your position today?</h4><p>Surprisingly, we are in a better position. When changes happen, it forces us to look at things differently, to adapt and figure out ways to be more efficient and work smarter, but not as hard. We went through some changes in the last year, and Oman as a country and government have also gone through the same process.</p><h4>Have you seen some benefits from those changes that have happened at the top?</h4><p>Yes. The PPP and all that has been happening in Oman are more and more visibly and openly talked about, and I have seen this in all countries I have visited. It has become a global approach now because governments do not have money but still need to get things accomplished; so they need to figure out a way to entice people who have money or who are willing to invest with time and effort and hard work.</p><h4>What are the advantages of being based here?</h4><p>As a company, we find Oman strong because of the policies and regulations, which are well known. It is a safe and stable country. The outlook of our employees is positive, so overall there are many benefits to being based here in Oman.</p><h4>How has the rollout of your e-payment platform for governments played out over the past few years?</h4><p>Customers can pay everything like bills and taxes with our system. With money there are many things to consider. First, to print money costs money, and then paper money has a lifespan so it is constantly necessary to pull notes out of circulation, reprint, and put new ones back in. With cash handling, any time there is cash in hand there could be missing money or mistakes, but when using e-payments everything is digitally accounted for; this really helps eliminate fraud and reduce the cost of money itself. </p><h4>What other technologies are you rolling out?</h4><p>There are different kinds of solutions. Each country has its own unique problems it has to address, each its own priorities—that is how we are approaching things. We tailor solutions to the specific needs of each country—everything from printing passports to e-governance projects, e-services consultancy, biometric solutions, healthcare, and access control solutions for banks and much more.</p><h4>Which countries besides Oman do you work in now?</h4><p>We print passports for a few African countries and do some specialty booklets for some European countries. In Bangladesh, there are telecoms intercept services and other e-government solutions that we have in place. We have a software development office in Egypt. In Sudan we have a type of card project focused on zakat and tax payments. Recently, I signed a contract for checkbook personalization with the Afghanistan Bank Association; we supply ATM cards that are produced in Oman.</p><h4>You have a new smartcard product. What are the details?</h4><p>We have a card product that is essentially a mini-computer housed in a credit card-sized format that can only be activated using the card owner's fingerprints. It looks like any other card people carry in their wallets, but has a live fingerprint scanner embedded on the surface of the card that eliminates the need to sign, provide identification, or remember pins to authorize transactions—they simply touch the sensor on the card and their identity is verified in less than a second. It is truly a “Match-IN-Card" solution. </p><h4>What are your expectations and ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p>In 2016, we opened branches in a few countries, so I hope that next year in those countries we will gain more business. Instead of going to other countries, I hope to expand more where we are already present. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[the Demand  for Broadband]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-demand-for-broadband]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2015, you talked about the under-developed regulatory framework between Oman Broadband and the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) in Oman. What progress has been made over the last year with this issue?</h4><p>Oman Broadband is part of the telecoms sector in Oman and the company was created by the government of the Sultan of Oman as part of the National Broadband Strategy (NBS) approved by Oman's Cabinet of Ministers. Oman Broadband has permission from the TRA to commercialize the fiber-optic infrastructure. Currently, we provide our services on a wholesale basis to licensed operators and government entities in Oman. Besides that, one of the pillars of the NBS is to look into the current licensing regimes. We are working closely with the concerned authorities to know more about that and to identify the type of the license that we need to apply for, considering the fact that the current market or licensing structure is based on classes I, II, and III, and the business is integrated between the service layers and the infrastructure layers.</p><h4>How is the fiber-to-home initiative progressing in Oman, and is bringing high-speed, fiber-optic connections to households still a big priority for Oman Broadband?</h4><p>The main purpose behind creating Oman Broadband is to bring the latest technology to homes by providing efficient infrastructure of high-speed fiber connectivity and providing a broader online experience, in addition to enabling the smart homes applications, bringing benefits to society and the business sector with an enhanced delivery of smart services, cost savings, increased competitiveness, and improved sustainability. Toward achieving that, we are moving according to our master plan, which means completing 85% coverage in Muscat by 2020. We are also looking to have 30% coverage outside Muscat by the end of 2020.</p><h4>Oman Broadband has a pilot program where provides high-speed internet services through the communications infrastructure of electricity companies. How would you characterize the efficacy of this program, and what are the benefits?</h4><p>There are two points when it comes to utilizing the current infrastructure. On one side, we are in alignment with infrastructure so that we can rollout alongside these projects, meaning we do not have to dig to lay cables. The position is similar for all the utilities providers for electricity, water, and wastewater projects. The other initiative we started in 2014-2015 is to expand our reach using the current telecoms infrastructure. There are some fiber-optic lines that are under-utilized, and we can use these to reach remote areas. This does not help us much on the FTTH project because this is usually across cities. It helps us more expanding to rural areas of Oman. We are in the final stages of completing the technical guidelines relating to how we can use fiber optics belonging to other utility sectors without disrupting their business.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead at Oman Broadband?</h4><p>I would like to elaborate more on 2020 and beyond, not only the coming year. Oman, like every country, has it specifics. We have managed to adjust our model and create efficient organization able to meet challenging targets. Our mission is to unlock the potential in numerous areas due to the solid broadband infrastructure we provide, which is an enabler for the knowledge-based economy. To accompany that, we closely cooperate with all stakeholders, primarily Ministry of Transport and Communications, Telecommunication Regulatory Authority, Information Technology Authority, and relevant government authorities as well as the service providers with a goal of providing and stimulating the demand for broadband through integration with other sectors under the umbrella of the National Broadband Strategy and National Vision 2020 (E-Government, Oman Digital Society, and others). I am happy to say that Oman Broadband is one of the major players and taking an active role in those discussions and initiatives, which leaves us in confidence that we are on the right track in terms of broadband infrastructure deployment to meet the future demands. This is very important as the world is changing faster than ever before. Today, everybody talks about IoT and Big data; new technologies are developed, and existing ones are improved to support the smart city concept. It is of vital importance that we closely observe developments and plan our network to be able to connect the required infrastructure not only today, but in the future. We want to see Oman as a positive example for other countries in the region and beyond, and we will be happy to share our experiences. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Omantel maintained profitability in 2016 despite a shifting environment. Can you give us an overview of your performance?</h4><p>Despite a gloomy economic environment, mainly due to the current oil price and the dependence of the country on these revenues, we have been able to grow, mainly through data. Data, whether through mobile or fixed line, has been a major driver of growth throughout the year. We also saw that outside the oil and gas sector the enterprise segment of the market has witnessed growth, and we are seeing good potential there. In terms of the financial performance of Omantel, the growth has been driven by data from the consumer end, and revenues relating to our wholesale expansion. Wholesale has been a major pillar in the Omantel growth story of late, and we are expanding the number of systems that are landing in Oman. We are leveraging from this infrastructure to be the true gate for the Middle East in terms of telecom. The value of data that has been passing through our networks connecting businesses and operators from the east of the globe to the west, and vice versa has witnessed growth this year. Growth in that area has supplemented lower growth in the consumer segments and is a part of our diversification strategy.</p><h4>Can we expect further announcements beyond the two current cable expansion plans?</h4><p>Global data growth has been significant in the last three years. Growth in data will continue in our region and is driven by a new dynamic. Data has become a new form of trade, and traditional trade has always been mainly driven by goods and services crossing the globe through conventional transportation. That transportation is now happening virtually, and Oman is still at the crossroads. With new technologies and the effects of globalization, we are seeing designers in Europe sending designs to manufacturers in Asia, which requires high-speed and dependable data routes. Our wholesale strategy has been focused to strengthen our conventional routes, which link east to west but also come up with unconventional routes that are growing quickly. We recently announced a cable that is unconventional in the sense that we are connecting China through the Silk Road and approaching Central Asia as well, and getting all of this to land in Oman. From Oman it can go west, which is traditional, and will go all the way to the global south by landing in East Africa. To leverage the growth and the lack of infrastructure in Africa we are employing what we call our X strategy. If we imagine the globe from east to west as a horizontal, then the vertical will be coming from Asia all the way from north to south, forming an X. Our strategy is beyond traditional and unconventional routes though; the idea is to make Oman and Omantel the hub for content providers. Today, we have a number of major global content providers such as Microsoft, Facebook, Akamai, and Level 3, which all have a base in Oman. This accumulated base, which hosts these content providers, serves a strong purpose; hosting Oman's internet, whereby 75% of the internet is served domestically. If someone is seeking specific content then his or her content will likely be hosted here and will not need to go to Hong Kong, Singapore, or Frankfurt. The majority of operators in the GCC actually link to Oman to obtain their content. It is not only GCC; today we have operators from Iran, Pakistan, Yemen, and Iraq, which are getting to the notes that are available here in Oman. This is a growing area.</p><h4>Omantel has other global ambitions, one of which is a stake in Pakistan's WorldCall. What can you say about the future of your stake in WorldCall?</h4><p>Right now we are in exit mode when it comes to WorldCall. At this point in time, we have received a binding offer from an organization within Pakistan and therefore it is subject to due diligence and clearances from the authorities within Pakistan. This is ongoing and hopefully by the first quarter of 2017 this process can close. We understand that so called non-organic growth is also required and therefore scouting for opportunities will continue until we find something that strategically and financially fits the objectives of Omantel. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the new Tam service help streamline government efficiency and promote e-government solutions in Oman?</h4><p>PKI services (the Electronic Certification Services, branded as Tam) is a solid solution we believe is essential for government electronic services and can make life easier for all citizens. It allows a single sign-on to all of the government services with data integrity, data confidentiality, strong authentication, and non-repudiation. With PKI, all parties are protected by law (electronic transaction Law 69/2008). The two most important services are online authentication and electronic signature, whereby the data is encrypted while transmitted over the internet. We have collaborated on this project with our partners, Royal Oman Police (ROP), Omantel, and Ooredoo to ensure that we have PKI services available in the National ID Cards and PKI enabled SIM cards; therefore, citizens can log in to the government services and sign electronically through the mobile phones as well without the physical presence in the service providers' premises. Citizens will be able to log into all government agency services that are integrated to PKI using their ID cards and mobile phones, which means they can enter all different government portals without having any usernames and passwords. Tam service is in line with the e-transaction law; therefore, when you have your digital identity, it is your responsibility to keep it safe to prevent any unauthorized use.</p><h4>ITA signed a fiber-optic contract with Oman Broadband Company to connect government offices. What value will this provide to the government network?</h4><p>This agreement is essential to connect the current 63 government entities hosted by Oman Government Network (OGN) providing high-speed connectivity and linked to the National Data Center at ITA in addition to another backup data center. We deliver government services and people place a premium on speed. They do not want slow responses, and this new network will provide us with high speeds, more than 1,000 times faster than the current government network. Second, we have the cloud as our central initiative, and we are pushing all government systems to use the cloud network because it saves money and also provides the right structure and security. There are many things that the cloud can provide, but without a high-speed network, it is not possible. Many government agencies are pushing to deliver their services electronically and we seek to provide the speed for the government networks that will keep users satisfied and happy to use the service again. The government network is the first phase, and we are now moving on to the next phase, which is to connect the towns of Oman to this fiber network as well. The fiber-optic service enables government organizations to enhance the service quality and hence better customer satisfaction for its provided services. It enables government organizations to integrate by exchanging data to facilitate a true end-to-end service delivery for their customers. </p><h4>How would you assess the unique national e-tendering system that Oman has, and how can companies benefit from using this platform?</h4><p>This project helps with transparency in terms of how we can help the government make the right investment decisions with regard to projects, how we can give the private sector confidence in the project when they bid with us, and how anyone outside of the country can bid and have confidence in Oman. Right now, this system is only available to government-owned companies. In the future, this could become a service available to any enterprise. We now have around 18-20 government departments in the system, and we are pushing for all government agencies to be on-board by the end of the year before we decide to make it available to the private sector. Tendering is one of the strategic national projects that we deliver as part of ITA's responsibilities. This system allows for greater transparency and trust in the government tendering process and allows companies to monitor tenders online. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[an-increasing-share]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the launch of your new rebar mill play a key role in your efforts to capitalize on the infrastructure-hungry markets in the region?</h4><p>When we took over the plant in 2010, it was set up to produce HBI/HDRI used to produce steel. After three years of selling HBI, we commissioned our Steel Melt Shop in April 2014, which has a capacity of 2 million tons per annum to produce billets and rounds. We started selling special grade and commercial grade billets. In April 2016, we started our prestigious rebar mill, with a 1.4 million ton per annum capacity, which is one of the largest and most modern, state-of-the-art mills in the world. We can produce 1.4 million tons per annum of rebar of 8mm to 40mm here. The concept of our integrated steel plant is that we should be able to convert iron ore into a finished product. In the last five months, we made around 100,000 tons of rebar. The ramp up with the new rebar mill is progressing according to plan. There are market issues at the moment since the oil prices went down and the speed of construction developments have been reduced. We now have a competitive advantage in the region for product like Rebar for the construction industry. The first thing that we are working on is how to increase our market share.</p><h4>What was the reason behind the company changing its operating role from being a supplier of HBI offering to semi-finished and finished steel products?</h4><p>When we took over the direct-reduced iron (DRI) plant, the concept was always there that we were not going to be just a HBI supplier; we wanted to go for downstream facilities. It is our goal to maximize our value addition in the country. The utilization of HBI in the country and within the GCC is limited, whereas the rebar can be utilized 100% in Oman, the UAE, and other nearby places.</p><h4>How do the facilities in the integrated steel plant maximize efficiencies in order to generate a greater in-country value?</h4><p>Our plant layout is compact; we have hot charging technology, with the hot DRI directly going into the electric arc furnace at a temperature of about 650-700 degrees celsius. We therefore save a substantial amount of energy in doing so. Our steel melt shop and mill are also integrated so that hot billets can be directly put into the furnace in the rolling mill. The whole point is that we consider ourselves to be more energy efficient than anybody else, certainly in the GCC. As far as hot material going directly into the furnace goes, we are the first company in the world with such a facility. I do not have to keep large intermediate stocks because we are directly feeding hot material and can therefore manage with much less inventory.</p><h4>What are some of your targets and expectations for the company over the next 12 months?</h4><p>Our immediate concern is that we need to increase our rebar mill production to full capacity. The other concern we have is that the availability of gas at a subsidized price to produce as much metallics as I need. Therefore, we need to find other sources of metallic to increase the production of our steel melt shop to 100% capacity. We are also looking for further investment in the longer term to improve our capacities and reduce costs. We are looking at possible options and will be taking a decision in the next six months as to how we can really put in some additional facilities so the cost can be reduced. The target is to accomplish this in three years. We are also a company that is socially-minded. We are close to society and do a lot of work for society under our CSR initiatives, including the building of facilities for the weaker sections of society and children. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Prysmian Group has recently become the majority shareholder of OCI. What are some of the changes that will take place at OCI as a result of this move?</h4><p>Since 1995 the Prysmian Group is a shareholder in Oman Cables through Draka. The Prysmian Group, which is the largest cable manufacturer in the world, increased its 35% share in OCI in December 2015 to 51% and became the majority shareholder. So today, OCI is an internationally renowned public listed company on the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) and comprises of both local Omani and International investors. There are for sure advantages of having the number one global cable manufacturer as a shareholder. The Prysmian Group has explained that it will share its technology, cable expertise, and access to markets with us. For OCI, this means we now have easier access to different markets, products, and technologies. An important plus for a technology and manufacturing company like OCI in Oman to have a partner that can bring this all on board.</p><h4>As necessary infrastructure projects and improvements continue in Oman, what role can OCI play, and how are you making sure the demand is met?</h4><p>Being a company in Oman means the domestic market is our highest priority. Since we have been in this market for such a long time, we are close to our customers. Therefore, when new projects come up, we are already close to our customers and partners, starting at the design phase. This means we can ascertain what the demand will be, what kind of development work we can assist them with, and how we can offer our services so that the cables deployed for a project are the right ones for the job. These projects do not happen overnight, and we ensure we are always ready to supply the domestic market with the cables and solutions they need. For example, OCI supplied all the cables for the new airports in Muscat and Salalah. The railway project has been officially postponed; however, as a company we were already busy preparing our factory to produce the specific cables needed for that development project. With that said, 60% of our sales are to GCC countries other than Oman, effectively making OCI one of the larger exporters in the country. We tend to call the GCC our home market, as Oman on its own is a small market. Out of the many cable producers in the GCC, OCI is the one of the largest and we need the demand for our products outside of Oman. Therefore, focusing on both the domestic and our home markets is how we approach sales as a company.</p><h4>How is OCI handling the important subject of corporate social responsibility?</h4><p>OCI's values are to act as responsible corporate citizens in compliance with environmental norms. These key considerations have been formulated at the management level in the mission, vision, and values of the company. The company has energy and material saving programs in place and is also reusing and recycling materials. Drums, the packing for the cables, are sent back to the company and are used again for transporting new cables to the customers. For the cooling systems, water in the factories is reused through a closed-loop cooling system contributing to a substantial saving in the consumption of water. The progress on the various elements of the CSR are closely monitored and updated on a regular basis with new initiatives to stay at the forefront of what can be achieved.</p><h4>What targets do you have for OCI over the coming 12 months? </h4><p>Our overall outlook is dominated by the current economic circumstances. Looking at the history of the company, we have a logical focus on achieving a sustainable growth. This movement is expected to continue in the future. Our current product portfolio will be optimized and this represents a natural development for our company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has BMRC successfully positioned itself as a trusted consultant for renowned international mining and exploration companies?</h4><p>Our main objective was to start professional mining company in GCC with special focus on Oman. In the GCC, mining has a lot of potential but the sector is not fully developed yet. Mineral resources and reserves compliance has also been non-existent until now. We are working to bring awareness in the mining industry about the importance of compliance reporting and professional mining. Our main objective was to start a professional mining consultancy in Oman. We base our entire philosophy around our core value called “ABC," wherein A stands for “act with a sense of urgency," B stands for “behave like an owner," and C stands for “continuous improvement." Acting like the owner means giving priority to the clients' interests. Acting with urgency means acting in the best interests of the project. Continuous improvement improves our knowledge by keeping up with the latest technology. Bottom line, we do not behave like a consultant; we act as part and parcel of our client's team.</p><h4>What are the main services BMRC offers its clients, and how do you differentiate them from those of other consultancy firms?</h4><p>We offer a complete range of services right from greenfield surface exploration, drilling, mineral resources, mineral reserves, mine planning, operational efficiency, software development, financial analysis, and scoping to feasibility studies. In the Middle East, we are the only consultancy that offers JORC and NI 43-101mineral resource and reserve estimation services. We are committed to developing Omani nationals in highly technical skills job like mineral resource estimation and mine planning. In order to encourage this, BMRC is planning to hold free workshops for students and young Omani professionals. There is a need for Omanization right from the basic level through to the technical expertise level.</p><h4>What are the main projects BMRC has in Oman alongside the big industry players?</h4><p>Our clients include government bodies involved in mining or planning to invest in mining. We have successfully provided our services to almost all major mining companies. We have grown to more than 30 clients in Oman in a period of less than three years in Oman and the list is continuously growing.</p><h4>What are BMRC's most significant ventures internationally?</h4><p>We have carried out exploration and mineral resource estimation projects in Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Guinea, Sudan, Colombia, Guyana, Canada, the US, Sweden, the Philippines, the CIS, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Currently we are developing two gold mines in Zimbabwe. Our commodity portfolio includes gold, diamond, base metals, iron ore, lithium, uranium, and industrial minerals.</p><h4>How do you assess the Omani mining industry, and what needs to be done in order to unleash its full potential?</h4><p>The mining sector in Oman has huge potential to develop. I see a great amount of unexplored potential. There is a lot of interest from foreign investors, especially in limestone, gypsum, and chromite. There is an acute need for well-prepared Omani mining engineers and geologists.</p><h4>What is your outlook for BMRC over the next 12 months?</h4><p>At the least we want to achieve sustainable growth. We have also taken the decision to diversify into technology development. An example of the product from this vertical will be software related to mine management. These are management systems that can be customized to provide all the production data required by a particular company. It will allow top management to remain up to date with mine production. It is about KPIs and systems-driven efficiency and performance on site. The other focus for us in Oman is training. We want to conduct workshops to teach Omani students about the mining technologies being used worldwide and about quality assurance systems, as these do not exist here. We are also working on systems for the security of exploration data because a project's entire funding is based on that. Investors need to know that the mine data is accurate and securely stored to protect their investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main activities of Kunooz Holding's various subsidiaries?</h4><p>We have several subsidiaries in Muscat; we have a business that supplies aggregate and sand to the construction and road industries and a marble quarry with a polishing facility where we produce polished slabs, tiles, steps, and raises for both the local and international market. In Salalah, we mine and export gypsum and have a ready-mix business that produces concrete products and paving blocks and sells aggregates and sand to third parties. Supporting these two business and our Muscat operations is our logistics business, which undertakes all transportation and logistics internally and for third parties. Our business is roughly 75% export orientated and 25% local.</p><h4>What are the holding's production capabilities?</h4><p>For marble, we produce and sell about 42,000sqm of polished and cut product per month. We produce about 1.2 million tons of aggregates and sand on an annual basis. In the ready-mix business, we produce roughly 250,000 cubic meters of concrete on an annual basis plus blocks, curbstones, and aggregate and sand. We produce about 2.4 million tons and 4.2 million tons of gypsum and limestone, respectively, on an annual basis. At Carmeuse Majan we have one kiln commissioned producing about 150,000 tons of lime per year.</p><h4>How has your transport network expanded beyond serving your own subsidiaries?</h4><p>We have taken the next step in this regard and brought on a logistics graduate to turn our captive transport business into a logistics and warehousing hub business. We now provide transport to all of our subsidiaries and for our clients between Salalah and Muscat in both directions. We are considering a warehousing facility in Muscat to centralize our activity. We are looking at this on a regional basis, but our initial focus is on Oman. </p><h4>What are some principal impediments to growth in the mining sector in terms of attracting investment or bureaucratic issues?</h4><p>The government has been historically slow in granting licenses and fixing certain problems; however, a new CEO has been appointed to run the Public Authority of Mining and is in the process of addressing all of these issues. Current and future mining operations and potential investors require certainty in sustaining and developing new and existing mining operations. It should be noted that investors look at the global opportunities and are not just looking at Oman. Ease of access, legal tenure, and stable investment environments with low risk (relative to the mining sector) will be their focus and will attract investment. Any volatility in these key areas will see investors looking at alternative investment opportunities</p><h4>Kunooz Holding plans to hold an IPO in the near future. What is the current strategy behind your IPO?</h4><p>The government has encouraged family businesses to hold IPOs in Oman. The market is relatively small and this gives the public the opportunity to invest in high growth areas. It is a distribution of mineral wealth into the local economy. We need to continue to expand our assets and take advantage of the expansions and contractions in the markets of India on an annual basis. We are currently in discussions with a sovereign wealth fund to take a portion of our equity pre-IPO. The IPO date is going to be dependent on the market and perception of the market in the next couple of years. I think we will have the IPO at some point in 2017.</p><h4>What is your vision for the next 12 months for Kunooz Holding?</h4><p>We are still in the process of converting a family business into a professional organization, so for us the focus will be internally on setting goals and achieving our budgets. We will be focusing on our markets and our customers, creating better long-term relationships, and working to make our assets sweat. Attracting talent into our businesses to make us globally competitive. Our aspirations are not just local, but global. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What progress has been made in formulating new mining laws?</h4><p>The mining law took effort and time to formulate because we wanted it to be as attractive to investment as possible. We have finished drafting the law and it has been reviewed by different government bodies and it is now at the final review stage at the Ministry of Legal Affairs and will hopefully be with the Council for final approval soon. The new law will help to attract investment and is designed to make the sector as transparent as possible.</p><h4>What key changes are you making?</h4><p>One key change is the specific period that a company will be able to hold a license; we are extending it to 20 years. This gives investors comfort in terms of sustainability. The second key change is more details describing each of the mining licenses so that it is clearer. Another change is in connection with local communities, while one more is the introduction of a government body to intervene if there is a dispute between government bodies regarding permits. Other than that, there will be space to change different fees as the market situation changes. In the current law there are fixed fees that cannot be changed unless the law is changed. Now we have removed those lines from the law and placed it in the procedural methods. Companies have to submit executive practices explaining what the law is in detail. The fees associated with the previous law will be added to this procedural methodology. This is a smart move that will benefit both the investors and us. Fees will adapt as the market changes and we will be the ones to monitor that. We have a bit of a role to play in reducing the overall business visibility to investors. We imagine in early 2017 that it will be in the books; we are hoping to push to ensure that.</p><h4>What will be the result of shifts in working with the private sector and how will it affect your governance of the overall mining sector?</h4><p>One of the issues with mining licenses is the process; companies are required to get permits from eight government units so it takes a lot of time. There is determination that this process needs to be more effective and timely. The second thing is that the government must look at the applications for permits in a more commercial sense, to view the economic value of it rather than just for the sake of rejecting it. There will be a lot of considerations regarding some of the permits, and there might be some objection, but now thinking about the economic impact and benefit as a whole might facilitate it. The term fee will also be looked at from an execution point of view. One of the challenges that the mining authority has is getting plans into action because of logistics money issues. If a challenge arises because of a logistics issue the body that we will establish will attack this issue and solve it as a part of the new authority. It will not only look at the fee plan but also other government plans that are facing problems and issues. That set up will manifest in a lot of other businesses and in turn the authorities will benefit from this. The mindset of how the plan is being put together is bottom-up with buy-ins from different stakeholders together and also being carried out through consultations with the public.</p><h4>What are you ambitions and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>First of all we need to support local entities by providing mineral products to them. One aspect is being able to provide building materials to the local market in an efficient way. We have to tidy up a few things with the licenses with the crushers so that they are regulated in a more effective way. The other big element of it is really attracting big investment in the mining sector. Without this big investment we will not be able to kick off a big shift to contribute to the GDP of the mining sector. We have to make the companies that are working right now collectively grow together and be more effective in creating downstream industries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess your role in the Sultanate's plans to boost non-oil activities?</h4><p>Mining has become of one the five pillars of the Omani economy with the ninth Five-Year Plan. The government is being supportive and the creation of the Public Authority for Mining (PAM) has shown its commitment to the mining sector. Oman is a rich and untapped country in minerals, so there is a lot of work to be done. In this sense, Gulf Mining is the leading private company in Oman's mining sector; in 2005 we were recognized by the Sultanate for our chrome activities. We started 10 years ago with the first 500-ton shipment, and now we are exporting 35,000 tons per month, which in 2017 is expected to increase to 40,000 tons. In 2015 we were ranked as the largest producer and exporter of chrome in the world. Despite our leadership in this segment, we decided to diversify to other commodities and move into production of magnesium, gypsum, diamond stones, and laterite. In addition, we opened a marble factory.</p><h4>What projects are you developing in order to boost your mineral production?</h4><p>The government of Oman aims to export value-added minerals rather than selling raw materials abroad. Therefore, we decided to support this plan and add value to our exports by developing new plants. We took a step further and started with two chrome ore plants in 2010, and the year after we added a new production line. In 2014, we opened a new plant that allows us to produce 6,000-10,000 tons of concentrated material. In 2015, we completed the construction of our own fulcrum plant at the Sohar Free Zone, which produces 50,000 tons per annum. We are currently considering an expansion of the plant, but we will have to wait for the construction of a new power station in the free zone to supply electricity to our plant. As the station is expected to be finished during 2017 or the beginning of 2018, we are postponing our expansion until the government fulfills its plans We also want to add another two lines of production of limestone and gypsum, which will expand our capacity to 150,000 tons per annum for the upcoming 40 years. Due to power shortages, we are waiting for the infrastructure to be ready to complete our pipeline for expansion, including a ferromagnesium production line. Finally, we have acquired a new quarry rich in metal ore and are talking with the mining authorities to get permission to start using it.</p><h4>What initiatives are you implementing to market your materials internationally?</h4><p>We have recently opened an office in Lausanne, which is managing all our exports to Europe, and it is performing well. We also have an office in China not only for our fulcrum production but it also looks at other opportunities in chrome and magnesium. In addition, we have an office in India and one in Dubai, which has been operating for more than five years and increased our popularity in the UAE market. Since we do not have a steel industry in Oman, all our materials are exported, including the majority of our marble production, with only 10% to supply the local market. Our exports are using about 5,000 containers per month. That is why we decided to have our own shipping company called Gulf Beach Shipping, which takes care of our cargo and land logistics. We have a logistics division, which has been created to look after the land transportation. We own 25% of the fleet and the rest is hired from 117 local companies, which is our contribution to SME development. Sohar Port has become our center of operations for our exports overseas, and we are exporting by road 15,000 tons per month to the UAE cement factories. </p><h4>What is your potential of to become a mining hub in the Middle East?</h4><p>In fact, we are already the mining leaders of the region and the only company that has the right to do evaluations. We have come to the level that Chinese companies cannot evaluate Omani chrome without our consultation. We are the controllers of the market; 70% of the chrome exported from Oman comes through Gulf Mining. As mining is a sensitive sector we are still facing bureaucracy problems for exports, but I hope the Tanfeedh program will ease some of these obstacles. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the distribution system in Oman been improved since the restructuring of the electricity system in 2005?</h4><p>The first year in which we moved from a vertically integrated industry to a single-buyer model was 2005. For the first time, there were new companies being established to conduct commercial operations. This was a major step forward in liberalizing the electricity supply industry and to have specialized companies for each function. Since then there have been major improvements on different fronts. From a human capital perspective, there has been an increase in the Omanization percentage YoY. There was an investment in educating Omanis and developing the people's capabilities. This is an ongoing obligation that we are taking forward because every time there is a new set of challenges arising and therefore we need to equip our people with the right sets of skills. In addition, over the recent years in the human resources domain, we have tried to take an approach of an integrated framework that took into consideration moving from the previous practices of managing HR into a competency based human capital management. This is a journey we are currently going through, although there has been a lot of work in the areas of competency assessment, framework and developing a personal and customized development plan for our own people. With the right competent people, we will make our companies to cope with challenges as meeting electricity demand and various stakeholder expectations.</p><h4>What is your strategy to cater the rising demand for electricity in Muscat?</h4><p>Muscat Electricity has also emphasized building capacity for execution, so our organizational structure is also under constant review to make it a more dynamic and effective tool for execution in terms of meeting the demand and in expanding the infrastructure. In the last three years, we have focused more on enhancing the customer experience and we have revisited what is outsourced within our companies. We have developed a strategy to enhance the customer experience that targets the existing customers and new customers to be added. The other area, which experienced a major improvement, was in health and safety. This was a challenge given the wide spread of our network across Muscat. There was a huge focus being put on health and safety in terms of competencies, policies, procedures, and resources. We enhanced the health and safety culture within our company and with our contractors, as well as the general public.</p><h4>What initiatives are your introducing toward energy saving?</h4><p>We have some license obligations and we are trying to fulfill them in terms of educating our customers on how to conserve their consumption. Whenever there are some major customers coming to us, we educate them on the measures they can take in terms of the building materials and the kind of the energy efficient equipment they can use. We have also signed a MoU with the Ministry of Education to work on this issue. Building that value of energy conservation within the children could be a long-term objective by inculcate the culture of energy efficiency and conservation. We do have some campaigns in schools and the Society of Women as well as in some sport clubs in order to raise awareness among the community. The government has recently approved cost-reflective tariffs targeting the high-value consumption segment of customers and we are also doing our best to educate our customers on how they can make the best of these cost-reflective tariffs in order to manage their demand in the off-peak hours and reduce the overall stress on peak growth. They get a reasonable tariff rate during the off-peak and in terms of the network the demand during the peak will also be reduced.</p><h4>How is Muscat Electricity navigating toward its privatization?</h4><p>We raised our capital at the beginning of 2016 and it was a step toward preparing the company for privatization. The intention of the government is to privatize or offload the share of 49% with an IPO through the Muscat Security Market. Privatization generally brings more efficiency in companies where it takes place, as there is an expectation from the shareholders that it will bring a more innovative approach toward handling the different challenges of the future, whether they are financial, regulatory, or customer expectations. We are working toward improving a wide number of those areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Nama Group effectively manage and structure its activities across multiple businesses and subsidiary companies?</h4><p>Nama Holding (NH), formerly known as the Electricity Holding Company SAOC, is a joint stock company registered in the Sultanate of Oman. The company commenced commercial operations on September 16, 2003. Nama Holding holds 99.9% of the government's shares in nine subsidiaries. These subsidiary companies are engaged in the generation, procurement, transmission, distribution, and supply of electricity and water services in Oman. In 2014, NH established the Nama Institute for Competency and Development as the first training subsidiary in the electricity and water sectors.</p><h4>The Nama Group saw a 7% rise in customers in 2015. What key investments and strategies were executed to achieve this growth?</h4><p>First, there has been investment in generation capacity through private companies. OPWP has entered into contracts with private producers to procure electricity and water to meet the growth in demand. This is a continuous exercise because the average annual growth in number of customers is 6% since 2005 to 2015. The investment is private; it comes from various companies working in the sector at the moment. Second, there is transmission and distribution, which is basically the wires business. There is a lot of investment in electrical infrastructure to get electricity to everybody who needs it and to improve the reliability of services. In 2015 alone, we invested almost OMR400 million. This is also a continuous process as consumption per account is increasing, as is the population. For these reasons we have to keep investing in electricity infrastructure to ensure that we have a reliable service. Oman now has a high level of coverage for electricity. The group, through OPWP, has been able to improve the efficiency of gas utilization by nearly 30% since 2015. Since the restructuring of the electricity sector, we managed to reduce losses in the electricity system from 25% to less than 10% in 2015. Therefore, a lot of the work now being done is just to keep up with the growth in demand, the rising number of customers, and the enhancement of the network.</p><h4>As a strategic enabler of energy infrastructure development and investment attraction, what is Nama Group's role in the diversification of the economy under Oman's 2020 Vision?</h4><p>Nama Group, and the electricity sector as a whole, is an enabler for the Omani economy. Everything we do is to enable the Omani economy to achieve its full potential. In 2015 the World Bank identified electricity as one of the main drivers for the improvement of the ease of doing business in Oman. We have established a good reputation in this regard, and a lot of investors are keen to invest in new plants. We have also been asked to look into the privatization of one of the distribution companies.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Nama Group over the next 12 months?</h4><p>We expect steady growth to continue. We are looking to arrange financing for the next wave of investments in the electricity transmission and distribution networks. Also, there are four important areas in which the group is focusing. These are the reliability of the power supply, cost efficiency, customer service, and the safety of our staff and contractors. We have been making strong progress and improved our customer services and asset management systems. We have implemented customer service management systems and are reviewing our contracts with third parties to ensure improvements are made in the type of services being delivered. Some of our subsidiaries have already achieved ISO and health and safety certification. A lot of work has been going on, and it will continue to ensure that we provide a good and reliable service to our customers. Building on this, in the next five years we will strive to improve efficiencies and reduce our cost per unit supplied whilst at the same time ensuring reliability, customer service, and the safety of our people and work environments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In a context of increasing water prices, how do you assess the importance of maximizing the use of this resource through your capabilities?</h4><p>Haya Water provides the treated effluent (TE) as a suitable alternative water resource for uses other than drinking. There is great potential for agriculture, landscaping, district cooling, power production, and more. Currently, the TE utilization rate stands at 53% of production, and our plan is to reach 67% by 2026 during peak seasons. Haya Water is currently supplying Muscat Municipality with TE for landscaping. Other customers such as the Opera House and every golf course are also making good use of this water resource. Haya Water aims to reserve potable or ground water and use TE as a substitute. In coordination with PAEW, Haya Water received a list of high water consumers and strives to offer them TE for irrigation and industrial use.</p><h4>How will your plans to connect at least 80% of properties by 2020 with a water re-use network system stand as a milestone in the region?</h4><p>Haya Water's Master Plan 2013 projected 80% connectivity of properties in Muscat by 2020. Currently the connectivity stands at 35%. It is a challenge to achieve the initial target due to practical challenges on the ground during the implementation of the projects. Some of these challenges are the lack of necessary drawings for other utilities, the long time required to obtain the NOCs, insufficient resource management by some contractors, the rapid development of Muscat, and the changes in land usage. The constant growth in Muscat led to variations and extension of time for most of the projects. However, the updated Master Plan 2016 has taken these challenges into account and revised the targets accordingly. Based on MP 2016, 900,000 m3/d STP capacity is required instead of the earlier plan, which was 434,000 m3/d. It is important to point out here that the master plan of 2016 identified 316,258 properties to reach 80% connectivity, whereas the 2013 master plan identified 225,227 properties to reach to the same percentage.</p><h4>Last June, Haya Water announced its intention to build USD67.5 million in water projects in Oman. What are the plants being expanded and what new projects are you conducting?<br></h4><p>Projects are being initiated and implemented in line with the master plan for building a sewage network, a treatment plant, a TE system, which includes a pumping station, and distribution network facilities. The projects are progressing in four out of seven catchments under the Muscat Governorate toward the objective of 80% connectivity. The projects are under different stages, namely initiation, design, tendering, and construction. A contract has been awarded to KEO for Design of Al Khuwair 17/1 and 17/2 Integrated Service, the new approach to establishing the concept of a “utility corridor.“ Also, focus is being given to enhance TE supply with dedicated projects. Furthermore, Haya Water is playing a major role in supporting the execution of Muttrah Integrated Infrastructure Redevelopment (MIIR) project managed by Muscat Municipality, for which design works are in progress. In regional governorates, Haya Water was given the mandate in 2014 to extend the services of the water reuse scheme to all regional governorates except Dhofar. In continuation of the directions from the government for the transfer of projects from MRMWR to Haya Water dated May 1, 2016, the projects have been taken over.</p><h4>How are you cooperating with other local companies like Tabreed and Be'ah in providing green solutions for the country?</h4><p>The environment team has approached Be'ah regarding waste management and in particular hazardous waste in order to discover its plans and to see if Haya Water can send it hazardous waste for disposal. Be'ah explained its plans to deal with waste in general and informed us that it is not yet ready to receive hazardous waste at its location. We started to approach our existing and potential customers to encourage them to use TE for cooling. At the moment, we are working with Tabreed on all its projects that need TE for cooling. Palm Mall and Panorama Mall are already connected. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do you see opportunities for Google in the Colombian economy?</h4><p>First, Google Colombia is becoming more important every day. As a region, we are growing quickly—faster than many parts of the world. Inside Latin America, there are some countries receiving more attention than others, and Colombia is now one of those because there are many opportunities here. One measure of this is how we have grown since we opened the first operation here seven years ago. We started with only one person and now we have 70. We have been growing fast and have some interesting plans for 2017, especially in areas regarding the development of the ecosystem and SMEs. We are planning on growing more in these areas. Another good thing is the peace process here in Colombia, which unlocks many interesting opportunities because we don't have the uncertainty that we had last year. Certainty brings money and growth in the economy. One of Google's main goals everywhere in the world, and specifically in Colombia, is to intervene in the growth of the economy by boosting the growth of companies, from small startups to bigger firms in the country. All of our efforts here are oriented to help companies meet their goals. If they meet their goals, then we meet ours. Where other people see problems we see challenges, and where we see challenges we see opportunities.</p><h4>What sectors do you see having more growth potential in the short term?</h4><p>With respect to Google, there are six sectors that are important to us. The first three are: CPG, retail, and travel. These three sectors are well developed in digital terms; they are using our and other companies' digital assets and are growing at a interesting rate, and we want to help them grow even faster. The other three sectors are: finance, including every level of bank and financial institutions; government—we are helping our government make a digital jump; and telcos, for which we are helping firms of every size grow.</p><h4>What role you do see tech companies playing in the peace process?</h4><p>Technology gives opportunities, and we will soon have 8,000 more people looking to make a new life, and technology is there to help them. Google.org supports JuvenTIC, a program that promotes digital skills for Colombian youth. Along with other entities—the Colombian Reintegration Agency, USAID, the International Organization for Migration, Universidad EAFIT, Reconciliación Colombia and Colnodo—Google.org also supports “A Window to Dream," a 2016 program for people affected by conflict embarking on a new life. We teach them how to use the digital world and digital assets to create new enterprises and develop the abilities to be good employees for potential clients. This is a good example of how you can use technology to help in the peace process. Apart from this, technology brings transparency and access to knowledge that are fundamental because if you have knowledge, then you can change your life.</p><h4>Where does Colombia stand in its transformation toward a more digital economy?</h4><p>We have a mix of different things. On the one hand, we are behind, but on the other we are well developed. It is an interesting mixture. As for the latter, our “Viva Digital" program stands out because of the example it has set for many other countries. The government has nearly connected the entire country, a huge step in the right direction. On the down side, we really need to invest more in digital education, especially in education about the ecosystem. This is why 100% of our marketing budget goes to the education of the ecosystem. We go to our partners, clients, and the agencies, but we also have an open door for people such as Google entrepreneurs, Google developers, and many other initiatives to help people to take advantage of the digital world and all of Google's tools.</p><h4>How is Google bringing its history and reputation for innovation to the local market? What are Google Colombia's goals for 2017?</h4><p>The growth of our clients, which translates into our growth. All of our clients' goals: more revenue, more market share, more product launches, more brand awareness—these are our goals. We want their KPIs to become our KPIs. The second goal is to use more our products for this growth. We have three main products, one is YouTube, which here in Colombia has grown immensely, which we want to continue. The second product is GDN (Google Display Network), the biggest display network in the world, whose power we want to leverage even more this year. The third is our well-known search and performance platforms. We have become the favorite sales channel for many clients and want to use the power of the search engine for more industries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Saudi Arabia is the largest car rental market in the Middle East, and Budget Saudi Arabia is the largest firm in this market. How do you compare to others in the region?</h4><p>Budget Saudi Arabia is the largest franchisee in the world for Avis Budget Group. Moreover, we are one of the largest car rental and leasing companies in the Middle East. We have about 25-28% market share in the Saudi Arabian car rental industry. Budget Saudi is the only car rental and leasing company listed in Tadawul, the stock exchange in Saudi Arabia, and our shares are publicly traded on the market. This was one of the strategic moves that allowed us to scale up business to its current level.</p><h4>Such dominance is rare in any sector in the Middle East, much less in the highly competitive rental car market. What in your history has resulted in your leading position?</h4><p>Budget Saudi was established in 1978. We have built a wealth of experience in nearly four decades. By experience, I mean that our key employees have decades of professional practice. Our visionary founder is the Executive Chairman of the group. Our formidable team with their expertise and commitment have excelled in every area of our operations. The average tenure of our top management team is nearly two decades. This shows the depth of experience in our team and the consistency of its management practices. There are also other factors that have contributed to our position. We have invested heavily in our infrastructure as well. We understand that we do not produce a tangible product: our product is our service. When renting a car, it is necessary to trust that it will function well and that it is safe. We create customer experience each time they drive a Budget vehicle. Though it seems like a simple task, when it comes to thousands of vehicles across the largest country in the Gulf it becomes a complex matter. Moreover we need to ensure consistency across all our retail locations and customer service points. Maintenance centers and mobile workshops are our fundamental infrastructure, and we have dedicated substantial resources to establish a nationwide network of these service centers. Our customers know that our cars are perfectly maintained, and that they can always count on us. When dealing with multinationals, they expect the highest quality, reliability, and consistency. We ensure these expectations are achieved and that makes us unique.</p><h4>Is there a new push for you to be present in smaller, secondary cities, and what recent investments have you made to your maintenance and retail infrastructure?</h4><p>As long as there is an airport, we are present. Budget Saudi Arabia has been present in all the major airports in The Kingdom for several decades. Recently, we have been expanding our operations into smaller cities to cater to the needs of our customers. With 105 retail locations, we are present in every province of this country. So our network covers Saudi Arabia from north to south and east to west. This is a major advantage for us because our clients, corporate or retail, can find us everywhere they travel. They can use the same provider with the same quality throughout the Kingdom. Once an airport opens in a city we build our infrastructure, which is our workshops and branches, and we recruit and train our team. We set up a complete transportation solution for our clients. It is not just about buying cars and renting them out, we build a complete solution inclusive of 24-hour emergency road assistance services. For example, we opened our newest facility in Jubail and invested there to support the government's new oil and gas projects in the east of the country, which have resulted in increased economic activity in Jubail and the eastern region in general. We have also invested and have been doing business in Ras Al-Khair, the minerals port in the Eastern Province, for the past four to five years, serving corporate clients involved in the mining industry there. We follow economic development in the Kingdom.</p><h4>What are your other streams of revenue besides corporate, and where will there be growth in 2017?</h4><p>Budget Saudi Arabia has two lines of business, short term and long term. Our long-term business is definitely 100% corporate, we do not provide long term leasing for individuals. In the Eastern Province most of our business is with the oil and gas sector because that is an oil and gas hub for Saudi Arabia. In the Western Region most of the business is in retail and the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) segment, connected with Hajj and Umrah. In the Central Region it is a mix of sectors and a lot of retail business as well. When it comes to short-term rentals 65% are corporate, and the remainder is retail or leisure customers. Saudi citizens travel a lot between cities. Many people travel for the religious pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina every year and then in the summer they move to the Southern Region to enjoy the hill station. Some 98% of our retail business depends on local customer traffic, not international travelers. Budget Saudi Arabia grows with the economy, and despite macroeconomic issues, the industries that we cater to are strong and sustainable.</p><h4>Have you seen a boost in your used car sale business as the new car market has declined?</h4><p>Selling our rental cars after two years is an important line of business for us. It represents 75% of our profitability and has a high margin. When people buy our cars they know these cars have been well maintained. The investment we make in our workshops and maintenance centers for our rental and lease cars pays us back almost twofold when we sell off a car at the end. We deliver a well-maintained product to the used car market, which no other re-seller from our industry can claim, be they dealers or individuals. Furthermore, we are the only car rental company that has our own car showrooms to sell to the public. We have not seen any decline in demand for used cars, while some dealers of new cars have experienced a YoY reduction of 50-60% in 2016. That is an indication of how robust our resale business is, and could be interpreted as growth given the economic circumstances.</p><h4>Is a year of change like 2017 about chasing efficiency or looking for new opportunities for Budget? How do you adjust to the macroeconomic situation?</h4><p>Actually, in 2017, opportunities will be excellent for Budget Saudi Arabia when compared to our competitors. When we buy in a difficult time, we dictate the price. Most of our competitors are family-owned businesses that are less willing and potentially less inclined to invest in times of poor economic conditions. We intentionally invest more during downturns. We know that we will gain more market share in an economy where our competitors are not willing to invest. We are still keen in investing because we believe we can gain a higher market share of the existing pie even though it is stagnant at the moment.</p><h4>Do you see scope for growth at Budget Saudi Arabia due to the reforms that being implemented in line with Vision 2030?</h4><p>The government's Vision 2030 will bring a lot of business to us. With the private sector on the rise, companies will employ more people because Vision 2030 is all about employing more Saudi citizens. We have approximately 200,000 students abroad and when they return to the Kingdom they need to work, and the country needs to create jobs for them. Job creation will definitely add to our economy because we depend on domestic travel. When people have jobs they have higher spending power and will travel either for business or leisure within Saudi Arabia. We are enthusiastic about the reforms and are ready for them. More private sector activity means employing more people, which creates higher demand for our services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Be'ah contributing to the development of environmental solutions within the Sultanate?</h4><p>Be'ah strives to conserve the environment for future generations. Be'ah's main objectives are to control environmental damage incurred during decades of traditional waste dumping processes; re-structure the waste sector in Oman and its related services in a sustainable manner; develop the industry; and support Oman's economy. Under this umbrella, Be'ah works on moving toward sustainable waste management practices as per international standards by establishing the required infrastructure, restructuring waste services, and improving public awareness of waste management. Be'ah is also setting up the country's first integrated industrial hazardous waste management and treatment facility in North Al- Batinah. Spread over 240 hectares, it will have a slag reclamation and hazardous waste engineered landfill. The integrated facility will also consist of plants for solidification, physical/chemical treatment, and thermal treatment. Furthermore, Be'ah has projects based on the theme of waste to energy to water. This is a national project whereby waste is thermally treated to generate energy, which is then fed to a desalination plant to produce potable water. At present, the desalination plants in the country are run by natural gas-fired engines. Under this project, natural gas can be substituted with energy generated from waste, and in this way the Sultanate can minimize the use of natural gas and redirect natural gas production toward exports, which contributes to the national economy. We have plans to set up a waste-to-energy-to-water plant on the South Al Batinah coast. A feasibility study was conducted and looked into aspects like waste characterization to determine which technology is best for the plant. If 2,100 tons/day of municipal waste were diverted to the plant, it would generate enough electricity to produce 120 million cubic meters of desalinated water per annum. This is almost 40% of the country's existing desalination capacity.</p><h4>What are some of Be'ah's major accomplishments, especially in relation to closing dumpsites and establishing a solid waste value chain?</h4><p>Uncontrolled dumpsites have existed for decades in Oman and all sorts of mixed-waste streams are dumped in unprotected trenches or dumpsites. It is estimated that there are more than 380 dumpsites scattered across the country that are polluting soil, water, and air causing fires and unpleasant odors and they contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. As a priority to control the damage, Be'ah embarked on an aggressive plan to close all dumpsites and replace them with 11 engineered landfills and 25 transfer stations across the country. As the infrastructure is being laid out, municipal solid waste services outsource contracts were floated as tenders, whereby experienced companies provide municipal waste management services that include pre-collection, collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste. We have started providing waste management services in the governorates of South Al-Sharqiya, South Al-Batinah, and Al-Dakhiliya. Our services in Dhofar are expected to start in January 2017, followed by Al- Dhairah and Al- Buriami. The rest of the governorates will be covered in due course.</p><h4>This sector is ripe for investment. Which areas are you most ambitious about?</h4><p>The total investment for basic infrastructure for municipal waste will be around USD150 million, the waste-energy-water project by itself will have a total investment of well over USD750 million, and the industrial waste infrastructure will have an investment of over USD150 million. Focusing on the specific projects, such as the waste to energy to water project, we do not yet have a local company that can develop and construct this. This has to be open for international companies. We also need international companies for industrial waste and have already taken steps to engage international companies. There are also great business opportunities in the different waste streams. To reinforce in-country value, Be'ah is working toward establishing various opportunities for investors and SMEs to manage end-of-life tires (ELT), construction and demolition waste (C&amp;D), lead acid batteries (LAB), and more. We are now focusing on putting in place investment opportunities both for Omani and international companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does MECA play in evaluating the ecological and environmental impact of new activities named in the ninth Five-Year Plan?</h4><p>As part of the continued economic development of Oman, the ministry recognizes that these sectors and industries are of great importance as they contribute toward the achievement of the government policy of economic diversification. As the Ministry fosters the objectives of sustainable development, it works with developers both public and private early in the project life cycle to ensure the economic viability as well as the environmental and social soundness of proposed projects. The environmental permits system allows the integration of the best available technologies not entailing excessive economic costs, thus striking the required balance for achieving sustainable development objectives. Our role does not stop here, but continues throughout the project cycle to ensure proper environmental performance and continuous improvement. To give a boost to economic development and to improve the business environment, the ministry is moving forward to decentralize environmental permitting and provide incentives for quality environmental performance.</p><h4>What kinds of collaborations have been made between MECA and other ministries over the past year, and what can we expect them to bring?</h4><p>The development of partnerships with other ministries is of great importance to us, as are partnerships with the private sector and society as a whole. Since last year, we have made a lot of progress working with other ministries, authorities, and universities. We have several inter-governmental committees, bilateral committees, and have signed concrete MoUs for joint collaboration with our partners. For example, we worked closely with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOCI), the Ministry of Information, the Information Technology Authority, the Public Authority for Mining, Sohar Industrial Port Company, PDO, and others. In particular, MECA has contributed significantly to the development of the InvestEasy portal, where we have instituted a smooth environmental permitting component within that portal. MECA works closely with the Ministry of Regional Municipalities and Water Resources on issues related to ground water quality as well as waste and wastewater management. We also collaborate with SQU in many projects such as joint research projects. In addition, the ministry plans to continue its dialogue with other ministries covering different development sectors to foster collaboration and encourage sustainable development policies and practices, ensuring a prosperous future for the Omani people and balanced economic development of the country.</p><h4>In light of the second seawater pumping station opening at Sohar Port, in what ways does the ministry work to support infrastructural energy-efficiency projects throughout the Sultanate?</h4><p>As part of Oman's commitments to the Paris Agreement made last year at the UN Conference of the Parties (COP21), the ministry recognizes the vital importance of the adoption of environmentally sound technologies and projects that are energy efficient. The ministry will be advocating and implementing programs and activities in conjunction with partners that are designed to reduce gas flaring from oil industries, to increase the share of renewable energy and to increase the adoption of energy efficiency projects among industries. In addition, the ministry will encourage proponents to be innovative in the development of their projects, to design and operate projects using the best available technologies that are also cost-effective, and to achieve the desired outcomes while protecting the environment. This includes issues such as climate change and the increasing challenge of water scarcity and its sustainable use.</p><h4>What are some challenges specific to Oman that the ministry faces as a result of climate change?</h4><p>Climate change is a global phenomenon potentially affecting everyone on the planet. Oman is no exception. According to the Initial National Communication of Climate Change, in the Sultanate of Oman, coastal zones, water resources, and the marine environment are considered to be among the main challenges. In this respect, MECA is currently preparing a National Strategy for Climate Mitigation and Adaptation through which Oman will be prepared to deal with future scenarios of climate change. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What initiatives has the Ministry of Sports Affairs put in place to develop a sports culture in Oman?</h4><p>We undertook a sports study of Oman, which involved different sectors including sport for competition, sports for health, and sports as a tourism promoter. Every sector has different ways to integrate them into our strategy. When promoting youth and sports, for example, it is not possible to implement a strategy alone; we must cooperate with the Ministry of Education on how to organize sports among the youth, how you start sports in schools, what type of sports, and what are the available facilities. We also work with the Ministry of Regional Municipalities, because it is important to have the proper infrastructure in order to accommodate the population in different areas such as clubs or complexes. Sport for competition is built through the youth in training centers and clubs, and it is built through associations and the Olympic Committee. Sport in general goes together with youth development, competition, culture, and health, so it has to be integrated as a habit, and we can see this in the new generation as it is healthier than before.</p><h4>What are the main sports facilities and complexes currently used to host sporting activities and events in Oman?</h4><p>We have various sport complexes in different regions across Oman and are already expanding some these developments. In almost every region in Oman, we have a full sport complex where we host more than one sport. For example, the most popular sport is football, and we have a stadium that hosts 20,000. We can also host large events in our indoor sports halls, such as volleyball, basketball, and handball competitions as well as indoor and outdoor Olympic swimming pools. It is not necessary to host them all in Muscat, as this is part of hosting sports tourism across the nation. For example, the Desert Marathon is an international event where we have a dual strategy targeting sports and at the same time tourism. The geography of Oman helps the success of these events, as the people participating see different views and terrains. There is 150km of desert, mountains, valleys, and beaches so our participants run through various sceneries. These people enjoy coming to Oman to do sports, and the media coverage encourages more people to participate and visit Oman for sports tourism; these are all positive results.</p><h4>How does the ministry partner with Oman Sail to develop sailing programs that amplify the cultural significance of sailing in Oman?</h4><p>Oman has a history around the world in terms of sailing. Oman Sail is doing a tremendous job of gathering more young kids that are interested in participating in this activity, youths who already have a sailing background and who are participating in competitions outside the present and promote the country abroad. Participating in those events by itself gives our youth mileage and experience, and people abroad get to understand the country. It is not only a matter of winning; we have to balance it both ways.</p><h4>What is the ministry's Olympic strategy to support athletes' development and the advancement of sports associations?</h4><p>Our aim from the beginning started with sport youth centers at different locations. We started with 10 or 12 and now we already have almost 600. To reach the Olympics requires a different strategy completely. As a government ministry, we are not the ones who create the teams; this is done by the associations and the Olympic committee. We are in the rear and try our best to prepare the infrastructure for almost all sports. We have the strategy we started four years ago with the youth centers and consider them incubators. Out of those sporting youths, we can pick a few of them and will take care of them in certain divisions of sport so that maybe they will reach Olympic levels. Let's hope that for the 2020 Olympics we can participate in bigger numbers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision behind the creation of the Royal Opera House Muscat?</h4><p>It is important to see the advent of the Royal Opera House Muscat (ROHM) in the greater context of the vision of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos. Over the past 46 years His Majesty has transformed Oman into a modern nation while preserving its rich traditional heritage culture. In creating the ROHM, His Majesty had the noble aim of fostering world peace and harmony through the performing arts, especially music as the universal language of humanity.</p><h4>The 2016-2017 season is titled “Excellence in Diversity.“ What is the artistic idea behind this title for the coming season?</h4><p>The signature phrase Excellence in Diversity encapsulates the ROHM concept of enhancing the excellence of the Royal Opera House by emphasizing diversity through different genres from various cultures around the world for a season of balanced programs at a high standard. Diversity is the key consideration that governs ROHM's program planning strategies. Balanced selections include a broad range of genres encompassing opera, symphonic concerts, both vocal and instrumental recitals, ballet, musicals, world shows, jazz, productions for families and children as well as our own original productions and special events. </p><h4>How does ROHM work to attract tourists and local residents to its variety of shows and events?</h4><p>The ROHM is in itself an attraction that brings tourists to the city, not only because of its renowned contemporary Omani architecture, but also because of its stellar programming. The production and programming are superb and feature a high caliber of world-famous stars, orchestras, and opera and ballet companies in productions for which it is difficult to get tickets in the great opera houses of Europe or America, let alone at a reasonable cost. ROHM offers ticket prices to suit a range of budgets, with seats as low as USD6, and VIP seats at an upper limit of USD165, with a reasonable range of prices in between. The ROHM Auditorium was carefully designed so that all seats—and this means every single seat in the house regardless of price—have a good view of the stage.</p><h4>What are the educational and outreach initiatives at the Royal Opera House?</h4><p>More than 16,000 students have participated in ROHM's educational outreach and open house events during this past season, all of which are free of charge. These initiatives take place in the main building which houses the auditorium and also in the equally stunning commercial Opera Galleria wing of the ROHM complex. We are now engaged in further efforts to expand and deepen our relationships with private and public schools in Muscat. One of our most successful ventures was a customized, one-hour opera through a process that included school teachers and engaged students as interactive participants who directed the action from their seats in the audience with props and sang along in Italian and Arabic on cue.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the next 12 months?</h4><p>The first priority is to ensure the smooth running of, and a high level of participation in, the wonderful season to come. Also of high importance is the continued training of Omanis as administrative and managerial staff, and as technicians and staging and costume specialists in theater arts. We currently have 223 employees, of which 73% are Omani nationals. As the ROHM is an opera house for the people of Oman, I aim to develop a future staff complement that is more than 90% Omani. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Amouage's strategy to promote the brand within Oman and internationally?</h4><p>The Oman market is where we have the highest level of consumer recognition and buy-in. We are a mature brand at 35 years old and are widely recognized in Oman. Therefore, our marketing strategy here is different from marketing in other countries, where we are still introducing consumers to our products. In Oman, along with advertising and features to support the launches, we promote through the use of product placement at key events where our focus customers are likely to be. We always make sure there are strategically placed interviews with our creative director each year, because in Oman it is all about continuing the story and selling the brand to consumers who have just joined our key target group. In some other markets internationally we are also well known, while in others we are still announcing our presence. The internationalization of the brand continues each year and we are no longer just an Omani brand, but a much bigger international brand that happens to be based in Oman.</p><h4>How does Amouage maintain high standards for all the products in its portfolio, with most of the production happening outside of Oman?</h4><p>The high-quality standards are exactly the same across all of our production. We have to police this carefully as only 60% of our fragrance is made in house in our own factory. The quality we expect in Oman is exactly the same as the product quality we would expect internationally. The only difference is that, with all the labor and salary changes in Oman, it is more profitable to manufacture our fragrances in the UK than in Oman. It is a significant financial commitment to continue manufacturing in Oman and we are restricted in not being able to hire the best people for jobs. In the long term it will be difficult to justify keep manufacturing here unless freedom of employment and the costs are improved.</p><h4>What product launches are due to take place at Amouage in the upcoming year?</h4><p>We have just launched a new collection of ostrich-print leather, which is doing well. We are about to launch another range of logo print, which is printed cotton with a calf leather trim. We launched a fine quality, silk scarf collection in June 2016, which will include a hijab size, as well as a normal large square size. We believe that the Amouage brand can stretch into textile accessory products as well as leather. If the scarf collection develops well and we see sales growing, then we may move into other accessory areas. I am in talks with licensees in Italy about an optical frame and sunglasses collection, for example. We also have several new fragrances being launched, including a new collection called The Secret Garden, which is mainly florals, but always with a twist. We have also launched our latest main line fragrances, Myths for man and woman, at the end of May 2016.</p><h4>How does Amouage grow and adapt to the developing customer base and to changes in the overall retail industry in Oman?</h4><p>The consumer is ever changing, particularly with the influence of the internet and social media. Consumers have so much information pumped into them all the time that their views, values, and fashion ideals are continually evolving. The moment we take our eye off the international consumer, we will lose our position in the market. It is my and our creative director's job to keep up with all aspects of new consumer trends and developments; however, we do not slavishly follow these. We always sing our own song and make sure we decide and do not let trends alone dictate our work. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Al Mouj announced contracts worth USD80 million for the development of The Gardens project. What are some of the details and plans in place for this new development?</h4><p>The Gardens and Marasa are Al Mouj's latest apartment developments, consisting of of 474 high-end residences next to Al Mouj Marina. The projects are currently under construction and will be ready by the end of 2017. These two precincts are not only unique because of their lush green surrounds, but also because they are close to Almouj Marina, Almouj Golf, and The Walk. Located in the heart of Muscat, it will be a high-end shopping and dining hub bringing unmatched value proposition for investors and home-owners. At Al Mouj we always try to innovate and break the boundaries with our work. Our focus is on lifestyle and not only selling brick and mortar.</p><h4>How is the Kempinski Hotel development progressing and how will the addition of this hotel bring new benefits to Al Mouj?</h4><p>The Kempinski Hotel is set to open in 2017 and it is a 400-room hotel and service apartment development. We also have the Shaza Hotel adjacent to Al Mouj Marina, a 200-room development which will also open in 2017. Hospitality is the last component of our project; we have leisure, sports, retail, and shopping centers alongside our premium residential complex. The hotels are the last part of the mix, and they will support all our other assets, as well as increase the tourism sector.</p><h4>What steps has Al Mouj taken to attract more buyers from outside Oman?</h4><p>Al Mouj is an integrated tourism complex (ITC); its key differentiating factor is its ability to sell to non-Omanis. Since 2005-2006, we have been actively marketing the project in Oman and have been successful selling around 2,200 properties. In 2016, we took the step of actively marketing the development outside Oman in Africa, the GCC, Iran, Iraq, and India. We have held roadshows in each of these markets and have been successful. We sold the most expensive villa of the complex in East Africa and the most expensive apartment, a penthouse, to an Indian buyer. The real estate market has receded a bit due to economic factors like low oil prices. Despite that, at Al Mouj we have seen a 30% increase over 2016 sales. This is partly due to our brand and the quality lifestyle we provide, but it is also because of our new strategy of going outside Oman to find clients. This means we are not reliant solely on the local market and this is what all ITC projects across the country need to do. We have found that it is a learning process for clients, too.</p><h4>Do you find business primarily coming from international investors or mostly locals?</h4><p>Our ratio of local and international investors has been 50-50. Previously, many of the non-Omanis buying from us were residents. Now, we start to market Oman abroad. For example, we had one German buyer who bought an apartment after seeing our roadshow in Kenya and subsequently coming to Oman to see the development. As of 2016, 30% of our sales have been to people who have never been in Oman before. Al Mouj is the first developer to go out of the market to sell its properties. Oman is beautiful, and buyers are looking for high-quality assets like the ones we are building. More marketing about the country and Muscat is required.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the next 12 months?</h4><p>In general, the real estate industry has seen a challenging year in 2016 and this is expected to continue in most parts of 2017, with an expectation of a starting rebound in the last quarter of next year. Al Mouj will continue to rely not just on the local market, but also on regional markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-new-model]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the progress of your most relevant integrated projects, and how are they supporting Omran's broader business strategy? </h4><p>We have a number of projects at different stages of construction underway. One of the most iconic projects is the Madinat Al Irfan Urban Centre. The project will establish a new urban center within Muscat. It will be at the nexus of excellent transport connections within the capital and beyond, including a location close to the new Muscat International Airport, and will create a new downtown for residents, businesses, and visitors. More than 7 million sqm, the new center will offer a new urban fabric for Muscat, establishing an integrated, sustainable, and inclusive community catering to many different ages, income groups, and ethnicities. This will become a model for new urban development locally and regionally. As with all developments Omran works on, Madinat Al Irfan will draw influence from the rich heritage and culture of Oman, while still offering everything a contemporary city should. A key feature of this urban development's first phase is the world-class Oman Convention and Exhibition Centre (OCEC), which opened its doors last September. The OCEC is built with state-of-the-art facilities and in accordance with the rigorous LEED certification of environmental excellence. Omran's OCEC is set to attract a completely new business and market to the country and strongly position Oman as one of the key MICE hubs of the region. It has just hosted its first exhibition in October in the newly finished exhibition halls, and the conference facilities will be open in 2017. Approximately 600 hotel rooms are under construction to directly support the OCEC: the five-star luxury JW Marriott and the four-star Crowne Plaza, in which Oman's two leading pension funds have recently made a 20% investment. Having these assets already on-site is important to prospective investors. Business on many projects of this size is done off plan, but investor confidence is boosted when assets are already in place. This opens up the door for investors to look at the attractive investment proposition that the upcoming phases of Madinat Al Irfan provide. The partnership models will be flexible and investor friendly, with a carefully established regulatory framework in place to encourage investment.</p><h4>How is Omran supporting the development of sustainable tourism projects across Oman?</h4><p>Omran is committed to driving Oman's social and economic growth through developments that are financially, socially, environmentally, and culturally sustainable. It is our duty to safeguard Oman's communities, natural beauty, wildlife, and rich culture so sustainability is built into every aspect of Omran's project design and delivery, and we only undertake developments that have been assessed for their impact on the environmental and local communities. For example, the W Hotel is going for the highest LEED rating, which is the main body that legislates environmentally sensitive design, and Omran's Atana Musandam Resort already holds a Silver LEED certificate. In addition, our flagship mountain hotel, Alila, was the first LEED certified hotel in Oman. It is made out of local stone mined from the top of Jabal Akhdar, where the weather is around 15 degrees cooler than in Muscat year round. At Alila, we have launched the Farming for Hospitality project, for which we partnered up with local farmers that now provide fruit and vegetables for the hotel and nearby hotels.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Omran over the next 12 months?</h4><p>One of the key objectives of my appointment is to move the company into a much more profitable position, and that is done through financial success and sustainable development. We are the tourism and real estate pillar of the country, and the only way we can move forward, and the best way to move forward, is with private-sector participation in everything that we do. For every hotel bedroom we build, it has been proven in terms of worldwide statistics that it creates seven direct and indirect jobs. From the person who sells the bread to the hotel, to the tour operator, or the person who cleans the room, the multiplier effect on the economy will be substantial. Our commitment is to be seen as a credible partner for the private sector, and to be seen as an organization committed to developing world class destinations that can help the tourism sector of Oman reach its potential, while ensuring our full commitment to doing this in a sustainable manner that safeguards Oman's social, environmental, cultural, and economic sustainability. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Oman's ninth Five-Year Plan has made tourism a significant priority. What areas need further development?</h4><p>Tourism has been identified as one of the future key pillars of Oman's economy. The Ministry of Tourism recently finalized its new long-term strategy, spanning 2016-2040, which will see the development of tourism clusters and unique experiences. This will require a rigorous implementation of tourism strategy plans in terms of management, human resource development, infrastructure, and employment. At this stage, detailed master plans are being formulated, making it easy and convenient for the private sector, both local and foreign, to identify attractive projects for potential investment. Additionally, important steps are being taken in terms of procedures facilitation and timeliness of approvals.</p><h4>Oman has various world-class natural sites for tourism. How will these be made more accessible to international tourists?</h4><p>The Oman Tourism Strategy calls for the creation of tourism attractions grouped by clusters and itineraries. These will include both natural sites and new developments such as resorts, parks, hotels, and more. The management of the rollout of such new projects will focus on quality enhancement, environmental sustainability, and distinctiveness. In addition, the promotion of Oman, locally, regionally, and internationally, will be based on two strategic pillars: digital marketing and public relations. With the pace of the development of technology and increasing accessibility, we will easily reach the specific target groups we aim to attract: leisure seekers, adventure visitors, sport lovers, as well as business people. The exposure and visibility of the Sultanate will be sharp and focused to maximize effectiveness and sustainability.</p><h4>The sector has incredible potential to employ Omanis, both through government initiatives and SMEs. How does the ministry work to boost local involvement in the sector?</h4><p>The tourism sector aims at creating more than half a million jobs by 2040, direct and indirect, most of which will be for Omanis. To ensure the effectiveness of such an ambitious goal, educational and training initiatives are planned. Also, hundreds of new SMEs will be required to support the industry over its development process. Specific jobs and SME categories have been identified.</p><h4>What are your plans for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our new tourism strategy is ready for implementation. This coming year will be focused on planning and organization. Simultaneously, tourism development quick-win projects are in the pipeline. We hope to create a solid foundation for what has now been universally recognized as the next major sector of the Omani economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With logistics listed as a key sector in the ninth five-year plan, what advancements have taken place over the past year in logistics and what are some future plans for SEZAD?</h4><p>If Oman continues to work toward creating an active manufacturing sector and starts to produce, export, and import, then there is room for real growth. There needs to be a hinterland of manufacturing to get raw materials from the outside and produce from inside; therefore, there must be a framework for flow of goods going both ways. In two years, the seaport infrastructure will be complete, and we also have an airport. We have an ambitious plan to create not just a normal container, bulk area port, but also have a liquid terminal where oil and gas finished products will be exported. There will also be a storage area for the oil and gas so that the ships can have their water, food, and fuel supply while loading and unloading. We have a dry dock to provide repair and maintenance services for them. </p><h4>What benefits does the construction of the massive oil storage facility offer for Sezad?</h4><p>Regarding the massive oil storage tank, it is important for us to be able store oil because it cannot always simply be extracted from the ground and supplied to the customer. Crude oil demand is very seasonal; at any certain point, there may be low or high demand. This oil storage space will allow us to regulate our capacity and will put us in a key position. In the south of Duqm, there is a 200 million-barrel storage unit, which is owned by the Oman Oil Company. That place was selected as it is a natural harbor, 32m deep draft, a natural height that allows gravity to put the oil into the vessels cost effectively.</p><h4>What are some of the plans currently in place for the USD10 billion China-Oman industrial park in Duqm?</h4><p>We are planning that project according to the resources we have. The first phase is for solar panels, tubular pipes. Some industries in this venture need gas, so we are going to plan the phasing of the investment based on gas availability. It will be a five- to seven-year plan for the overall investment. The investment from China is a bit different because it is also responsible for providing the infrastructure itself. We gave it a piece of land and it will do the infrastructure and factory construction within the next year. When the gas pipes come there will be a need for a chemical refinery and petrochemical plant, so that will depend on the oil storage and the Duqm authorities. </p><h4>What are the details of SEZAD's plan to develop a fishing port?</h4><p>Fishing is a long and sustainable industry in Oman and enjoys rich resources along a very long coastline. We not only have the fishing vessels for the fishery port, but we will also have a food-processing center. When the fish are caught, we want to process rather than sell raw, so that we can create some added value. Furthermore, the airport will be finished soon, and we will be able to export fresh fish to the market. </p><h4>What is your outlook for SEZAD over the next 12 months of business?</h4><p>SEZAD is subject to the world economy, and the investors coming here are looking for access to markets all around the region. Iran is a market that we cannot ignore, but people are still cautious. Additionally, oil prices are very low, everyone is adjusting to new budgets, and the supply and demand curve will shift. All of this will have an impact on the market and investors will react accordingly. It is a challenging time, and the whole world economy is not doing very well, but there are bright spots and we have to look at long-term prospects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Today, the speed of transit and speed of turnaround in the port has become much more important. On the general cargo side, we are close to the main mineral deposits in Thumrait, which makes it easy for exporters to get their goods to market quickly. We are also quite an important import port for agricultural products coming from North Africa. People think of Salalah as a container port, a limestone and gypsum port, and occasionally a cruise port, but we also import a million live goats a year and have many navies there because of the anti-piracy task force. It is a broad-based business because of its closeness to North Africa, its closeness to the shipping lines, and its position on the Indian Ocean.</p><h4>What were the strategic decisions and operational action plans that drove business growth at the port during the past year?</h4><p>The container business grew by 25% over last year. It is important for shipping lines to not spend time in port; the quicker they can get in and get out again the better for them. Salalah has improved in terms of efficiency and productivity every year for the last five years. We always say we are in the top three in North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe, and we will go further up the table in the course of the next 12 months. It is not just the speed with which we turn the vessels around; it is also the fact that they can rely on us to do it. We are really good at doing what we do, and that is what attracts business.</p><h4>What technological innovations are being implemented at the Port of Salalah in order to continue its high standard efficiency operations?</h4><p>We have the best available systems for operating the container terminals, and that is an off-the-shelf package; anyone can buy it but we use all of its modules. Traditionally, ports in the Far East are quick and productive because they can throw many people at it; that cannot be done in Europe because labor is expensive so they have to use technology. One of the reasons that the Port of Salalah is successful is because we have combined the two. Our labor is not as cheap as in the Far East but we can afford to have more people than traditionally in a European port. But our constant process improvement is the byword of our port, identifying what the pinch points are and eliminating them. What impresses me is that there is no resistance to change in Oman. People are proud every time we achieve something new and they want to be part of it.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Port of Salalah over the next 12 months?</h4><p>Salalah will continue to buck the trend; most ports in the world see declines in their volumes and we are increasing and continuing to increase because we are improving our market share thanks to our geographical position. We have done a bit of brain storming recently about why it is that people like us and it is because they can trust us. On the container side we will continue to grow and by the end of 2017 we will be handling more containers than we ever have. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the drivers behind your impressive profit margin last year?</h4><p>For our fleet and contracts, around 60% is focused on long-term contracts, which ensure steady cash flow for the company. About 40% of our vessels are in the spot; therefore, the flow of contracts provide a cushion for us whether the market is up or down. The spot market is where companies can earn more or less depending on how the market goes. 2015 was a great year because we have about 15 very large goods carriers trading in the market. The drop in oil prices has caused a higher demand for the usage of very large cruise carriers (VLCCs). The rates and the demand for hiring VLCCs have gone up, while our operating costs have gone down. Therefore, our margins have gone up and this made for an excellent year. Moving forward, it will hopefully be a good market in 2016 and 2017, after which it will reduce. When ship owners see something good, they tend to spoil it by buying vessels on a speculative basis in order to get a piece of the profit. All of a sudden there are many vessels coming in and we see this happening for the next two years, which will reduce the market.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Oman Express Service for the overall shipping industry of the country?</h4><p>This is run by our subsidiary Oman Container Lines. We started first by connecting Sohar to Jebel Ali, which is a weekly service that runs successfully. We launched the Oman Express Service in April 2016. The whole idea was to capture all the Omani ports and link them to Jebel Ali. Right now, the service is there to promote tradability. Real connectivity between ports in Oman and influential foreign ports is one of the difficulties we face. Service is once every two weeks right now and we seek to create awareness of its benefits. Once we see that the service is successful, we will try to link Omani ports with other regions. Jebel Ali is a major contender in transshipment, because mother vessels travel there and it is well connected to the region, with daily services to Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. This vision will not be realized overnight; we need to see what we can create, and we need to understand what customers really want.</p><h4>Do you have plans to expand your fleet to strengthen your position in the market?</h4><p>We currently own and operate 47 vessels and have an additional five vessels coming in by the end of this year, which takes us to 52 vessels. There was a time we started to move out, but now we want to focus a great deal on Oman and bring all of our resources back to the country. There is a great deal of industry coming up here, such as refineries and the mining sector. We are trying to provide the shipping solutions for these industries. The feeder vessels connecting Oman to the region are the type of projects that we are going to concentrate on moving forward.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Oman Shipping Company over the next five years?</h4><p>I would like to see us not only concentrate our trade in Oman, but also become a key player in the region. This would mainly be in the wet side for product tankers as well as bulk areas. The bulk area is mostly for the mining industry and the minerals coming out of Oman. The wet side product tankers are mainly for the refining capacity, not only in Oman, but also in the GCC. We want to work closely with the stakeholders in the refineries to understand how we can provide the transportation for them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After achieving all of the stated objectives for the company last year, what are some of the new and current objectives on the agenda for Oman Air?</h4><p>By 2020, the airline will operate 70 aircraft, flying close to 70 destinations. We have launched new services to destinations such as Singapore, Goa, and Dhaka and have increased frequencies on many of our established routes. These and other moves enabled Oman Air to carry 6.3 million passengers in 2015, up from 5.1 million the previous year. We operated more than 28,000 round trips, served 7.5 million meals, and handled 10.4 million passengers at Muscat International Airport. As the national carrier and one of the country's largest employers, we continue to make an important investment in enhancing the skills, experience, and capacities of Oman's workforce. All of this activity has enabled us to meet one of our most important objectives: to make further progress toward profitability. Oman Air increased its revenues by 14.1% to OMR465.971 million in 2015. We also reduced our losses by 21.2% to OMR86 million. </p><h4>With the announcement of an Omani budget airline coming online for the first time in the country, what effects do you anticipate this new airline will cause on competition in the industry?</h4><p>Oman Air welcomes the expansion of Oman's aviation sector and competition from both Omani and overseas carriers. Our strong market position has been achieved over a period of time by delivering consistently high standards of service, excellent reliability, and on-time performance. As a result, we have a loyal and much-valued customer base. As more people are introduced to the pleasure and convenience of air travel, they will increasingly seek out quality and this will bring them to Oman Air. A robust Omani aviation sector will benefit Oman Air. We believe in maintaining a cordial relation with all its competitors, especially those who share our Omani heritage.</p><h4>Tourism is a priority sector for the country in the ninth Five-Year Plan. What are Oman Air's plans to keep pace with the country's strategy to increase the number of tourists each year?</h4><p>As the national carrier of our country, Oman Air is committed to promoting the Sultanate of Oman as a wonderful destination for tourists through our international network. Not only do we fly the flag of Oman across the world, but we also actively promote the destination of Oman, both independently and in partnership with other organizations. The expansion of Oman Air's airport activity is already supporting the growth of the tourism sector and the enhanced capacity of existing airports, together with the opening of new ones, means that international travelers can enjoy much-improved facilities. This also means that both domestic and international travelers can visit a broader range of locations and experience Oman's diversity with much greater ease. As Oman Air's expansion program continues, we will access more global markets, raise awareness of Oman's beauty, rich culture, and world-class hotels. That means that many millions more people will have the opportunity not only to consider Oman as their next destination, but also to experience Omani hospitality.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Oman Air over the next 12 months?</h4><p>Oman Air will continue following its 10-year plan to expand its fleet and to increase the size of its network. We are now well placed to meet or exceed our targets for 2016. We will unveil more new destinations and fine-tune our on-board products. Most importantly, however, we will work even harder to provide a sublime air travel experience for our existing customers and for those who have yet to discover Oman Air. Having just launched a second daily service to London Heathrow, we are working to launch a new service to Manchester in 2017. Later this year we will unveil new international destinations—including, I anticipate, one in China—which I am confident will delight our customers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>OAMC recently released its own five-year corporate strategy. What are some of the main pillars of this strategy?</h4><p>Our vision is to be among the top-20 airports in the world by 2020. To do this, we need to excellently manage and develop our airports as gateways to Oman and beyond, working closely with our people, partners, and communities. We have three focus areas. We will continue to manage our airports to deliver an exceptional experience. We will also grow our business and impact through developing our land assets and looking for business opportunities outside of our airports' boundaries.</p><h4>How will the advent of a second ground handler at the Muscat International Airport improve service and what are the benefits to creating competition in this field?</h4><p>Aligning with our vision, it is our pleasure to announce these strategic partnerships with our second ground handler. Two instead of one monopolized ground handling companies will bring a multitude of benefits to overall operations at Muscat International Airport. We anticipate that the competition will serve to enhance quality and reduce costs, factors that will not only benefit travelers, but also airline operators. In addition, the introduction of the second ground handler will translate into an additional 400-500 initial jobs that will be subject to legal Omanization requirements. For OAMC, it is important to be operating at maximum efficiency as we gear up for the launch of the new Muscat International Airport terminal. This will truly be a world-class gateway to the beauty and opportunity of Oman, and it is a key project within the government's economic development strategy. The airport will also position the Sultanate as a modern and attractive hub for travelers transiting through the region. With the increased quality and efficiency as a result of two ground handling operators, Muscat International Airport will surely be in good stead to become one of the world's leading airports as per OAMC's 2020 transformative strategy.</p><h4>What growth have you seen in passenger traffic over the past year in Oman's busiest airport in Muscat, as well as the country's young airport in Salalah?</h4><p>With such limited facilities at the current Muscat airport, OAMC has worked extensively to break records in terms of passenger growth YoY. In 2014, Muscat International Airport hosted a total of 8 million passengers. Building on that, 2015 saw an impressive 18% increase to end the year with 10,315,358 passengers. In 2016 we broke the previous records. There are many constraints because of the limited space in the current airport, but we are pushing to get the maximum number possible. Salalah Airport has developed the tourism sector immensely. It has boosted the tourism sector in the Dhofar region and has turned it from a seasonal spot to an all-year destination. With more airlines flying directly to Salalah, Salalah has become the top destination in Oman after Muscat.</p><h4>What are your expectations on Salam Air's first year of operations, being the country's first low-cost airline? </h4><p>Salam Air declared the beginning of a new era in local competition for our strategic and national transportation partner Oman Air, within the Sultanate's civil aviation sector. The inception of Salam Air, along with which has come large aspirations from the local community, serves to establish a new cornerstone in the government's plans to develop Oman's civil aviation sector. Salam Air will allow for further commercial competition, hinting toward the future that the civil aviation sector has been waiting for, and will serve to benefit Omanis and residents alike. In launching its commercial flights, Salam Air has taken great strides.</p><h4>OAMC is in a unique position to provide vital assistance in the country's priority sectors of logistics and tourism. How does OAMC position itself in line with the government's announced goals in these areas?</h4><p>Oman has begun the process of devising a national economic plan to grow its non-oil sector. Logistics, among tourism and manufacturing, has been identified as one of the key priorities to develop in order to diversify the source of revenue for the country. Oman Airports plays a vital role alongside the Ministry of Transport in developing this sector. We are working accordingly with the ministry to accomplish these targets and promoting Oman as a tourism destination as well as creating opportunities in the logistics sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Oman's ninth Five-Year Plan has made infrastructure and tourism significant priorities, and air travel is crucial to both of those ventures. What role will PACA play in the plan?</h4><p>The Sultanate of Oman has focused largely on diversifying the economy and sources of income away from oil revenues, and certainly tourism and logistics are two of the most important sectors the country counts on to achieve its diversification objectives. The aviation sector is one of the most significant players in the logistics sector and the development of this sector in the form required permits to accommodate large numbers of tourists to the country, with the integration of other tourist services, of course, as the aviation industry was given great attention by the government during the current Five-Year Development Plan complements the last five-year plan and what has been done of projects carried out for the development of the civil aviation sector. It goes without saying that the civil aviation sector is an important feeder for the national economy and adds a lot of value on other related sectors, especially during this period in which we are witnessing the finical difficulties. In order to capitalize on these major developments in the civil aviation sector, PACA will endeavor to market the new airports by means of negotiating more traffic rights and new airlines to attract more passengers and cargo to the Sultanate.</p><h4>The market for aircraft maintenance in the Gulf is increasingly significant. The same is true of cargo handling. How are these opportunities being capitalized on?</h4><p>We have recently embarked on an initiative of encouraging competition not only in airlines services, but also in airport services, especially ground handling services. A second license was awarded last year to Swissport in addition to allowing another license for a second strategic partnership between Oman Air and Menzies. The aim has been to improve the quality of ground handling services. As for aircraft maintenance, the government is investing a large amount of money in building a state-of-the-art maintenance, repair, and overhaul facility and we hope that RFPs are floated soon to interested investors in other airports.</p><h4>What impact will the new airport have on the Omani air travel market?</h4><p>There will be a significant and positive effect based on what was planned when the government embarked on its construction. The new airport will receive more than 20 million passengers per annum, a figure that was arrived at by examining the growth of the aviation sector around the world. According to statistics, Oman's airspace is one of the most congested in the Middle East, and there is an increase in air traffic and flights to and from Muscat airport in the coming period, in which the Sultanate is looking to open up wider fields of investment and the development of the logistics sector.</p><h4>What are your expectations and plans for the year ahead?</h4><p>PACA is currently focusing on the separation of service providers, namely air navigation and meteorology services. We will concentrate on our core business as a regulator and hence the authority will remain the only source for the legislator of the laws and regulations of aviation in the Sultanate. This in fact is considered as a huge step in the history of civil aviation in the country and will support the growth of the aviation sector. This year will also see the re-sectorization of the Omani airspace from five to seven sectors to cater for the growth of overflying traffic and to provide a better quality of air navigation services. It is also expected and indeed all the efforts are now exerted to operate the Muscat International Airport terminal before the end of 2017. We also hope that the Duqm airport project will be complete by the end of the year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for Colombian exports to the world outside Latin America and the US? </h4><p>We are starting to see that it is easy to export products to consumers in Asia and Europe, particularly France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. We export here and to the UK, so some of the new companies we work with are selling to over 60 countries across the world. It is complex being a new company that wants to sell its product in completely new markets. You might have high-quality marketing here in Colombia, but how do you sell to different countries such as Vietnam? What, for example, are the taxes? When you open a new area, you do not know if there is a free trade zone and who can purchase which products from where. That is what we are now working on with these new companies: training them and explaining how to do business around the world by using DHL. This opens up new opportunities for both Colombia and DHL.</p><h4>Is DHL currently focusing on attracting SMEs to Colombia or on larger corporate clients?</h4><p>We have both. DHL has 38 years' experience here in Colombia, and we have an operation of over 500 employees in the country with nine operating sites and more than 120 routes. We also have two international flights coming in and out with all the products. We have solutions for big companies, but more than 80% of our customers are SMEs. Our specific focus is on providing solutions for them. We not only work to attract these small companies but have made a study about the biggest concerns for SMEs by gathering data from ten developing countries to understand precisely how they work. Their biggest fear is working with other countries where they do not know the rules. Sometimes they send products which are then confiscated at customs because they did not send the specific documentation. This is where we are working a lot on training in order to facilitate business with other countries. Through this study, we also came to see that companies who find a way to succeed on a global scale also do better at home because they understand best practices and implement them locally to increase their success.</p><h4>What is DHL Express' investment strategy for expansion within the country?</h4><p>In the last five years, we have invested more than EUR10 million in infrastructure, something we always invest in. In the airport, we have an operation of gateways and increased the size and speed of the capacity of the packages we are moving. Apart from the gateway, we also invested in moving into warehousing from the free trade zone in 2016. To speed things up, we activated these warehouses as fiscal warehouses so that when things come in from the airport, they can be processed, packaged, and sent out from there the same day.  If you have the customer's correct documentation, it goes directly from the airport to the customer. For things that involve a longer process, we bring them to the fiscal warehouse and do all the paperwork before moving it to the customer. Apart from that, we also purchased three electric cars as part of a project called Go Green. Our group target is to decrease our Co2 emissions by 30% by 2020.</p><h4>How are you applying DHL's technological innovations to the local market?</h4><p>We have two major centers of innovation at DHL—one in Germany and another that recently opened in Asia. We love to work with customers and challenge them on what the logistics will be in the next 50 years. One of the things we focus on are megacities, which will be one of the toughest things to manage in the next half century since they will only grow more. There are already seven to 10 million inhabitants in Bogotá, and the communications needed for cities of this size and bigger will require huge amounts of resources. There are many apps being developed that now deliver to people's homes, which will certainly be a challenge. We are doing a lot of tests to take drones to remote, secure, and high-traffic areas to deliver packages. Since we have already developed the technology, we are now looking at the legislation of each country and around the world to help us find the best ways to deliver. Electric cars are another crucial new area, and in Germany we just started making deliveries to the trunk of people's cars. When delivering to the consumer one of the challenges is having the wrong address or the person not being home, not to mention that modern society means almost everyone is working and rarely at home. Thus, one of the technologies we are developing is where the customer allows us to deliver to the trunk of their car with one simple code. We can put in the code, open the trunk, deliver the package and close the trunk: this is what we're doing to make life easier for consumers in Europe. We are working a lot on developing these solutions with our customers.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2017?</h4><p>We want to keep investing here in Colombia. One of the things we are focusing on for 2017 is penetrating a wider geographical range in Colombia and to start seeing growth outside of Bogotá. We have considerable infrastructure in Cali, Medellí­n, and Bucaramanga but want to go to other specific locations and are looking for secondary cities to invest in because this is where future growth will be. The most important thing we are investing in here in Colombia is the social aspect, and here we already have three initiatives. One is Go Teach, where we work with local teenagers to help them decide what to study and train them for business interviews. This is but one example of how much we want to give back to Colombia in the same magnitude that it has given to us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the ministry's vision for the Oman Global Logistics Group, and what will be its main responsibilities?</h4><p>We have many companies working on logistics and transport, which are either 100% government-owned companies or partially government owned, and have established a holding company that has around 17 companies under it. We divided the holding company into certain categories such as ports and economic zones, some transport companies such as ferries, shipping companies, and some other support services. One major role of this group will be to look at the investments that the country needs in this sector, which will require examining KPIs to create profitable companies and elicit growth. We are expecting to see an improvement in our financial investments in these companies by integrating them and improving their financial status. </p><h4>How will the ministry's move to grant two licenses to manage and operate local taxis help to increase the development of public transportation in Oman?</h4><p>Taxis in Oman require a great deal of improvement, as they have not been regulated properly for many years. In 2016, we issued a new land transport law in the country. Using that law, we will start issuing regulations for taxis and impose certain rules and conditions for how drivers should operate. The next step is that we will create management companies to manage the taxi drivers. They still have their taxi license, but there will be a management company at the top that will regulate the systems such as meters, GPS, ordering service, credit card, and tracking systems based on certain fees. </p><h4>What are some of the new capabilities that will come to Oman as a result of the country's airport projects in terms of increasing the national tourism and logistics capabilities?</h4><p>Salalah Airport is now operational and we are expecting the airport construction in Muscat to finish at the end of 2016, with its full operation in 2017. In all of our airport projects, we are developing a complete airport in terms of cargo facilities, catering, and MRO. We are hoping that introducing modern facilities will grow our logistics business in Oman to be a hub for passengers, cargo, and possibly the maintenance of aircraft. We realize our infrastructure will require strong, state-of-the-art services in order to attract more airlines, and are floating tenders for international operators, such as introducing a second ground handler in the airport with Swiss Port. Oman Air itself is partnering with a company from the UK to improve its ground handling capabilities and along with a Singaporean company to develop its capabilities in cargo handling and operations. We are reforming Oman Air to have subsidiaries; right now, there is one company doing the flying, maintenance, cargo, and catering. We are seeking to have strong international partners in all of these areas to improve the quality of services provided in the new facilities.</p><h4>How will a well-developed logistics sector in Oman help carry the country into its next stage of development?</h4><p><span></span>The good thing about the logistics sector is that we have done a good job in setting up solid infrastructure over the past 40 years. We have three deep-sea ports and five good airports. We are trying to progress the railway project for the GCC, which will be a good addition to the country. In addition, other sectors that we want to develop for diversification, such as mining, depend on logistics. If we want to export our fisheries or agricultural products internationally, then we need good airports and warehouses to take the products worldwide. The same thing applies to industrial output and even tourism. Logistics is the enabler for all of these sectors and crucial to their success. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the most significant past or ongoing projects in your portfolio in Oman?</h4><p>We are and have been active in most of the major projects in Oman since the past 12 years. In Sohar, we regularly work with refineries, methanol plants, aluminum smelters, Port of Sohar, the port operator, and many more. We were the main sub-contractors to Japan Gas Corporation in the erstwhile Sohar Refinery Project (renamed Orpic). Of late, over 1,000 members of our workforce were engaged in the prestigious SRIP Extension Project at a single point of time. We were actively involved throughout Barka Power Plant Phase-I project. For Salalah Airport Project, we have supplied over 200,000 cubic meters of scaffolding material plus manpower. We are present in most of the main projects in Oman in one way or another with one or more of our services. </p><h4>As the company has strategic offices in Sohar, Salalah, and Duqm, do you see your business expanding as these economic zones also expand?</h4><p>As we have already established ourselves as a major player in the market at Muscat and Sohar, the development of Salalah and Duqm Economic Zones would offer us more opportunities to expand our business to these areas. We are already operational at Salalah and Duqm having set up offices over there and already cater to various projects like Salalah Airport Project, Port of Duqm, and Oman Dry-dock, for example. We position ourselves to be in a position to supply all the major requirements of various clients as and when development activities pick up. </p><h4>What is the level of competition in the construction industry of Oman, and how does Al Nahdha set itself apart from competitors?</h4><p>The level of competition in Oman is less compared to its neighboring countries in the Middle East. One of the main reasons is the strict implementation of Omanization work quota across all industries by the government. However, we consider this aspect as advantageous to us as we can save a lot of ancillary costs by inducting more nationals in our workforce. This is one of the reasons we have set up a training facility to develop the ICV of national workforce and we offer training to new recruits to develop various skills in them. Another of our main emphasis is on quality development, not quantity. Over these years, we have developed ourselves to achieve international standards and excellence in the services we provide. We were recently awarded an ISO certification in recognition of the level of standard achieved by us, which is considered to be a benchmark in terms of quality assurance, which is one of the major requirements in the competitive market. We have implemented new software to train our people and send them to various seminars and training programs to update and upgrade their performance levels in line with the market demands. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the next 12 months?</h4><p>Even while considering the fallout in oil prices across the globe and the resultant effects on the economic front, we do not see any substantial recession or cause for panic in Oman as more and more projects seem to be coming up with regularity. Hence, we do not anticipate any cause for any major worry at the moment. In the meantime, we have started looking into doing business in Iran as well in the wake of the UN sanctions on Iran being lifted recently resulting in a large backlog of developmental works being undertaken offering huge opportunities. Simultaneously, we will work towards consolidating our position and presence in the UAE, Qatar, and India. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How difficult is it to realize Symtech Solar's sustainable innovation mission here in Oman?</h4><p>From an outside perspective, I was quite surprised to see the lack of solar uptake in Oman considering the sun shines for 320 days of the year and Oman has one of the highest solar radiances in the world. It was important for my chairman and myself to diversify into a different business sector, but one that was analogous to what we already do, which is generate electricity. As government subsidies for petrol and diesel are being reduced, government subsidies for electricity are likely the next ones in line. Recognizing that solar was a massive, untapped opportunity and the likelihood of reductions in government subsidies for electricity being combined with reduced customized service costs in this sector, has created a perfect storm. The government has a great opportunity to encourage the uptake of rooftop solar, which is exactly what it is doing.</p><h4>What are the product lines and services that Symtech offers, and what industries or sectors are you looking at to introduce this technology?</h4><p>We are concentrating on three main areas; rooftop solar systems for domestic, industrial, and commercial use, solar street lighting, and solar powered water irrigation pumps. With regard to the rooftop solar sector, a survey was completed for the government two years ago that recognized that there was an opportunity for 1.44GW of electricity to be generated from domestic rooftops in Oman and one-third of that would be in Muscat. Muscat has low-rise buildings and flat rooftops that are ideal for the installation of rooftop solar systems. We are structuring so that our installation teams will arrive at a home with everything necessary in one box. Within 36-48 hours, the panels will be connected and households will be producing their own electricity. If there is a feed-in tariff from the government, they can feed in their excess electricity into the national grid and receive credit for it on their monthly electricity bill. The excess electricity fed into the grid then goes to power schools, hospitals, and their neighbors. After the sun goes down, the system automatically senses it and the system automatically switches over to the grid. In the industrial and commercial sectors, we are concentrating on hotels, tourism, food manufacturing, and infrastructure sectors.</p><h4>Is there a specific market, apart from Oman, that you are focusing on?</h4><p>For obvious reasons, we will focus on Yemen when the current hostilities cease. The war has resulted in widespread destruction of infrastructure, especially electricity infrastructure, and that will need to be improved. We believe this will offer an opportunity for Yemen to leap forward in technology, analogous to what happened in Africa with the uptake of mobile phones and we believe that Yemen will skip two or three generations and go straight to solar. The uptake of solar now in Sanaa and around Yemen is massive. When peace finally arrives, there will be an opportunity for Symtech Solar to assist in rapidly providing solar electricity to relieve the suffering of the people of Yemen.</p><h4>What needs to be done to unleash Oman's full potential in renewable energy?</h4><p>The Authority for Electricity Regulation will need to promulgate specifications to allow solar power to connect to the national grid system. Currently, we are not allowed to connect anything to the grid for electrical safety reasons. We are expecting the AER to issue specifications for equipment and standards for installation by early 2017. Until then, we will concentrate on solar street lighting, solar powered water irrigation pumps, and totally off-grid solar systems. Incentives from the government, often called a feed-in tariff, would certainly assist in the rapid uptake in rooftop solar to achieve the government's objectives of 10% of Oman's electricity derived from renewable sources by 2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>PDO has set an output goal of 600,000bpd. What progress has been made toward this goal, and will this remain a key strategy?</h4><p>Our target to achieve a long-term production plateau of 600,000bpd was for 2019, but we are on course to achieve this well before that date. In response to the low oil price environment, we have pursued a strategy of staying the course on our key projects, pursuing the early monetization of exploration prospects wherever possible, and expediting well hook-ups through lean processes by cutting bureaucracy and eradicating unnecessary and wasteful work practices. Key success factors have been our world-class well, reservoir, and facilities management. This is reflected in our ability to maintain the stability of our fields and facilities and manage both scheduled and unscheduled deferment. Our strategy is creating value for Oman and we intend to stick to it.</p><h4>What role will the 1GW solar-to-oil plant that is set to commence operations in the Amal oil field in 2017 play in PDO's operations? </h4><p>Work on the Miraah solar project, which we are developing with our partners GlassPoint Solar, is progressing ahead of schedule and below budget, with the first steam set for 2017. This project, one of the largest of its kind in the world, is essential to PDO's plans for sustainable production. It will provide a significant portion of the steam demand at Amal for thermal enhanced oil recovery in ultra-heavy and viscous reservoirs. It will target 250 million barrels and have considerable incremental scope across our concession area. The use of solar for oil extraction is a long-term strategic solution to develop PDO's viscous/heavy oil portfolio and reduce the consumption of valuable natural gas, which is normally used to produce steam for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Solar steam, when fully mature, can reduce gas-fired steam generation by up to 80%. This gas can be diverted for other important industrial, commercial, and residential needs, and help address the national and regional shortfall. It has the potential to make Oman a world center of excellence for solar EOR, providing job and training opportunities for Omanis.</p><h4>PDO plans to invest USD10 billion in hydrocarbon projects throughout the country. What are the most significant projects that are part of this investment plan?</h4><p>The mega Rabab Harweel integrated project (RHIP) is twice as big as the existing Harweel (2AB) scheme and will see miscible gas injected into each of the seven Harweel oil reservoirs. The RHIP includes the installation of sour gas processing facilities and export pipelines. It also includes a new power plant to generate 110MW and a waste heat recovery system for steam generation to meet the heat load of the facilities. Production from the Rabab Harweel EOR project is expected to begin in 2019. The complex paves the way to develop 240 million barrels of oil and 100 million barrels of condensate, with the export of 1 trillion cubic feet of non-associated sale gas. We are also making good progress on a second megaproject at Yibal Khuff. The first oil is projected for 1Q2020 and aimed at recovering approximately 70 million barrels and 39.4 billion cubic meters of gas.</p><h4>What are the implications of the MoU that PDO signed with the Nama Group regarding the power infrastructure of Oman? </h4><p>It will establish a framework for a more efficient and coordinated national electricity grid by integrating the existing networks. At present, there are four separate electricity supply networks: the Main Integrated System in the north, the Dhofar System in the south, the Duqm System in the east, and PDO's in central Oman. This agreement means the four will eventually be interconnected via a 400-kilovolt power transmission system, which will enable them to share power reserves, coordinate electricity generation and planning, and access areas with high renewable energy potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Orpic successfully deliver fuel to Oman and export products to its global customers while pursuing investment opportunities in the energy sector? </h4><p>Supplying fuel to Oman is not just a mandate but a responsibility bestowed to Orpic, as Orpic is the sole licensed refiner and petroleum product importer/exporter. Currently, approximately 70-75% of the refinery production is marketed in Oman. This provides a solid foundation to Orpic for further growth. Another important aspect of Orpic's business strategy is to add further value to the natural resources of Oman. Orpic not only adds value to the Oman export blend (OEB) crude oil by refining it to higher value petroleum products, but also uses condensate produced as a side product of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) production facilities at Sur. At the Sohar Refinery, Orpic processes methanol produced from the natural gas/methane resources of Oman and converts it to higher value etherified gasoline, a component used in gasoline blending. Furthermore, growth is an important ambition at Orpic. Aside from regular capital expenditure, there are flagship growth projects in the pipeline. First, Sohar Refinery Improvement Project (SRIP) implementation will overcome the constraints of the residue fluidized catalytic cracking (RFCC) unit at the existing Sohar Refinery and will produce an additional quantity—70% extra capacity—of products to meet the growing requirement for petroleum products in the country, as well as supplying additional volumes to the aromatics plant and polypropylene plant.</p><h4>What are Orpic's expectations in terms of increasing its contribution to the country's GDP, while manufacturing plastics that are highly rated in terms of global demand?</h4><p>Liwa Plastics Industries Complex (LPIC) is the biggest of the three strategic growth projects undertaken by Orpic to achieve its vision of building an Omani integrated refining and petrochemical business. Upon commissioning in 2020, Liwa Plastics Industries Complex will transform Orpic's product mix and business model, double company profit, create new business opportunities, generate significant employment opportunities, and support the development of a downstream plastics industry in Oman. With the highly integrated complex in Sohar including the refineries, aromatics plant, steam cracker, and downstream polypropylene and polyethylene plants, the operation will be one of the best integrated refinery and petrochemical facility combinations in the world and will be able to achieve the maximum value added for Oman's hydrocarbon molecule. Following LPIC's commissioning, plastics production is forecast to increase by more than 1 million tons, giving Orpic a total of 1.4 million tons of polyethylene and polypropylene production. The LPIC project will contribute roughly 2% to Oman's GDP upon commissioning.</p><h4>What is the scope of the first in-country value (ICV) roadshow organized by Orpic in Sohar? </h4><p>As part of its commitment to support the Sultanate's nationalization plan and offer opportunities to Omani SMEs, Orpic conducted its first ICV roadshow in Sohar. This event was conducted in association with CB&amp;I and CTCI Corporation, which have been awarded the engineering, procurement, and contracting (EPC) award for steam cracker and utilities for LPIC. Through this roadshow, Orpic intends to support SMEs directly via business operations and ring fence certain tenders specifically for Omani SMEs, which in turn will positively impact Oman's GDP.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Orpic over the next 12 months?</h4><p>We expect the market environment to be fluctuating and challenging in the next 12 months; however, our main focus is on the controllable elements of our business. We want to keep on progressing with our reliability improvement journey to ensure industry best practice asset utilization and the effective integration of existing and new assets as a result of the realization of the three flagship projects, all while recruiting, developing, and retaining talent and enhancing profitability and earnings through short term profitability improvement initiatives and long-term business development initiatives. It is clear 2017 will be an exciting year for Orpic, as the first of our three megaprojects will be operational, and we expect significant contribution from SRIP to the business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[On the Road to Success]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[on-the-road-to-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>OQIC has opened a branch in the Oman Avenues Mall. What is the advantage to this location and how does it fit with your overall growth strategy?</h4><p>Opening a branch at Avenues Mall in Muscat is an extension of our well thought out strategy, which we had implemented a few years ago by opening a kiosk at a mall in Doha, Qatar. Capitalizing on the success of our pilot project, we decided to open a branch at the Avenues Mall to gain visibility and traction. Depending upon the success of this branch, we may look at opening similar outlets at various malls. This also allowed us to refine our look and feel, which will be easy to replicate wherever we go. The location is also strategic because it allows us to be operational for longer hours than traditional branch timings to suit our customers' convenience.</p><h4>How has OQIC adapted to changes in modern technology to serve its increasing customer base?</h4><p>We strongly believe that customers today prefer to purchase and manage their insurance digitally. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of merit in having a brick-and-mortar approach, as many customers still prefer human interaction and would prefer to buy their financial products over the counter. To maximize on our reach, we have deployed cutting-edge technology to send instant quotes, SMS, and emails to inform customers about the latest promotions, and send auto reminders just before renewals. We have already ventured into various social media channels to engage our customers and ensure that we enrich their customer experience.</p><h4>In which area of activity does OQIC have the most clients?</h4><p>Approximately 50% of our premiums are generated through the sale of our retail products. To give an overview, we have over 70,000 retail customers, which equates to 7-8% of the total motor insurance market share in Oman. We have over 5% of the overall market share for all the products.</p><h4>How will OQIC change in response to the CMA's mandate to have insurance companies become publicly listed throughout 2017?</h4><p>Currently OQIC uses a lot of shared resources such as IT, finance, investments, and human resources, which allow us to be nimble as a company. With the implementation of the IPO, there would be increased transparency, corporate governance, and sufficient capitalization for some of the shared functions to be embedded locally within OQIC. The regulator CMA has mandated that 40% of the paid-up capital has to be allocated to the public offering. That is generally the standard percentage you would expect to see across the Gulf countries. Our plan for floating the IPO is well in progress.</p><h4>Do you think this ruling will help advance those insurance segments?</h4><p>It may assist in better insurance penetration, albeit the majority of the population has marginal availability of liquidity to buy these shares. Based on market trends, it can be safely concluded that this is a consumerist society and people would rather spend their money on tangible items.</p><h4>What are some of the other regulatory changes that have come in recently?</h4><p>A new law has been introduced for better regulation of insurance brokers. The law is expected to increase the operating costs of brokers so there may be possibilities for more mergers and acquisitions in the anvil. There are currently 40 brokerage firms and not all of them generate significant revenue for being sustainable.</p><h4>What steps can Oman take to improve safety for its citizens, especially on the roads?</h4><p>We recently performed a survey in Oman about the lack of use of indicators in cars. 66% drivers claim to indicate “almost every time," but credit only 13% of other motorists for the same. Around 38% find indicating is a sign of inexperience, don't indicate out of habit, or don't use indicators because it is not common in their home country. Around 93% state that indicating lane change increases road safety. If the road traffic regulators were to impose stricter driving standards and improve the driver's education system, there would be an improvement in road safety. Road safety is one of the important issues that we have rendered support to and seek greater cooperation from the Oman Insurance Association. While we have a fantastic road management in the capital, there is a lot of room for improvement for the interiors that still need to be developed and roads widened. To summarize, there has been a significant decrease in the reported number of deaths due to road accidents, which is a good sign.</p><h4>What is your outlook over the next 12 months for OQIC?</h4><p>We have a cautiously positive outlook. We are using technology and innovation and enhancing our products and services to highlight our “customer first" approach. We have worked on improving our partnership with affinities and intermediaries for gaining greater momentum in the marketplace. Being a subsidiary of the QIC Group-the leading insurance Group in the MENA, we share the same philosophy in terms of the quality of services we provide and the lines of products we underwrite.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[in-the-right-hands]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the role of PASI evolved since its inception 25 years ago?</h4><p>PASI is the only social insurance organization in Oman covering Omanis working in the private sector. The issuance of the social insurance law was part of the government's initiative to diversify the economy and encourage young Omanis to take jobs in the private sector. The role of PASI has been strong throughout the past years since the application of the Royal Decree No. (72/91) came in force in July 1992. This can easily be seen from the development of the number of workers covered (and their employers) as well as the development of benefits and reforms done to the social insurance system. In terms of the number of covered workers, the statistics show a big jump from as little as few thousands in the early years of the 1990s to more than 210,000 in 2016. On the benefits side, the level of benefits provided by PASI witnessed a remarkable improvement. That includes increasing the accrual factor in the formula for calculating pensions, and also, a minimum pension was introduced and then increased at least three times to reach a current level of OMR202,500. Other benefits were also improved in all branches of social insurance provided by PASI.</p><h4>What process does PASI's Investment Department follow to make the right investment decisions?</h4><p>PASI as a social insurance organization receives contributions from employers, employees, and the government on a monthly bases. This fund is invested in order to pay the pensions and other administrative expenses. PASI always pursues the best ways to practice its investment activities successfully and achieve the objective of investment safety and value. In 2007, PASI developed an Asset Allocation Model that takes into account the best of the risks, returns, and the obligations of the authority. This model among other initiatives of the authority won the International Social Security Association (ISSA) Best Practice Award for Asia and the Pacific. In addition, PASI seeks to adhere to the model in building a framework that issued by the Executive Regulation of Investment Authority and pension funds in the Sultanate of Oman taking into account the actuarial study outcomes. PASI seeks to give priority to national projects in its investment strategies. The authority tries to diversify its investment portfolio as much as possible both locally and internationally through international managers. Around 80% of the fund is invested in Oman and the remainder outside. </p><h4>What do you consider to be the most important change your company will implement in the medium term?</h4><p>In the coming few months, PASI's priorities will be to transform its services online to take advantage of its newly launched portal and extend the coverage to cover the unemployed and non-Omani workers. In addition to that, an active investment plan will be implemented in order to increase the fund income from investment by taking advantage of the government initiatives to diversify and economy. For 2016, a new Asset Allocation Model is being put in place to take into account the fund increase, which resulted from basing the contribution on the gross salary rather than the basic salary. A number of human resource development projects are planned for the next few months that will hopefully take the organization into the next level. The authority plans to move into the new headquarter by 4Q2016. The new headquarter is part of a huge multipurpose investment project in Oman with a budget of around OMR68 million. That development includes our new headquarters and commercial buildings, as well as six residential buildings. In regard to the social insurance projects, both the Insurance Scheme for Omanis Employed Abroad and the Insurance Scheme for GCC Extension Coverage are being updated, and a new unemployment scheme is expected to come out in 4Q2016. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What advantages does leasing an asset through OOLC offer to your SME customers?</h4><p>Oman is a developing economy and as such there is a need to support the SME sector. Due to our expertise, SMEs find it easy to transact with non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) as compared to the banks. The government of Oman has taken a number of initiatives to develop this segment and we feel that it offers a number of growth opportunities for all the NBFIs. The biggest advantage of dealing with OOLC is quick turnaround time, easy documentation, and a strong network of six branches in addition to the HO in Muscat.</p><h4>How do you work to remain a competitive alternative to banks as a NBFI?</h4><p>OOLC has developed its expertise in the SME segment and we provide comprehensive solutions for our customers. At the same time, our pricing is competitive and we have developed good relations with commercial and construction equipment dealers to source referral business. As mentioned, our other advantages include a strong branch network and swift response time.</p><h4>How does OOLC work to mitigate the risks involved in these investments?</h4><p>OOLC has laid down prudent credit policies and is involved in the financing of fixed moveable assets such as vehicles, construction equipment, and plant machinery. Post-dated checks are obtained for all the transactions and the know-your-customer (KYC) principle is followed to the letter.</p><h4>What are some trends in Oman that are driving business for OOLC?</h4><p>Due to the initiatives taken by the government the corporate sector has shown prominent growth over the last few years. There are ample opportunities for setting up manufacturing facilities in the industrial free zone areas. This provides opportunities for NBFIs to finance plants and machinery in this segment. The SME sector continues to prosper in Oman, providing opportunities for financing of commercial/construction assets and vehicles. Oman is a young population and there is a need for financing of vehicles to both locals and expats. The government is taking steps to develop the tourism industry and a number of initiatives to attract tourists have been taken. The development of various ports such as Sohar and Duqum provide financing potential to downstream companies. The bulk of our corporate business is comprised of financing to SMEs, which represents more than 60% of our portfolio.</p><h4>Can the renewed focus on growing the non-oil sector in Oman work to increase your business as more companies look to obtain new machinery or automobiles?</h4><p>The government continues to take steps to diversify the country's economy and develop the non-oil sector. Some of the sectors in focus include manufacturing, tourism, transportation, and logistics. This will not only generate employment for the youth in both the public and the private sectors but also encourage establishment of downstream companies. This in turn will invigorate the economy and provide financing opportunities to these segments. Requirements can include financing for plants and machinery, commercial or construction assets, vehicles, as well as consumer financing to individuals.</p><h4>What are your expectations for OOLC over the next 12 months?</h4><p>We expect to achieve our business targets and have put our strategy in line with local market conditions. We will continue to grow our portfolio both in the corporate as well as the retail segment. We are currently working on geographic expansion and expect the economy to continue to grow at a reasonable pace. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of interest has Al Madina's USD200 million healthcare complex project received from investors?</h4><p>We have received strong interest for participation at the equity level from institutions, high net-worth individuals, financial services, and family offices in Oman, the GCC region, as well as a global American healthcare firm. The large interest drawn is attributable to the professional planning undertaken in the pre-feasibility study, concept design, and architectural planning by Al Madina Investments. The project has also attracted considerable interest from local banks for participation in the debt level with attractive terms. The hospital is aimed to be the country's premier private medical facility providing multi-specialty services. Patients can receive the appropriate medical evaluation, diagnosis, advice, and treatment from top medical specialists with best-in-class facilities and excellent service quality. Currently, the public sector faces challenges in terms of long waiting lists and declining bed density ratio. In addition, the rising population and trends of life style diseases are expected to result in an increased demand for healthcare services in the future and pose an increased burden on public health services. We want to lift the quality standards for Omanis. We want to go to the first meeting of the shareholders with everything intact, as Al Madina has long been known for providing quality to its investors and the public.</p><h4>How can the regulatory authorities in Oman bring about changes to create a better investment environment for local and foreign investors?</h4><p>The laws have to change in the various government sectors and ministries. If someone were to come up with a real estate fund, for example, then real estate laws have to change, taxation has to change, and the capital market has to change. Sukuk law and takaful law recently came to Oman. There are many laws that have been changed. The government is aware, and it is looking at what is best and what is needed. We do not just want to open investment channels to anybody; we want to make sure that only serious investors come to Oman. We take our drive from His Majesty, who taught all Omanis that we have to be serious and add value to this land. Oman is a place where we have to add value, and that is our message to any potential investor. We need people that can add value to the country.</p><h4>How do you see PPPs playing a role in the diversification efforts of the country moving forward?</h4><p>As His Excellency Sunaidi remarked at the Oman Economic Forum, government companies are no longer getting the same level of support from the government; they have to work as companies and find their own way. The government will not make a major investment unless the private sector participates as well. The government will focus on infrastructure as normal, especially those projects in which the private sector can participate and add value, such as hospitals and schools. Our role as an investment company is to develop products and projects that allow other people to come in and participate through PPPs. We have companies in real estate, national mass housing, and hotels that are all participating in this regard. Everyone can play a role, and our role is to enhance the capital market here with projects and products and call other investors so that they can participate in the PPP. It is an interesting time coming up, and Oman still has a great deal of unrealized potential compared to other GCC countries.</p><h4>What are your targets and expectations for Al Madina Investments over the next 12 months?</h4><p>We have plans in the pipeline, but we still have our own challenges. We need to grow as a professional investment bank in Oman. We have been tagged as an Islamic investment bank and we are trying to come up with projects and ideas that can bring value to our shareholders and stakeholders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>From a capital market perspective, what was the impetus behind the mandate requiring all insurance companies in Oman to list publicly by 2017?</h4><p>First, we want to have big players and well-capitalized insurance companies. We want these companies to be able to underwrite certain risks and to keep these risks in Oman and depend less on reinsurance. We are trying to have stronger insurance entities and to encourage consolidation in the industry. Secondly, we want to see better corporate governance and transparency in the industry. In addition to market pressures, shareholder pressure can force companies to be more efficient, transparent, and reliable.</p><h4>The CMA recently ruled to restrict the amount of non-auditing services of audit firms. What does this move accomplish and how does it improve capital markets?</h4><p>External auditors play an important role for publicly listed companies of showing the shareholders and all stakeholders the financial position of the company at a certain period of time. We want auditors to focus on this work, rather than diversifying their attention into other businesses within a company. This also eliminates any potential conflicts of interest. We have not blocked all services, just those that conflict with them being the financial auditor of a company. This is the norm and we have conducted considerable due diligence. We are trying to introduce the best and globally recognized practices, and while auditors are prohibited from providing other services to one client, they are not prohibited from providing them to others, such as companies they are not auditing. It dove-tails with the new Corporate Governance Code, which was issued in 2015 and came into force in July. </p><h4>How can PPPs help create a more favorable capital market environment in Oman?</h4><p>For the past 45 years, the government has been doing a great deal. But, it has done its part, and now it is time for PPP arrangements. Outsourcing these activities would certainly help in the efforts to diversify the economy and bring in new sectors. It will also help the private sector and the economy grow, as well as the financial sector and the capital market. Oman began by implementing extensive PPPs in power generation, which appears to have been successful. For example, in the 1980s when the government was responsible for power generation and transmission, the cost of electricity was very high. With each PPP project, costs for consumers came down and are now a fraction. It is a successful model and this success in the power sector can definitely be replicated in other sectors.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the CMA for the next 12 months?</h4><p>Being the regulator of the capital markets and the insurance sector, our purpose is to ensure that these sectors are working within the laws and regulations, as well as functioning and properly integrated with the international economy and to ensure appropriate rules and regulations are helping, encouraging, and stimulating the sectors. In the next 12 months, we will work toward achieving these goals, reviewing and updating the regulations, and trying to help the market participants in these two sectors develop new ideas. In addition, we have started working on insurance for the agricultural sector, which is outlined in the five-year plan. We are designing new regulations that will facilitate the growth of investment in agriculture, including farming and fisheries, by using insurance as a means for its propagation and development. Another project we have already started working on is revamping the role of securities and derivatives. Health insurance is another area that we work to develop, because it is an area that is growing around 30% annually. My advice to investors is for them to come to Oman. We have promising free zones, especially in heavy industry, chemical industry, and logistics. There are opportunities available in Duqm, Sohar, and other areas. The government is already undertaking huge investments in state-of-the-art infrastructure and it is time for investors to come and benefit. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a state investment firm, TANMIA has been working to promote the mining sector. What form have your efforts taken?</h4><p>We are working on Mining Development Oman Company (MDO), which is currently under formation and of which 60% is owned by four government entities: the State General Reserve Fund (SGRF), Oman Investment Fund (OIF), Oman Oil Company (OOC), and TANMIA. The remaining 40% will be offered for public subscription via an IPO proposed to be floated on the MSM in 2017. MDO envisions a major role for itself in attracting international investment and technical know-how in the monetization of the Sultanate's prodigious mineral resources to ultimately help to drive the employment generation, economic development, and GDP growth. In the mining sector, TANMIA also has a floated company with Jindal Shadeed for quarrying limestone and manufacturing limestone products. Currently, we are working with the authorities to obtain dedicated limestone quarries for the project.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for TANMIA in the next year?</h4><p>TANMIA has been successfully partnering with new ventures, assisting businesses by ensuring availability of resources and providing experience and skills, as well as capital to various ventures. In line with this vision, TANMIA board decided to increase the capital to USD650 million, and of which USD285 million has already been capitalized. Our plan for next year is to focus and identify new opportunities and newer investment areas. Currently, we are reviewing various opportunities within diverse sectors that would further strengthen economic goals of the country. We are extremely selective in the opportunities and are being careful about due diligence, while at the same time being more opportunistic than aggressive. Further capital infusion would be dictated by the annual business plan and the strategic vision being rolled out by the company in consultation with the shareholders and the Board of Directors.</p><h4>Will the Tanfeedh program change the way business is done in the country?</h4><p>Definitely, we expecting a great deal from Tanfeedh. This National Program for Enhancing Economic Diversification has set objectives to expedite the process to diversify Oman's GDP away from oil while creating sustainable jobs for Omanis with a focus on manufacturing, tourism, logistics as well as the two enablers, namely, finance and human capital development. Labs are regularly held for discussions to streamline the necessary changes and how to improve regulations, making them friendlier and less restrictive. All the involved parties are working with determination to succeed and with such partnership we all expect Tanfeedh to be a success. The government is focused on establishing the right climate for a public-private partnership (PPP) framework so as to solve the funding challenges and attract much-needed investment to deliver the prioritized projects. Such determination with absolute transparency and firmness is important to move ahead.</p><h4>As Chairman of A'Saffa Food Oman, can you explain how the USD117 million investment to expand poultry production at A'saffa fits into the larger growth pattern of the company?</h4><p>A'saffa grew as a farm and has reached a capacity of about 25 million chickens per annum. It has progressively invested and diversified in food processes whereby it now produces quality snacks and other foods. A'saffa also established a logistic company to serve its business due to the distribution challenges it faced and the lack of quality storage required for food industry. It now has storage and distribution centers of its own around the region, which help its business grow and capture a wider market. Coming to expansion plans of A'saffa, the board decided to double the current size of production in the coming three years under two phases. There is also a plan to invest with other investors in similar or related areas of business that would expand the product offerings from A'Saffa. We are proud to add that A'saffa is unique because we use hormone-free feed and halal practices across the company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The banking sector in Oman has achieved consistent and even robust growth. What are the main factors that have contributed to this growth?</h4><p>The CBO plays a crucial role in maintaining financial stability, pursuing appropriate monetary policies, developing and strengthening financial institutions and markets, and supervising and regulating the banking sector. Despite the recent challenges faced by the hydrocarbons sector with the drop in crude oil prices, the banking sector in Oman continued its positive growth during 2015 and the trend has been maintained during the early months of 2016. The financial profile of banks in terms of asset quality, provision coverage, capital adequacy, and profitability has remained strong. The combined balance sheet of conventional and Islamic banks show that the total outstanding credit extended stood at OMR21 billion at the end of March 2016, a rise of 12.6% compared to the level witnessed a year ago. Total deposits also registered a growth of 6.5% to OMR19.9 billion at the end of March 2016. The BIS capital adequacy ratio averaged 16.1% at the end of 2015, which is significantly higher than the 15.4% recorded in the previous year. A well-calibrated and progressive approach to banking sector reforms has led to the emergence of a strong and resilient banking system over the years. </p><h4>To what extent does the CBO work with the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) for Islamic banking in Oman?</h4><p>An important milestone in the banking sector in Oman was the introduction of Islamic banking in December 2012. Within a short span, two fully fledged Islamic banks were established, and six local banks have opened dedicated windows for practicing and offering Islamic banking products. All these institutions have established their own sharia supervisory boards to guide them in sharia-related matters. Islamic banking entities provided financing to the extent of OMR1.93 billion as at the end of March 2016, compared to OMR1.2 billion a year ago. Total deposits held with them also registered a significant increase to OMR1.68 billion in March 2016 from OMR0.7 billion outstanding as at the end of March 2015. The total assets of Islamic banks and windows combined amounted to OMR2.5 billion as at the end of March 2016, which constituted about 8% of the banking system's consolidated assets. CBO interacts with the IFSB, an international standard setting organization for the Islamic banking industry. The Islamic Banking Regulatory Framework issued by CBO has adopted guidelines issued by IFSB. It is widely acknowledged that the standards and guiding principles of IFSB enhance the soundness and stability of the Islamic financial services industry. CBO receives updates on market developments of regulatory and supervisory relevance and participates in research as well as round tables, seminars, and conferences organized for regulators and industry stakeholders. They are particularly relevant as the market share of Islamic banking increases in Oman and we will be concerned with financial stability as a whole.</p><h4>What effects or benefits will the passage of the foreign capital investment law have for Oman?</h4><p>In recent years, with a favorable investment climate, Oman has emerged as an attractive destination for FDI due to its free market system, stable macroeconomic environment, and political stability. The policy is to encourage foreign capital that will enhance the overall development of the country. The government is in the process of finalizing the proposed new foreign capital investment law to attract further foreign investment. The key features of the new law will address the major concerns and shortcomings in the current law by removing restrictive provisions, providing greater clarity, and enhancing investment security for investors. Additionally, foreign investors' rights and obligations will also be clearly defined. The proposed investment law provides for dispute resolution and includes international arbitration. Banks in Oman will also benefit from the new foreign capital investment law because transactions will be routed through them and greater financial intermediation will take place for the benefit of the economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your target market within logistics and how do you plan to increase your activity in this sector?</h4><p>There has been a demographic shift in terms of logistics in Oman over the last two or three years. The new Sohar port being 250km away means that the old logistics cycle has shifted. For Oman, this is a major shift and we have been through the process of moving into Sohar and making it the center of our logistics business. Apart from the geographic move, the port has also introduced the new Bayan system, which is the government's online portal for clearing cargo and customs. It wants to incorporate various other things into the portal, including health and agro inspections. The shift has challenged us, but this is something that we had to adapt to and introduce our own IT system to interface with the system, train people, impart knowledge, and then transfer it into application. We need to make sure we are moving in line with the government in terms of upgrading our systems and that we are geographically present in Sohar to ensure that our clients get the service they require at all times and that we have enough choices of transport available for our clients to choose from in an efficient manner to move the cargo.</p><h4>What role does your lifestyle and special products business play in your overall growth strategy?</h4><p>If we want to attract foreign investment, then we need to make sure the country gives out as much to the market as an individual wants. When foreigners come, they not only want to see good hotels and restaurants, they also want good cafés, lounges, and bars to spend the evening in. What happens outside of those eight hours of work is as important as what is available during that time. A country may have good customs clearance and police mechanisms, but it also needs activities outside of working hours. We are also de-segmenting our megastore concept into small independent boutiques. The size of the megastore is decreasing but the number of outlets available to people is increasing. Lifestyle is as much of a contributor to the economy as the actual efficiency in government mechanisms.</p><h4>As one of the biggest conglomerates in Oman, do you seek to expand outside Oman in the future?</h4><p>We are careful with what we do. Dubai is an established, developed world as far as trade is concerned. Everything that we do over here is already in Dubai, and more. This leaves us with other choices such as Iran and India. Iran needs to stabilize and, until the banking regulations are fit to operate, it is difficult for a trader to go there and start operating. It is a matter of time, and Iran is an opportunity that is there for the taking. India is definitely an opportunity, but it is massive. We are wary about that and understand that India has complex trade practices. We have taken one initial step in India and focused on one small state, focusing on trade and distribution with Procter and Gamble, our most trusted and largest trading partner. We have done that and seem to be doing well, but we will slowly tread the waters.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Khimji Ramdas over the next 12 months?</h4><p>We will definitely keep our ears solidly to the ground on what the government intends to do. At this moment, government spending is being curtailed because of revenue restrictions, and we will make sure that we have our systems, which are geared to this decreased government spending and look at other avenues of growth, whether that is through organic expansion or through different services we want to go into. We could go into 4PL logistics or grow our existing business strengths and grow into different geographies. Organic growth is something we will try. We will continue to remain optimistically conservative. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[time-for-tanfeedh]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main initiatives under the implementation of Tanfeedh program across the manufacturing, tourism, and logistics sectors?</h4><p>The Tanfeedh initiatives are a mixture of capital projects, policy initiatives, and procedural reforms that are tied directly to GDP growth and increasing investment and jobs. Some of them are existing private-sector projects that need support, others are government ideas that need private sector engagement, and many are completely new initiatives that emerged through discussion between the stakeholders—especially in policy changes that can enable investment and growth. What all the initiatives have in common is that they are plans behind which public and private sector can unite in implementation.</p><h4>In a context of low oil prices and with Oman's government borrowing USD10 billion to tackle budget deficit, how is the Sultanate going to finance the implementation of the program?</h4><p>It is no secret that the government's capital investment plans are confined by the sharp drop in revenues with the oil price. One of the main goals of Tanfeedh is to increase the proportion of capital investment that comes from private investors. The government's infrastructure and development spending has driven the economy for a long time, but that is not sustainable. The government needs to regulate, facilitate, and promote private investment as a tool for growth. The capital projects which are in Tanfeedh initiatives are intended to have over 80% private funding on average, and the encouraging thing is that it was clear during the labs that the private sector are really enthusiastic about making the investment</p><h4>What impact do you expect Tanfeedh will have in the involvement of the private sector within the nation's key projects and what opportunities will be opened up to stimulate the development of the Omani private business?</h4><p>The private sector needs to be the leading investor in the future of Oman. It will drive economic growth and will reap the rewards. It is important to remember that from the beginning the private sector has been involved in Tanfeedh as an equal partner. We acknowledge that stimulating development requires some fundamental changes in the way we work with the business community. Many of the initiatives and ideas that came out of the labs were about attacking bureaucracy and streamlining processes to make the government serves business better. Because of that, the Delivery Unit has established a dedicated group to look at all the issues surrounding the business environment.</p><h4>What are your expectations on Tanfeedh's appeal to foreign investors and multinationals considering entering the market?</h4><p>One of the most important things about Tanfeedh is that we are doing it all Oman's stakeholders. It sends an important message of openness and responsibility to the international business community. Let's not forget that many multinationals are already here in Oman and understand and value the opportunities that we can offer: our strategic location, natural resources, accessibility, and living environment are attractive assets. They understand the challenges we face and need to see how we are dealing with them, and their experience is the best advertisement to other investors. A lot of multinational investors participated in our labs, as well as in separate syndication sessions.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for the future of the Sultanate if Tanfeedh is successfully implemented?</h4><p>It is not a binary question of whether Tanfeedh is implemented or not; it is a matter of how much and how well. Its implementation has already begun. Our Malaysian partners, on whose experience Tanfeedh is based, have a “30/30/40" expectation that they have advised us to expect. Over several rounds of their own “Big Fast Results" system, their experience suggests that on average 30% of initiatives are implemented as suggested, another 30% with some amendments, and 40% to be new ideas and projects to meet the same targets. If we only aimed to do things that were easy, we would have failed before we started. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[stat-of-life]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What types of statistics are more sought after or requested by businesses here in Oman?</h4><p>We divide the statistics into three parts. There are social or population statistics, economic statistics, and environmental statistics. The interesting ones for people in general are the social and demographic stats. For the private sector, the more attractive information is about the economic statistics: GDP, foreign trade information, tourism information, and data mining. This is also interesting to the policymakers. For the public, the more interesting statistics are about the population, such as nationality, age, distribution, and others, such as labor. According to our portal and website, we are trying to track where people have more access to the data, which data is sought after more, in addition to asking for people's feedback on our publications. We will provide more in-depth information where there is more demand.</p><h4>What new technical innovations is NCSI implementing to make the access to information a transparent and easy process?</h4><p>We started to focus more on how to use administrative data in the statistics. We believe there is a huge amount of information being used daily, not as statistics, but as a service that can be transferred into statistical information. We tried to give this a great deal of attention, and one of our projects for 2020 is to move from a traditional way of collecting data in the census to a smart census. We will use the administration and try to link these together. We believe the technology can improve our work and we have started to talk to our stakeholders and partners.</p><h4>How can Oman move toward the development of smart, sustainable cities with the interaction between data centers, the population, and businesses?</h4><p>There is a must to move to big data. The good news is that Oman is leading a UN task team for mobile big data with Eurostat. We are starting with how we can use data from mobiles to enhance the knowledge of people and businesses. We are trying to focus it on three areas. One is for tourism, and we can get information about who came to Oman, where they are going, and interesting areas for them to visit. We can also see where Omanis are going. For city planning, they can find out where more crowds are, where we should build more roads, and where services need to be provided. For example, for emergency services, it is important to know how many people are in an area. We can use the mobile information to get all this data, which will help business people. The other area is like a census. Through mobile data, we can know how many people are living in an area without having to go and count them. This is a project in which we are leading worldwide. Most countries are now moving to big data. Technology is an opportunity to improve our work and provide knowledge.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the next 12 months?</h4><p>There are many visions we would like to implement. This includes an addressing system for Oman and a smart census, and we have already started using technology as dashboards. People realize the importance of information. Our information will help clients make decisions and one of our paths is to give the media this information so that twice weekly they are coming with news about it. We do not need to communicate the news ourselves, as everyone has it. I have noticed there has been a great change in the culture of Oman, as people now refuse to make decisions without evidence and seek numbers. Nationally and internationally, people trust what we publish. We invest a great deal in statistics, and we want to be sure that every department and area uses this knowledge in their plans and in their lives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[growth-from-within]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Riyada use its position to forge partnerships with some of the biggest companies in Oman to offer support for their SMEs?</h4><p>Riyada has been successful because we work closely with the private sector. We have great relationships with major companies. They are keen to support us in Oman and we highly value these partnerships. Within this framework, we cooperate with public- and private-sector entities that correspond to the services that are set in our mandate. Within our mandate, we are responsible for the registration and database of SMEs, facilitating incubation for SMEs, training and mentoring, marketing and events, media and public relations, and support and development. For each of these services, we sign MoUs with corresponding public- and private-sector entities that offer services in that field as well.</p><h4>How does Riyada work to facilitate SME development in hotbed investment areas such as Duqm or Sohar?</h4><p>We are starting to work a great deal with Duqm. There was a major investment opportunities forum in Duqm to link investors to SMEs and to start business relations between the small and big businesses operating there. There have been extensive discussions, and there are huge opportunities for SMEs in Duqm. Since 2013, there has been a government mandate for all government projects to award not less than 10% of their tenders to SMEs. There is close coordination with the Tender Board for this initiative. This is all within the framework to improve the economic ecosystem for SME development. Additionally, we work with the relevant authorities to ensure that governmental units and government-owned companies comply and have an incentive to work toward implementing this process. We also work with free and special economic zones. We started with Duqm, where we are in collaboration with Duqm Special Economic Zone Authority of Duqm (SEZAD) and the National Youth Commission.</p><h4>What opportunities does Riyada offer to foster growth and further opportunities for local SMEs on the international level? </h4><p>Having local SMEs participating in various trade fairs and exhibitions is a big opportunity for growth. We have been promoting SMEs to market their products internally and outside of Oman for the past three years. Another way to foster growth is by sending SMEs to international exhibitions that take place outside of Oman, like in Dubai and Saudi Arabia, for example. This helps to build links between SMEs, big companies, and their customers.</p><h4>As the country looks to diversify its revenue away from oil and gas, can SMEs play a larger role in this effort moving forward?</h4><p>SMEs are definitely a part of achieving this goal, and they are one of the pillars to achieving new growth in Oman. Part of our vision is to make sure that we provide job opportunities for SMEs and increase the contributions of SMEs toward the national economy. For example, we have around 1,000 people a year benefiting from our training services. We have an annual award in which we recognize Omani entrepreneurs who are role models in the area of SME development. These awardees help us promote SMEs as contributors to the economy and sources of job creation. We also have 24 incubated businesses here with us in Riyada. Since we were established in 2013, we have seen over 7,000 Omanis officially registered as business owners. This is important because this number was in the hundreds when we started. Overall, we have registered around 20,000 SMEs in our database.</p><h4>What are some of your targets at Riyada over the next 12 months?</h4><p>Our target is to continue facilitating four types of access to SMEs: access to innovative ideas, resources, growth, and markets. This not only contributes to their economic growth, but also to the overall balanced progress of the nation. We hope to see more Omanis setting up SMEs or working for SMEs. Lastly, we expect SMEs to continue playing a big role in the economic diversification efforts of Oman. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the impact of the Partnership for Development (Offset) program on the current level of cooperation between multinationals and Omani companies?</h4><p>PFD began in Oman in early 2000 as an offset program with the Ministry of Defence (MOD). After eight years, the program moved to the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry and remained there until February 2014 when the Royal Decree no. 9/2014 was issued to form an independent public authority, tasked with the management and oversight of the PFD Offset program. The program no longer only applies to defence procurements but to all procurements by the defence and security apparatus as well as to civil infrastructure procurements by government Ministries and companies where the government holds more than a 50% stake. During 2016, OAPFD signed 10 PFD agreements with leading international defence and security companies and two civil agreements. Today, the authority has more than 15 PFD projects at various stages of development that vary from setting up joint ventures in the aviation industry; research centres to human resource development projects; and new projects in defence and security sector.</p><h4>How would you define OAPFD's role in supporting the diversification of the Omani economy by channelling foreign investment?</h4><p>The authority's mandate is to contribute to the economic diversification of the country that includes three specific missions; developing of Oman's security and defence capabilities, building of human capital and strengthening of the private sector. The PFD Program is an important governmental tool that we should benefit from in order to reduce dependency on oil as a primary income source for the country and to reduce Forex externalization in the future. The program will support local resources and Oman industry through the relationships formed with the foreign companies under the program. To this end, foreign companies that contract with the Oman government, or with a company in which the Oman government holds more than 50% of the shares, must invest part of the value of that contract back into the country either through ICV (Direct PFD) or indirect PFD strategic national projects. Within the country, it is the authority's core business to work with multinationals to identify both direct and indirect PFD projects that are to be carried out in Oman. </p><h4>What is the significance of the Tanfeedh program and how important is cooperation between the public and the private sectors if the vision is to be achieved?</h4><p>Tanfeedh is a national program that has as its aim the execution of a National Program for Enhancing Economic Diversification in the context of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (2016-20). The program model is based on the Malaysian experience and would involve all stakeholders, private and public, across the key sectors to identify the key projects, KPIs, and actions needed to achieve our five-year plan. This is an excellent model of the public private partnerships we encourage and want to see more of. We at the authority will strive to channel our PFD projects to support the outcomes of Tanfeedh and fully believe in the PPP model.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2017?</h4><p>OAPFD will continue to focus on achieving its ultimate objectives of contributing, through the PFD Program, in diversifying the national economy through three key objectives which are enhancing defence and security capabilities, human resources development and facilitating knowledge transfer, and strengthening the private sector. The overall strategy in implementing PFD in 2017 is to achieve PFD results, which will require a good balance between creating an awareness of PFD and also educating all 39 Omani Units that have to apply PFD, all international contractors as well as the wider audience, of beneficiaries of PFD. Also establishing appropriate systems for coordinating with all the procuring agencies and thereby ensuring the implementation of PFD whilst at the same time increasing the database of commitments to be discharged and translating PFD commitments into productive and sustainable projects within the mandate and objectives of the authority. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does MoM work to support both companies and workers?</h4><p>MoM offers a wide range of services, including proposing and implementing the general manpower policy in line with Oman's economic and social objectives concerned with preparing the drafts of laws and systems relating to the regulation of the labor market and the vocational training sector, the issuance of implementing decisions and regulations, protecting the national workforce, working toward developing skills and capabilities, and building an integrated system for labor market information. It is also concerned with applying, following up, and monitoring the implementation of labor law and regulations. It works hard to implement the Royal Directives to employ the national labor force in private establishments. The ministry has an initiative to adopt any method that enhances its role to link national job seekers with employment opportunities available in the private sector. The ministry works in coordination with the Public Authority for the Manpower Register to streamline the procedures and develop work at the directorates of labor in the various governorates and regions and to avail required technical support to mainstream computer use by all directorates. The “job opportunities bank" was established to provide information on job opportunities at private establishments. The ministry has also provided technical and administrative support to enable companies and establishments to meet candidates for employment or training before signing contracts. It has dozens of e-services for establishments, employers, and job seekers to ensure direct communication. The ministry also works in coordination with Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OCCI) and the private sector to develop the work of Omanization sector committees.</p><h4>How does MoM efficiently work with the technological and vocational education sector to fulfill labor market requirements?</h4><p>The ministry works toward implementing government policies and programs meant to develop vocational education in the Sultanate, with the aim of preparing general diploma holders. The ministry continues the implementation of “employment-linked training" programs, which provide job seeker trainees with guaranteed employment opportunities after receiving applied training at privately accredited training institutions, and take up vacant posts at private-sector establishments. Employment-linked training is considered one of most important programs based on scientific planning and coordination between the MoM and the private sector. The continuation of such programs will provide job seekers with more opportunities to achieve the full employment of the national labor force.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the ministry over the next 12 months?</h4><p>Guided by Royal Directives and scientific planning, the ministry continues its active contribution to ensuring the sustainable growth of the national economy. It also recognizes challenges in the labor market in the Sultanate and works to overcome them through a daily follow-up method and scientific planning thanks to its belief that the labor market must be balanced realistically and that its challenges can be encountered positively. The labor market is an inseparable part of macroeconomics and the challenges facing the national economy affect the labor market. Finding employment opportunities for national job seekers and the stability of nationals in their jobs is one of the priorities of the ministry. Much has been achieved in this area, as the number of nationals employed in the private sector exceeded 240,000 men and women by the end of 2016. Among the challenges is that Omani citizens prefer to work in public institutions, which increases the number of job seekers. The ministry works to implement awareness campaigns to encourage citizens to set up their own businesses, and to highlight the advantages of working in private establishments. Despite the implementation of the Omanization programs and plans, private sector projects employed more than 1.8 million expatriate workers by the end of 2016, which poses another challenge. The Omanization percentage in private productive and service establishments has not exceeded 25% in spite of the ministry's efforts. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision for annual economic growth during the next five-year plan and how were the target sectors of this plan identified?</h4><p>We aim to maintain a 2.5-3.5% GDP growth rate across the different sectors. However, the diminishing returns from the oil sector will definitely have an impact, and that has to be offset by two things: producing more oil and more gas so we can generate more revenue, and by having other, non-oil sectors grow. In this five-year plan, we have concentrated on five non-oil sectors: manufacturing and industry, minerals, tourism, logistics, and fisheries. For example, with manufacturing, we are expanding our industrial zones. We are expanding Samail, Sohar, Nizwa, and Sur, and we are servicing more land. There are tenders to expand Samail and Sohar already, and we are also expanding a new industrial zone. In the minerals sector, most of the work is focused on changing the law.</p><h4>What role would you like to see public-private partnerships play in enhancing private-sector development in Oman?</h4><p>Outside of the five sectors mentioned, there will be PPPs or BOOT projects in a few sectors, especially the health sector. We will start to see projects that are designed, financed, and built by companies either on long-term lease terms to the government or through a process of transferring to the government over time. We are also working on refining the law pertaining to sewage, and there will be privately-owned sewage plants just like privately-owned power plants, but the networks will still be government owned. We have already started testing this transfer through Bee'ah, which is a state-owned company that has agreements with private companies and is transferring the work of waste collection to privately-owned companies. This is regulated by a new law that will allow for a larger private sector role and competition in the waste management sector. </p><h4>What drivers were behind the more than 10% increase in FDI inflows, and how does Oman assert itself in the international arena as a destination for foreign investment?</h4><p>We have been generally hesitant about borrowing and, over the years, we have not gone out aggressively looking to borrow or for direct investment. Now we have more of a need to excite foreign investors and encourage lending. Foreign capital comes outside of borrowing too. The Gulf is seeing a good FDO inflow in real estate from Europe, while, from India, we are seeing construction and mechanical engineering. The Chinese have tapped into a new market totally, which are in clusters like Duqm. In addition, since 1970, the government was the only entity that did industrial parks. In 2016, we saw a local Omani company take a 250sqm piece of land and create an industrial zone, which was the Sindan project in South Batinah, and then after that there was a big USD10 billion investment by the Chinese in Duqm for an industrial park. </p><h4>To what extent is Oman looking into expanding its footprint abroad?</h4><p>In 2016, we have so far been in Africa three times in different capacities. We participated in a meeting in Kenya, then we took about 200 people from around 100 businesses to Ethiopia. Now we are exporting many commodities like packed food and oils and we are also sending petrochemicals to Ethiopia. We then went to Tanzania with a delegation of about 80 businesspeople. We feel Africa will grow tremendously and we feel that we could be a major supplier of petrochemicals and packed food to them. We could also supply fiber optics, cables, and specialized building materials, as well as soft services like IT and advertisement, including website design, development, and content management. As Oman Air opens up new destinations both in Africa and Iran, we will see more direct interaction. There have been numerous trade missions in 2016. They are not just to expand our exports, but to directly deal with the people of those countries so we can import, export, and re-export to them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do you see the biggest potential for deepening investment and trade ties between Sri Lanka and Oman?</h4><p>Sri Lanka has had a negative trade balance over the period from 2011 to 2015, with a negative average growth of 4.25%. However, imports from Oman show an average positive growth of 1.85% during the same period. More than 90% out of the total imports to Sri Lanka from Oman consist of mineral fuels and oils. Sri Lanka's main export products to Oman in 2015 were panels, consoles, desks, cabinets, and other bases for electronic goods or the distribution of electricity. Other items included desiccated coconuts, MDF boards, rubberized coir pads, coconut milk power, fruits, vegetables, and tea. The main imported products from Oman were petroleum oils, mineral fuels, polymers, propylene, aluminum products, frozen fish, iron, and steel. Notably, the top-20 export product sectors of Sri Lanka are not performing well in the Omani market. Most of these products are exported either in small values or not exported to Oman at all. Therefore, it is vital at this juncture to look into the possibilities of utilizing the Omani market for Sri Lankan products. In terms of investment, the potential sectors for FDI for Sri Lanka include tourism and leisure, agriculture, export manufacturing, export services, apparels, knowledge, utilities, and education. At present, there are four projects in commercial operation in Sri Lanka in collaboration with Oman, totaling an investment of USD1.5 million. In addition, three projects are in the pipeline and promise an investment of USD0.5 million.The current target sectors to attract projects from Oman are in agriculture and fisheries, infrastructure, real estate development, tourism and leisure.</p><h4>What are the prospects for the two countries to collaborate in promoting growth in the maritime sector of the Indian Ocean?</h4><p>Sri Lanka's location at the heart of the Indian Ocean straddling western and Eastern Asia has made us beneficiaries of interregional trade for centuries. The strategic importance of Sri Lanka as a regional hub in the realm of global commercial activity is widely acknowledged. The Indian Ocean is a vast source of maritime economic resources as well as a maritime trading corridor, through which nearly two thirds of the world's oil is transported. Thus, the protection of the Indian Ocean is crucial for the food and national security of many nations. We are aware that under the visionary leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qaboon Bin Said Al Said the government of Oman is committed to promoting the maritime sector through its economic diversification plan. As members of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), both Sri Lanka and Oman are working closely in the areas of maritime safety, security, and fisheries management. Most recently, we welcomed the arrival of the Royal Omani Navy ship Khassab on a goodwill visit at the Colombo Port in July 2016. The participation of Omani defense officials in the annual defense seminar organized by the Ministry of Defense and the Galle Dialogue organized by the Sri Lanka Navy is another example. We look forward to further strengthening our cooperation with the Omani authorities to ensure a safe sea routes in the region and countering issues such as human smuggling, piracy, and drug trafficking.</p><h4>What is your outlook for future cooperation efforts between Oman and Sri Lanka?</h4><p>The present government of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, which came into power in 2015, is committed to creating a more business-friendly environment by ensuring good governance in all spheres. International responses to our initiatives have been very encouraging. I understand many Omani businessmen are interested in investing in real estate, agriculture, and tourism projects. There will also be more opportunities for the Omani private sector in Hanbanthota harbor, as the Ports Authority has announced new development initiatives. I wish to encourage more visits and interactions between the business communities of the two countries. There are more opportunities for joint ventures between the private sectors of the two countries. Sri Lanka looks forward to discussing future cooperation between the two countries during the second bilateral consultations meeting scheduled to be held in Colombo. The government of Sri Lanka is keen to increase future cooperation in the fields of training, fisheries, agriculture, tourism, and investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In light of the official Omani business and government delegation trip to Singapore in 2016 led by Ithraa, how can Oman help play a bigger role in capitalizing on the GCC-Singapore free trade agreement?</h4><p>The recent visit to Singapore by the combined government and business delegation from Oman demonstrated the strong ties that have been built up between our two countries. The delegation met with both government representatives and members of the Singapore business community to discuss the various investment opportunities in their respective countries. Singaporean companies are active in Oman's ICT and water sectors and are keen on pursuing opportunities in other diverse sectors such as fisheries, airport services, and logistics. The GCC-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (GSFTA) entered into force in September 2013 and helps facilitate the growing trade links between Singapore and Oman. Among other benefits, it provides for a preferential tariff rate for Omani exports to Singapore, and vice versa. Through the implementation of the GSFTA, both Singaporean and Omani traders benefit from importing and exporting their goods from and to each other. Ithraa, with its mandate to promote the export of Omani goods to other countries, is in an excellent position to raise awareness of the benefits of the GSFTA among Omani companies. Another good example of our growing bilateral economic ties is the mutual recognition of halal standards between Oman and Singapore as a spin-off from the GSFTA. This ensures that halal food products in Oman are recognized as halal by Singapore's authority on Islamic matters, Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS), and vice versa.</p><h4>What main items of trade comprise the economic relationship between Singapore and Oman, especially as Omani exports to Singapore posted a 10.5% increase last year?</h4><p>The most traded product between Oman and Singapore last year was petroleum oil. However, we have also seen a jump in trade in non-oil products such as aluminum, organic chemicals, marble for building materials, and even perfumes. The diversity of Oman's exports to Singapore is the result of Oman's efforts in promoting its non-oil exports.</p><h4>Singapore enjoys the top spot in the World Bank's “Doing Business Report." As a country in a similar geopolitical situation, how can Oman follow Singapore's model and improve its position as an enabler of global and regional commerce?</h4><p>As a small island nation, the lifeblood of Singapore's economy is trade, investment, and business. Unlike Oman, Singapore does not have any natural resources to rely on. Therefore, the government is committed to maintaining high standards in the ease of doing business in Singapore to ensure that commerce flourishes. There are several factors that have contributed to Singapore's rank in the "Doing Business Report." One of the most important is the strong rule of law, with a competent and independent judiciary. International investors and domestic businesses alike are confident that their investments will be protected and can operate in an environment with zero tolerance for corruption. Another factor is excellent infrastructure. Through continual investments, rigorous maintenance, and ongoing improvements to our infrastructure, we provide reliable power and water supplies, efficient logistics and transport links and high-speed internet access. These measures ensure that Singapore remains as business-friendly as possible. While each country's circumstances are unique, we are always happy to receive delegations from Oman and share our experiences. In so doing, both parties benefit through mutual learning.</p><h4>How would you assess the influence and role of Singaporean technology companies in the development and growth of the Omani telecom and IT sector?</h4><p>Singapore companies are active in Oman's telecoms and IT sectors, helping to develop its e-Government services and other IT-related technology services in areas such as education and the maritime industry. In the 21st century and especially the rapid spread of the Internet of Things, we will live in an increasingly interconnected and digital world. A strong presence in this sector will lead to opportunities for deeper collaboration between Singaporean and Omani companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the bilateral relationship between Thailand and Oman? </h4><p>It has been over three decades since Thailand and Oman established diplomatic relations in 1980, and ever since our bilateral relations have always been close and cordial at all levels. There have been exchanges of visit between members of the royal families, the two governments, and our peoples. The latest high-level visit from the Thai side was by Deputy Prime Minister HE Dr. Somkid Jatusripitak, accompanied by four ministers while Thailand welcomed I-I.E. Dr. Mohammed bin Hamad Al Ruhmi, Minister of Oil and Gas of Oman, in 2016. These visits have shown our strong desire and endeavor to strengthen ties and expand cooperation between Thailand and Oman even further. In addition to our main area of cooperation in the energy sector, the royal Thai government looks forward to further strengthening collaboration with Oman in various fields such as trade and investment, education, agriculture and fisheries, and tourism.</p><h4>How does Thailand view Oman as a strategic partner in the Middle East?</h4><p>Situated in the middle of the East-West trade route, Oman possesses the unique position of being between the Middle East and Africa. In addition, Oman has maintained friendly relations with every country in these regions. There is no doubt Oman can be our strategic partner linking Thailand with the Middle East and the wider regions of Africa. Thailand, with a thriving domestic consumer market of over 65 million people, is strategically located at the crossroads of Asia. Thailand can provide easy access to the region's dynamic markets, such as the Greater Mekong sub-region, where newly emerging markets offer great trade potential. For this reason, Thailand can be Oman's gateway to other ASEAN countries and the wider Asian countries. The energy sector has been laid at the forefront of our bilateral relationship; however, there are a number of sectors that Thailand and Oman can expand and strengthen their cooperation, to complement each other in areas of mutual interests such as tourism, trade, logistics, agriculture and fisheries, and other non-oil sectors. Furthermore, Thailand and Oman have enjoyed strong local contact, with around 80,000 Omani tourists visiting Thailand and a growing number of Thai tourists travelling to Oman each year.</p><h4>As a founding member of ASEAN, how can further cooperation with Thailand facilitate improved access to East Asian markets for Oman?</h4><p>The establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015 is a major milestone for ASEAN. The AEC can offer a huge market of USD2.6 trillion and over 622 million people. The AEC, as envisioned for 2025, is an economic community that is highly integrated, competitive, dynamic, people centered, and engaged at the global level. I am confident that the AEC will continue to make progress between now and 2025, and as it increasingly integrates, it is projected to be the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2050. Moreover, ASEAN remains outward looking and continues to engage actively with key trading partners. Also noteworthy is the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which includes China, Korea, Japan, India, Australia, and New Zealand. It will enhance the region's competitiveness through the expansion of production and distribution networks as well as simplified rules and standards. We also have set a goal to achieve “Thailand 4.0," which is our drive toward a value-based economy driven by innovation. To achieve this goal, the government is formulating and implementing multi-faceted economic packages such as investment in transport infrastructure and the establishment of special economic zones (SEZs). Undoubtedly, Thailand 4.0 will complement our existing advantages in infrastructure, skilled labor, and connections to the ASEAN markets and beyond, all of which Oman can benefit from and use as a springboard into ASEAN, Asia, and the Pacific. The sectors in which Thailand's strengths lie, to name but a few, are agriculture and agro-industry, industrial products, and services related to tourism, hotels, restaurants, and healthcare. Both countries can also cooperate under the framework of ASEAN and GCC. We share several similarities in terms of economic growth and potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The history of cooperation between Oman and South Korea dates back almost 1,000 years. There are historical texts in Korea and China referring to Arab merchants who are believed to be ancestors of the Omani people; it is written that, with their advanced navigation and shipbuilding technology, they came all the way to Byeokrando, a port of then Korea.</p><p>Based upon their long friendship, Oman and South Korea have, since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1974, built a firm partnership in various fields. The trade volume now stands at as much as USD4-6 billion per year. Moreover, Korea is the second-biggest market for Oman, while Korea imports its second-largest amount of LNG from Oman.</p><p>The cooperation between the two nations is not limited to trade—indeed, it has contributed to the nation building in both countries. For instance, a number of Korean companies have played a part in the process of realizing Oman's Vision 2020 by participating in numerous infrastructure-building projects in Oman. Furthermore, mutually beneficial cooperation between the two nations has now expanded to encompass a whole range of fields including IT, SMEs, science and technology, health, tourism, culture, minerals, and marine products.</p><p>In addition, Oman has taken the initiative in taking part in activities of the Korea-Arab Society, which was established by governments, enterprises, and relevant groups of Korea and 22 Arab countries, with a view to enhancing mutual understanding and development of Korea and the Arab world. Of particular note, the current secretary general of the KAS is the Omani ambassador to Korea.</p><p>Under the distinguished leadership of Sultan Qaboos, Oman has enjoyed long-lasting peace and remarkable prosperity, and has contributed greatly to the peace and stability of the Middle Eastern region. Oman also takes part in the international efforts together with other GCC countries to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, which represents a serious threat to the peace and security not only of the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia but indeed the whole international community.</p><p>Moreover, Korea also actively participates in the activities of regional institutions led by Oman such as the Middle East Desalination Research Center (MEDRC) so that it can play a part in the efforts to secure peace in the Middle East, and the Cheonghae Unit from the Republic of Korea Navy also cooperates with regional anti-piracy operations to eradicate pirates which pose a threat to the stability of the Gulf of Aden. The activities of the Cheonghae Unit are also supported by the Omani government; i.e. the Omani government proactively offered humanitarian aid by providing medical treatment to Korean patients who were victims of the Samho Jewelry incident when it was hijacked in January 2011 by Somali pirates.</p><p>In May 2012, the Omani government successfully completed its building of the Omani Embassy in Seoul, which, with its unique beauty with traditional Arab style, is greatly admired by local people, while the new Korean Embassy building in Oman, which opened in November 2016, has brought traditional Korean beauty to Muscat.<br>Oman and Korea have shared their traditions and culture based on their bonds and friendship that stretch back 1,000 years, and they are opening new doors, moving together toward a future of peace and prosperity in the 21st Century. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can increased cooperation with Oman bring mutual benefit to both countries?</h4><p>Increased cooperation between Kenya and Oman would allow Oman not only access to the region, but also to the growing Kenyan market and the improving investment environment. The Kenyan economy provides enormous opportunities and potential for mutually beneficial business interactions between the two countries. In line with Kenya's Vision 2030, key business and investment opportunities exist in the fields of tourism, agriculture, transport and infrastructure, manufacturing, communications, energy, building and construction, and pharmaceuticals. Specific areas of interest to business include eco-tourism, power generation equipment, road construction, telecommunications equipment, food processing, cement production, motor vehicle parts and agricultural inputs, among others. Kenya intends to enhance cooperation with Oman in these and other sectors for mutual benefit, as both countries continue to diversify their economies. Kenya also works closely with Oman in the multilateral arena, particularly within the context of South-South cooperation and shares the ideals of peaceful resolution to conflict. Our two countries have continued to benefit from people-to-people interactions and cultural ties, which have helped to shape relations in all other sectors.</p><h4>How does Kenya's strategy to capture tourists from the GCC seek to increase the inflow of Omani tourists to Kenya?</h4><p>Kenya has identified the need to create more product awareness about distinct tourism attractions and to attract more visitors from the GCC region. In this regard, marketing development representatives were appointed to market Kenya's diverse tourism products in the region. Kenya also actively participates in regional tourism expos, such as the Arabian Travel Market in Dubai and hosted our own Magical Kenya Travel Expo in Nairobi in 2016 in which travel agents from the GCC were invited to participate. In addition, Kenya has launched the “Yalla Kenya" campaign, which specifically targets the GCC region. The campaign, which means “Let's Go Kenya," was launched in the UAE and is expected to be rolled out in the rest of the countries. Kenya and Oman have a rich cultural and historical affinity, with the coast of Kenya having strong historical ties with Arabs from across the Gulf of Aden. With approximately 11% of the population of Kenya (over 4.5 million) being Muslim, Omani travelers would feel at home as halal food is available everywhere, mosques are located in all parts of the country, and the Kiswahili language is widely spoken. Major airlines provide seamless connections between Kenya and Oman. The impending commencement of direct flights from Muscat to Nairobi in 2017 will provide a big boost to Kenya's efforts to attract visitors from Oman and the GCC region. The presence of the Embassy of Kenya in Muscat ensures that the process of issuing visas is much faster. We intend to further improve our awareness campaign and strategize for increasing the inflow of tourists from the region.</p><h4>What are some of the efforts currently undertaken by both governments to maintain the safe passage of maritime trade in the coastal areas between Kenya and Oman?</h4><p>Kenya is in the process of developing an integrated and cross sector maritime policy to help accelerate growth of its maritime economy. Similarly, and in recognition of the importance of the maritime sector within the African continent, the African heads of state and government adopted and signed the African Charter on Maritime Security, Safety, and Development in October 2016. The charter aims to solidify Africa's commitment to the efficient and effective management of its oceans, seas, and waterways so as to ensure the sustainable, equitable, and beneficial exploration of these critical resources. As active members of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Kenya and Oman work closely to promote and protect interests within the Indian Ocean and pursue maritime safety and security issues. The two countries are similarly in the process of concluding an MoU between Salalah Port Services and Kenya Ports Authority to enhance cooperation between the two major port cities and improve their economic and strategic cooperation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Through the implementation of a succession of national development plans, Oman has successfully completed laying the foundations of a modern state and will continue to build on this achievement, improving living standards, and implementing programs that aim to boost economic growth through the diversification of sources of national income and the development of human resources.</p><p>Guided by its 2020 Vision, Oman aims to prepare itself for the future by enabling the economy to achieve its strategic evolution. Thus, the economy will no longer be dependent on government expenditure, oil resources, and foreign workers, and it will enter a better and more comprehensive phase, based on private initiative, nationally trained workers, and sustainable established resources. This will result in improving the standard of living of Omani citizens, in guaranteeing their welfare, wherever they are, based upon this vigorous development in every field.</p><p>Oil is a finite resource, and its age is limited. Therefore, it is necessary not to depend on it solely to finance development. From the beginning, Oman has stressed this truth, and its efforts have been notably successful. However, oil is still the main resource, and the fluctuation of its price is of great concern to everyone. Thus there is no other course but to diversify the sources of national income more widely in order to make oil revenues only a minor element of this income. This leads Oman to call upon its citizens to save, invest, pursue business interests, develop industry, tourism, and agriculture, and utilize mineral resources, fisheries, livestock, and other sources of revenue. It is essential that the Omani private sector be more active and prove its efficiency and ability to compete. The governmental administrative system must react to, and co-operate with, the private sector. It must not allow bureaucracy and routine to hinder its good performance.</p><p>Nations can only be built through the efforts of their people and the only way they can join the march of civilization and progress is through knowledge, experience, and training. It is no secret that the true wealth of any nation lies in human resources that are capable of pushing the wheel of progress forward in every sphere of life. Oman's determination to move forward with confidence, toward the broader horizons of comprehensive, sustainable development remains undiminished. While committed to preserving its own values and identity, Oman is enthusiastic about developing international relations to reinforce the advances already made. Further progress, Omanis believe, can best be achieved through hard work and the pursuit of knowledge, which will prepare the Sultanate and its citizens for dealing with the emerging realities of the modern age.</p><p>In the area of international relations, Oman's foreign policy is based on firm foundations and principles; support for rights and justice and a desire to work together with other peace-loving countries of the world to resolve international conflicts through dialog and negotiation, so that everyone can enjoy security and stability and all the peoples of earth can reap the benefits. The Sultanate of Oman has always been known for its clear policy of co-operation with all, based on the firm principles of mutual respect, dialog, and the rejection of force as a way to resolve problems, because it believes that this will lead to societies in which a spirit of fraternity and stability will prevail.</p><p>Oman has maintained and preserved its identity and intellectual inheritance, and it has adopted every means for development and modernization. It has been clear to Oman that its heritage is not only represented by forts, castles, and ancient buildings, but by spiritual customs and traditions, by science, art, and literature, transmitted by one generation to another. The real preservation of heritage will not be accomplished unless Oman understands this and cherishes it. The achievements made across the land of Oman in various fields are a source of pride. Oman aspires to continue the blessed march of renaissance with greater will and determination, and this can only be achieved through collaboration and integration of efforts for the benefit of all. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major operational achievements of SWCC over the past three months?</h4><p>SWCC continues to fulfill its strategic obligation to meet the demands placed upon it as the largest producer of desalinated water in the world. In doing so, we have worked on improving our core capabilities by executing a number of initiatives and programs that are related to enhancing our operational capabilities accompanied by developing the capabilities and performance of our workforce. Recently, we have revamped our Strategic Workforce Plan to ensure its alignment with our cooperate strategy, and be able to anticipate our surplus/demand of required manpower, and thus re-deploy/recruit our workforce in an effective and productive manner that ensures sustainability of the operations. Furthermore, tracking performance through the SWCC Performance Management System has enabled us to better identify and diagnose weak areas and issues, enabling us to take proactive decisions and enhance our operational performance and productivity, such as in the case of achieving a reduction in fuel consumption that led to decreasing overall operational costs. In addition, one of the major achievements over the past three months has been the launch of the Ras Al-Khair desalination plant by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman on 29 November 2016. Located in the Ras Al-Khair Industrial City, 75km northwest of Aljubail, the desalination plant will supply Riyadh and the surrounding provinces using both the Multi Stage Flash (MSF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) technologies. As noted in the Guinness Book of Records, Ras Al-Khair is the world's largest dual-purpose plant with a production capacity of 1.025 million cubic meters of potable water per day and 2,400MW of electricity. The megaproject represents a significant step forward toward Saudi Vision 2030.</p><h4>The company has outlined plans to undergo full-scale privatization as it looks to double production capacity over the next 15 years. Why is it such a crucial time for SWCC to expand its scope, and how to you expect the privatization to impact your long-term capabilities?</h4><p>The privatization program represents a significant opportunity for the evolution of the water sector and opens the door for improving efficiency, eliminating current headwinds, monitoring operational key indicators, and increasing the flexibility of SWCC plants. As part of the privatization, investment opportunities will arise for building new desalination plants.</p><h4>In terms of privatization, what is the time frame for making this happen?</h4><p>We have a consultant working with us now, and our roadmap has already been established. We aim to complete privatization in two years at the most. To help us achieve this, we have a milestone schedule, and one of these is to present the business plan to the minister by the end of March. Once this happens, we will proceed with implementation. We have held one road show already, and we plan to hold another in the near future. These shows allow us to explain the project to investors, showing them what is in it for them and what is in it for the Kingdom. We want them to understand exactly how attractive the opportunity is. I think that USD50 billion in investments is entirely plausible, and I think that we will have strong interest from both domestic and international investors. Many firms are interested, and we want to see a multinational consortium investing in the project. It would be good for the Kingdom because these firms would bring competition and high technical knowledge and standards. By working with others we can do better.</p><h4>Saudi's Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture, HE MR Abdul Rahman Al-Fadli recently explained that investment in the local water sector is one of the most attractive throughout the Kingdom. How have you found foreign investor sentiments regarding this industry?</h4><p>As you are aware, Saudi Arabia is located in one of the world's most arid regions characterized by low rainfall and high evaporation rates. As a result, desalination represents the major source of potable water in Saudi Arabia with rapid demand growth driven by the rising needs of the population. This in turn explains why future investments in water desalination are so attractive to the private sector. In an effort to promote and facilitate investment opportunities in the Kingdom, SWCC organized The Water Investment Forum 2016, which successfully took place last month and was attended by investors and key national and global water players. It has become clear that foreign investors understand both the rationale and investment opportunity for the development of these essential resources throughout the Kingdom. The opportunities are exemplified by key success stories in the sector including the construction and operation of Shoaiba phase 3 and Shuqaiq phase 2, which together represent the potential for the private sector.</p><h4>In what ways do you expect the local water industry to contribute to the government's Vision 2030 reforms?</h4><p>Currently, the private sector contributes less than 40% of GDP in Saudi Arabia. One of the key aims of Vision 2030 is to increase the private sector contribution to the Saudi economy through the privatization of some government services and entities. To increase the role of the private sector in the economy, the privatization program will help to facilitate investment, encourage innovation, and introduce healthy competition. Water sector infrastructure investment and sustainability are key to achieving Vision 2030 and the government's role will transition from being focused on providing services to concentrating on monitoring and regulation.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>In the year ahead, we expect to continue improving the efficiency of SWCC plants, meeting the needs of our customers, and planning for future water demand. SWCC will continue to accelerate plans to prepare for its commercial role. Amidst all these developments, customer satisfaction remains a key priority.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhmys has been in the insurance market for 15 years and is now the third-largest insurance company in the country. What are the main reasons for its success?</h4><p>Our breakthrough in the insurance market is the result of a well-constructed development strategy, which is aimed at diversifying the portfolio with an increase in the share of retail insurance. Taking the new vision of modern insurance as a base, we focused on optimizing the business processes and safety provision of many Kazakhstani enterprises. Before, we specialized more on serving Corporation Kazakhmys LLP. However, Kazakhmys Insurance Company is now an organization that concentrates on satisfying clients' interests across various sectors of the economy. At the same time, the corporation continues to be our most important strategic partner.</p><h4>KMIC was able to almost double its income in 2015 compared to 2014 during the peak of the recession. What was the key to this success?</h4><p>The principle of our company is to meet customer needs, regardless of the internal and external market situations. That is why the world economic crisis was not the starting point in the search for reserves. It was the reason for developing a new strategy, which included creating new insurance products, optimizing the agent network, improving business processes within the company, and formulating a competent investment policy. An integrated approach to the problem allowed our company to not only remain stable in such an unstable economic situation, but also to move to an entirely new level of development.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans in terms of including new sectors to the portfolio?</h4><p>Currently, we have gone through the stage of expansive development and our priority is to improve the quality of services provided instead of the quantity. At the same time, we are not ready to stop there. Expanding the product line, reducing the time for application processes for corporate customers, and developing an attractive diversified portfolio for shareholders are the main directions in the development of the company that will be implemented. Today, we have representative offices in 22 locations in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The main objective of the company is to strengthen its position and become a reliable insurer.</p><h4>How do you plan to move from quantity to quality?</h4><p>In order to achieve this goal, we intend to improve insurance activity in several ways. Moreover, there are modern technologies and new developments in IT and customer service using modern techniques. Our company has excelled in the market and the proof of this is our being ranked second in the general collection of insurance premiums in the market. We have developed a balanced reinsurance structure that allows our customers to be confident in their choices, because 90% of the portfolio is reinsured in companies with a rating of “A-" or higher. Our partners include Lloyd, Hannover Re, Munich Re, Allianz Switzerland, ACE European Group Limited, AIG, and Swiss Re. At the moment, the company is a leader of insuring cargo, property, and air transport, and we intend not only to hold on to, but also to improve the trust of our clients and partners. Our portfolio includes a large number of enterprises that are the real engines of our economy, such as mining and processing industries, power-producing companies, financial institutions, oil sector companies, and international companies that represent their interests not only in our country but around the world. That is why our company will do its best to ensure every customer is satisfied with the quality of our service and the services we provide.</p><h4>Why is it so important to be insured in troubled times, and how do insurance companies raise awareness of the need to insure businesses in such times?</h4><p>Insuring life and property of citizens has been a common practice in developed countries for a number of years. At present, this topic remains open in our country, because the share of insurance in GDP barely passes the 0.47% mark. Understanding the importance of the role of insurance companies in improving the culture of the Kazakhstani society, we regularly conduct campaigns aimed at explaining to potential clients the importance of insurance in the age of financial market instability. The main drive of the current market is compulsory insurance and property insurance. However, in the future our company predicts a transition to total coverage of all segments and trends of the market. In particular, the focus is on increasing the level of education of the insurance business community. The company is not one person, but rather a whole society that the head of the company is responsible for. Insurance can protect a company from interruptions in production due to broken equipment, environmental risks, and more.</p><h4>How would you assess the insurance market in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The tendencies of developing insurance market suggest that its future will depend more on participants' ability to optimize insurance products and business processes. First-class service, timely payments, and an overall client-orientated strategy are the keys to solving many issues. In this regard, we believe there will be possible market growth of 5-7% in the near future. An important role in increasing retail sales will be focused on health insurance and the general increase in the standard of living of our citizens. Thus, the beneficiaries will be those who have laid the foundation of the insurance products and are ready to develop and adapt to customers' changing needs.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>The economic slowdown undoubtedly left its mark on the country. However, the stable growth of the economy is possible. A competent financial policy by the National Bank of Kazakhstan will be the starting point to develop many sectors of the economy. That is why we expect an increase in demand for insurance products in 2017-18. Innovative projects supported by the state and the development of current businesses will help insurers to consolidate their positions and prove to be a reliable guarantor of business stability and peace.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the positive achievements of the Qatari Businessmen Association?</h4><p>The main achievement of QBA is creating a platform or a think tank with the aim of exchanging ideas, concerns, and raise suggestions between Qatari businessmen and entrepreneurs. We act together for the benefit of developing the private sector's role in the economy and to contribute further to the growth of Qatar's economy, bridging business relations between Qatari businessmen and their international counterparts. We partner with similar business associations and chambers of commerce worldwide and open new markets for Qatari investors by highlighting business trends and opportunities abroad. At the same time, we receive foreign business delegations to showcase the opportunities which Doha offers. We have hosted more than 750 delegations and have organized and participated in over 200 conferences so far.</p><h4>How do you assess the Qatari Businessmen Association's role in connecting the Qatari business community with the world?</h4><p>Through its various activities, QBA aims to support the business and investment environment by highlighting economic sectors with high growth potential, both in Qatar and abroad. In addition, we sign trade agreements with various regional and international institutions to encourage business cooperation. QBA enjoys excellent relations with the international community and continuously receives invitations to participate in business related activities. We take an inclusive approach, opening all of the meetings and events to everyone, not just to our members.</p><h4>What structural reforms does QBA see as necessary for Qatar to continue to grow?</h4><p>We receive support from the Ministry of Economy and the Prime Minister to encourage the role of the private sector in Qatar. This happens on many levels, including through regular meetings with business representatives that enable them to discuss and listen to the needs and requirements of private companies and what can be done to enhance the contribution of the private sector in the economy. Reforms and adjustments are made continuously and we are hoping that within a few years Qatar will be a role model for economic and structural development.</p><h4>How have Al Faisal's investments in education, especially in its local Stenden University, improved the Holding Group's operations? </h4><p>When we started in the early 1960s our business was just a small trading company, but with the development of the country we felt that our duty was to support the development of the education system in Qatar. As we expanded our operations across different sectors, education emerged as an important field. However, we have never regarded our involvement in education as a business or as profit-based. We have established the Gulf English School and Stenden University Qatar, in addition to an agreement with DePaul University to introduce the MBA program in Qatar. We aim to continue to be an active contributor to the enhancement of the education system in Qatar, partnering with renowned institutions which can potentially add value to the education sector.</p><h4>What role does the Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani Museum have in promoting education and Qatar's national heritage?</h4><p>The museum is my hobby and passion. Before opening it to the public, I used to have personal collections displayed in the guests meeting hall, and I noticed the increasing interest people showed in the collection. We started receiving many inquiries about the collection and requests to see the artifacts, primarily from highly informed enthusiasts both from Qatar and around the world. I therefore felt an obligation to make access to my collection more widely available, and I decided to open it to the public. The main museum opened in 1998, aiming to preserve and display different collections of arts and heritage artifacts from around the world. Since then it has continuously expanded, offering dedicated research and education facilities in addition to the artifacts. The museum has partnerships with many educational institutions, including the University of London for restoration work on some of the collection.</p><h4>One of your business strategies is to diversify your industrial manufacturing interests. How is Aamal Company diversifying its industrial base?</h4><p>Qatar enjoys many characteristics that makes it suitable for being an industrial hub, such as its excellent location, its strong connectivity to major neighboring markets like Iran or India, and its natural resources required as raw materials for various industries. I am confident that in the near future Qatar will be an important, diversified industrial hub. Likewise, our strategy for Aamal is to track Qatar's rapid economic development to identify sectors which offer investment opportunities for sustainable growth and returns by meeting the increasingly sophisticated needs of the local market. We focus on industrial manufacturing, trading, business services, and property. We believe in building strength through careful diversification and have built a successful track record of delivery against this strategy, often in collaboration with world class partners in their respective markets. We always seek to expand our business operations in line with our strategy, either through joint ventures or organic growth. Our solid foundation and successful track record allows us to be the partner of choice to many regional and international companies, building strong relationships with blue chip companies such as hotel operators, medical and pharmaceutical companies and many others. Our business development team continuously evaluates investment opportunities that will add value to our business model.</p><h4>What are your expectations surrounding the FIFA World Cup 2022? </h4><p>I am confident Qatar will host a superb World Cup. I also believe that after the event, Qatar will witness further development and prosperity. For the time being, we are all working to fulfill the requirements related to the infrastructure development plan and World Cup associated projects. However, after 2022 the country will benefit from all this investment and effort, the legacy of which will be a sophisticated and innovative platform which will enable us to be ready to take on new, exciting challenges. We will have advanced infrastructure, the private sector will be stronger and more developed, and there will be more qualified Qatari graduates who will have benefited from the excellent education system and will be looking to apply their knowledge and aspirations to lead the country forward. When it comes to our business, I am very optimistic and excited to continue with our journey. We have several projects in the pipeline and I look forward to all the challenges and achievements the future will bring as we bring them to fruition in the year ahead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Is SAGIA still on course for its target to double FDI in the Kingdom to USD15 billion in the next 10 years?</h4><p>Since last year we have aligned our goals with Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program (NTP) 2020, allowing us to create a clear vision for the country, outlining the sectors necessary to reach those goals. There have been no fundamental changes in terms of what SAGIA focuses on. What has happened instead is that the goals are now clear for everyone, for both the government and the private sector. This is important in terms of aligning different government entities toward specific goals, and as a result for 2030 we have seen a number of things happen. There is now more collaboration between public sector entities. In terms of the private sector, we have seen a great deal of gearing up toward reaching the goals of 2030, with many multinationals establishing 2030 departments and forming 2030 teams. These teams are redesigning and re-engineering their organizations in Saudi Arabia to reach those goals in line with the reforms. In terms of the target of USD15 billion, this was set by Vision 2030 and are currently reverse engineering this figure in order to establish our annual targets to match the Vision 2030 targets.</p><h4>How has Vision 2030 influenced, facilitated, and boosted investor sentiment?</h4><p>Entities that already have a local presence are extremely excited and we have seen many visits by the leaders, presidents, and CEOs of a number of multinationals in the past year. They seek to explore how their companies can contribute to reach those 2030 goals. In particular, we see this surge in tech-driven companies, as Saudi Arabia is now focusing on attracting FDI that facilitates innovation, the transfer of technology and knowledge, and the creation of jobs. Our outward investments in tech companies has also changed sentiment and signaled to the tech industry that there is a real focus and motion toward that field. In other sectors including healthcare, mining, transport and logistics, and alternative energy, we have also seen the same healthy buzz around the Kingdom. Global leaders are certainly showing greater interest since the Vision's launch.</p><h4>In what ways does SAGIA contribute to improving the investment environment and ease of doing business in the Kingdom?</h4><p>About two years ago, we launched the Competitiveness Acceleration Program (CAP) that works with 52 different entities to improve the investment environment, because one of SAGIA's mandates is spearheading the competitiveness agenda of the Kingdom. CAP has since grown and evolved into a project monitored by a ministerial council. It also has an executive council, headed by His Excellency the Minister of Commerce and Investment, which meets weekly at SAGIA and is managed by SAGIA. SAGIA's CAP team works on over 200 points to improve the investment climate, in terms of both procedures and regulations. The pace is rapid, with the team quickly and closely engaging with different government entities to reengineer processes. We are benchmarking our approach against global best practices, using around 300 global indicators along with locally developed indicators, major indicators, and also sub-indicators. All this work has produced clear results. Recently, the Kingdom announced an application system to issue electronic business visas within 24 hours. In ports, we have reduced the time it takes to clear containers from 14 days to 24 hours. These initiatives were completed in just a few months, and the CAP is only in its initial stages. Investors can expect much more going forward.</p><h4>How does SAGIA facilitate investment and growth in innovation and technology-related fields?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is one of the world's last great untold stories: there are many things about the Kingdom that would probably surprise any first-time visitor. Saudis are incredibly tech-savvy: they are the highest per capita users of YouTube and Twitter in the world. We have one of the highest education rates in the world, with 92% of high-school graduates going to university. We have the largest government scholarship program in the world, with around 200,000 students at any given time worldwide. So the foundations for a lively tech sector are there. We just need to put the wheels in motion, which is what we have started doing. There is a great deal there to be excited about and our investment attraction team in the past year has visited a number of tech companies around the world to spread the word. Locally, the Kingdom has a number of initiatives supporting innovation-based investment. One of them is SAGIA's licensing requirements for innovative companies, which are conducive to attracting such businesses, many of which are SMEs. Many of the requirements that would apply to larger companies are not applicable to SMEs, so our licensing requirements are tailored to attracting SMEs, to smooth any administrative barriers that may be in their way. Elsewhere, SAGIA works closely with other organizations across the country to ensure investors are fully aware of the range of incentives available to them that, particularly, can ease some of the burdens unique to SMEs. For example, hiring and training talent for small businesses is essential, yet sometimes costly. To mitigate this, Saudi Arabia's Human Resource Development Fund (HRDF) will pay up to half the training costs, and up to half the salary of a new Saudi national employee for up to two years. Annually, we also organize the Global Competitiveness Forum (GCF), an event that promotes innovation through innovation-based panels, making it a platform for innovation-based businesses and people with cutting-edge ideas and concepts to discuss their projects through what we call “Big Idea" sessions.</p><h4>What are your expectations for FDI trends in 2017?</h4><p>FDI trends in the Kingdom have generally followed global trends, increasing and falling in line with FDI trends worldwide. We will see a continuation of that in 2017. We expect an increase in FDI this year and the next in line with the implementation of Vision 2030, particularly as the government establishes PPP models across a number of sectors. One of our main challenges now is engaging the local private sector, focusing on them, nurturing them, and having them as active partners both in terms of development and growth in Saudi Arabia, and in terms of attracting foreign companies. That is an area that we will start to focus more on this year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Health, infrastructure, education, and security received more than 50% of public investments for 2016. How much is the current government investing in social issues?</h4><p>Official data shows that our budget is about USD280 million. Of that, social spending received about USD215 million, a figure that covers all types of programs that reach our country's most vulnerable. For example, men over 65 with no pension and living in extreme poverty get a government subsidy of around USD120/month. Today, this program has around 133,000 beneficiaries. We have another program called Opportunity Network, which targets families headed by women and has 65,500 beneficiaries who receive USD50/month. There is another program for those with severely disabled dependents who receive USD80/month, which has 17,000 beneficiaries. In the last two years, we have expanded this program by 90%. Finally, there is the program for people suffering from malnutrition, mainly among indigenous people. Today, there are 10,000 beneficiaries who receive food support of PAB8 million per year. Our administration has also built several children's counseling centers across the country that meet the necessary quality standards. In this context, this program is supported by the Inter-American Development Bank and reaches soup kitchens in the country, especially in the capital cities and remote areas. We additionally donate about USD4 million to about 100 non-governmental organizations that support elderly people in remote and indigenous communities. These are the main points of our social policy. On top of that is our literacy program. Some 4.5% of Panamanians are still illiterate, and our objective is to eradicate this. One of our greatest achievements has been the implementation of the Social Investment System in which we support people in our effort to eradicate poverty by providing them with the necessary tools. These cooperatives support local farmers, handicrafts, and small industries through a PPP that spurs them to become entrepreneurs. Some universities also take part in this program by providing training. Finally, we have created the Social Protection and Inclusion Program. We have aligned the structural matrix of the program/system to reach our beneficiaries with transparency and efficiency. Overall, our greatest achievement has been the establishment of strategies for the creation of state policies in the social area without political objectives.</p><h4>In such a small country characterized by solid and constant growth, is welfare equally distributed within society?</h4><p>We are a country of around 70,000sqkm and enjoy great social cohesion. Our people are our greatest asset in Panama. We are proud of having become the epicenter for many cultures and ethnicities. Culturally, we are Caribbean, geographically we are Central American, and historically we are South Americans. Yet, we are alongside Brazil and Haiti as one of the countries with the highest levels of inequality. This is because historically, the political system was mainly dominated by certain parties and government policies rather than long-term state objectives. President Varela and his administration have recognized the critical nature of the situation, and we have identified three countries within Panama: that of the rich; that of the middle-class, which supports the social and economic development of the country, and everyone else. In this context, our government has prioritized intangible projects in order to address this situation. We fight poverty with basic healthcare, eliminating ranch schools, and providing educational opportunities to all, decent housing, and other similar programs. We have also decentralized investment, which has been complex and difficult for mostly cultural reasons. We have slightly less than 500,000 indigenous people, and 23% of regional land belongs to them. Large investment projects in these areas always face the radical opposition of local communities. For example, the electric connection between Panama and Colombia was suspended due to the opposition of indigenous communities. The main challenge here is the differences within those communities. We can say that there is no consensus at all within them regarding their development. In this context, we have established an Indigenous Coordinator to channel the development of the regions, for we are committed to their development and will continue to invest in these regions.</p><h4>What is being done to improve the inclusion of women in the society?</h4><p>It has been hard for women in Panama to break the glass ceiling. At the ministry, however, we are 80% female and 20% male, meaning we are trying to lead by example. In this context, 70% of our mid-level management across the country is women, too. At the MIDES level, we have the National Women Institute of which I am the president. There is also a national Women's Council, in addition to many other organizations and institutions that have been fighting for equal gender rights. One of our main focuses in 2016 has been the fight against femicide, of which at least 25 were registered in 2015. We have already seen that figures have dropped thanks to our efforts. Our priority is to provide women with the tools for them to achieve economic autonomy while still taking into account their importance in the development of their families, households, and so on and so forth. Another of our main struggles has been struggling against early pregnancies, and we are drafting a law to strengthen education and consciousness in society.</p><h4>What are the main programs MIDES wants to implement starting in 2017?</h4><p>When we arrived at the ministry, we approved a five-year program for our policies and development. In 2016, we completed about 95% of the program. In 2017, our priority is centered around increasing systems efficiency and better serving our beneficiaries. We also want to find a payment mechanism to deal with all the transfers to our beneficiaries. Today, almost all our beneficiaries receive the payments through the so-called social card in both private and public ATMs. When dealing with remote areas, we want to implement an e-wallet concept. We also want to implement the social protection and inclusion program I previously mentioned in its totality, in addition to tripling literacy rates across the country and formalizing children's counseling centers. In 2016, we formalized almost 50% of these centers. We also want to reach a wider geographic spectrum of the country with soup kitchens, children's counseling centers, and other such investments, especially within these 14 areas at high-risk of exclusion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you choose Kazakhstan to build the first factory outside of Turkey?</h4><p>Kazakhstan was the first country chosen by Efes because of the opportunities it offered given its proximity to Europe and Turkey. Our Brewery in Karaganda was the first investment of Anadolu Group in 1997. The total investment of Anadolu Group in Kazakhstan stands at around USD650 million, with the part invested through Efes Kazakhstan above USD250 million for the three breweries we have, namely one in Karaganda and two in Almaty.</p><h4>What have been Efes' main achievements in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Our main achievement has been to become the absolute market leader. In 2008 our market share was 25%, and within three years we increased that to 55%. We brought many innovations to the market such as the new concept of fresh beer in the bottle. Typically the shelf life of beer is nine to 12 months, while the shelf life of the new concept created by us is four months. In addition to this new types of beer have been launched, namely easy-drinking lager (mild beer under Kruzhka Svezhego brand), and unfiltered beer. </p><h4>What is your strategy for becoming a trendsetter in the market?</h4><p>First of all a company needs to feel the market. It should take some lessons from the past but it does not mean the same pattern should be repeated in the future. Companies should understand where the market is going. Nowadays beer markets in CIS region are either declining or flat, due to many reasons like regulatory constraints and purchasing power decreases. Particularly in Kazakhstan, the beer market has shrunk by around 20% over the past five years. We are continuing to invest in innovations to develop the category, and last summer we introduced a new category, unpasteurized beer in a bottle called “three weeks“ (“3 ÐÐµÐ´ÐµÐ»Ð¸“). Secondly, we aim to pursue our goal to serve our consumers with products brewed from 100% natural raw materials like malt and hop, ensuring world class quality and the best taste created in breweries equipped with the latest technologies.</p><h4>What strategy will you adopt to achieve your goal of doubling business by 2020?</h4><p>One of the strategies is investing not only in equipment, but also in people. In order to be successful a company needs good employees generating smart ideas. Generally in our industry, the turnover for employees is around 15%. In our company it is 2.5%, because we invest in employees. This year we provided 20,000 hours of training to our staff, or about 30 hours per person. Our employee engagement, which represents employee satisfaction, is 76%, compared to the country average of 62%. The second aspect is the portfolio of products. We continually emphasize the importance of innovation, because consumers are bored with purchasing the same product over five or 10 years, and so companies should give them something new.</p><h4>What will be your main focus for 2017?</h4><p>We already have three breweries but each year we make investments of more than USD10 million into Kazakhstan's market. We will continue to be innovative by launching new brands and creating new trends, to try to expand the market and meet consumer expectations.</p><h4>What trends do you see in the consumption of alcoholic beverages in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The market is not growing steadily, mostly due to the ban on advertising. Now there are some initiatives in the mass media sector to lift this ban. Removal of the ban will help the beer market to grow. Selling draught beer in plastic bottles is an area that has been growing. The share of key accounts in beer sales in Kazakhstan is growing and there is room for that channel to grow in the future.</p><h4>The government seeks to introduce duty on alcoholic beverages. How will this affect Efes?</h4><p>Currently we pay an excise tax per liter of beer. It was KZT26 per liter but in 2017 it will be raised by 50%. This is of course negative for us, as it limits market growth. Also in 2016 additional tax introduced for underground water usage. To overcome the increase in tax burden we should be more efficient, and become more dynamic each and every day.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>The market didn't grow in 2016, and in 2017 we expect a decline due to an increase in the tax burden on companies. But we are the locomotive of the beer industry and locomotives never stop. We pull others behind us and will not stop because we know what to do and how to react to the market and we will continue in that manner. In 2017 although the market will decline but we will have positive growth. We still have good expectations from the market and we believe in Kazakhstan, the economy, the future of the country, and the people. That is why we are here and we will continue working to make life more enjoyable for people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Huta Marine performed on the KAP since we last spoke in 2014?</h4><p>In 2014, we started commercial operations in King Abdullah Port (KAP), and over the past two years we developed the port further. Today the port handles about 1.5 million TEUs per year, and with the current arrangements, we expect that figure to be close to the order of 2 million TEUs in 2017, which would make KAP the second biggest container port in the Kingdom after Jeddah. We were the fastest growing port in the world in 2015. We have had double-digit growth in a declining trade environment worldwide and in the Gulf. The trade market was stagnant in 2016, and in the Gulf it was actually shrinking, for obvious reasons. But we were able to increase our volume in absolute terms from 2015 to 2016, and we also increased our market share. The reason for that performance is because we have a good product, first and foremost. The port is state of the art in terms of infrastructure, in terms of process, efficiency, and technology. The market appreciates that and sees the difference we offer, as do local importers and exporters. We reach the highest levels of international standards in terms of vessel unloading productivity as well as the clearance process. In terms of cost, we have to be competitive against other national and international ports for the same or comparable services.</p><h4>What key trends in the global shipping industry are driving that growth?</h4><p>In the global shipping industry, small shipping lines are going out of business, and there is a lot of consolidation going on. The remaining lines have forged four “alliances," which are capacity-sharing agreements, similar to what airlines are doing. There are just four alliances remaining now, namely 2M, Ocean 3, G7, and CKYHE. The alliances are part of an effort to optimize the use of existing capacities. The use of large ships triggers an economy of scale. Big ports like ours that can accommodate this trend are going to be more and more important. In short cargo is being driven onto larger and larger ships, and only ports like ours which can accommodate such vessels will remain competitive internationally.</p><h4>What is the state of your RO-RO terminal?</h4><p>We will start operations around the middle of 2017. The terminal is operated by a JV with NYK, the largest RO-RO car carrier in the world. NYK has a terminal operating arm. Cars are capital goods, expensive ones, and that is the first item affected by any economic downturn or fluctuations. This is why the imports of cars to KSA has dropped in 2016. Normally these cycles lead to recovery, with downturn being followed by an upturn that is bigger than the downturn preceding it. The RO-RO port has a lifetime of 100 years, so I do not worry about what will happen over the next two years.</p><h4>What is the status of the construction of the port and the expansion process?</h4><p>We foresee an expansion of the port that will continue for the next couple of years. Today we have more than 3km of berths that are completed, and we plan to have about 15km in total by the end of the project. So we have a few years yet ahead of us. The ultimate development period depends on financing, the economy, demand, political issues, and more. But we see a continuous increase in demand, because of the superiority of KAP's infrastructure, and also its superior efficiency and its strategic positioning. The port is in the proximity of Yanbu, and considering that Vision 2030 includes the expansion of the petrochemical industry, that is a good place to be because these exports all go to KAP. Yanbu does not have adequate port facilities for export of commercial cargo like containerized petrochemical products. Yanbu is an industrial port, not a commercial port. The commercial port of Yanbu is not designed as container port and does not have international connectivity. So it needs KAP. The basins of our port are 18m deep and can accommodate Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULCV), vessels carrying more than 20,000TEUs. The biggest container cranes worldwide operate in KAP. Yanbu, on the other hand, has just 12m water depth, so it cannot accommodate large vessels.</p><h4>What about your plans for going public? What conditions would need to be there to go public with KAP?</h4><p>We are determined to do this one day, because we believe an infrastructure facility of this size that is for public use should be publicly owned. However there is no fixed timeline set yet.</p><h4>Are you encouraged by the developments and reforms that we have seen on the capital markets today? Would these developments speed the timeline for going public with KAP?</h4><p>The opening of the KSA capital markets, which is geared more toward foreign investors, is a very important move, especially for a port like KAP, because this will attract individual as well as institutional investors, and those investors look for open secured capital markets as a prerequisite for their investments.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for the coming 12 months?</h4><p>Like many others, we are trying to wait and see the impact and effect of the reforms. The financial impact of the reforms is not fully known yet. It is difficult to plan before the details are known and the impact of reforms and policies can be estimated. This is the disadvantage of the current situation. Certain state-controlled enterprises are already planning and preparing for new investments in connection with Vision 2030. We know that SABIC and ARAMCO are very active in planning huge new projects. But this is a bit speculative for now. Uncertainty is the flipside of any reform, and in particular of reforms that have hardly taken effect yet.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over the past 50 years, CoopeAnde has worked in different areas but always focused on the educational sector. In the last few years, however, you have diversified your portfolio, and shifted to the public sector. What was the strategy behind this?</h4><p>After 50 years of business activity during which we focused on the education sector, which is very different to other countries, we decided to diversify our portfolio. We focused on making a difference to the people of Costa Rica, to educate them about the benefits of being part of a cooperative. We wanted to have a greater impact on the socio-economic development of the country. We offer the same benefits to the main relatives of the associated person. We offer social and economic packages that complement each other. We have to be efficient economically to then have an impact on the social arena. We have invested heavily in the digitization of the company. For example, our efforts to innovate in this area have allowed us to create an app for our financial analysts. This also enables us to reach remote areas of the country where we do not have a physical presence. This sets us apart from competition and offers great possibilities to our associates. In the social arena we offer different types of subsidies, for education and health. Our efforts in the last few months have focused on providing support to indebted associations. Additionally, our people are highly qualified professionals that offer some of the best services in their area of specialization, such as finance, psychology, and social work, to name a few. Each of them has helped us deepen relationships with our associates, providing them with developmental tools, and addressing potential issues. Our commitment goes far beyond this and we aim to guarantee the economic solvency of our associates in order for them to meet their needs. This is a relatively new program and has helped us learn a lot. We needed to establish certain access parameters because the interest among associates was huge.</p><h4>CoopeAnde currently has 23 branches in the country and more than 63,000 associates. What are your expansion plans?</h4><p>We have more than 63,000 associates at the moment, a figure that will rapidly grow within the next year. In terms of offices, we have different types. For example, we have the “A" offices, which are located in the largest cities of the country's provinces and are the most important markets. Then, we have “B" and “C" offices. These are in smaller cantons and deal with smaller markets. We also have two mobile units that enable us to reach areas where we do not have a physical presence. Our financial consultants are also part of our network. Our partnerships with education centers enable us to have a presence at certain schools during certain periods of the year. When it comes to expansion plans, we are currently focusing on financial consultancy and mobile units. Basically, we put a lot of effort into the mobile type of office in order to expand our geographical coverage in the country. New technologies play a key role in this expansion and that is why we have put that much attention into digitization. For example, one of our mobile units has the ability to offer digital signatures, making it unique in the country. We expect to purchase one more mobile unit in 2017.</p><h4>What are the main challenges facing the sector at the moment? </h4><p>The main challenges are related to dynamics that came after the implementation of new regulations in the financial and regulatory industry. In our case, we felt the impact of this new regulation; we expect to close the year with a 17% growth when in the last few years our growth was above 22%.</p><h4>In terms of total activities, CoopeAnde is third in Costa Rica with a total of COP477.34 million, expecting to close 2016 up by 12% in its credit portfolio. What do you see for 2017?</h4><p>2017 will be a more complex year for us than 2016. We will see the consolidation of new regulations and that will lead to a certain accommodation among financial institutions. We are committed to our goal of achieving further consolidation in our leading role in the industry.</p><h4>What are CoopeAnde's main objectives and projects in 2017?</h4><p>We will continue our digitization process, though our focus will mainly be on the credit scheme, which we want to fully digitize to reduce waiting times. We also put a lot of effort into time and response efficiency within the organization. We want to continue investing in our model to serve people by eliminating physical barriers and making them feel more comfortable in our offices. We are working toward a closer, more transparent, and more tailored approach to our associates. Additionally, we are revising our products and services at the moment in order to continue adapting these to the needs of the market. All in all, we aim to strengthen the social and economic development of families and communities by providing them with the necessary tools for that development. As we said, our work focused on education through scholarships and subsidies, but over the last few years we have tried to diversify our portfolio in order to have a broader impact and continue gaining the trust of our associates.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do the ministry's initiatives seek to underpin the country's role as a focal point for regional activities?</h4><p>Zambia is landlocked, surrounded by eight countries, and we view these eight countries as opportunities for us to push our agenda in terms of foreign economic policy. As a strong member of COMESA and SADC, we consider ourselves to have a potential audience of about 850 million people within these regional groupings, which gives us a platform to be the focal point in the region in terms of foreign diplomacy. We look at a whole range of issues to strengthen our foreign economic policy. We seek to develop our Foreign Service Bureau, which aims to ensure Zambia realizes its priorities in its interactions with the international community. We also want to utilize the Foreign Service Bureau to attract professionals to work in order to adequately and sufficiently represent Zambia's requirements. What is more, Zambia is a member of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, a platform we take full advantage of in order to promote the values of pacifism and diplomacy throughout the African continent and indeed beyond. Our history as a country speaks volumes about our determination to advocate peace. We know that unless the region or the continent is peaceful, it is difficult for Africa to actualize its potential and fully develop, economically speaking.</p><h4>What are the pillars of the government's foreign policy for attracting FDI to the country?</h4><p>We give precedence to regional and international cooperation. It is crucial to represent ourselves as a country that is open and conducive for investment in order to attract foreign interest. Peace and stability are a core part of this. We are one of the eight countries in Africa that has never experienced any form of civil strife. However, we also promote our national identity, our wealth of resources, and our people. The good investment planning that has been put forward by the government also speaks to potential investors in all sectors, for example in agriculture. Zambia is ready to receive FDI and we will continue to open up various avenues to ensure that investment does indeed flow into our country.</p><h4>What were the fruits of the fourth African-Arab Summit held this year in Equatorial Guinea, and what do such gatherings mean for Zambia's relationship with the Arab world moving forward?</h4><p>The African-Arab summit was paramount. In the past Zambia as a country did not take the time to develop connections with the Arab world. Now, however, we have truly turned our attentions to opening up mutual relations with the Middle East. At this summit, the action plan for 2017 and 2019 was developed, and this in turn will help channel avenues of investment into Zambia. We have cooperated with the Arab world in the past, though our relationship has always been through bilateral aid, via institutions such as the Saudi Fund, the Kuwait Fund, and the Abu Dhabi Fund. Through these, we have been able to see areas such as agriculture, health, and tourism open up for Zambia. To be more specific, we will receive funding for the Sicomo Collabo Road in Western Zambia, a strategic road that could greatly enhance Zambia's connectivity with the rest of the world. In 2017, there are several meetings planned with our Arab brothers and sisters. I will travel to the Gulf in the first quarter of 2017 on a trip to cement relations between the Arab world and our country.</p><h4>With which other parts of the world is Zambia forging strong ties?</h4><p>We continue to strengthen our relationship with China. The historical ties between the nations go back many years: Zambia has supported and continues to support the One China policy, while China was instrumental in establishing TAZARA, which was a lifeline for the country in terms of imports and exports in the 1970s. Our relations with China were fostered under the umbrella organization the Forum for China and Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). Zambia also enjoys strong ties with many countries, such as the US, Germany, and Japan, and each is a unique relationship.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements and developments at KOC since your appointment as CEO in January 2016?</h4><p>The company performed well in 2016. We reached a record production of 3,078 thousand barrels of oil per day (MBOPD) and gas production of about 1,900 million standard cubic feet of gas (MMSCFD). In addition, several projects, which are critical to delivering KOC's strategic production capacity target of 3,650MBOPD by 2020, have progressed well. These projects include four production units—three of them for Jurassic oil production and one for heavy oil production, which together will deliver around 135MBOPD, three gathering centers in North Kuwait with total capacity of 300MBOPD, and a major heavy oil production facility to produce 60MBOPD. In August 2016, KOC reduced the gas-flaring rate of its operations to a record 0.8% of its produced gas, thereby maximizing the revenue from gas production and improving the quality of the environment. Also on the environmental front, last April we inaugurated the Ahmadi Oasis, a new addition to the several oases KOC has constructed in its operation areas to restore and improve the environment. In response to His Highness the Amir Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah's direction to develop alternative energy sources, we have established our first solar power plant in West Kuwait to cover some of the power requirements in the operations and oil production fields.</p><h4>The KOC's mandate primarily encompasses the exploration, drilling, and production of oil and gas in Kuwait. What are the major projects that your company is currently involved in?</h4><p>Several major projects are ongoing toward realizing our strategic goals in all the fields. In the exploration field, KOC currently handles five projects, which are in the execution stage, with an approximate cost of KWD259.8 million. These are the 2D/3D seismic surveys in Kuwait Bay, North Kuwait, and Southeast Kuwait, and two other projects related to 3D seismic surveys for Boubyan Island and West Kuwait. When it comes to drilling, KOC handles around 100 drilling projects with different drilling types, including the construction of flowlines and artificial lift, with an approximate cost of KWD5.5 billion. Work on an effluent water treatment and injection plant and a new booster station in West Kuwait is also in progress. Other major projects in the contracting stage are a Jurassic gas facility in North Kuwait, a new gathering center-32 in SEK, and a gas sweetening facility in West Kuwait.</p><h4>What is your strategy for future innovation within KOC?</h4><p>Our strategy outlines an ambitious growth agenda with technology as a critical enabler. Considering the challenges that we face in Kuwait, we look at several key technologies with high potential for our operations. We are considering the options of using nano-chemicals for enhanced oil recovery, which could lead to increased production with limited material use. Options for using nano-materials for corrosion control and drilling fluids are also being explored. Water conformance technologies that enable the potential use of smart fluids to prevent or reduce water production from our reservoirs are also being looked into. The use of non-thermal processes for heavy oil productions, new effective inhibitors to prevent asphalting, and also a new class of superior chemicals known as surfactants are also being explored. Currently we are working to establish an upstream R&amp;D center that will help us build capabilities within the Kuwaiti oil sector and develop the critical technologies needed to advance our operations.</p><h4>With global volatility in the oil price in recent years, what do you consider to be the main challenges for attaining KPC's volume objective of 4 million barrels of oil per day (MMBOPD) in 2020?</h4><p>KPC has set a challenging strategic direction for Kuwait's domestic upstream, which is a production capacity of 4MMBOPD by 2020, of which KOC's share is 3.65MMBOPD. To achieve this target, KOC has been implementing a comprehensive roadmap, where we outline how to overcome the challenges ahead. First, we will master secondary recovery techniques and conduct an aggressive exploration program to add additional new oil and gas production capacities. We will also enhance the current production capacity by applying production optimization techniques and by piloting and implementing newer technologies to meet our strategic target. In addition to the sub-surface optimization initiatives, we are conducting several de-bottlenecking projects in several production facilities to increase crude handling capacities. Another ambition is to develop Kuwait's large heavy oil reserves, which is a new activity for KOC. Developing the Jurassic reserves in North Kuwait to increase the production of non-associated gas in Kuwait is also on our agenda. These reserves are considered to be the most difficult to handle due to their extreme depth, high temperature, pressure, and fractured nature. To overcome these challenges, we will implement several technical initiatives to improve and enhance its performance, such as multilateral and horizontal drilling as well as applying smart field concepts for better decision-making.</p><h4>In December 2016, OPEC agreed upon a cap on conveying capacity for the first time in eight years, implying a production cut of 133,000MBOPD for Kuwait. How do you assess the long-term impact of this agreement on Kuwait's national oil production?</h4><p>We are always in support of measures to ensure stability in the oil market and to achieve a fair price for producers and consumers. The OPEC decision was an in-principle agreement and the finer details will be discussed at a later stage. KOC is a strategy-driven company, and we are moving ahead with implementing our strategy to meet 3,650MBOPD by 2020 in order to meet our obligations to the state of Kuwait. In response to the low oil price, currently, KOC is implementing several measures to optimize its spending. However, the cut in spending is neither at the expense of the oil and gas operations, nor at the expense of the capital projects that are critical to increase production capacity and also shall not compromise HSSE standards.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>Although it looks challenging, we are looking forward to the coming year. KOC is working to increase its capacity beyond its midterm target of a production capacity of 3,150MBOPD. The production of non-associated gas is expected to reach approximately 500 million standard cubic feet per day (SCFD). These milestones will be achieved with the commissioning of three Jurassic production facilities and one heavy oil production unit.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the state of Nigeria's aviation sector today?</h4><p>Though Nigeria's aviation sector is still young, it is promising, and it has potential for growth. It has space to accommodate investors, entrepreneurs, and thinkers. It is an industry that has experienced transformation when compared to other modes of transportation. Aviation is benefiting from the public and private sectors through PPP arrangements to develop the sector. Nigerian aviation has seen some modest investment by the government in terms of infrastructure, the capacity of its people, and the general economics of the sector itself. However, this is not enough to bring out the best of the sector. When we partner with the private sector, we will be able to create business models that further expand the sector and make it worthy of investment.</p><h4>What do you think is the potential for private involvement in airport renovations and ownership, and where do you see Nigeria's airports in the near future?</h4><p>There has been modest investment by the government in the development of the sector. In terms of airport terminal buildings, Nigeria had to source some funding through import-export bank loans to build or rebuild terminals at four of our airports. Entrepreneurs will find that there is huge potential for investment, especially in general aviation infrastructure, including terminal buildings, runways, communication and navigation equipment, and security systems. The entire sector is greenfield, waiting for suitable investors to come in. It is important for interested investors to act now because the doors will be closed once we have all of the investors that we can find.</p><h4>Airfares in Nigeria are high compared to other emerging markets. From a regulatory and policy perspective, how might airfares fall?</h4><p>The first and most important step is to create competition, which is the whole idea behind the national airline we are about to set up. This way we can leverage all the bilateral and multilateral agreements between us and other nations that are bringing in their planes. Emirates flies to Nigeria 21 times per week, and British Airways has a similar number of flights. If we create an entity that has the capacity to leverage those 21 flights and offers a better service, then that will force those airlines to bring down their fares. The second factor is that we are trying to get the government to either fund or allow the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to find investors to refine jet fuel here to help bring down costs. Jet fuel accounts for about 40% of the operating costs of an airplane, and when its cost goes up, so do ticket prices. Furthermore, the more an airline does business with Nigeria and increases traffic on a certain route, the more passengers they have and the more that airline can afford to bring down the cost of tickets.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the national airline and toward what time frame are you working?</h4><p>The time frame is uncertain because it is dependent on a number of factors. This includes how quickly we are able to form partnerships and agree on the terms and conditions for potential investors. The ambition is to create an airline through private participation in Nigeria that is able to take advantage of the vacuum that exists due to the absence of a national carrier. That national airline could become a source not only of revenue and pride, but also for developing the wider pool of aviators in Nigeria. When Nigeria Airways existed, nearly 80% of aviators here were developed by it. Some were initially trained, while others were trained further or retrained by Nigeria Airways. One of our ambitions is to see over time that our new airline similarly contributes to building local skills capacity. We can look at the case study of Ethiopian Airlines, which is owned 100% by the government, but operates with no government interference into its management. That airline has now developed the capacity for engineering, flying, support services, and so forth. It has reached the point where it was viable to create its own maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) center, which is sustained by Ethiopian Airlines' operations. They then sell the excess capacity to other airlines to leverage them to come in and partner in the country. Our ambition is to create an airline that can bring Nigeria that same level of MRO business first. If we have excess capacity to sell, Nigeria is positioned well to attract client airlines in. Nigeria is a shorter distance for airlines to bring their aircraft for MRO compared to taking them to Ethiopia, Europe, or the US. Our goals in creating a national airline are therefore to create more MRO business, more capacity building, take advantage of routes and the voluntary air services agreement, bring in revenue, and fly our flags all over the world.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We hope to achieve the infrastructure development of the airport runways, aprons, and terminal buildings, followed by the communication and navigational capacity and facilities and subsequently by the security infrastructure. I would like to have at least four of those airports commercially and economically viable within the next year; they should be doing business and yielding results. Within the next 12 months, we will have gone far in concessioning those airports to investors. We also want to look at whether we can concession the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), either wholly or at least for some capacity. The details of that have not been examined, but it is a definite possibility. We want to take our Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT) and invest in human resources development by making it a center of excellence for training, initially up to about mid-level training for aviation personnel. Within 12 months, we want to kickstart the establishment of an aviation university, perhaps in Abuja. These are a few of the things in our vision. We need to of course ensure over the next 12 months that we have a new Civil Aviation Act that is proactive and in tandem with international best practice. This would remove regulatory aspects from operators and service providers to allow these matters to be wholly under the purview of the Civil Aviation Authority. Finally, we want to increase the scores we have from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). We scored a 92.6% on our last evaluation, and it is our goal to ensure that within the next 12 months we score a full 100%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since the establishment of Al Sulaiti Law Firm in 2002, what developments allowed you to become a major player in the local market?</h4><p>Since its initiation, Al Sulaiti Law Firm has always had the intention of becoming one of the leading law firms in Qatar. Hard work, patience, and dedication to the field of law are essential attributes of our success. Throughout these years, many important factors contributed to the development of the law firm, and one of these was finding the right team with enthusiasm, commitment, and passion for the field. Our firm includes lawyers from five countries, including Egypt, France, Italy, and the US. Our educational and experiential diversity allows us to quickly bridge the gap between our clients' legal traditions and the rules and procedures of Qatar. Moreover, we are able to work comfortably with contracts governed by foreign law. The cultural aspect of our diversity is distinctly important. Our foreign clients often arrive in Qatar with a time-is-money mentality. They are often best served by, and most comfortable working with, a lawyer who shares their predisposition. Upgrading the tools we use to execute the job and improving on internal organization systems and programs used by other leading law firms also enables us to deliver the best services to our clients. At the end of every term we come together as one team and critically analyze our development strategies, which is essential to our improvement process. Working as a team makes this process easier as we are able to assess different methods, new ideas, and approaches. By doing this we can overcome new challenges and tackle them as a team.</p><h4>How can you make a comparison between the current strategy of Al Sulaiti Law Firm and the one applied upon establishment?</h4><p>Since the establishment of the law firm in 2002, we have aimed to continuously upgrade the levels of services introduced to our clients by making regular developments internally. The area of law is a very sensitive one, which requires a lot of hard work, time, and effort. In law there is no standard application for all of the cases we are presented with. There are a lot of factors that differentiate each process. Each case needs a certain amount of time, effort, and a high-end level of accuracy and dedication. In every process there are advantages and problems that are labeled as disadvantages. Highlighting these disadvantages and tackling them is a challenge and involves a systematic process which requires attention and a solid improvement structure. Law firms in private practice that wish to expand their presence in the GCC, whether national or international, must develop a distinguished strategy and start branding with an inimitable distinctiveness that grows progressively from within the firm. Success is generated through incorporating an effective plan into practice. When introducing your firm to the market you have to build a presence, create a brand, and inform those who may be potential clients about what you do and how you stand out from all of the other firms.</p><h4>What is Al Sulaiti's approach to maintaining stronger relations with clients?</h4><p>Understanding your clients' needs and making them your own is a major part of our lawyer-client relationship. Each case is dealt with in a detailed manner and with delicacy, and making the case our own is an essential attribute for pleasing clients. Communication is the core of a strong lawyer-client relationship. It enables the lawyer to understand the client's business, which is the key to our success. Being involved in the business as if you are a member of the team enables us to deliver the best legal services. Exceeding client expectations by over-delivering to impress your clients is a strategy that works better than over promising and not fulfilling a client's needs. Presenting your clients with the best services brings back more clients.</p><h4>How do you assess the importance of being the first Qatari Law firm to pledge to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)?</h4><p>All organizations around the world are accountable for running a responsible and sustainable business for the benefit of people, community, and the world as a whole. A law firm is a legal service provider, and to provide the best services, we must have a clear understanding of client needs, of the community we live in, and of our pledge to and respect for the law. In the same way that the law and our community have been a great benefits to us, we must give back to these core pillars of society by making it our responsibility to be more involved in the promotion of worthy change through our corporate responsibility policy. Our corporate responsibility not only includes the UNGC's ten principles, but also upholds our devotion to making the Qatar National Vision 2030 possible. With Qatar being an ever-evolving landscape, we pride ourselves on being involved and watching all that was just a plan become a reality. The honorable state has been through remarkable positive changes and development. Our vision makes it our responsibility not only as a business, but also empowers us to be a responsible business that gives back to the community, education, and the environment.</p><h4>What are your aspirations for Qatar in 2017?</h4><p>2017 is another year to work toward the Qatar National Vision 2030, and Al Sulaiti Law Firm is proud to support it. We have our role in this vision by supporting investment institutions and companies through providing them the best legal services and taking our corporate responsibility initiative seriously, through supporting the environmental, educational, and humanitarian aspects of the vision. In this regard, we are asserting our sincere gratitude to His Highness Prince Tamim bin Hamad al Thani who said during the Shura Council opening session that “Qatar deserves the best,“ making our aspiration for 2017 to continue striving and working hard to achieve our 2030 goals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was KidZania founded?</h4><p>I was working within the venture capital division at General Electric when a colleague of mine who had the idea of setting up a chain of day-care centers that entertained kids with roleplaying games and real life situations was in search of financing. In the beginning I left the idea aside, but as time passed and we started talking in more detail about it the idea evolved from the day-care center project to what KidZania is today. In addition, we have to keep in mind that Mexico is a rather young country, and families lack the entertainment spaces that many developed countries have for their kids. KidZania was also born to respond to the needs of the market: quality entertainment and education for kids.</p><h4>How has KidZania evolved since its establishment?</h4><p>KidZania is an educational and entertainment center. We believe that the combination of these two elements strengthen the learning process for kids. We have established ourselves in three shopping malls across Mexico, and we build small cities in which kids can have fun and learn how the real world works in several spheres, such as health, banking, theaters, and supermarkets, for example. There are around 60 different establishments in each city, and we invite private companies to be represented in the city—Toyota, Coca-Cola, American Airlines, Walmart, and Telmex are here to name a few. They are all multinational companies, both local and foreign, and they all very much value the chance to build close ties with the future generations of our society. In parallel, we also have collaboration agreements with public organizations because we believe it is very important to show the most realistic image of our society.</p><h4>What is the company strategy when it comes to foreign markets?</h4><p>We implement the franchise model when operating abroad. In Mexico, we finance and operate our centers, but when going abroad we look for a partner that can provide us with knowledge of the local market. We sign a franchise contract and we give them our content, like software, human resources training, and image, and then they pay us a percentage of the profits. For example, in South Korea we operate alongside the largest private TV channel in the country.  Right now, we have 16 KidZania centers: three in Mexico, two in Japan, and one in South Korea, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Kuwait, Turkey, Egypt, Dubai, Portugal, and Chile. In the next few years, we will open nine more: another one in Korea and India, and we will open our first centers in Singapore, the Philippines, Russia, the UK, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil. We are also about to sign a contract to enter France, Germany, Italy, Canada, China, and the US, which is largest market in the world in terms of entertainment.</p><h4>What is the social impact of such an impressive presence in the world?</h4><p>By the end of 2013, we were employing more than 8,000 people around the world. Taking into consideration our growth plans, we will certainly increase this figure very soon. Our main goal in this context is to create values among our staff while providing opportunities to everyone in the community; we employ senior workers, as well as disabled people. We believe in providing opportunities to everybody regardless of their background or condition. We promote the social inclusion of many different social groups and communities that sometimes have difficulties accessing the labor market. In addition, we should not forget the main role KidZania plays with the kids. We educate them and generate values through entertainment. At the same time, we also believe in our role as transmitter of these values to the multinationals we work with across the globe. I would also like to highlight the importance of having such agreements with large corporations, because it provides us with valuable and unique content in our efforts to make our cities as real as possible. It allows us to educate kids throughout their childhood until they become adults with values.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing Mexico in its development process?</h4><p>Mexico has one medium- to long-term challenge, and that is education. Through education, the country will be able to tackle other problems, such as poverty and violence. Mexico is doing great when addressing issues in sectors such as energy. However, actions in these sectors have short-term results, whereas education shows results over a longer period.</p><h4>Since KidZania has its origins in entrepreneurship, what role do you think this, along with SMEs, play in the further development of Mexico?</h4><p>Nowadays, SMEs represent around 80% of Mexico's GDP. However, I think Mexico still lacks entrepreneurship. However, in the last few years we have seen more people making their business ideas become a reality, I think that the country has only recently started to promote entrepreneurship. In this context, I also see a lack of long-term vision and ambition among many entrepreneurs in Mexico. Many companies prefer to stay within their familiar space rather than becoming larger chains. Also, Mexican businessmen should be more ambitious and think outside the box when they decide to export or expand operations abroad, because they tend to opt for countries within the comfort zone. For example, we are the only Mexican company in Kuwait and in many other countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.</p><h4>What advice would you give to Mexican entrepreneurs?</h4><p>When I started with KidZania, I received many negative answers from companies in the pursuit of funding to make this dream come true. However, we were very persistent and despite the economic situation of Mexico at that time, at the end of the 1990s, we pushed the idea forward thanks to our savings and agreements with private companies. They provided us with funding, too. At that time, the sponsorship deals that we offered brands were very innovative and it succeeded. I would say that the key to success is the passion and persistence of a team of the best professionals, a readiness to listen and look for advice, and having a long-term vision.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of KidZania?</h4><p>We have a strong focus on doing things better and better every time—quality wise. We know of the importance of the brand, and we are in the process of improving our product from the education, entertainment, and security points of view. This also means providing excellent services and this is only possible thanks to our human workforce—we provide them with all the training opportunities they need to grow as professionals within our organization.</p><h4>What are some of the main projects you have for KidZania?</h4><p>We are about to launch a line of interactive and educational toys. I see that as the opportunity to grow with a line of merchandising in the near future. We want to boost online interaction with kids. I also want to create media content for kids within the next few years. Overall, I see many areas in which KidZania can grow and expand its business activity. Finally, we have very ambitious plans to continue growing in foreign markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Zayed University's milestones over the past year, and what are the major changes that the university has undergone?</h4><p>The most important measure of any higher education institute is quality, and we achieve that through the accreditation process that we have in place for all of our programs. This is one of our first priorities as the youngest federal university, having been established in 1998. Zayed University has completed the process of international accreditation and recognition from US-based bodies for the majority of its academic programs. This process started in 2008 with the institutional accreditation by the Middle State Commission for Higher Education (MSCHE), one of the regional accreditation boards in the US. Then the process of program-based accreditation started with our College of Business programs obtaining AACSB accreditation in 2012. The College of Education programs achieved NCATE accreditation the same year and was the first college to achieve that outside of the US. Thereafter, two of our college of IT programs completed the ABET accreditation in 2014, and our College of Arts and Creative Enterprises obtained substantial equivalency from the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD) in 2015. The College of Communications obtained accreditation with ACEJMC, the accrediting body for colleges of communication and mass media in the US in 2015. At the national level, Zayed University is completing the accreditation process with the Commission for Academic Accreditation (CAA), the national accreditor of all higher education institutes in the UAE. CAA Institutional accreditation was obtained in 2015, and by end of 2017 we expect to have all our programs accredited having completed all the site visits in 2016. Part of our vision for the future of Zayed University is to reshape the portfolio of our programs into a more comprehensive university with a greater array of majors. Within this outlook, we will develop more STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) majors, to serve the needs of the country. This comprehensive approach will allow Zayed University to develop new majors in the engineering, physical sciences, social sciences, the arts, and others. In the next five years we are also looking to increase the R&amp;D outcomes of the university by 50-100% with more emphasis on R&amp;D that is relevant to the country, and with a continued emphasis on innovation and the development of entrepreneurship skills within both the academic programs and research.</p><h4>The local labor market in the UAE faces a shortage of graduates in certain areas of expertise while it is saturated in others. How is Zayed University addressing this issue? </h4><p>Generally, our programs align well with the job market and in certain areas where we can adjust enrolment to meet job market needs, we will do this by providing new options. The largest area in the job market is business with around 30% of the jobs, and this is matched by the Business College attracting 25-30% of the university's students, mainly in the areas of accounting, finance, human resources, and marketing. The second largest area is engineering and technology with a 25% share of the job market. We are introducing engineering alongside the already existing information technology majors to cater to this segment of the job market. Beyond these two broad areas, other segments such as science, communication, and law occupy anywhere from 4—8% of the job market. To differentiate Zayed University graduates in all disciplines, we are refocusing on what people refer to as “new millennium skills“ in all our programs. People classify these skills differently, but they usually cover critical thinking, interpersonal skills such as communication, ethical conduct, group work, and lifelong learning and knowledge of contemporary issues and latest technologies. Developing and imparting these skills to all graduates and complementing these with the disciplinary skills and knowledge provides our graduates a distinctive place in the job market. We appreciate that the requirements of the job market change over time and the graduates' skills are meant to be reshaped once they enter it, so at Zayed University we try to foster well-qualified individuals with well-rounded contemporary skills that allow them to adapt and acquire new skills relevant to the job requirements.</p><h4>What are some of Zayed University's initiatives regarding entrepreneurial programs and innovation in learning? </h4><p>At Zayed University we have our general entrepreneurship education, which is part of the core program to all students. Apart from that, each discipline has its own approach to entrepreneurship. For example, students in the College of Business are required to develop case studies and create a business plan for their capstone, students in the College of Arts and Creative Enterprises couple their senior design project with a business plan, and so on. As an institution, we have cooperation agreements with a number of incubators and groups outside of campus, because they provide the spaces for entrepreneurs to grow and the mentorship to help them in this endeavor. Furthermore, each Spring, we have a business carnival on campus where around 120 companies mostly owned by alumni exhibit and market their products, while some are owned by current students who study and work. This platform inspires others to become entrepreneurs especially as we also have booths for the regulatory and funding agencies for small and medium enterprises. Our alumni survey shows that around 11% of our graduates work in the private sector, but we are making every effort possible to increase this percentage with support from the community.  </p><h4>Your three-year smart learning project is coming to an end in 2016. How would you assess the outcome of this innovative program?</h4><p>The smart learning project entails taking advantage of all the apps and educational tools across our courses to organize internal workshops and connect people with different approaches and techniques. In total, around half of our faculty members have been engaged actively in this program and the ratio increases with time. As you may know, we have our digital course-hosting environment, which we have been using for over 10 years, and have recently launched a virtual learning website called the Zayed University Virtual Bridge. This site caters to continuous development beyond the classrooms for both our current and future students. Our English foundation program has developed its own learning app, which allows students to improve their English anywhere and learn at their own pace. We also have plans to launch a similar app for the Arabic language. This project has also supported faculty research on better learning pedagogy, on understanding trends in technology applied to education, and has helped change the environment for teaching and learning.</p><h4>What do you envision for the future of Zayed University and what are your main targets?</h4><p>We are aiming to become a more comprehensive university, having all of our programs accredited nationally and internationally, to achieve better research outcomes, and to improve our standing in the international rankings. We see Zayed University becoming a more established academic institution with accreditation and results that can help the wider needs of society, offering research solutions across a range of fields from IT to humanities. We see Zayed University as a contributor to the country's knowledge and to the world's, and most importantly as an academic institution with high-quality academic programs that can develop the future leaders of the country. Many of our students care deeply for their society and the environment, and they excel in projects involving leadership and a volunteering spirit. We are confident and hopeful on their future role in transforming our nation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were your biggest achievements in 2016?</h4><p>2016 was an excellent year for Panama's continued regional leadership as the principal investment destination in the region, resulting in a projected increase of between 15-18% of incoming foreign direct investment (FDI). The country once again received close to half of all FDI in Central America. We managed seven effective missions abroad, resulting in over 800 new potential business contacts and more than 100 real investment prospects, which was well above our target. Beyond that, we attended over 125 additional investors, with on-target responses to their requests for assistance and information. This has resulted in very important investment projects in our country, generating high-quality jobs, knowledge, and technology transfer, and more demand for goods and services from the local economy. For example, 2016 was a record-breaking year for the Multinational Headquarters Regime, Law 41 of 2004, which tallied 24 new multinationals operating from Panama. The previous record year was 21, which was in 2012. The projected incoming FDI stock for 2016 may be above USD6 billion, which corresponds to about 11% of our country's GDP. This has a real impact on sustainable development, and that is how we measure success. 2016 was an important year for Proinvex Panama. We honed our focus on effectively promoting the principal strategic sectors and growth areas of Panama's economy in a more ambitious and effective manner, ramping up the country's investment attraction activities and strategies both locally and abroad. We also worked on delivering the right resources to the right activities. We did a lot of internal work on advancing skills and processes that add value to the broader development goals of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, other state institutions, and, of course to our client: the investor. We focused mainly on ironing out a coherent, relevant, compelling, and most importantly, unique value proposition for foreign investors in Panama. These were some of our broader goals for 2016. Now, in 2017, we are taking everything we learned in 2016 to the next level by becoming a LEAN organization, applying the best management practices for continuous improvement to deliver results that add value to investors and key stakeholders, while boosting our capabilities to pinpoint the key markets for potential inflows of FDI.</p><h4>A stable investment climate is all-important. What actions should Panama take to improve its transparency among the international community of investors?  </h4><p>At Proinvex Panama, we facilitate investments coming into Panama and help integrate new business operations that are productive, and which have a positive impact on our future development goals, and that in turn enhances the competitive advantages that our country offers. Panama has been a competitive destination for FDI and transparency. The country has advantageous special economic regimes, and it is in our country's best interests, and in the best interests of the foreign investor, that the laws are clear and that there is confidence in the rule of law. Transparency is of paramount importance for guaranteeing an attractive and sustainable business climate, as this is one of the main factors that companies consider when investing abroad. Panama is an important player in international trade and a major global commercial hub. Therefore, the very important steps that our government has undertaken to further advance the roadmap toward international cooperation in transparency matters and good governance will enable Panama to remain competitive in the global arena, and will ensure that we are bringing the right kind of investment to the country, mainly investment that generates jobs, broadens opportunities, attracts talent from all corners of the world, and closes the inequality gap for future generations.</p><h4>The big multinationals investing in Panama are mainly from the US, Venezuela, Mexico, Spain, Luxemburg, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Which of these has the potential to turn into a strategic ally? </h4><p>Beyond the US and several markets in Europe that have historically important investments in Panama and our key partners in Central and Latin America, we should see substantial investment inflows from South America, particularly Peru, Chile, and hopefully Colombia, Ecuador, and Brazil. Panama is a natural place for the exportation of services and the establishment of transnational operations to service not just the region but global markets. We are also a natural distribution and value-added logistics hub for capturing logistics corridors and trade routes. The newly-expanded Panama Canal, linked with our multi-modal platform is certainly a major factor in our unique value proposition. This is how Panama is cementing its position not only as a key transnational transshipment hub but also as a value-added center for international trade, both for goods as well as services. I don't believe any other country in our region has this particular strategy because they don't have the broad-reaching connectivity that we do, which is among the best in the world. Geographically, Panama is blessed. We are the only country on the planet, that has one terminal that connects to two oceans. Connectivity is the name of the game and we are playing to our strengths. Each and every one of the countries mentioned is already a strategic ally for the simple reason that Panama's platform works to their benefit, providing market access for cheaper goods, more efficient value chains, and an ideal location for services that have a transnational reach.</p><h4>Panama attracts half of all FDI in the region. What sectors of the national economy are considered particularly appealing to international investors?</h4><p>Our national strategic plan highlights four main growth sectors, which are logistics, regional services, tourism, and energy, as well as opportunities in other pillars of the economy, like infrastructure development, maritime services, agroindustry, real estate, and more. We have seen exponential growth in headquarters and shared services delivery centers. The Multinational Headquarters Regime now has 130 multinationals, generating close to 9,000 jobs. We hope to see growth both in new investments in that particular sub-sector of the economy as well as re-investments and growth from existing operations. We should see substantial investments in distribution activities such as value-added activities to cargo for re-distribution. Third party logistics services from Panama are capturing economies of scale as a result of the expanded Panama Canal, and the world-class maritime and air infrastructure in the interoceanic region, which are ranked as the 6th and 5th best in the world, according to the World Economic Forum. This competitive multi-modal hub helps companies generate efficiencies in international supply chains. We consider Panama as a natural place for this and are expecting continued growth. Future development in a cargo hub adjacent to the Panama Canal and a new free trade zone in Tocumen International Airport, as well as new roadways and corridors to better connect the interior of the country to the exportation nodes will also contribute to this. The other sector where we should see growth in Panama is in energy, as the National Energy Plan for 2050 will be a catalyst for transformation of the energy matrix to one that is based on over 70% on renewable and alternative sources. Modern infrastructure and sustainable energy projects, with a focus on wind and solar generation, are not only generating new jobs and investments, they are also making Panama's business environment more attractive and competitive. This also includes potential future investments in LNG power plants that will both supply the local market but also create a hub for distribution of this particular type of energy source.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the performance of the existing free trade area and economic zones as platforms for attracting foreign investment? </h4><p>Panama has a unique advantage in that the investment regimes it offers are designed, developed, and tailored as solutions to particular economic activities. Proinvex Panama and the government at large can continue to generate new investments by focusing on the particular strengths of our investment regimes and playing to our attractiveness factors. In the Panama Pací­fico Special Economic Area, we hope to see further investments in advanced manufacturing and third-party logistics operations, as well as value-added multi-modal logistics activities. Investments in headquarters, shared service activities, and high added-value services are a growth area in Panama Pací­fico that will bring the most sophisticated business processes to our country, and create a multicultural community that fosters creativity, growth, and value. We hope to see the further development of new free trade zones based on the advantages that Law 32 offers to private developers and investors, mainly in logistics, distribution, processing, and exportation activities. We are making a concerted effort to channel investors to our catalog free trade zones, as they provide advantageous solutions to their business needs. The Colón Free Trade Zone, the second-largest free trade zone in the world and a pillar of our national economy, is a competitive distribution center for serving Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andean pact region, with well over 3,000 companies. Working with the administration as well as the association of the users of the free trade zone, we are developing strategies to penetrate new markets for the redistribution of goods and new value-added activities from multinationals like Payless Shoes, Hewlett-Packard, Diageo, Adidas, Huawei, GSK, Bayer, and nearly every major pharmaceutical firm, either through captive activities or through third-party service providers. The City of Knowledge continues to be a bastion of cultural exchange, academic endeavors, pioneering research, and development activities. We expect this sustainable city to grow in 2017 and further contribute to making Panama an effervescent environment for new ideas, entrepreneurship, investigation, and human development.</p><h4>What are your main goals and ambitions for 2017?</h4><p>The main ambition is to continue the rhythm of growth in investment attraction. There was nearly 17% growth between 2015 and 2016, a milestone that was replicated last year. We are integrating our promotion and attraction efforts with other key government agencies, academia, and private-sector stakeholders to foster the growth our country needs to meet our strategic development plans. If Panama sustains the rhythm of year-on-year FDI growth until 2025, we could experience a transcendental transformation, as our economy shifts from one that functions on the basis of services, to one that is based on innovation. I firmly believe this is one of many paths that will contribute to securing a brighter future for all Panamanians.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does RSM fit into the Omani market and how do you assess the evolution of your operations since its establishment?</h4><p>
	George Mathew &amp; Co has been operating as a chartered accountants firm in Oman since 1988 and presently changed its legal status to George Mathew LLC and is a member firm of RSM international, the 6th largest global audit, tax, and consulting network, operating in 120 countries, from over 790 offices and a combined staff of over 41,400. With RSM International being a global network, we at RSM in Oman adopt all the RSM methodologies and techniques for auditing and other professional services. George Mathew &amp; Co has been associated with international networks from the inception of the firm in Oman, including with Spicer &amp; Oppenheim, Arthur Young, and MSI. With effect from January 2011, George Mathew &amp; Co became a correspondent firm of RSM and as of May 2014 has become a full member firm of RSM International in the Sultanate of Oman.
</p><h4>How do you distinguish yourselves in such a competitive audit firm market and what type of clients are you targeting?</h4><p>
	George Mathew LLC's adoption of the RSM global standards, availability of expert consultants from the network worldwide, and personal attention by our senior professionals to the clients' needs are our distinct advantages. We are one of the few audit firms in Oman accredited by the Capital Market Authority of Oman, which entitles our firm to act as a statutory auditor of public joint stock companies, investment funds, licensed companies operating in the securities market, and insurance companies registered in Sultanate of Oman. George Mathew LLC, with local and international expertise, targets the provision of services to entities in all major sectors, whether private or public, domestic, or foreign.
</p><h4>
	Why is Oman considered to be a business-friendly economy, capable of attracting billions of dollars in direct and indirect foreign investment?
</h4><p>
	Oman's economy has seen a steady transformation to a stable economic and financial destination. Oman has a business-friendly environment, a modern business law framework, respect for free markets, contract sanctity and property rights, and relatively low taxes. The government of Oman has steady and ambitious long-term investments in the country's infrastructure, including free zones, seaports, airports, rail, and roads, as well as in its healthcare and educational systems and facilities. Oman actively seeks foreign investment. Oman promotes higher education, manufacturing, healthcare, fisheries, transportation and logistics, mining, renewable energy, and tourism as areas for investment. The Public Authority for Investment Promotion and Export Development (Ithraa), the inward investment and export development agency, is tasked with attracting foreign investors and smoothing the path for business formation and private-sector development. The confidence of investors is reflected in the FDI inflows to Oman, increasing by 11% in 2015 as compared to the previous year. Oman is considered to be one of the ideal destinations for FDI.
</p><h4>
	With your experience in the market, is Oman walking on the right track towards economic diversification with initiatives like the 9th Five-year plan and Tanfeedh?
</h4><p>
	The key goals of the 9th Five Year Plan are to achieve an average annual GDP growth rate of 3%, create job opportunities, encourage SMEs and activate public private partnerships (PPPs). The 9th Five Year Plan (2016-2020) maintains focus on economic diversification, welfare, and the enhancement of social benefits, and at the same time drives to boost the private sector. To support this view, certain prime sectors have been identified: manufacturing, transportation, logistics, tourism, fisheries, and mining. These sectors represent untapped potential and the country's determination to diversify its economy. The National Programme for Enhancing Economic Diversification (Tanfeedh) is a working mechanism to achieve the goals of the 9th five-year plan, and overcoming the obstacles, if any, facing economic diversification. The Tanfeedh programme is an excellent opportunity to develop national talent and expertise, and to optimally utilize natural resources available in Oman. These initiatives are leading Oman to diversification, growth, employment generation, and a reduction of dependence on oil.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the significance of your partnership with Chevron and Petrobras?</h4><p>This partnership is not only beneficial to the partners, but also to the country as a whole. Our current production capacity is 250,000bpd but our production averaged around 242,000bpd in 2016. Producing 250,000bpd is significant to the economy, as it has increased the government's revenue from oil sales. This current government has just presented an oil production estimate of 2.2 billion barrels for its 2017 budget. Petrobras has always been known to be a giant in deep water experience and as at the time Agbami was to be developed, Famfa and Chevron needed such a partner, and the outcome of this kind of partnership is stellar performance in terms of production. On a larger scale, local content has benefited the most from this partnership as indigenous companies were allowed to bid for some segments of the project thereby building their capacities in these areas. The partnership has also helped nationals in bridging the technology gap in the deep offshore terrain as well as exposed them to the management of deep offshore exploration, development and operations.</p><h4>The low oil prices are a general concern. Instead of seeing it as a drawback, how can investors take advantage of these situations?</h4><p>Such periods are generally characterized by low earnings for most companies; therefore, we are all in the same boat. However, low oil prices have actually presented investors with the opportunity to acquire oil blocks at a lower price than what was obtained during the oil price boom. We have also reviewed our process to make it more efficient, thereby reducing production cost without compromising on safety and quality.</p><h4>How would you describe the importance of the oil and gas sector in terms of job generation in Nigeria, and what role does Famfa Oil play in supporting the local content development strategy of the federal government?</h4><p>The oil industry is a vital industry in Nigeria. It has created opportunities for Nigerian entrepreneurs, which in turn serve as employers of labor to a great number of Nigerians. The industry alone creates over 65,000 direct jobs in Nigeria and more than 250,000 jobs in non-direct employment. Famfa is a fully indigenous company with 100% Nigerian workforce and over the years has built capacity in its workforce through both local and international training that have empowered them to jointly manage and operate a world class floating, production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) facility. Famfa with its Agbami partners are strongly supportive of local content development through the training and development of local manpower. We ensure compliance with all the relevant local content guidelines in support of the government's policy.</p><h4>The government is working on a new petroleum regulatory framework. How do you expect this legislation to influence the future of the sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>The regulatory framework is expected to drive investment in the oil and gas value chain. It should promote the development of local content and create a conducive business environment for all stakeholders. The government must ensure it does that and not the opposite. We hope for the best fiscal policies when the legislation is eventually passed.</p><h4>How significant is the role of the banking industry in supporting the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>Banks have been supportive of oil and gas through reserve-based lending (RBL) for the upstream sectors and asset-based lending (ABL) for the downstream sector. However, our local banks do not have the huge financial resource/capacity needed to adequately fund oil and gas operations, especially deep, offshore field development. The low oil price and high exchange rate have negatively impacted the ability of a number of operators to repay their loans, which have turned out to be too much of a burden for the local banks, which are now struggling.</p><h4>Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer but still suffers from refined fuel scarcity. As an expert in the industry, what is your opinion on this?</h4><p>The previous scarcity was due to the non-liberalization of the downstream sector, which has now been addressed by the current government. The low production capacity of our existing refineries is also part of the problem. Hopefully, with the imminent launch of the Dangote refinery and others in the future, coupled with federal government efforts in attracting investors to refine locally, the scarcity will be a thing of the past.</p><h4>As the role model that you are, what do you think should be done to empower and unleash the potential of girls and women in Nigeria?</h4><p>Research has shown that contrary to age-old beliefs here, the mental capability of a girl is in no way inferior to that of a boy. If exposed to the same instruction and care, they can both achieve similar feats. Girls should be allowed to dream and be supported to achieve their goals. They should be encouraged to break frontiers and make a difference. They should be allowed to choose their professions freely and allowed to pursue a career to the very limits of their chosen field. The leadership potential of girls can be developed via the provision of adequate and impactful leadership training programs, especially for those that are in highly discriminatory environments. Finally, women already in leadership positions must create forums for younger and aspiring females and demonstrate how they have been able to navigate and succeed in their chosen fields of endeavor.</p><h4>In addition to being a businesswoman and designer, you are also a philanthropist. Which nonprofit initiatives are you most passionate about?</h4><p>I was inspired to set up the Rose of Sharon Foundation in 2008 and our vision is to alleviate the plight of widows and orphans. We accomplish this through programs that give financial independence and educational opportunities to widows, their children, and orphans. Our desire is to reach out and touch as many widows and orphans as we can in order to make the world a better place for them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over the past several years your assets under management have increased significantly. How has SEDCO Capital changed in the past 2-3 years?</h4><p>The past two to three years have been interesting. From 2015-16 we have been focused on Saudi Arabian real estate and have been able to conclude decent investments, mainly in defensive income-generating real estate. They end up making about 7% in net returns annually, and as such are a solid products with good yields. This is one way our clients are able to diversify. In the future we see that this will be a promising line of business as well. New regulations within the Capital Market Authority (CMA) will encourage and induce more investments into income-generating Saudi real estate through the real estate investment trusts (REITS) that it has just been announced. This will be an area of great interest to the real estate industry and to investors because you are giving them diversification and access, especially for medium and smaller-sized investors. This will continue to be a very interesting area for us from that angle. We have also participated in build-to-suit real estate opportunities that have been successful. We are continuing to grow our international real estate capability and have concluded transactions in local and international real estate in excess of SAR4.5 billion over the past four years. To help with that, we opened a real estate advisory office in London in 2016 that is focused on international real estate, although the bulk of our international real estate team remains in Jeddah. One of the interesting transactions that we have done in real estate was a build-to-suit school in the US for one of the leading international schools. That school was just completed and 800 students are already enrolled in it. In 2017 the Saudi listed equity market will again be promising for a few reasons. First is the fact that we are hoping that MSCI inclusion of the Tadawul should happen late 2017 or early 2018. We have seen the capital market authority and Tadawul taking all the necessary steps to facilitate the entry of foreign investors by easing the requirement for qualification and changing the settlement period to align it with international norms. Once that happens, we will expect to see sizable international AUMs into the Saudi equity market. Attracting international sophisticated clients into the Saudi market is a very important strategy for us. Our Luxemburg platform has seen growth in assets under management through our distribution arrangements, with large international banks that have sharia-compliant investors or other types of investors who have invested into our funds on that platform. In private equity, we have invested in five different transactions around the world during 2016, and these range from dialysis centers in India to technology in the US and car components in Korea.</p><h4>What would you have to say about the initial regulations? Were they done the right way?</h4><p>I fully agree with the acting chairman of the CMA. It has to be done gradually. We have to start somewhere and I have always said that it would be a nice test of the systems to see how comfortable international investors are with the settlement processes. You will only start seeing serious money come in once you are included in the MSCI index; if not it is going to take much longer. Nobody said once they open the market money is going to flow. We will see serious money once we are included for two reasons: the first is that current market prices are at acceptable valuations and that should encourage money to flow into Tadawul. A lot of that money that will come in is through asset managers or directly through institutional investors. These types of investors have clear allocations to emerging markets and that should drive 3-4% of trade allocations to the Saudi market.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for the next year?</h4><p>We are considering listing our own REITs. This may happen in 1Q2017. We are positioning ourselves to encourage and attract international funds into the local equity market. These are the two major areas while we continue in our growth of the international real estate and private equity portfolios. It will be a busy year. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that we are the pioneers in prudent ethical investing that has been growing globally at a rapid pace. You hear different numbers, but definitely north of USD20 trillion is being invested in an ethical and responsible fashion. Sharia investing is ethical by nature, and we have actually bridged the two industries through prudent ethical investing (PEI). We pioneered this framework and became signatories to the UN principles of responsible investing in 2013. Now, we are seeing that there has been a lot of excitement about the prudent angle that we are bringing to the table. By prudent, we mean the avoidance of excessive leverage, and not investing in structures that are not transparent. We invest in transparent structures that have clear cash-flows and clear assets. With that we are able to produce meaningful profits and gains for our clients. Some of the most significant institutional investors take this approach very seriously. It is worth noting that we have attracted non-sharia investors that are quite conventional but like our performance and the PEI investing methodology. Here you really create jobs, and create business that will be sustainable and result in consistent profits. We are at the corner of sharia compliant and responsible investing, and we are a pioneer in bridging both.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of the banking and financial sector in Panama? </h4><p>It was a challenging year for Panama in 2016. First we had the “Panama Papers," and later we had the Waked Group situation. Panama just got off the GAFI grey list. We were in a great position to recover everything that had to do with our legislature in terms of money laundering and counter-terrorism. We need to continue to work with our international partners to protect the integrity of the Panamanian system. Panama has taken many steps to promote transparency, fairness, and compliance with the standards set by GAFI and the OECD. That is where the country made the biggest improvement this year. Then, the Waked crisis came and had a negative impact on the country's image. When something like this happens, it threatens the stability of the system. Fortunately, we were able to come up with a solution working in accordance with our partners in the US. The banking system in Panama is continuing to grow while. Local banks had to establish stronger reserves in order to comply with current regulations from the Superintendency of Banks. That has forced financial institutions to be more responsible and prudent. We have no Central Bank here and do not have a discount window, which makes our banks very conservative in the way they conduct business.</p><h4>BNP investment in the Agrosector exceeds USD500 million. What is the potential of this segment, and how are you fostering its growth?</h4><p>We have a particular commitment to the agricultural sector and need to achieve sovereignty with regard to the production of our own food. Panama has the potential to produce its own resources for its people. We need to show the agricultural sector that they can use the land if they get the conditions they need. We have the money to do it, and the bank has put over USD500 million into the sector. What we would like to do in 2017 is study every potential agricultural product that can be produced in Panama. We are achieving a separate policy for each product and identifying the conditions that need to be met in order to finance the production of a particular product and then offer that to potential clients and investors. This is the way to take the primary sector and put it on a different level. We have been portraying Panama as a service-based country, but we do not want to forget about the primary sector.</p><h4>How are you applying innovation to your daily operations?</h4><p>We are working right now on getting the first electronic wallet in Panama. The average here is 2.2 cellphones per person. Cellular coverage is almost 100%. We have areas in which people do not have access to financial services like an ATM or bank branch, but they have a cell phone. This has been a solution that has been successful in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. We want to bring it here as well, first by integrating people who do not have a bank account and promoting economic activity between them. The way to create something out of this is to enhance business among those groups of people, and the electronic wallet is a useful resource for doing that.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the bank's CSR policy? </h4><p>Inclusion and integration are part of our DNA. We need to share the wealth. This country is a prosperous country in the service sector, but we need to share the wealth better with our people, which means integrating people into the system. In order to promote and help other financial institutions focus on inclusion, we want to foster SMEs. There is a large portion of the economy that is very informal, and these people have the potential to become better entrepreneurs. I have seen that in other countries in Latin America. We have the technology and connectivity, but need to train people to use resources and have a clearer view of what they are doing to manage their finances and promote their own businesses. That is the level of integration we aim for and want to be part of.</p><h4>What are your main targets for 2017?</h4><p>The promotion of the electronic wallet is one of our main targets. We also need to cover areas of the country that still have no access to financial services. We have promoted a new set of branches for the bank all over the country, not only to provide services but also to identify potential economic areas that need the presence of a bank, the government, and private institutions to create an ecosystem. The bank will be the first stone on which this is built. We have 30 different projects. This includes new branches, the remodeling of current branches, and the relocation of other offices. We would like to accomplish these goals between now and 2019. We have a chart on which we can identify each day in order to follow up each step. We have spoken with the president about this and he is very interested in this matter. He wants to create these new pockets of economic activity. The third thing we want to achieve is the reformation of an organic law that needs to be in accordance with the new regulations. In early 2017, we are going to the assembly to promote this. We need to achieve it because this bank is growing, and we need more board members on the corporate governance side. We need at least seven members according to current regulation, though currently just have five.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the group's background and in which businesses is it currently most involved?</h4><p>Zahid Group is a privately owned organization, led by an established family whose commercial roots date back over a century. Initially, the group focused on passenger vehicles, followed by construction machinery, which represents a major business for us. Over the years we have continued to grow and today we are active in over ten thriving industries. We are one of the largest distributors of Caterpillar machinery in the world. We then expanded into commercial vehicles through a partnership with Volvo and Renault Trucks. We had a truck assembly plant for almost 20 years south of Jeddah, and just recently opened a new state-of-the-art factory in King Abdullah Economic City to meet the rising demand for quality trucks. This factory is fully automated and air-conditioned, with a capacity to produce 7,000 trucks per year on single shifts. We have well-trained and highly motivated Saudi workers who are capable in various segments of our business from management to the shop floor. Besides equipment, we have a joint venture with Total to produce high quality lubricants. That joint venture was the first tenant of King Abdullah Economic City. Furthermore, Zahid is a key stakeholder in the Budget Rent-a-Car franchise in Saudi Arabia, which is the market leader here. We also established AJIL Financial Services Company in partnership with Riyadh Bank, Mitsubishi Corporation, and other Saudi investors. Today AJIL is a leading provider of lease finance products, specializing in the financing of capital expenditures. Our travel business, Zahid Travel Group, is an internationally recognized agency that offers complete and customized solutions for travelers, families, and businesspersons. We also have a one-stop-shop facilities management company through a joint venture we have with OCS, a leading UK-based company. Zahid Industries, based in Yanbu Industrial City, creates a complete system of Caterpillar generator sets in transportable soundproof containers, which can be safely and easily operated and maintained. We also have a building material factory in Yanbu that produces gypsum in partnership with LafargeHolcim that is the largest cement producer in the world. In addition to our efficient expatriate cadres of employees, Zahid Group is committed to the recruitment, development, and advancement of competent Saudi men, women, and disabled people. The jewel of Zahid Group is our Zahid Learning Institutes, in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam, providing full training for all our people in soft and technical skills. We take young apprentices and put them through rigorous programs ranging from six months to three years. Upon successful completion, they receive a diploma or certificate and a guaranteed job. We feel this is our duty to our country, and it fits in with our national goals to add technical training capacity across the Kingdom.</p><h4>How has the Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Plan changed the group's outlook and the opportunities you are pursuing?</h4><p>First and foremost, we are a Saudi organization and, to a large extent, our focus is on our investments in our country. We do have a few investments abroad; for example, we have expanded our operations with Altaaqa for power rentals by establishing Altaaqa Global, based in Dubai, to serve other countries around the world. Another investment we have made internationally is in Morocco, acquiring a substantial stake in Total's marketing and services affiliate, Total Maroc. We fully subscribe to the vision of our leaders, such as that of the late King Abdullah, which is to create economic cities around the country to bring jobs and prosperity to our citizens. We have been investors in the King Abdullah Economic City from the very beginning, and we continue to increase our investments in this advantageous location, with its close proximity to a modern seaport, advanced high-speed railroad, and convenient road network providing access to the airport and the rest of the Kingdom. All of these forms of transportation allow for more efficient shipment of products. Additionally, close to KAEC there are villages where we can find young Saudi workers whom we can train, develop, and hire for our factories and companies. Vision 2030 provides economic diversity and will eventually reduce our dependence on oil. Through non-oil industries and support for SMEs we strive to create jobs for our future generations. Zahid Group is fully aligned with Vision 2030, and will continue to develop, hone, and improve economic growth and business strategies.</p><h4>Do you see an IPO or other share sales on the cards for any of the group's subsidiaries other than Budget, which is already listed?</h4><p>Not at the moment. We have our core businesses, which is construction machinery, commercial vehicles, and energy and utilities, and some of our companies in these areas are working in partnership with public companies. As our local stock market, overseen by Tadawul, continues to mature and develop, I am sure we will review our investment policies and consider our options very carefully, which may include the decision to go public for any one of our companies.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming 12 months?</h4><p>Now is the time to restructure and refocus on our core competencies and strengthen ourselves in those areas. We are very proud of what Zahid Group has achieved in the past, but there is a lot more we can do. We want to work on developing the skills of our employees and increasing the recruitment of competent nationals even further. The number of our Saudi employees continues to rise, and we are proud that they represent more than one third of our workforce across the various group companies. Equally important is the fact that we are continuing our efforts to increase the number of Saudi female employees in traditional positions in administration, human resources, finance and information technology, and also in technical areas. For example, we have four women in the eastern province who can drive a D9 Caterpillar machine and can answer any complex technical question relating to our construction machinery. We have honored and recognized them in front of their colleagues and the entire company. Additionally, it is important that we do not neglect the hiring of capable persons with disabilities, who have proven their productivity and efficiency in the years they have been with us. Zahid is one of six founders of Qaderoon Business Disability Network, a non-profit employers' organization, which strives to create a conducive work environment and job opportunities for persons with disability. As our country implements our national transformation plan 2020, companies (us included) will face, no doubt, big challenges over the next couple of years, which we will need to overcome through streamlining our operations and increasing our efficiency. As we look to 2017, it will be a year of essential reform, positive change, and creative innovation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the current government working to foster the concept of innovation in the Panamanian economy?</h4><p><strong>JORGE A. MOTTA:</strong> SENACYT is strengthening the National System of Innovation by promoting programs to financially support entrepreneurs and companies that develop business innovation to create or improve a process, service, or product. Furthermore, SENACYT encourages private companies to invest in innovation and technology. Even though the path has been difficult, the effort of the government in this respect has yielded significant results, such as the recognition awarded to innovative companies every year for the last 10 years.</p><p><strong>VICTOR SANCHEZ URRUTIA:</strong> The Department of Business Innovation of SENACYT has worked closely with the National Authority for Government Innovation (AIG), the private sector through the Panamanian Chamber of Technology and local universities, to establish the Panama Digital Hub Strategy, which will strengthen the development of the IT sector in Panama for the next 10 years. The strategy defines the guidelines for creating programs that will make the IT sector of Panama more competitive internationally. The first step is to establish an IT observatory that will help us understand the current state of the IT sector in Panama. The data collected by the IT observatory will be used to elaborate public policies and to develop the market strategies to follow.</p><p><strong>JAM:</strong> In fact, the projects and programs of SENACYT are based on the objectives established in the National Strategic Plan of Science, Technology and Innovation (PENCYT 2015-2019). In the area of innovation, SENACYT launches calls to financially aid projects that are oriented towards business innovation and to provide seed capital for entrepreneurs to start their businesses. Moreover, we are starting to venture into the area of social innovation for the sustainable development of the country.</p><h4>Thanks to a fruitful collaboration between SENACYT and CAF, Panama will soon position itself as the fourth country in Latin America for the number of registered patents. How did this come to be?</h4><p><strong>JAM:</strong> It is a culture-changing initiative. Our society has been oriented towards providing service instead of creating patents. Therefore, we do not have the infrastructure to deal with the patent process. For this reason, SENACYT has collaborated with CAF in an effort to generate more patents.</p><p><strong>VSU:</strong> We already have 230 patent applications thanks to the alliance with CAF. What follows is working on strengthening the patent process so that it becomes easier for innovators to generate more patents. Due to the fact that patents are a viable commercial strategy, this is a priority for the Department of Business Innovation of SENACYT.</p><h4>How are you fostering the growth of the healthcare sector?</h4><p><strong>JAM:</strong> Together with the Ministry of Health, SENACYT gives scholarships to healthcare professionals to continue their studies in the field of medicine. We are also working on activating a simulation center to train local medical doctors. The medical schools have simulation areas but the size and sophistication of the simulation center we are planning to build will set it apart from anything else in the region.</p><p><strong>VSU:</strong> Together with the Institute of Scientific Research and High Technology Services (INDICASAT), SENACYT promotes health research in areas such as diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, malaria and others.</p><h4>How can SENACYT use science to deal with the low penetration of technology and innovation outside of the capital?</h4><p><strong>JAM: </strong>“Infoplazas" are community centers that provide internet access as well as educational training for kids and adults to help close the digital breach in Panama. More than 200 Infoplazas exist all over the nation, including the indigenous regions. Together with the Department of Education of SENACYT, the Infoplazas offer courses to improve digital literacy in Panamanian society. To attract participation, the Infoplazas launch competitions in coding, mathematics, and video-game programming, a strategy which has proven popular among young people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major accomplishments of the ministry since the conclusion of the National Health Strategy 2011-2016?</h4><p>Improving the health of Qatar's population today and in the future is a key element of Qatar's National Strategy 2030, and the first National Health Strategy (NHS) 2011-2016 has provided the building blocks to make this a reality. Working with our main providers in healthcare—Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC), and private clinics—we have started the important shift from treatment to prevention. This first strategy has enabled us to develop plans for tackling some of Qatar's most pressing health problems including cancer, diabetes, and mental health. I am especially proud of the creation of the National Cancer Registry, as well as a national screening program for breast and bowel cancers and the opening and expansion of both primary care and specialist facilities. Another great achievement has been the creation of the Qatar Council of Healthcare Practitioners (QCHP). This body registers and licenses all healthcare practitioners in Qatar and means that patients and the community can be assured we have the best-qualified clinicians working in Qatar. We have also introduced a mandatory continuing professional development (CPD) system. This ensures that our nurses, doctors, and other healthcare professionals are up to date with the latest information and training in their fields.</p><h4>What measures is the ministry taking to increase the number of doctors in Qatar, especially alongside Hamad Medical Corporation's numerous expansions?</h4><p>Qatar's population is rapidly growing and is incredibly diverse. To meet the needs of our evolving nation, we are opening a range of new hospitals across the public health system that will increase the number of beds by 1,100. HMC has begun the largest expansion program in its history. Four new hospitals—the Communicable Disease Center, Women's Wellness and Research Center, Ambulatory Care Center, and Qatar Rehabilitation Institute—will significantly increase capacity across our system and provide state-of-the-art environments in which our expert teams can provide care for their patients. This is being done alongside similar growth in the PHCC, where they are increasing the number of their health centers to 35 in coming years. While we can build bricks and mortar, we need trained clinical and support staff to deliver compassionate care at the highest possible level. As demand for both primary care and specialists services grows, we are always looking to recruit the most qualified and motivated candidates we can from around the world. Throughout the last quarter of 2016, HMC has undertaken a large-scale recruitment drive aimed at recruiting more than 2,000 staff to meet the need for specialized clinical and non-clinical staff. These new staff members will strengthen teams in HMC's existing facilities and fill positions in the new hospitals.</p><h4>How will the health industry of Qatar benefit from launching the first academy for organ donation?</h4><p>For many people a transplant can mean the gift of life, and making the decision to register as a donor is a personal choice. At the heart of our organ donation system is fairness and equity. We have a single, unified waiting list and have led the way in terms of support for donors and their families. In 2015, HMC performed 19 kidney transplants and six liver transplants, a jump from previous years. The number of organ transplants increased tenfold between 2009 and 2015. More than 100,000 potential donors have registered with Qatar's pioneering Organ Donor Registry, marking a major milestone for us. For a small nation, Qatar has had a big impact on the field of organ donation. The academy will promote education and research in organ donation, both in Qatar and internationally. We have called on our own expertise as well as international experts who will provide advice and information for other countries in the field of organ donation. It will also help HMC and Qatar become a Center of Excellence in training and research in cell, organ, and tissue donation. This will ultimately benefit our patients as we will be able to offer them new treatments.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the private sector's involvement in Qatar's healthcare industry, and what role would you like to see the private sector play in the future?</h4><p>As our population continues to grow and its needs change, so too will the need for both us in the public sector to work more collaboratively and closely with our private sector colleagues to deliver the best healthcare possible. HH Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani has acknowledged this and has encouraged us to work together. He said in his address at the opening of the 45th Advisory Council meeting in November 2016 that although healthcare is the responsibility of the state, we must “benefit from an interaction between the private and public sectors." In the future, the private sector will play a fundamental role in helping to reduce pressure on the public sector, for example through the running of hospitals and facilities or providing certain services. For example, Doha-based Qatari German Medical Devices and Qatar Pharma are providing services to our public sector hospitals. Qatari German Medical Devices manufacture and distribute disposable medical equipment, including the Q JectUltra devise, an insulin syringe used in the care of diabetic patients at HMC. And Qatar Pharma operates the first intravenous infusion facility in Qatar and manufactures a number of IV generic and topical drugs that are not only used in Qatar but across the world.</p><h4>How does the ministry create ties with international institutions and other nations to stay up-to-date on relevant advancements in the healthcare industry?</h4><p>The delivery of high quality healthcare requires collaboration. One of the wonderful things about Qatar is that it is a country that is not afraid to draw on international expertise and partnerships to help us create the best. Healthcare is an industry that thrives on the exchange of information and experiences. In order to achieve the ambitious National Health Strategy 2011-2016, the ministry has recognized the need to access international expertise in a number of areas. For example, with the support of colleagues from Canada we have established new licensing and accreditation programs.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the ministry over the next 12 months?</h4><p>I am excited about the new phase of growth and expansion we are embarking on across our healthcare system. HMC is opening three new hospitals before mid-2017 and the PHCC is opening new health centers in the coming months. We will also launch two national strategies: Qatar's first Public Health Strategy and our new National Health Strategy, covering 2017 to 2022. The Public Health Strategy sets a vision for “a comprehensive, dynamic and collaborative health system, working together to improve the health and prosperity of Qatar." The new National Health Strategy will build on the considerable work achieved as part of the NHS 2011-2016. Based on three clear principles—better health, better care, and better value. The next year will also see the launch of Qatar's new health insurance system, through which we have worked hard to ensure faster access to care and more options for all.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Costa Rica within Deloitte's operations in Central America?</h4><p>From our office in Costa Rica, we also serve the Dominican Republic, Panama, and the rest of Central America, as I believe is the case for all of the Big Four. We offer our entire range of service lines here in Costa Rica, and from here we can address needs throughout the region falling into the category of large-scale client needs or strict quality requirements. Costa Rica is a relatively mature market, where the products demanded are continually becoming more sophisticated. We will nevertheless continue offering financial audits as well as tax services; however, the market is demanding more sophisticated offerings, and there are also enormous growth opportunities in Guatemala, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on Deloitte's business surveys in the region?</h4><p>This was a group of interviews given to a representative sample of the leaders of the various private sector industries, and it is an exercise that repeats itself in almost all the countries of Latin America, which are located in a unit inside what is known as LATCO. Our survey, the Barometer of Companies, typically happens two times a year and features both standardized questions that are repeated in all of the editions as well as a series of questions that change with each new edition. In Costa Rica, we have an alliance with El Financiero, whereby the survey is released and later distributed to the rest of the media.  </p><h4>How do you evaluate the market in Costa Rica compared to the rest of the region and what stands out as the main challenge?</h4><p>The vision for the future of Costa Rica is like a cautious optimism that almost borders on pessimism, but the expectations of the companies individually is optimistic. We expect our performance in 2016 will be better than 2015. When a company believes in what it is doing, when it believes in the people working with for it, and when the project is efficiently designed, it has the right to be an optimist. In our case, as a consultancy and a provider of many financial and legal services, macroeconomic complications do not necessarily indicate a shortage of opportunities for us. When the crisis of 2008-2009 affected Costa Rica, we promised not to dismiss anybody. This, together with our commitment to maintaining our competitive compensation policy, helped propel us to our current position as the number-one professional services provider in the country. We face similar conditions in similarly sized markets such as Honduras and Nicaragua. It seems to us that Panama is not going to maintain the growth that it has had to date, though it will obviously remain a key market</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2017?</h4><p>The main thing that we have to do is continue consolidating the company throughout the Central American region. There are also lines of service that we will prioritize; audit will remain our core business, but the exponential growth of consultancy forces us to make important investments in this field. I am particularly fond of one of the directives of the international signature, which is to promote the legal services. We aspire in the short term to become the biggest legal firm in Central America. The year 2020 is an important year within the international firm, and our motto is that we want to focus on the services in which we are absolutely successful. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The chamber comprises almost 300 associates in Costa Rica. Please tell us about the evolution of CCH in CR, and which areas CCH is focusing on to boost the hotel sector?</h4><p>Right now we have more than 280 hotels and represent more than 60% of hotel rooms. If we go by GOP, we represent more than 50% of the tourism industry, which means that the Chamber of Hoteliers is the most important association in terms of GOP representation in the country. The main thrust of our association is to be a counterpart to the ICT, but the good part about the tourism sector in Costa Rica is that even as counterparts, more than 90% of the time we are also part of it. One of the reasons why the tourism industry in Costa Rica has risen to such great heights is because we have come to understand since 1985 the importance of building a strong coalition between the private and public sector. Even though ICT is a part of the public sector, you have to understand and remember that it is headed by a board of directors composed of the minister and six other members proposed by the private sector. Hence, the direction of the ICT is from the private sector, something we understood in the past and have worked well with since.</p><h4>The new Convention Center is expected to bring more than 100,000 business tourists. How do you foresee this area and how is the CCH working in this regard?</h4><p>We have taken an active role in this because the first thing was to convince the government, which meant we had to first convince ICT that the deal was important for the entire MICE sector. They were not aware of the sector, and there was no support whatsoever either from the public or private sector in recent years. Only a few scattered or secretive people were trying to organize events or bring people in. </p><h4>How is the chamber working to resolve impediments to growth such as seasonality?</h4><p>Certainly that is not our biggest concern right now. Costa Rica first positioned itself with having two seasons: the rainy season and the dry season. However, we got this wrong, for we truly only have one season: the green season, so this was a mistake. For example, the rainy season is the best moment to go to the rainforest; it is one of the things we promote the most. We are changing that strategy, or the ICT is changing that strategy. The other way to do so is through the MICE sector, which the ICT is finally doing. This is an especially good opportunity, since MICE activities are counter-seasonal and most meetings and conventions overlap with our low season. This is something we only recently realized. Now, my chamber has been proactive and was probably the one that first took up the flag to convince the ICT to finally embrace MICE tourism. Apart from this, security is another challenge and has probably worsened a little in the past two years, and infrastructure is another challenge that needs to be seriously addressed. We must always remember that the tourism industry takes two or three years to react to broader, structural changes.</p><h4>What are the chamber's goals for 2017?</h4><p>The focus is to continue to convince the government that we should invest in the MICE industry. To do so, we need to finalize the construction of the convention center—not because we need it—but to use it as a tool for making the government understand that MICE is important. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The tourism sector in Costa Rica grew three times faster than the national economy in 2015. What are the main areas the ministry has worked on to maximize this sector's potential?</h4><p>It is fair to say that tourism is Costa Rica's main economic sector and the figures prove this. For example, 27% of the country's workforce is employed in the sector; 29.6% of the country's exports are in tourism and, according to the latest data from the Central Bank, while services represent around 40% of GDP, tourism accounts for 20% of that. We also expect it to grow three or four times faster than the national economy. Moreover, it is extremely diverse, and SMEs represent the great majority of its enterprises. That it is dispersed throughout the country has enabled us to boost investment in all of Costa Rica without favoring one or two areas, bringing investment to regions that otherwise wouldn't have it. At the moment, the average stay is 13 days, a length of time that proves what an array of offerings we have to get people to stay that long.</p><h4>What kind of projects do you have in mind to further realize the potential of the tourism industry in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Costa Rica is well known in two areas: nature and adventure. According to the World Economic Forum's (WEF's) tourism competitiveness study from 2015, Costa Rica is number one in terms of nature among 140 countries and number two in adventure, just behind New Zealand. This proves that we can compete with the world. Our objective is to further consolidate the country's position in these two areas. At the same time, we are also trying to add to this strategy. For example, the Conventions Centre is a nationwide effort to position the country as a leading destination for MICE tourism. We have started to promote Costa Rica in this field at the international level through fairs and tourism events. To be sure, we are trying to boost our potential in this area across the entire country rather than focusing on one or two cities.</p><h4>Which areas still need improvement and what is the Ministry doing to tackle the seasonality challenge?</h4><p>Visitors leave the country overall very satisfied, but we know we can still get better in some areas. Infrastructure is one of these—even historically so—and we need to work closely with other ministries in order to tackle this. Our efforts to move toward MICE tourism are a good example of what we are doing to minimize the impact of seasonality in the industry. Previously, the ICT focused many of its campaigns on the high season—60% of its budget on the high season and 40% on the low. Today, we invest 70% of our budget on promoting the low season and 30% on the high. In this context, we need to work together with the private sector to focus our strategies on a common goal.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's objectives for 2017?</h4><p>The Convention Centre needs to be ready and fully operating. We will also continue attracting new airlines and working closely with the different PR agencies in Europe. These combined efforts should allow us to break the seasonality factor. We are also looking at redefining our strategy for attracting tourism investment in order to get more funds for infrastructure areas like hotels. We also expect to release the results of a pioneer study at the international level to measure the contribution of tourism to a country's development of a country, something that's never before been done. We are calling it the Social Progress Index in tourism. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The university was opened in October 2015 with the goal of becoming one of the top universities in Latin America. How is this process developing, and how has the university evolved in this beginning period?</h4><p>A group of academics and businesspeople started this idea in the middle of 2014. Although Costa Rica has been attracting a lot of FDI, there was a sense that the current academic system was not providing the talent or human capital that we need in order to keep this FDI growing. New companies coming to the country always ask whether Costa Rica will be able to provide enough of the right people if they decide to grow their business in two or three years. The reality is that we do not know, because it is difficult to adapt the public university programs quickly enough to meet evolving business needs, as has been the case in the services industry and the IT sector. We, therefore, felt that there was a gap between what companies need now or in the near future and the offers that we currently have in Costa Rica.</p><h4>Are you creating any partnerships with international institutions?</h4><p>We are trying to maintain our level of adherence to international standards here at Lead University. Part of our plan of action is to attain certification in the US within the next five years so that we may secure agreements with various universities abroad. We have a relationship with INCAE Business School, but nothing else beyond that yet, as at this point we have only been operating for two months. In 2015, we received a delegation from the National University of Singapore (NUS), and we are discussing with them the possibilities for developing some exchange programs.</p><h4>How would you assess the current level of education in Costa Rica and how can potential investors benefit from this? </h4><p>Costa Rica is well known in the region for its high-quality education; having said that, there is a lot of room for improvement. The main challenge for higher education here at the moment is aligning the offerings with demand. Costa Rica has 54 private universities, and the level of quality varies between them. Over the next few years, some universities will solidify their position in the education system, and a lot of others will have trouble remaining in the market. There are media campaigns going on constantly advising students to look carefully for certified programs and check that universities have at least a certain level of minimal infrastructure.</p><h4>What are the main goals you would like to achieve in 2017 at Lead University?</h4><p>We want to consolidate Lead University as a higher education center of excellence. We also want to consolidate our vision to extend our preparation beyond just technical education. We want to provide a holistic education experience that covers technical skills and knowledge, but also other types of competencies. Even if graduates have an excellent background in economics, there will ultimately be problems if they cannot interact well with others. Our third goal for 2017 is to be the type of university that is always innovating with regard to our technical programs; therefore, we are bringing in new programs for data mining, engineering productivity, corporate law, software engineering, and business economics. We are also working in the area of cyber security and want to get into the franchising area as well. We want to be one of the best universities in Central America; we prefer quality than quantity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Universidad de Costa Rica evolved to become one of the country's main institutions?</h4><p>As the largest and oldest university in Costa Rica, Universidad de Costa Rica is the country's main institution of higher learning. The university has had over the last 76 years a major contribution to the development of this country in almost every aspect. Its prestige is the highest of any institution in the country, even more so than that of the executive of the judiciary power or the Catholic Church. A recent survey in Costa Rica reaffirmed this reputation, with our university listed in the first position as the most prestigious institution in the country. That gives us a strong position in the country and makes us influential. It has contributed in a big way to social mobility, the infrastructure of the country, and the health system, as we are one of the main bricks of the health system thanks to our training of the majority of physicians and specialists in all different specializations of medicine. In engineering, we have been the most important university over the decades, training engineers of all kinds. </p><h4>Universidad de Costa Rica offers a wide educational portfolio. Is there any particular discipline in which the university specializes?</h4><p>The University of Costa Rica is a comprehensive institution. We have disciplines consisting of music, agricultural science, food technology, engineering, philosophy, linguistics, and neurosciences; we have almost everything. The areas that stand out most are engineering, specifically civil engineering. We have built this country; we are in a seismically active region, and the University of Costa Rica has developed the seismic code for building. We have had major seismic events like in Chile and Japan, and this country is still standing thanks in large part to our university. Engineering is now moving away from traditional lines of teaching and orientations and toward robotics, mechatronics, and new development fields. In the field of robotics, we are strong, and as a matter of fact next year the world robotic conference is going to take place at our university. In the 1950s and 1960s, Costa Rica became the most efficient country in the world in production of bananas and coffee. We supervise the building of roads, but what we say is not compulsory so the government does not have to adjust to our criteria. We provide technological services to Costa Rican society. These are some of the main aspects of our university. Another important aspect to our institution is biodiversity.</p><h4>With which foreign universities and educational institutions do you collaborate?</h4><p>We have more than 300 different cooperation agreements with many universities around the world, and we currently have three international chairs. These are important to us, as they are one of the main platforms we have to foster international cooperation with other universities. One of these is the chair for Korean and South Asian studies. This was organized and built by myself three years ago, and now we have a strong scientific and academic cooperation with South Korea, which is strong and productive. I recently had a meeting where I received about 20 different rectors from China, as they have become important partners. Another chair that we have is co-financed with the German exchange service, and that is a home-built chair dedicated to promoting academic exchange with Germany; however, it has become a European chair. The last one is the chair for African and Afro Caribbean studies. Apart from these three chairs, we have had close relations and academic exchange programs over the decades with Germany, which has been perhaps the most important for us; many of us including myself have been trained in Germany. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures is the Ministry of Public Education taking to ensure that higher education in Costa Rica is more accessible and equitable?</h4><p>Before taking office as minister, one fundamental aspect considered a priority was the Republic of Costa Rica continuing to increase its allocation to the education budget. It is constitutionally established that Costa Rica shall allocate 8% of GDP to education. Therefore, a goal before joining the Ministry was to place this under the leadership of the president as a working priority. We have continually achieved spending 8% of GDP on education despite the fiscal situation that Costa Rica is currently experiencing. Our progress toward that 8% includes spending on preschool, primary, and secondary education, as well as education for youth and adults such as state university education; all of this is part of the country's education budget. A second important priority has been the quality of education, for which different projects have been promoted. One of these has been continuing to transform and update the curriculum of new programs in English and French, as the push toward quality goes hand-in-hand with a growing internationalization of the Ministry's offering. In 2016, the pioneering project "Let's Speak Mandarin" was launched for the first time in the history of Costa Rica. All of this occurs within a context referred to as "Educating for a New Citizenship," which is the Ministry of Public Education's motto. An important part of the new citizenship is what we call digital citizenship. A more intense use of mobile technology in the classroom is being promoted, as is the case with encouraging the use of mobile phones as part of the learning process and creating innovative educational experiences. A third component is a sustainable development. The environmental component is being strengthened so that our students become aware of social responsibility, their role in the world, and their ecological footprint, while encouraging greater commitment to future generations.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Costa Rica's cooperation with international institutions like UNESCO and ONU to promote youth rights and opportunities?</h4><p>Our relationship with UNESCO is crucial and decisive. This entire educational policy around the idea of new citizenship is based on UNESCO's great principles. For us, as a government, the path determined by UNESCO in education is a course of action to be followed closely. I have actively participated in UNESCO's call for men and women ministers or in specific conferences, and for me it is a priority link. We are working with UNESCO on policies for sustainable development and respect for sexual diversity, and we are committed to the organization's guidelines for the different areas of educational development. UNESCO is an absolutely indispensable ally.</p><h4>What is your vision for education in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Costa Rica has a fundamental asset, which is that families continue to believe in education. My vision is optimistic, because we are achieving a state policy in education. In the past, there were drastic changes in education policy with each change of government, but that is no longer happening. As a government, we joined the Ministry of Education with a sense of high responsibility. No country without a state education policy can achieve high standards, at least not in a four-year period, which is the term of governments in Costa Rica. Instead, a medium and long-term policy with goals that are continually met overtime is needed. For this, a government must carry out a sustained effort. The prime example is that with the last administrations we have continued to advance toward investing 8% of GDP in education; therefore, a national will has been embedded in the constitution. This shows that the country has a will and that there is a country plan for the educational system, which is good news that will continue strengthening Costa Rica. In addition, the growing internationalization being applied to the education system is causing our boys and girls to look at other global examples. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since being established in 1941, the CCSS has worked to reduce child mortality and increase life expectancy. How has the organization evolved in the way that it carries out its mission?</h4><p>CCSS is a unique institution in Costa Rica because it was established not only by law but also by the Constitution. This is important because in the beginning the main focus was on extending social protection such as healthcare access to more people, especially workers in the formal sector. In these 75 years, we have increasingly covered more kinds of workers, including informal workers and independent workers. The primary source of funding comes from the workers, the employers, and the state, which is markedly different from other systems; our social security system is an adaptation of the Bismarck model. The CCSS was originally a healthcare system for people affected by disease; however, we now integrate services such as health promotion and prevention, immunizations, and a holistic approach to healthcare, from primary healthcare through tertiary care. It provides comprehensive care; Costa Ricans can receive immunizations to prevent diseases as well as top of the line cancer treatment, cardiac disease management, and organ transplants. Our package is implicit, meaning that we are charged with serving all those in need of healthcare services. We make no distinction between the individuals of different income groups; everyone living in Costa Rica has the same opportunity to benefit from quality comprehensive healthcare services. This kind of universal healthcare coverage makes Costa Rica stand out as quite different from other countries, and we are proud of this. This approach reduces child and maternal mortality rates, and our life expectancy is around 81 years. As with other countries with a growing elderly population, we are in the midst of an epidemiologic transition, where the population still suffers from acute infectious diseases but is also being afflicted by chronic diseases such as cancers, diabetes, and cardiovascular ailments. The management of these diseases is more expensive, so one of the challenges that we are currently addressing is the strengthening of a system that would follow individuals throughout their life cycle—through health promotion, disease prevention, opportune care and management of disease, rehabilitation, and palliative care in end-of-life conditions.</p><h4>What strategy is CCSS following to solve the issue of patient waiting lists?</h4><p>Like other systems that offer universal healthcare, wait lists are a challenge that we are addressing with creative, patient-centered initiatives, designed and driven from the hospitals themselves.<br>We are working with different kinds of strategies to increase the optimization of our capacity and resources, including alternative schedules, specialized ambulatory surgery campaigns, and optimization of surgical suite utilization among others. Influenza vaccine administration is another example of opportune patient-centered care. Costa Rica's comprehensive immunization schedule includes 15 different vaccines for children and adults. Special at risk populations like children younger than two years of age, the elderly, and those suffering with other pre-existing conditions like asthma or diabetes, were prioritized when the vaccines were administered.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2017?</h4><p>The priorities for 2017 have been established in the institution's strategic plan 2015-2018 which has been developed across three strategic axes: healthcare services, institutional management and financing. Each axis has strategic themes that include health, pensions, infrastructure, information technology and communication, evaluation and accountability, human resource management and financing among others. Priorities for 2017 include implementation and evaluation of the project for the Integral Development of Strategic Functions of Human Resources, Project for the Organizational Restructure of Central Administration, and the Fortification of Health Care Services project. Infrastructure projects include remodeling emergency services and building new hospitals where population changes have exceeded current capacity. Innovative technology will also be a pivotal component of prioritization in 2017, not only for health services but also for education, including telemedicine and apps for patient use. The CCSS is being positioned to evolve significantly over the next several years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Ministry of Health work with other departments of the government to attract investment into the healthcare sector?</h4><p>One of the main problems that we face in Costa Rica is being able to work with other ministries and institutions to bring investment into the country, but thankfully we have made a lot of changes in this regard in the current administration. We work closely with the ministers of commerce, economy, industry, and other related areas. As an example, we are trying to introduce high quality service standards on public and private healthcare providers working with the National Quality Authority lead by the Minister of Commerce, Economy and Industry. To coordinate migration controls it is necessary to work with the Minister of Tourism. We have also worked closely with the Minister of Foreign Relations and the Minister of Agriculture trying to offer health and wellbeing services to people that comes to Costa Rica. Cooperation such as this used to be difficult, but this is gradually improving. We have made a lot of changes that are leading to better results in terms of governance. The primary ministers that we work with on these areas are typically those related to some economy activity. We work to improve the state of the healthcare sector in several ways, such as making it easier for international companies to establish an operation here. </p><h4>Are there any specific projects or plans that you are working on right now?</h4><p>We are leading a real revolution in our system of product registration by reducing the bureaucratic process and remove specific barriers, which in the past have been a problem. We are working with the Minister of Commerce, Economy and Industry on related activities, and with the Ministry of Foreign Trade (COMEX). We are also trying to make things easier for smaller companies by helping with the initial capital investments needed to get started. In these projects, we are participating together with the private sector and official business associations to make things easier for companies to establish operations, which is in many ways new for us. We are trying to implement a recycling strategy to deal with waste, and there are many opportunities to develop some related activities in this segment. We already have some international companies helping manage waste in hopes of extracting what we consider to be valuable, and we should increase this activity. We have a few options here in San José; however, we would like to see this expand throughout the country, and we are trying to bring in some new companies to help in that regard. Recently, we started the National Biomedical Research Council (CONIS) as an official body and authority and we would like Costa Rica to recover regional leadership in genomic medicine, clinical trials, in vitro fertilization (IVF), stem cells, and regenerative medicine.</p><h4>How can Costa Rica maintain its position as a regional hub for medical tourism given increasing competition from other countries in Latin America?</h4><p>Costa Rica has had an excellent healthcare system for many years. We have had many highly qualified healthcare professionals, but because of the size of the public sector, the private sector often seems small by comparison for a country of this size; however, at the same time there is a huge opportunity to grow as a private sector player, which tends to improve the international healthcare services that we can provide as a country. We are trying to create a quality guarantee for all Costa Rican products, including services, but this remains an ongoing initiative. The medical tourism segment will continue growing in the medium term. There are several initiatives in place to develop related areas such as social tourism and to continue carrying out the same long-term strategies that we have been for many years. We are even looking at ways to encourage older people to move here after retiring. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved in the last decade, and what is the importance of Costa Rica for Grupo Calvo?</h4><p>We have been operating in Costa Rica for 11 years; we started our business just selling tuna products. Our arrival in Costa Rica was a couple of years later than the group's expansion of manufacturing facilities in El Salvador and Brazil. In the first decade of the 2000s, the group acquired other companies in other parts of the world and developed its sales to many countries to strengthen its position. In Costa Rica in the last three years, we have partnered with other producing companies to expand our business lines to other segments outside the tuna industry. Costa Rica has excellent producers in the food industry, and we saw this as a way to further strengthen the brand in the country. We started to commercialize different canned products, hot sauces, and sauces to prepare pasta, and today we offer over 50 highly recognized products in the Costa Rican market. Costa Rica is a strategic market for us in terms of diversification. We own around 20% of the market share in the country</p><h4>Grupo Calvo has invested over USD1 million in Costa Rica in the last few years. What are the company's expansion plans?</h4><p>When we first started operating in Costa Rica in 2006, we were selling just under USD1 million, but today that figure has reached USD20 million. The investment in the country goes exactly in that line; we see great potential to commercialize locally produced products in the entire region. We have already started working in that direction; recently, we began exporting locally produced products to El Salvador. Currently, we export about 50,000 units of sauces to El Salvador; this is the potential we see for investment and development in Costa Rica. We want to start with more Central American countries, though we also see great potential to export to Eastern European countries.</p><h4>What social responsibility activities does the company engage in here in Costa Rica?</h4><p>We are highly committed to social and environmental responsibility. We try to engage with the maritime conservation and that is why among our ships there are biologists on board, too. We also work on improving fishing techniques. Since we have partners and commercialize other products, we work on social responsibility for the entire production chain we are involved in. We are committed to contributing to the social and economic development of the countries where we operate.</p><h4>The import of tuna to Costa Rica experienced a sevenfold increase. How do you foresee the evolution of the sector over the next five years?</h4><p>Costa Rica is a mature market in tuna consumption. It will be very hard to increase this consumption in the next few years; people in Costa Rica eat an average of 2.5kg of tuna per person per year. This figure puts Costa Rica at the same level of consumption as countries like Spain. Costa Rica is in fact among the top tuna consuming countries in the world. The first is Libya with 6kg per person per year. In five years' time, we want reach 30% market share. Our main objective in the Central American region is to increase tuna consumption in neighboring countries, and work hard in our diversification to sell sardines, canned vegetables, and sauces with the Calvo brand.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2017?</h4><p>We have developed our strategic plan for the period 2017-2020 and expect to increase operations and volumes in the region by 40% during this time. Current figures are around 3,000 tons for Costa Rica and 5,000 for the region. We aim to reach 7,500 tons in the region by 2020. We have achieved a great deal in terms of the production chain with our partners here in Costa Rica and we want to further strengthen that position, and the position of our plant in El Salvador. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is new technology and innovation for Agrocosta?</h4><p>All our chemical products are in high demand; however, in the last few years we have focused much on exploiting our differentiating points in comparison to our competition; we strengthened our ties with farmers in order to boost innovation and develop the products they need. We have put innovation at the forefront of our development and we invest heavily in new technologies, too. These efforts have enabled us to differentiate ourselves from both local and transnational competitors. We cannot compete with the latter in terms of capacity. Our main objective is to make our farmers more productive and competitive in a global market. In this context, we have the local knowledge, whether of climate, tropical diseases, or the needs of local farmers, we use that knowledge applying it to new technologies as our main competitive advantage. Sometimes it gets a little complicated, as producers usually incline to use what is known already and we have to convince them to change their current systems and technologies. This means a great deal of work and investment in promotion. Such efforts have definitely paid off, as the brand image we have built over the years is that of a company based on innovation and new technology. Throughout time, we have developed new products and have gained the trust and recognition of many customers, opening the doors to new markets. In order to increase the number of producers using our product, we have to invest in research, as it is necessary to do some testing in the labs, in the fields of the producers and in their markets of operation. Our focus is on biodegradable and organic products, which enables us to reach both organic and traditional producers. Our investment in innovation is also to prevent other companies from copying what we do, making us unique with innovative products.</p><h4>Who are your main customers and partners in Costa Rica?</h4><p>We work with the private sector, so our main partners are distributors. For example, some of our distributors are CoopeVictoria, Almacenes Dos Pinos, Coseinca, Agroirazu, El Surco, El Exito, and Cámara de Productores de Caña del Pací­fico, among others. We work closely with them in order to develop, introduce, and distribute our products.</p><h4>Some of your products are being exported. What are the main regional markets you work in and what plans do you have at the international level?<br></h4><p>Our main regional markets are Panama and Nicaragua. We focus on these two because we share a language, culture and proximity to them. In the future, we want to consolidate business in these countries and enter the US market. There are large agricultural extensions in Florida where we would first start; thanks to the boom in organic products, we would have plenty of opportunities in that market. Such efforts are gradually carried out and require finding the right producers to conduct our field testing prior to fully entering the market.</p><h4>The average age of producers in Costa Rica is 54 for men and 52 for women. How do you see the future of the agriculture industry in the country?</h4><p>It all depends on the professionalism of the people working in the industry. With the arrival of a new generation, we will see a change of mentality; we will go to a more industrial approach to agriculture activity rather than just survival. This goes along with the needs and demands of consumers; they ask for better quality and cheaper products. We need to see the arrival of more professional farmers in terms of people with educations who have an understanding of how to use new technologies. This will enable them to be more competitive and efficient. We understand that small producers face the greatest challenges, which is why we focus on them. We want to be part of their transition and adaptation period, as there is no way back. </p>]]></richbody0content>

What have been its major projects in the last two years?</h4><p>Over the last two years, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock has been trying to recover the internal market. Our agricultural sector basically has two engines: one is the export market, which has been dynamic. The other is the internal market, but the small growers who produce for the local market are facing challenges, such as cheap agricultural prices in the international market. In response to this, we are trying to increase productivity with an emphasis on certain activities that are important for feeding the Costa Rican people. We have also identified a range of products we want to focus on, which are rice, beans, potatoes, onions, beef, pork, and milk. The Ministry is targeting and prioritizing coffee as well. In terms of research, we have helped the University of Costa Rica to develop a new potato variety. We are trying to improve not just the productivity, but the value of the crops in the production processes. We are also working to adapt to climate change in these sectors, which is both a value-added proposal and one that helps to reduce the costs of production.</p><h4>How is the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock helping small producers to adapt through better access to basic services, new technology, and knowledge?</h4><p>The past three years, Costa Rica suffered the most severe drought in the country's history. The agricultural sector needs to adapt to climate change, which includes producing new varieties and efficient water use. We are trying to promote irrigation systems based on drip irrigation rather than sprinklers. We are also trying to improve the marketing and the markets for small producers. The government institutions that buy food, like the Ministry of Education, the police, and the Ministry of Justice through the prison system, buy from local producers. Costa Rica has the Institutional Supply Program that tries to link up local production with institutional demand. We are doing that program with agricultural products and fisheries. In 2017, the ministry is starting a project that will provide the facilities to small producers so they can incubate their businesses for one or two years while they get their processes established and get to know the market. This administration is using Costa Rica's Development Banking System to give financial support to these small agricultural producers, manufacturers, and businesses. And this is growing exponentially in terms of the amount of credit that has been placed in the agricultural sector.</p><h4>Around 80,000 producers work on 2.5 million ha. How do you foresee this number evolving? Is the ministry working to encourage young people into the agricultural sector?</h4><p>It is one of the pillars of our policy to try to create opportunities for young people. We want to push this through various means, such as the Development Banking System, value-added concepts, and technology-based agricultural production. And not only at the universities, but at earlier stages through the Ministry of Education so that high schools get into these processes. We actually have a fair every year where people can showcase their value-added products, and we have a special space for younger people where we highlight their work in the agricultural sector.</p><h4>What are your expectations and goals for 2017-2018?</h4><p>The agricultural sector must move toward better regulations because the ones we already have in place can cause difficulties. We need to be more agile in our regulations so that our processes can go faster. Also, we are trying to improve our customs processes at the ports so business can move faster. In terms of technology, Costa Rica's borders and ports recently implemented a scanner system to scan containers more quickly and avoid any problems with the products we import and export. These are some of the efforts that Costa Rica can accomplish during the rest of this administration. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of your most significant projects, and how is the company diversifying its portfolio to move also into the commercial segment?</h4><p>Our main business is developing gated residential communities.  Some of the most recent ones in the central valley are Condominio Cerro Alto, Condominio Villamont, Condominio Los Portones,  Condominio Monterán, Condominio Gregal, Condominio Tierras de Café, Condominio Francosta, Condominio Santo Tomás, and Condominio Los Murales. Our projects are known for being large-scale communities with lots of amenities; we put a lot of emphasis on the green areas and open spaces of our developments. Our properties also have a lot of space for sports and community gatherings. Usually the people that buy our properties stay in them for a long time because they provide the perfect environment to raise families and live a full community experience. After the construction process, we also offer property management and post-construction maintenance for all of our communities.</p><h4>How is La Laguna adapting its projects to the newest technology?</h4><p>Now, we are starting an interesting project related to technological infrastructure whereby we will provide a fiber-optic network to all of our projects and Fiber to the Home (FTTH) for all of our clients. We want all of our projects to have a network that can provide high-speed connectivity for all of the units we sell and for all of the common areas of the developments. We started with this project last year, and we already have a couple of developments that have their own fiber optic network and a lot of houses operating with bandwidths of 50 to 100MB each. Our idea is that each day, more people work from their houses and need to use the internet for all of their basic daily activities. For this to happen, they need a stable and fast internet connection and is the reason why we designed a robust active network of more than 250km around the central valley. We have the biggest private active fiber-optic network in the city.</p><h4>What trends are you noticing in the residential segment and how do you foresee the sector developing in the medium term?</h4><p>In 2016, we started a couple of projects that have made this a great year for us. We have observed a tendency of people living in mid-size and tall residential buildings; therefore, we are trying to add certain properties within our project portfolio that allow for vertical construction. One of the newest projects we have is located on the East part of town, and it is going to have around 3,000 residential and commercial units, most of which are going to be built on mid-size buildings. The central valley is a small area with strict construction regulations, and there is very little land left on which we can develop our projects; hence, we are trying to develop fewer projects but with more density and less footprint.</p><h4>What are the main challenges and opportunities for companies doing business in Costa Rica?</h4><p>The number-one issue of our industry and of national importance is the permitting process. In such a small country as ours, we have 81 different municipalities, all with different rules and different ways of approving construction permits, making it hard for any developer to understand how to do business in each county. Since we have a complex permitting process because of our scale, we have had to develop an important permitting department in our company. This department now offers the service or approving project permits for many other developers of the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the performance of Cushman &amp; Wakefield/AB Advisory over its six years in Costa Rica, and what strategy are you following to maintain such results?</h4><p>My partner was initially based in Mexico City, then about six years ago he moved here and saw some opportunities for the company, though he did not necessarily start developing a fully operational office. Approximately two years ago, I joined the company as Managing Director and partner of the Cushman &amp; Wakefield alliance to develop a full service office here, which includes our brokerage services, investment sales, project management, and facilities management, as well as valuation and consulting. We are the only fully operational commercial real estate office within Central America. We have a team of approximately 25 people and are number one in terms of revenue and market share.</p><h4>In 2016, the company plans to open an office in Panama. Can you describe your plans for expansion and your five-year investment?</h4><p>We are covering projects in Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, and will realize some other projects in Guatemala, though this is not yet active. Those markets are not yet large enough to support a formal office. It is easy for us to take day trips to support our operations. When we partnered, the board of directors asked me to prepare a five-year business plan with a corresponding investment plan. That five-year plan essentially outlined and indicated the way that we want to expand the business over the coming five years in terms of geography and service lines.</p><h4>What are the challenges and opportunities presented by doing business here in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Of the negative things that are said about Costa Rica, infrastructure and bureaucracy are the two most clearly recognized challenges. Bureaucracy is more of an issue, as infrastructure, though it was lacking for several decades, is a relatively easier problem to solve through adequate investment plans. We need a structural reform to truly solve our problems from the roots; however, I do not see that happening in the next 10 to 20 years. On the bureaucracy side, we can do some things to improve the situation, but we cannot change it at the root. The size of the economy may be an issue sometimes, as some of our larger clients thinking about bigger investment projects in the medium to long term are investing millions of dollars in small countries. The Costa Rican workforce is one of the most educated and hardworking workforces in the region, which is a huge asset to have. In addition to that, the culture of the people here is quite open to American culture, European culture, and other Latin American cultures. We do not have the cultural barriers that are found in other areas of Latin America. </p><h4>What are your expectations and goals and priorities for 2017?</h4><p>Our main goal is to be well positioned as the leading commercial real estate firm in Central America; that is our first and foremost objective. Our clients also say that we are the leader in the region, which is our clear target. In 2016, we have completed eight major private bid processes with our competitors in Costa Rica, and we have won all eight. We just want to keep on that track and work as hard as needed to do so. That is our culture; we work hard and play hard. We want to go the extra mile not on paper, but in reality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since 1961, Sanchez Carvajal has positioned itself as one of the four big construction companies in Costa Rica. What strategy have you followed to achieve these results?</h4><p>At the beginning of our operations, we focused on the construction of roads across the country. However, as time passed we understood the need to adapt ourselves to the needs of the country, the market, and our company. We broadened our project portfolio with the construction of hydroelectric plants, maritime port repair works, etc. Two of the key elements in our strategy have been flexibility and adaptability. Over this period, we have mainly worked with the public sector, but have also developed certain projects with the private sector—mainly hydroelectric projects.</p><h4>What trends do you see becoming more popular in the construction sector?</h4><p>The country must adapt to what the sector and the economy requires. In the last few years, the market demand increased for more sophisticated end products. Infrastructure is a key element within the final price of finished goods; the fewer infrastructure projects you have, the higher the cost, production, and distribution costs companies will have. The more and better infrastructure you have, the more competitive you are as a country, and in the last few years competitors have reduced costs in this sense. Good-quality infrastructure also promotes growth of the country's GDP. Our aspiration as a country has to be to develop the necessary infrastructure to enable Costa Rica to compete with similar countries and markets. Today, we do not have the necessary infrastructure to make our industry and farmers competitive in global markets. In this context, the administration faces the challenge of making income flow more rapidly within the national economy.</p><h4>How has the company contributed to the social and economic development of Costa Rica over the last 60 years?</h4><p>We only need to look at the public projects we have handled and the investment made in infrastructure at the national level in the last few decades. The country's GDP grew exponentially during this time, too. In this context, we can conclude that when there is investment in infrastructure, Costa Rica's GDP grew more than when there was no investment in infrastructure. This is due to the fact that, among other things, we generate employability for the country and, along with that, more consumption. In this context, we can assure that the more consumption there is, the more income we generate for the country. This leads to more funds to invest in areas such as education and poverty reduction.</p><h4>What is the split between public and private customers in your portfolio?</h4><p>At the moment, 85% of our customer portfolio is composed of public customers and 15% of private ones. One of the turning points in our development in the last decade was the construction of an African palm oil plant. This project was a public initiative and came at a time when there were not many infrastructure projects in the industry.</p><h4>In which areas is your company focusing its efforts for 2017?</h4><p>One of our main objectives is to continue contributing to the economic and social development of the country. At the same time, it is important for us to keep holding the social values we have built our company on, for we believe it is crucial in a world where social and environmental responsibility have become that relevant in every industry. In terms of projects, the Chilamate-Vuelta Kooper road should be completed, and the government is also doing its best to complete the San Carlos road in 2017. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which areas is the ministry investing the majority of its resources?</h4><p>We have a group of stakeholders that includes two public institutions the MIVAH and the second floor bank (BANHVI). The BANHVI has financial entities, which directly deal with the builders and the people in need of housing, and their organizations. The system is celebrating its 30th birthday this year. It has changed throughout time. It used to be a bank that made loans to poor families, but long ago political decisions transformed in an institution that only give grants (bonos) to families. On the other hand, another component of the bank gives loans to financial institutions in order to lend to middle class families. The system has been essential in helping to maintain the social peace in Costa Rica. For example, recent studies have shown that among families that have received a housing unit from the state, the educational performance of their children is much better. Female teenagers who live in a house given by the system are 30% more likely to finish their secondary education. The government's goal is to provide the poorest people (with no plot for the house) 9,600 housing units by the end of its term.</p><h4>How does the ministry work with private construction companies to provide housing to the poorest people?</h4><p>The most critical point is that some of the houses built in the past were badly located out of cities and towns. We need to build houses and apartments closer or inside cities and towns. We are part of the same system. We talk and work with all the stakeholders in order to change procedures and priorities. At this point, some of the construction companies are in a comfort zone and do not want to change. That's the tension we have with them; we want to be able to assure the country that people are receiving the housing subsidies, particularly the poorest of the poor. With the Puente al Desarrollo program, this government established  a "contract" with families meeting certain requirements in order to receive support.</p><h4>How do you see the sector evolving in five years' time?</h4><p>I am optimistic about housing construction for the middle class, because the economic growth of the country, the low inflation, and the lowering interest rates are opening many housing opportunities for the middle class. Of course, the margin of intermediation by the financial institutions has to decrease, the competition among the builders has to increase, and the regulations should be more effective. The contribution to the economy is going to grow to double digits in the next two years. With respect to housing for the poor paid by the state we expect the programs to continue around 10,000 solutions per year. We hope that most of the homes and apartments will be built close to or inside the cities.</p><h4>What are the ministry's main goals for the next year?</h4><p>From a popular housing point of view, we want to increase the assignment of resources by at least 15-20%, depending on this year's results. The other goal is to update the urban regulations that are part of our obligations as the Ministry of Human Settlements, such as the modifications of condominium regulations, and but not the law in itself. Accelerate the construction of collective grants (bonos comunales) for different purposes, in particular building the winning projects of the two competitions for improving open spaces. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate Aeris' operations in Costa Rica so far? </h4><p>We are a small airport in Central America, surrounded by a stable growing economy and a safe investment environment, which resulted in our investors being able to obtain the concession from the World Bank and make an agreement with the government of Costa Rica. We entered into an 18-month remediation plan, and in that time we invested more than USD50 million to bring the infrastructure up to date. We also agreed to update a master plan for the future development of the airport, which we originally delivered in 2011. It was intensive work from June 2009 through to 2011. Since then, we have been successful not only in building and expanding the airport, but also in bringing in more airlines.</p><h4>After investing USD19 million into the expansion of the airport in 2015, does Aeris have any new investment plans?</h4><p>We agreed in November with the government and the civil aviation authority to develop the public infrastructure of this particular airport, as there are still extensive amounts of work to be done, in both areas; the terminal facilities and the airfield side. There are several important works to improve the infrastructure. We have to find consensus with the government in relation to the need to move the firefighters from their present location. This perhaps does not seem like a major change, but it will allow us to continue to grow the terminal to the west. Most people do not see it, but we have a lot of companies, people, and equipment for transporting baggage from the aircraft to the inspection site in order to ensure that passengers are able to find their baggage after clearing border control. We are going to duplicate the capacity in this respect.</p><h4>What is your strategy for improving the number of connections to Costa Rica and attracting more companies to operate here?</h4><p>We have regular meetings with the Minister of Tourism to coordinate with him and his people, who see national development on a broader level than us; we look at our airport, while they consider the whole country. Many of these ideas have naturally come into place, while others come from our international contacts. We normally have a company of international advisors working on route developments that provide ideas and data on passenger movements. In some cases, we have begun providing incentives, particularly for encouraging airlines to come.</p><h4>The airport's passenger count has grown steadily every year, with 3.9 million passengers passing through in 2015. What are your projections for the rest of this year and into 2017?</h4><p>In 2016, we are growing 12.5% more than last year, which is the highest growth rate we have ever had. We should end with almost 4.2 million passengers. The expectation for next year is high, as we have new flights with Air France starting in November. We also have the initiative of Volaris coming to San Jose and doing what is named Volaris CAM, which will base  it out of here. We have invested around USD16 million this year in expanding the parking capacity of the airport, and one of the reasons is that many airlines have decided to have overnight layovers in San José. We have a lot of overnight parking; however, now we also have to be prepared for the Volaris project. Volaris is already flying here from Cancun and Guadalajara, and it is in the final stages of doing Volaris Central America, which will see its base established in Costa Rica. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the most important milestones for the company in Costa Rica during 2016?</h4><p>It was important to see the start of a project that will have such an impact on the country, the Moí­n Container Terminal Project, which will improve the economic development of Costa Rica. This is a year that has been marked by important milestones, one being the successful start of this construction. Another milestone was the signature of the USD110 million contract for the purchase of all the lifting equipment that is going to be installed.</p><h4>How did the company win the contract and what will it entail?</h4><p>Moin will not be the largest container terminal in Latin America, but it will strive to be the most efficient one, a standard in safety and security to look up to, and in harmony with the environment. It will represent a major change of current paradigms because of its efficiency in servicing and deeper draft. It will be able to attract the exact same transoceanic vessels that go through the Panama Canal, thus connecting for the first time Costa Rica to this first tier shipping network. This will be a big game changer. The concession invited to an open bid all interested parties, and APM Terminals won by proving to be the best partner for the government to develop a specialized container terminal with. This is the first time in Latin America that a port of this level of specialization is being built on an artificial island. We are going to have 650m of quay, a draft of 14.5m, and six STS cranes in the beginning. That will allow us to dock vessels of up to three and a half times the size of the biggest vessel that actually docks in any port in Costa Rica. By the end of the third stage, we will have 1.6km of quay, and more than 85ha of container yard to be able to handle all of the cargo, and workshops that will support the logistics.</p><h4>Infrastructure remains a major challenge in Costa Rica. How are projects like the improvements to Routes 32 and 4 progressing?</h4><p>The government recently approved the new concession contract for the construction of Route 32, which is an important step. The winners of the bid that was selected to take over this concession will spend seven to eight months in the design stage, and then approximately three years in building the expansion. Even though we would like to have Route 32 tomorrow, we understand that it is also a major construction project and the involved parties will take their time.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2017?</h4><p>Our priority is to complete the building of the terminal, and ensure that we have trained personnel to start operations immediately. We will continue with our involvement in the betterment of the community through our CSR programs, improving schools in the area, as well as coordination with Police and Public Authorities to work on public safety. Achieving this is not always simple. There are many points of view, so the priority is to reach a consensus on an agenda, regardless of political colors or personal interest. This is necessary to be able to push through those three or four items that will move us forward. We are on time, and 2017 is going to be the year of challenges. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the MOPT's structure help bring projects to fruition?</h4><p>The MOPT is important for the country. The MOPT has five assigned councils of which the Minister is the President of the Board of Directors. These entities include the National Council for Highway Administration (CONAVI), the Technical Council of Civil Aviation (CETAC), the Public Transport Council (CTP), the Road Safety Council (COSEVI), and the National Council of Concessions (CNC).  We are conducting important negotiations to update a few studies on transit demand for a concession that is going to be revisited, stretching from San Jose to Cartago. Some smaller ports located in Golfito are undergoing updated studies between construction projects. The CTP has two important projects, one of which is focused on eliminating many cars in downtown San Jose and improving the public transport service in order to change the service and reduce the number of cars and buses entering the area. The other project is an electronic payment system, which could potentially enable users to pay with cards while allowing us to obtain information through the system and observe the behavior related to the tariff regime. CONAVI is now implementing a program of road infrastructure financed by the BID for USD300 million. CONAVI also has extremely important projects, such as the construction of the Cañas-Liberia road to connect Pozuelo to Jardines del Recuerdo in Heredia, the road in San Carlos, and other key access points. No less important is this ministry, which will start on a USD450 million transport infrastructure program. </p><h4>What are some takeaways from closing CONAVI and creating a new National Institute of Infrastructure?</h4><p>At the moment, it is in the Legislative Assembly. This ministry made a proposal, but before I began my charge. The new institution wants to have a different remuneration to make wages more competitive. It is a good project, and we have had some strong reactions or denials of the project and other positions that are also important. </p><h4>Besides infrastructure, what is the main challenge facing Costa Rica, and how is the Government working to overcome it?</h4><p>We have a lot of potential, many requirements, and competent people; however, there are many problems, and we have to look for a solution. We have an excess of controls that at times delay the execution of works. It is these kinds of constraining conditions that need to be overcome, so we have been identifying laws and decrees to improve ourselves. From the national perspective, it is a big task because the country has great potential for investores. Under these conditions, however, investors resign themselves and lose interest in Costa Rica. It is necessary to make these adjustments in order to be more competitive.</p><h4>What are some of the Ministry's goals for the next year?</h4><p>There are significant projects that will be given to developers next year, such as the San José-San Ramon road, which is an important road for the country. We are going to have contracting processes from both the construction company and the companies that will monitor the fulfillment of the contract. Equally, the contract for a road to Limon province has already been awarded to a Chinese company, which will be in charge of the construction of a 100km extension to the road. In addition, all the infrastructure works are going to arise in transport, which will be strategically significant for the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your services include fiber optics, Wi-Fi networks, and security video cameras. What else is Anphora planning to add to keep its leading position?</h4><p>In the beginning between 1984 and 1990, we were only a computer and printer reseller, but when we adapted to the local market we started working on projects. We do not sell to the final user as a retail store; we only work in IP networks projects, and nothing with analog technology. All our knowledge is in IP network and local area networks; therefore, all our work has to be covered by this. That is important because at this time all the services and products are in the IP market. Around 15 years ago, telephony was analog but is now IP; video security surveillance still have a lot of analog cameras, but the switch has been implemented and in less than three years there will be no more analog ones. The Internet of Things is another big market we are interested in entering as every sensor has to be connected to the internet in one way or the other. We work on projects and go to our customers to provide a full turnkey service.</p><h4>With fierce competition in the market, what differentiates Anphora from other players?</h4><p>We have to be careful to see what is happening in this market, but we have a strong position in that we sell projects. Normally many companies sell fiber optics and have to get the camera or the IP telephone system from another company, but we can provide the complete solution. Even if we have to integrate some products not in our portfolio, we will do it to satisfy the customer's expectations. We also have another important strength, which is that we design the systems as the customer wants them. For example, ICE needed a solution about two years ago for the dam in Cachí­, at which there are many deep tunnels. The employees entered the tunnel to provide maintenance to the equipment, but had no communication. That was a problem in case an accident occurred. Therefore, we installed an IP security system inside the tunnels with alarm systems, voice-over IP, a paging system, cameras, telephones, and a siren, all of which is connected to a central location in the site's guard office. If something happens then he knows at which level and he can communicate to see if everything is okay. That is a custom-made solution.</p><h4>How do you see the telecoms industry in five years?</h4><p>The technology sector is the key to the country's growth. We have to provide more speed to communications, internet, and coverage. It is almost unbelievable that the average speed in this country is less than 2Mbps. As a first step, we have to increase this to 100Mbps very soon. The technology sector will be the country's motor not only because if we increase all the services then more companies will be here for manufacturing, services, or call centers, but because connectivity exponentially increases possibilities for new businesses.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for 2017?</h4><p>To increase and consolidate the Wi-Fi market by developing this market with the service providers. When ICE was founded in 1949 with the revolution of José Figueres, a visionary president, the country was scarcely developed in the electrical market. They made a goal of having electricity in the whole country; 99% of the country is now covered. That goal was met many years ago—now we need the goal to have 99% of internet coverage at high speed of 100 Mbps and need to establish a mandate to achieve this goal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways has your company evolved, and what are your plans for moving into countries like Mexico?</h4><p>Our first project took place in Panama, followed by a big project for an important bank in Honduras. After that, we began several critical projects for the Costa Rican government—mainly focused on banks like Banco de Costa Rica, Banco National, and several cooperatives. Then, we tried to expand our business in South America, starting in Ecuador with some important projects for the CNT, prior to our participation supporting the project design for two data centers—one in Quito and the other one in Guayaquil. We are currently trying to have more participation and get involved in more projects from these countries. As a result, we got a significant project in Peru for Sunat, the Peruvian tax collecting institution.</p><h4>In addition to consultancy, design, certification, and operation services, what other services does Data Center Consultores offer to keep its leading position on the market?</h4><p>We started operations as an electromechanical, architectural, and civil design company before venturing into the design and construction certification opportunities and later, into the data centers operation and maintenance field. We launched a new company called Intelligence Carbon Zero during the 2016 Data Center Summit. The main focus of this company will be the use of clean energies via the introduction of certain technologies such as data mining and big data to monitor data centers. We have also created a strategy to make the maintenance and operation of data centers more predictive by applying data mining and big data information from a software that will be implemented. The vision of this new company is based on providing our clients services that differ from what the market currently offers.</p><h4>What relevant projects do you have in the pipeline?</h4><p>We are currently working on the Banco Nacional and Registro Nacional data centers. Besides, we are on the design stage for another data center that will be initiated next year. In addition to that, we have a design certification and construction data center project in Colombia, and another project for the Ministerio de Vivienda de Costa Rica that has already been designed but is on hold for budgetary reasons.</p><h4>Costa Rica has built high-quality data center infrastructures and is an industry leader after Brazil. What opportunities does the country have to become a regional hub?</h4><p>One of the main purposes of the Data Center Summit 2016 was to look for that opportunity. During 2016, we produced around a 100% of our energy from green sources. This is a major opportunity for data centers in the region because all trends are going toward more efficient solutions that use less energy and green sources. Costa Rica is also working to become carbon neutral by 2021; hence, these eco-friendly solutions can also contribute to transform Costa Rica into a data center hub focused on producing green energy.</p><h4>Some countries such as Russia, Korea, and Brazil have been trying to attract large technology firms. What does Costa Rica need to attract these multinationals?</h4><p>We need to focus on education specialized on data center operations. Costa Rica has excellent professionals and our education system is one of the best in the region. However, if we want to become a hub for data centers technology, we have to reinforce some areas of education like management, operations, research, and other relevant fields. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the IT sector currently here in Costa Rica?</h4><p>I have worked in this industry for 27 years and I see three main challenges here. First, the public sector plays an important role in our industry in terms of size and IT needs. The IT budget in Costa Rica's public sector is significantly larger than in other countries in Central America. This is an important revenue in our yearly numbers. The second challenge we face is that Costa Rica has been known, in the last years, to have highly qualified IT professionals. Nevertheless, we often face the challenge of finding these professionals with the kind of IT skills we require due to their high demand. The IT sector has been growing immensely in Costa Rica, especially in the software industry. Multinational companies have formed alliances with local universities in order to meet the demand in the desired technical skills needed. Here, there are nearly the same type of needs and challenges a company in the US or Europe has. The main issue is that most part of the market is four or five years behind in terms of the implementation compared to US companies, especially in the banking industry, which is paramount worldwide. The other challenge in Costa Rica is that the industry is interested in the ideas and implementation of IT services in other countries such as the US; however, we lack the penetration and confidence of managed services in the industry. </p><h4>GBM works to closing the digital gap in Costa Rica. What are the main highlights of your programs here?</h4><p>We have two large initiatives, which are core for the entire business in Costa Rica. One of them is to help close the digital gap and the other is electronic waste management. Electronic waste has been growing considerably in Costa Rica. We have made strategic alliances with institutions that recycle IT waste, helping our customers and non-customers, to get rid of obsolete equipment in an ecologically responsible way. We also seek to minimize the digital gap. We deploy various initiatives in this area, such as teaching people with disabilities basic computer skills amongst other. While we have volunteers who come in and give lessons, we also decided to establish a formal program in which we have invested important resources, named One Goal for Education. The initiative consists of bridging the digital gap amongst low resource schools and other centers, such as homes for the elderly, with the help of local soccer teams that aim to score as many goals as possible. Each goal represents the amount of centers and schools who will benefit from receiving a learning kit (13 previously owned iPads, a Wi-Fi device and pedagogical training). We work with top high schools that give us a hand with content included in the iPads and also give English lessons and basic computer skills courses to go with the equipment we donate. We expected to donate 1,700 iPads, but have given away nearly 3,000 pieces of equipment, which also includes laptops and desktop computers. </p><h4>What are the company's goals for 2017?</h4><p>Our main goal is to grow. We have grown double digit in each of the last five years. We will continue to grow in managed services, an important area for us. We will also grow our data center infrastructure strategy with our customers and outsourcers. Business analytics is an opportunity and an area that customers begin to require. Since we adhere to SAP implementation practices, we will continue to implement more solutions using SAP and the ecosystem around it. We are the number-one IT solutions integrator in the region and this has been confirmed by IDC, the service consulting firm for marketing solutions around the world involving all the major players in the industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Movistar has already reached 2 million users in Costa Rica and has 25% of the market. What strategy did the company implement to achieve this?</h4><p>Telefonica Costa Rica started operations in 2011 and has created a robust company in only five years that has enabled us to reach 2 million users. New technologies and innovation have been the main drivers of our development in the country. In this context, we have based our operations on three pillars: customer service and the digitalization and simplification of their experience; 3G coverage for 95% of the population and 4G coverage for 70% of the population; and innovation—our Movistar company is focused on developing the most innovative products and services. In addition, our company has taken an active role when it comes to sponsoring sports events and two key players for the national team. This sponsorship has helped us gain proximity to our users.</p><h4>What is the importance of Costa Rica for the company's global and regional operations?</h4><p>We are the youngest company in the group and Costa Rica is a young and burgeoning market. We have invested more than USD500 million in infrastructure and platforms. Penetration levels of technology products are dynamic and offer great potential, making this market an attractive one for a company such as ours. Costa Rica represents a long-term investment for the company.</p><h4>What characterizes the products set to be launched in 2017?</h4><p>We have a strong focus on data, and since we have been innovating since day one, we continuously launch new products and services into the Costa Rican market. In the future, we will be moving into financial services. However, in Costa Rica we see great potential in SMEs, which is why we launched SME in a Box and Negocio Smart. For example, according to the Ministry of Economy, 93.4% of the economic contribution of industries comes from SMEs. In our B2B business line, we develop personalized services and products for these companies—micro, small, and medium-enterprises. We try to adapt our services to their budgets and enable them to grow from a technological point of view. We also think this is an interesting sector in which to grow our data center's activity. Around 93% of our customers are private users and the remaining 7% are companies, including B2B.</p><h4>What are the main challenges of operating in Costa Rica for a company like Telefonica?</h4><p>This is an interesting market that can serve as testing arena for many multinationals. However, one of the main challenges are the current regulations. Telefonica has contributed in an important way to the development of the mobile and technological market here in Costa Rica, and this has made us the industry leader. We are a reference in the sector, and innovation has enabled us to become pioneers in many areas. For example, we were the first company to invest in an enterprise incubator in Costa Rica and the region. This project is called Open Future, and we will soon complete the third call for start-up projects. We have also signed an agreement with a few municipalities like Heredia and Cartago to transform them into smart cities. These kinds of projects are important in setting us apart from the competition. In this context, innovation also sets us apart, and our leading role in Central America is a major point of attraction for corporate customers.</p><h4>What are your main goals and objectives for 2017?</h4><p>Our main objective is to continue serving our 2 million users. We actually have loyalty user plans, where we know the user's entire journey. We want to continue innovating our services and products for the public and private sector, the former having great potential. We plan to continue expanding our data centers and the data sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Costa Rica represent for Claro's global operations?</h4><p>Costa Rica is one of the few subsidiaries where America Movil did not acquire a consolidated operation. We started both network deployment and business from scratch and now we have a very competitive efficient network covering about 98% of the population. We also have a National Direct to Home Satellite Television License (DTH) that allows us to provide services along the entire country with state-of-the-art multimedia technology. Our operations in Costa Rica closed the previous small geographical gap in the continuity of Claro's services across the Latin America region, since currently Claro has presence from the US to Patagonia with a powerful brand presence. The aperture telecommunications market in Costa Rica gave us the opportunity to offer a real full Central America coverage to our regional customers.</p><h4>Claro CR recently introduced new HD channels and MiFi technology. What other products are in the pipeline for next year?</h4><p>We are making significant improvements to our DTH offer by operating a new satellite and broadening capacities to increase the quantity of channels and introduce many HD channels. In 2016, we finished the migration of satellite receivers to operate them with the new satellite so that all our customers can start 2017 with an improved experience. In regard to the broadband mobile services and according to recent studies from the regulatory authority, Claro currently provides the best customer experience for internet access, which will be improved by extending our 4G coverage in 2017 and adding new spectrum by participating in the frequency bidding planned for the next year. We will continue consolidating our growth in the corporate market, supported by the America Movil global infrastructure and the offer's diversification. The commercial options for companies are going to be stronger.</p><h4>The three operators this year addressed the need of the pricing model to be modified now that the market is already in competence. When will SUTEL conduct its new evaluation?</h4><p>The aperture of the Costa Rica telecommunications market started with many rules of price regulation to prevent some behavior from the incumbent operator. Now, the regulatory authority is analyzing the level of competition of the markets. The mobile telecommunications market in Costa Rica is highly competitive but it could be improved by allowing commercial innovation; therefore, it is imperative that the regulatory authority provides the necessary flexibility for creativity and development of innovative new products. We are waiting on the final report from the regulatory authority and hope that it will produce positive results to remove the obsolete price regulation and avoid unnecessary intervention in the market in order to increase competitions and generate more benefits to users. Currently, the broadband services for internet access in the postpaid segment is regulated by allowing a unique way to rate, preventing low-income users from experiencing the high-speed connections and the general users from experiencing the highest speed offered by networks. Customers should have the right to choose between being rated based on speed, capacity download, or other innovative ways. In this sense, we expect to be able to broaden the options for customers. This is what we propose and we hope that it gets resolved by the end of the year based on technical facts and the evidence of the existence of strong competition in the Costa Rica mobile telecommunications market.</p><h4>What are your top priorities for 2017?</h4><p>Our main priorities for the next year are consolidating our growth strategy for our 4G network and refining our approach toward the content. We are dealing with large content, but there are also other services content on the corporate market. We want to consolidate the country brand that we already have and drive that brand deep into the hearts of the Costa Rican population. In addition, we want to expand our satellite television offer in a significant way, continuing our double-digit growth trajectory of the last three years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved since its incorporation?</h4><p>The ICE is a state company that from the beginning was responsible for the development of telecommunications in Costa Rica. One of the main focuses at the beginning was on rural telephones and the expansion of fixed-line telephones across the country. We have gone through every different stage of development, and today we have an IP-based system. We have developed a 4G mobile network that has evolved from 2G and 3G, and we are improving coverage and service quality of the entire mobile network. What is more, we started to build up a brand for the telecommunications industry and put social and environmental responsibility at the forefront of our priorities, as well as human resources. This is when the logo of the frog and the name of the company kölbi were created. In 2011, we sold 1.25 million prepaid licenses, a strategy based on getting ready for further competition in the industry with the entry of foreign companies. Thanks to that decision, when these foreign firms first arrived, they saw a slightly more mature market in which we already had a strong position. Today, we have 4 million customers, which represents 60% of market share. In terms of income, 70% comes from individual customers, whereas the remaining 30% comes from businesses. In the business segment, we are also market leaders. However, when it comes to TV services, we only own 2% of the market share. One of our particularities is that we compete with all the companies operating in the IT industry in Costa Rica, which is currently at least 136 firms.</p><h4>In which areas is kölbi investing the most?</h4><p>We want to redefine our entire technological future, for Costa Rica has always been a leading and pioneering country in Latin America in terms of IT services. However, certain macroeconomic problems in Costa Rica led to a reduction of investment in IT, putting all that innovation on hold. We are trying to get back on track, which is why we have a project to implement fiber optics across the country. We have already started with small-scale projects and in highly targeted areas that have been successful. Costa Rica is a demanding and consuming society in terms of IT services and products. Today, we focus on renovating our infrastructure from copper to fiber optics in order to become a company providing tools and content to our customers, internet services, and over-the-top content on fully digital platforms through a robust network of high speed.</p><h4>kölbi currently reaches 89% of Costa Rican territory and is the leading mobile service provider in terms of coverage. What strategy will you implement to keep this edge?</h4><p>I was appointed General Manager in 2014. When I revised the current situation of the company, I understood that despite covering almost all the country's geography, this did not imply a good performance. In the last few years, we grew our number of customers significantly; however, investments in infrastructure did not follow at the same level. Our customers were not fully satisfied with our services, despite the wide coverage. We now focus on strengthening some areas of our coverage and optimizing our network, one of our main focuses since 2014. We have invested more resources in our data, amplifying licenses, and traffic controllers. We have also started the installation of new infrastructure spaces. One main objective is to provide a better customer experience to our users. All in all, we have doubled our capacity and coverage in mobile infrastructure since 2014. Finally, we invest in our people and train them in depth. </p><h4>What are your priorities for 2017?</h4><p>Our priorities are the introduction of the Fiber to the Home (FTTH); the finalization of content provision services; and the doubling of our mobile network points. We aim to introduce new technologies and services thanks to the multi frequency antennas we plan to install. Finally, we plan on implementing and expand the use LTE/4G technology for data. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the Ministry of Science, Technology and Telecommunications (MICIT) play in Costa Rica's human capital and socioeconomic development?</h4><p>Although we are not the regulator of telecommunications, we have important relationships with telecom operators. We administer the use of the spectrum for wireless telecommunications, including radio, TV, cellular, and other types of communications in the country. Hence, we make policies on how that is used and administered. We also try to define public policy and investments in telecommunications, providing guidance for operators and other actors, guiding their investments in the country. The amount of resources the country has invested in science and technology has increased considerably. There are three main areas: R&amp;D, human capital development, and innovation. Those three areas work in synergy to enhance how Costa Rica can actually develop its R&amp;D ecosystem. In terms of developing human capital, we support programs and scholarships abroad for Costa Ricans. Right now, we have invested USD35 million in scholarships for graduate degree abroad, and those people will come back to Costa Rica to develop the R&amp;D ecosystem. The other area that R&amp;D serves is to develop the necessary ingredients for the ecosystem to row, from working with international companies to enhance the R&amp;D centers they already have in Costa Rica, to attracting FDI into Costa Rica's R&amp;D centers. The innovation aspect is crucial. Our innovation division works with SMEs to develop technology-based small companies, with entrepreneurs to develop SMEs based on science, technology, and innovation, trying to coach them, and in some cases scale them up so they can actually export. It is a successful program, because we invest in young entrepreneurs who provide ideas on how to develop SMEs based on science and technology; it is not just in ICT, but also in biotechnology and other areas.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of the Science, Technology, and Innovation National Plan 2015-2021?</h4><p>The plan is based on three pillars. The first pillar and main objective is to become a knowledge-based country. This involves human capital development, the creation of R&amp;D clusters, and the provision of a mature innovation system that can foster more entrepreneurship in the country. For the R&amp;D part we have defined five priority areas: energy, agriculture and food, health, the environment, and education. We want to develop research projects that can solve Costa Rican problems in those five areas, things like climate change and water supply in the northwest part of the country. Hence, we are now investing our resources in five research projects worth USD100,000 each in that part of the country. The idea is to direct and focus the investment we do in research projects so they can be used in applied research to solve specific problems the country is facing. We will eventually move into human health or energy.</p><h4>How would the ministry assess the opportunities for private investment, both domestic and foreign, in the ICT sector?</h4><p>Costa Rica is a great destination for foreign investment in IT and ICT in general. Many software and IT companies, such as Intel, HP, and IBM have done well in Costa Rica, and their operations have been successful, employing thousands of people. We hope and expect that other companies and brands will come to Costa Rica to hire our engineers. We hope to attract more companies from Europe and Asia to invest in Costa Rica. We have one of the best public education systems in the world, and perhaps the best in Latin America, including universities. So we have the quality engineers and talent. However, what we lack is the number of engineers to bring to big companies that employ 1,000 people or over. We are a small country after all. Therefore, we have to see how we can provide more engineers for that particular sector. We work closely with universities to achieve this goal and address these issues. We meet with the rectors of all universities almost on a weekly basis to discuss this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your plans for expansion in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Our first priority for the moment is to fill our current site in the America Free Zone, where we are prepared to have up to 320 people working. That said, we expect to grow both due to internal Bosch projects and third-party projects, since we have started to look at the external market. We expect to grow in the coming years to maximize the use of our resources and as part of our fixed-cost coverage strategy. Together with our colleagues from Central America, Bosch Service Solutions creates the conditions so that the company can enlarge its presence in Costa Rica. This means that if they need to organize presentations or training sessions they are able to do them from here. We also seek to get some people working for them here for the Costa Rican market. This is a small market, but once we have all the infrastructure in place, it will be easy to have people available to work in any market imaginable. </p><h4>FDI inflows to Costa Rica increased by 1% YoY in 2015. What role does Bosch play in the development of the country?</h4><p>We currently have 170 employees and our target over the next two years is to have approximately 320 employees working on our Costa Rican site. We also create the conditions so that people can work from home, and look into more solution-orientated and complex services, which require deeper and more complex knowledge. We aim to create service platforms that we can then do the maintenance work for. A great example of this is our development of a management platform for car manufacturers in relation to an emergency call system (eCall), a technology that has to be made available by law in Europe and the US by 2020.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of your CSR activities?</h4><p>In 2015, we made a donation of USD10,000 to a local institution that supports the government by giving IT tools and training to underprivileged schools. We engage in a number of activities in terms of our social responsibility to help people by providing resources, and we do sponsorships as well. We are working on designing a new social and technical project involving voluntary work to pass on some of our maintenance knowledge. We will then continue to support them if they go on to university, perhaps even hiring them upon graduation.</p><h4>What is your outlook over the next five years for both Bosch and the overall sector in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Bosch and the business support services industry in Costa Rica in general have to develop a more automated environment. Robotics replaces many transactional functions in the accounting field and makes them easier and faster. The first thing is to standardize practices, streamline them, and then automation comes in. This trend will give Costa Rica an opportunity to develop more added-value services to our customers. Most of the work we currently do here is transactional, but if we can shift transactional tasks to other tasks, like controlling, planning, and reporting, we can achieve more. It also gives us the opportunity to develop new services and products to cover the needs of our customers better. In terms of services Costa Rica will continue to be a near-shore option for Bosch divisions in North America, and because of the economies of scale that we will be able to capture, Central and South America could also become partially covered by Costa Rica. This has started with our technical support services, which already cover the rest of Latin America except for Brazil. Certainly 2017 will be about stabilizing the first two projects we have in Costa Rica, and we should also have more projects up and running by next year. Starting our own projects is the most important target for us. For this to take place, we need to build up our human resources. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Grupo Capris evolved into the market leader?</h4><p>My grandfather founded the company in Costa Rica in 1954 in the beginning the company focused on automotive and industrial maintenance, or MRO, gradually moving into other markets over the years. It was involved in the coffee business early on, and Cafe Capris was the largest exporter of coffee until being sold in 1969. In 1987, Capris Medica was founded with a focus on laboratory services in hospitals mainly in the areas of clinical chemistry and haematology. Over the years, the company diversified geographically and now has a presence in El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia. In each of these countries, we have a different focus. It is a complex business because each of the market segments we participate in has different challenges, competitors, and market strategies. Those are our main businesses; however, we also have a vested interest in the renewable energy and energy efficiency market through a subsidiary called GBT. The reason we are in so many different markets and excel in most of them is that we listen, innovate, and adapt to our customers' needs. Once the decision is made to enter a market, we try to become the relevant player in that market.</p><h4>Over the years, Capris has been consistently diversifying its portfolio. Which services show the most market potential?</h4><p>The ones growing fairly quickly are the medical business, MRO, and wholesale. These are growing quickly, and the company is changing both its portfolio of products to adapt to the changing product demand patterns as well as the way it communicates to its customers on a regular basis with technologies that have been mature in other countries, but are fairly new in Costa Rica and Latin America. We use vending machines to make our products available 24/7 for our customers and also enhanced our product portfolio with a significant amount of new products to service the growing segments of the economy. Other ways we are trying to meet the requirements of the customers by enhancing and improving the supply chain solutions we offer through our website, which provides our customers with an efficient communication channel providing our VIP customers with all the tools they need to enhance their supply chain process. Today, it is the most developed platform available in the region. From this platform, customers can access up to 35,000 products online in a customer-friendly manner, order products, and see their account statements and the status of any order that has been placed.</p><h4>How do you see the market evolving in the next five years, and where do you see Grupo Capris within this outlook?</h4><p>There is a great deal of competition right now. There were USD350 million in internet purchases in Costa Rica during 2013. That grew in 2014 to USD500 million, which is a 30% annual growth. Costa Rica has a higher internet penetration rate than most of the countries in the region; therefore, we foresee increasing numbers of people coming to our online store. That is why we have strategically decided to develop the platform and make it more user-friendly, and we will soon have the plugin from DHL to allow for speedy deliveries. The platform was actually developed for industrial and wholesale companies, and not necessarily for end users or home users, but we are changing that given that we have sold products to Germany and Spain over our platform, and we see that tendency growing. These end users have found something competitive in what we offer, even in such highly competitive markets. We need to develop and invest even more in our multi-platform electronic services. We also have an open return policy that is not necessarily the norm in our region. We will return customers' money if they are not satisfied with the product or made a mistake ordering it, which is a way of incentivizing our customers to actually start using the platform. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What initiatives are underway to encourage investment in other areas beyond the capital?</h4><p>The recently renovated airport in Liberia, Guanacaste will play an important role; hence, we need to work on the cargo terminal there in order to generate trade activity in and out of the country. That will also provide conditions for the development of other economic activities, such as agroindustry. We need to move forward and through innovation try to transform our agricultural industry into value-added processes whereby Costa Rica, its people, and the agricultural undertakings take advantage of the activities that are being developed by the multinational corporations active in the country.</p><h4>What do you think the country needs to do to increase its competitiveness?</h4><p>We need to create better conditions, and energy is an important area. Costa Rica has been successful, and the Chamber of Industries has played an important role in the establishment of a sustainable long-term energy plan. We are in full agreement with the government that the country is moving in the right direction in that sense. We need to be less dependent on fossil fuels for generation, and on non-sustainable resources in general. Costa Rica has for many years been developing hydroelectric energy; however, we need to focus on improving rates and generating significant levels in an effort to reduce costs. That has to do with efficiency and focusing a lot of our matrix into lower cost, sustainable energy generation. It is also related to efficiency and opening up energy generation and distribution to competition. Competition drives efficiency and leads to a reduction in costs and rates. We also need to ensure that we make processes easier for companies to come here and invest. This is something that we have been discussing seriously with the president. One of the most important things that we need to focus on is strengthening our security. We all understand that we live in democratic countries and that the people of Costa Rica are prone to corruption and illegal activities; therefore, we need to ensure that we provide jobs and a sense of wellbeing to the population so that they do not feel the temptation of such activities. </p><h4>How do you foresee Costa Rica's economic structure evolving in the short to medium term?</h4><p>Services are going to continue to grow. We need to make sure that we maintain the diversification of our economy, which has proven to be successful for the country. Diversification means that we have the possibility to continue to move forward as sectors are affected in the future. A diverse economy reduces risks that may occur when a specific sector suffers a downturn. The fact that Costa Rica was diversified when we faced the 2008 real estate crisis allowed the country to better handle the crisis and survive. While other countries were significantly affected because their economies were not as diversified as Costa Rica's, we were able to emerge faster and stronger. </p><h4>What is the Chamber of Industries doing to contribute to the growth of the industrial sector?</h4><p>We need to understand that what we are producing and selling today is not what is going to be sold in the future; I do not know what sort of industry we will have in the country in five years. The role of the Chamber of Industries is to ensure that we help in the development of new activities and in the development of the future industry of Costa Rica. The Chamber of Industry is playing an important role as a facilitator by organizing activities and bringing in key worldwide players in innovation to come share their successes and experience with local industry and different players in the country, such as universities and institutions involved in R&amp;D, as well as governmental divisions and industry so that we can generate actions to get them involved in innovation. Innovation can happen when industry, academia, and research institutions all work together. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[balanced-development]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ICE works in many areas including telecoms, infrastructure projects, and the electricity sector. In which area is ICE currently concentrating the most? </h4><p>We have a planning outlook of 25 years; electricity demand in recent years has not grown as it did previously. We have had growth at one time of around 5.5%; however, because of economic reasons this figure is now closer to 1.2-2%, as the country is still suffering from the effects of the 2008 recession. We are currently in the last phase of the Reventazon hydroelectric plant project, which will add 305MW of electricity to the country's energy matrix. After that, we will continue working with geothermal, beginning the construction of Pailas II, complete a new 50MW privately owned hydroelectric plant, as well as pursue several private developments where ICE buys its energy. There are two wind power plants of 20MW. Looking ahead, our vision is to begin construction of Diquis hydroelectric plant, which would boast a 650MW capacity. </p><h4>In recent months, ICE has been undertaking huge investments to expand 3G and 4G coverage in 33 new regions. What have been some of the main highlights of this project?</h4><p>There are two things that are most important for us, namely wireless coverage and internet access. We are in a constant process of optimization and introducing new improvements to our coverage. We have been making advances in fiber optics, and we still have room to expand further in what we call the “last mile," which is the section in which we still have a great deal of copper. In terms of growing our provision of 3G and 4G services, the best is still yet to come with direct fiber-optic connectivity. In this sense, we can begin the processes of developing applications, as there are intelligent cities, intelligent homes, and a wide availability of services that many developed countries have been implementing. </p><h4>Costa Rica will soon achieve its goal of 100% renewably sourced electricity generation, mainly from hydro energy. How did this project come together, and how do you foresee Costa Rica achieving this goal?</h4><p>Everything depends on the plan of development that we have in place, which is adequately balanced, and the hydrological and meteorological conditions at play in Costa Rica. A year of constant generation using 100% renewable sources could be achieved; however, the cost would be high. A balance between risk and benefit should reflect a bit of thermal generation, but in the vast majority of countries throughout the world, thermal energy plays a role of low importance. In 2015, thermal generation was 1.06%, while 4% of our energy supply in 2016 will come from thermal generation, due primarily to the dry weather. In the second quarter, we expect 0% thermal generation, which means that thermal generation of less than 2% is a possible scenario.</p><h4>Costa Rica and the ICE are greatly characterized by environmental responsibility. What are your main initiatives in this regard?</h4><p>We have always been associated with environmental and CSR initiatives. When we develop a project, we also generate employment opportunities for the people of the region; our priority is always the people of the region. We have several key measures in terms of the study of environmental impact. We seek to compensate the communities with social work. All our plants are certified, and we are advancing with ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 18001. We have contributed in important ways for many years, declaring zones of reservation, as is the case with Reventazon. In our geothermal projects, all of the steam and water extracted from the soil is then injected back into it, which guarantees that there are no types of environmental pollution. We have systems that are set out at the start of a plant's operation in which we establish different environmental parameters, and we monitor these throughout plant's operation to detect any changes. This approach has, thus far, been successful. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main highlights for the coming year of the National Energy Plan 2015-2030?</h4><p>Firstly, this plan was the first one made via the participation of different actors in society. The second feature is that after hearing what the participants had to say we decided to work on the main pillars that synthesize what we wanted to do during the next 15 years: energy efficiency, optimal distributed generation, sustainable energy matrix, environmentally friendly vehicle fleet, sustainable power development, sustainable public transport system, and cleaner fossil fuels. In 2015, 75.3% of Costa Rica's energy was generated by water, 12.8% by the gas of the volcanoes, 10.08% by wind, 0.77% by biomass, 0.01% by solar, and 1.04 % by fuel. We now have about a 70% participation rate of hydro generation in our matrix; on the other hand, we know water will be a scare resource in the coming decades and there is a need to diversify the energy matrix. We need to bring online new sources such as solar and biomass, as we have a great deal of agricultural byproducts that could be used to generate electricity. The main objective underlying the Energy Plan is a national development model low in emissions orientated toward decarbonizing our economy. The plan then complies with the Costa Rican goal of carbon neutrality for 2021.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of investing in Costa Rica's energy sector and what steps are being taken to attract FDI?</h4><p>It is not easy to invest in the energy sector per se in Costa Rica. Even if foreign companies come to produce solar energy, electricity is owned by the state, which means that every kilowatt produced has to be sold to the state. The way that we have set up the market is that only 15% of the state-owned capacity we have in place to generate electricity can be placed for private generation. The market of fossil fuels is roughly the same, as there is only one state-owned company that imports all fossil fuels in Costa Rica to be distributed by private distributors. On the other hand, oil exploration in Costa Rica has been forbidden until 2021 by an executive decree signed by the President and myself, which, again, complies with our commitment in the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><h4>How does the ministry work with local authorities to combat illegal trafficking of protected species?</h4><p>We have addressed the problem of illegal trafficking of protected species by establishing different mechanism to prevent and combat it. The most recent one is an agreement that I signed with the Minister of Public Security and the President of the Supreme Court to establish a National Commission on Environmental Security with the mandate to fight criminal organizations that traffic wildlife species. With this, we are now capable of working with international security bodies such as INTERPOL, which helps to identify these groups. We have been able to capture some criminals trafficking rosewood, which is a precious wood. At the moment, we have an important fiscal crisis, but ultimately when there is more resources available, all these institutional arrangements will provide the required muscle for the government to combat the illegal trade of wildlife species.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for 2017?</h4><p>I would like to see more electric vehicles on our streets and a better and environmental friendly public transport system in place, along with higher quality fossil fuels in the market. With better fossil fuels we will have better cars, which means less pollution and more fuel efficiency, leading to less imported fossil fuels. I would also like to see a more diverse energy matrix, including more solar and biomass. And more resources employed in our protected wildlife areas. These among a very broad agenda we still have for the next two years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us more about the evolution of the company?</h4><p>We have an interesting history; our parent company is Sociedad de Seguros de Vida del Magisterio Nacional, which was established in 1920. In 1972, it expanded by means of a law on the private sector. From 1986, the company wanted to enter the insurance market but could not. It started selling commercial insurance from 1990 and created a portfolio until 2008, when a law opening the insurance market was passed. The company had an interesting portfolio, approximately 25,000 individual policyholders and 30,000-40,000 in collective insurances. On June 17, 2009, we were granted a license to act in the open market. Our license is the A02. We were the first private insurance company authorized to work in the open market</p><h4>What is the total composition of your portfolio and which products show the most potential in Costa Rica?</h4><p>We focus on insurance for people, namely individuals and group insurance. Within individuals, we focus on insurance that also includes the spouse and children of the principal registered in the policy, to try to look for an integral conjuncture of the whole family because when someone suffers an event it affects all the members of the family. For groups, we have made great progress; we work extensively with life groups as well as the insurance of debts for individuals who take loans with a financial institution. There, we have two types: original amount of debt and debt balance. We also work on funeral insurances, individuals, and as a type of insurance life group, and also have insurance for accidents. For example, if someone organizes an activity, race, or something for social responsibility, such as cleaning a beach, we provide insurance for the day. We operate only in Costa Rica. </p><h4>According to SUGESE, revenue by volunteer insurances increased 25% compared with the same period in 2015. What is your outlook for the next year in this regard?</h4><p>The market looks set to grow, though not as rapidly as it grew in the initial years. We expect growth, especially because life and medical insurance have grown a great deal. We will continue to offer group insurance as it is a great way to attract people. We have contracts with about 15-17 brokers, non-exclusive agents approximately between 10 and 15, and three to four dealers of auto-expendable insurance. There was an insurance market in Costa Rica after the monopoly, though there was no culture of insurance. However, over the years, it has improved and developed through campaigns conducted by insurance superintendent SUGESE and by the insurance companies. Now, people know not only about insurance, but also the rights that they have, what they can buy, how they can make claims, and so on. Awareness has improved a great deal compared to 2008. </p><h4>What are your goals and targets for the next year?</h4><p>We will finish 2016 with an expectation of sales that we have to fulfill. For 2017, we expect to fulfill the goals of 2016 and add new goals for stronger growth. We expect to grow 12% in 2016. In 2015, we grew by about 20-22%. Currently, we have 44 employees. For 2016, we expect to finish the development of three new products; in fact, we have one that will come out soon called SM Integral. We plan to release two more products and to also offer our products to the entire Costa Rican market. For 2017, we expect to continue with our goals and focus on collective insurance. We are also focused on the magisterial sector as it is our owner and shareholder. It is important to mention as well our value added, which is customer service. This is where we guarantee our insurers and beneficiaries a quick response in time and efficient in paying compensation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[starting-from-young]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the decision by INS to forego the price war, and how do you protect your profits?</h4><p>In the insurance business, it is important to make a great profit; however, our main goal is to offer trust and the best services in the market. In the past year, our strategy has been trifold—to improve services, reduce costs, and manage our assets more efficiently—and those changes ultimately have benefited our customers. Even before 2008, when the monopoly was broken, we faced illegal competition. Therefore, we have become a more competitive and stronger insurance company, because of the challenges we knew were coming. We continue to assess the market needs and work on meeting the needs and wants of our customers. Consequently, this quarter we have doubled our profits compared to last year.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your investment in public works and other projects in the pipeline?</h4><p>In 2015, we announced that we would invest USD25 million on a road from San José to San Ramón; however, work on the road has not started. This road has to be built by a trust subscribed by Conavi and the Bank of Costa Rica; they have signed an agreement and we expect them to be ready to start building the road soon. We recently also announced our plans to invest USD35 million on a road to Cartago that will possibly begin in March 2017. Another project is the Mega Firemen Station, which consists of two large buildings that will cost around USD25 million. It is a small project but we are excited to be part of that. These two buildings for the Metropolitan Area have to be ready by 2017.</p><h4>What steps are necessary to raise national awareness of insurance?</h4><p>Developing and implementing a financial education is a key strategy for us. We have a plan that involves different targets with educational resources and channels designed according to different customer segments to meet their specific needs and wants. It is imperative to start educating children from a young age. That is why in 2016 we started a project working with schools to educate children and parents about insurance, risks, and the ways they can prevent and manage them. We seek to develop a culture based on learning to identify, prevent, and handle risks and the intrinsic relationship between risks and insurance. This is important because the newer generations will be better protected and will understand and pass their knowledge to future generations.</p><h4>What do you identify as the main challenge here in Costa Rica?</h4><p>The first challenge is education, especially for the elderly because they have not received this type of education and information. In other words, some of them do not understand that when they buy insurance they are buying protection for their future. The other important challenge in Costa Rica is health. This is why we are strengthening our Health Services Conglomerate, especially for those sectors of the population that depend on public services. That is key because in doing so we also help the Department of Social Insurance, which is an important institution for everyone in Costa Rica. As the health system in Costa Rica is relevant in terms of social stability, we believe it is extremely imperative for us because we are a public institution and we could have a big impact in our society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of the cooperative and its various areas of operation?</h4><p>From the year we started to 1994, our company went through a steady evolution, but it was not until 1994 that we became supervised by SUGEF. That marked a new step in our company toward new growth and expansion. In 2001, we had around USD10 million in assets and 7,000 members, and for the current year we have increased to 30 branches and USD1.2 billion in assets. Because we are a credit union, the essence of cooperatism is to be a social organization, and instead of being focused on capital, it focuses on people. All the benefits of what comes out of the business are distributed among our members and also used for developing social and environmental strategies. Annually, we give around USD12 million in cash to members at the beginning of the year. Coopeservidores has a nearly 60 years' trajectory and the success of our work is due to our sustainability strategy, which is stablished over three major axis: the economical, the social, and the environmental. The main objective of our business is to bring overall wellness to our clients, transforming the economic wellness into social and environmental one.</p><h4>How does Coopeservidores combine its sustainability and innovation strategies with its investments?</h4><p>Our strategy also responds to this technological vision without loosing the humane feeling that has led us to become a much more digital and innovative cooperative, making everything easier without forgetting our environmental and social responsibility. Thanks to our greatly valuable ideas in this matter, nowadays we have become a reference point and example for the rest of the financial and cooperative sectors in Costa Rica. We have 30 branches but 28 of them are traditional branches where there is a counter and a person providing products and service. Today, we are proud to have fulfilled the requirements and certificate the entire company with the INTE 35-01-01 Social Responsibility Certification and the ISO 9001 Quality Certification. Also, all of our branches are already carbon neutral, this means that the cooperative takes care of its environmental impacts, specifically the ones that produce greenhouse gases. Hence, some of our new green objectives are to become a Positive Carbon and a paper free institution, especially in our back offices. This effort is strongly linked to several technological projects.</p><h4>Coopeservidores has signed an agreement with Procomer to provide credit to companies wanting to obtain the ESENCIAL country brand. What results have you seen so far?</h4><p>The country brand is Esencial Costa Rica, so we have been a 100% Costa Rican company since our foundation through to today. This alliance not only helps companies that want to obtain financial solutions, it will also help the ones that already have it and want to grow even more. This is not only a financial solution, but also developing them through the accompaniment and the development of their company. In addition to this alliance, the BID has given us USD50 million to support developeing companies, while another percentage is going toward social housing. As part of the alliance with PROCOMER, we have been analyzing six particular companies over the past two months; however, the potential is 250 and hopefully 1,000. We are structuring the process and analyzing who can be a part of it and how can we provide help and support along the process. Right now, we have started a process with the four core priorities of being digital, simple, innovative, and humane, asking ourselves how can we add value to people's lives. We are asking ourselves how we can translate this usually cold experience and transform it into something that they embrace, in a way that makes them feel they can trust us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main achievements and milestones on your 25th anniversary in Costa Rica? </h4><p>Desyfin started as a family entrepreneurship company in 1991, a dream of my father, who is the president of the company. After two or three years, my brothers, Mauricio and Manfred Lacayo, and my mother, Hortensia, joined the company; In the early years, our products and services were mainly focused on factoring; eventually we developed our portfolio providing additional solutions to our customers. We started off as a boutique financial institution targetting SMEs with good quality service and a strong customer focus. In 1997-1998, we became a regulated financial institution by SUGEF, Costa Rica's financial system regulator. Subsequently, we were able to issue bonds, offer certificate of deposits (CDs), savings accounts, and so on. </p><h4>Which of your services and products show the most potential in Costa Rica?</h4><p>SMEs are growing rapidly in Costa Rica, particularly those that do business with big suppliers and multinational companies in free zones. Once your financial products and services fulfil your customers' requirements, new business and growth opportunities open up and you are headed for success. Desyfin offers savings accounts, CDs, commercial, automobile, and housing loans, provides credit cards, and manages forex currencies, among other services. We have become a complete financial institution for these customers.</p><h4>Desyfin has seven branches in the area and recently invested USD100,000 in a new office in Grecia. Are you planning further expansion?</h4><p>We are always looking at locations with a high development rate in Costa Rica, where we can potentially expand to. We recently opened a branch in Limón (Guápiles). There was a large and significant project developing in that province, a USD4 billion hydroelectric project, and we decided to open a branch there to serve all the SMEs involved in that specific initiative. We currently have seven branches nationwide. </p><h4>The company is already in the process of becoming a bank. When do you expect this to be completed and what will this bring to Desyfin?</h4><p>For shareholders, becoming a bank definitely adds value to the company. As a bank it will also have lower cost of funds, access to cheaper and more credit, institutional lines of credit around the world, and greater reputation, all those benefits can be transferred to our customers. We expect to become a bank in the next two years, but there is no specific date yet.  This is an important process and we are working with Costa Rica's authorities to complete all the requirements. </p><h4>Desyfin has a diversified source of financial resources from banks from all over the world. What opportunities does this bring to the company?</h4><p>About 60% of our funding is external. Our main source of financial resources are coming from different banks and government institutions,  such as DEG from Germany, FMO Entrepreneurial Development Bank from the Netherlands, Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) from the US, Norfund from Norway, and MicroVest from the US. In 2008, during the financial crisis, many commercial banks, for instance Citibank and Bank of America, were strongly impacted during this crisis, and we would have been in trouble if we had relied only on them. This diversified credit structure that we pursue has been an effective strategy in terms of diversifying our risk. At the moment, we have access to credit lines from Europe and the US, as well as banks in Panama and other countries and regions around the world. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the sector in the mid term? </h4><p>We are pursuing the license to become a bank; our next step would be to expand our business to Central America. We hope to accomplish this goal in the next five years. Our plan is to start operations in one of those countries, then move to a new country every year; however, that decision has not been taken yet. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the ministry reducing the country's fiscal deficit?</h4><p>When we took office, we did an in-depth analysis of the main finance indicators and policies that had been implemented until then and came to the conclusion that there had been a certain disarticulation. An example of this is that between 2008 and 2010, there was a strong increase in public wages; however, no new resources were created to finance this expenditure. The technological apparatus inherited was old-fashioned. Now, we have focused on income, expenses, and new technologies to improve tax collection. We have implemented several new laws. In terms of expenses, for example, we passed new laws on pensions that are funded by the national budget. Within the focus on expenses, the Caja íšnica concept is a mechanism through which certain resources get transferred from a ministry to its decentralized agencies. In terms of income priorities, we have approved a draft law to tackle smuggling, while two others are about to be approved dealing with fiscal fraud. In this context we have five more draft law projects lined up: VAT, income tax, public employment, exonerations, and fiscal rule. </p><h4>How do you assess the commitment made by the government to spend less and raise more revenue without raising taxes?</h4><p>We have put a lot of the ministry's effort into collecting more and spending less. For example, we have implemented e-tools for people to pay taxes directly on the ministry's website. That change contributed to increasing the overall number of tax returns 18% more than expected. We also created more synergies within the ministry's main areas of work in order to increase the level of tax intelligence. For example, we have increased the number of taxpayer profiles in our database. In Costa Rica, we have a register of 490 large taxpayers to better understand the behavior of companies and improve the tax collection efforts of the government. We have seen that income tax has increased by 15% in the last two years. </p><h4>What is the current level of primary deficit?</h4><p>We calculate both the primary deficit and the financial deficit (the same, but including interest). In both 2014 and 2015, these deficits increased; however, in 2016 [data to October] we managed to reduce them. In 2016, the primary deficit was CRC519 billion, whereas in 2015 it was CRC702 billion, a reduction of CRC180 billion. Now, we are at a similar level as to that of 2013. Total income grew in 2016 by almost 9% and income on utilities is up by 14.5%. In this context, total expenses have only increased by 3.6%. This is key to reducing the primary deficit. The fiscal deficit in 2016 was at CRC1.2 billion, whereas in 2015 it was CRC1.35 billion, today representing 3.9% of GDP.</p><h4>What is the attraction of Costa Rica's finance sector for foreign investors? </h4><p>As a ministry, we leave the effort to attract foreign investment to other ministries and public organizations; having said that, we have been reducing interest rate, have a stable exchange rate, legal and regulatory stability, and are making continuous efforts to guarantee an ideal investment atmosphere. We are also increasing our available resources and have an effective treasury. We offer great macroeconomic and microeconomic stability. </p><h4>What are your key priorities for the rest of your administration?</h4><p>We want to continue implementing the same types of policies and actions we have done for the last couple of years: e-taxation and the implementation of new technologies in most of our processes. Overall, we are satisfied with the work done up until this moment, for the development of the country from the moment we took over has been palpable. At the same time, we believe there is still a lot we can do and will work toward that end. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the group's plans to expand operations and facilities in Costa Rica?</h4><p>We operate three FTZs and the strategy varies in each one. In Cartago, for example, we have chosen to buy third-party warehouses and refurbish them. In Alajuela's FTZ, we identified an increasing demand for space in the industrial area, mainly due to logistical growth in the area. This demand comes especially from foreign companies. In Alajuela's FTZ, we have focused on large warehouse facilities due to the strategic location in the Pacific corridor, as well as proximity to key infrastructure points in the country. For example, we recently completed a deal for a 3,500sqm warehouse and have plans to develop a new 12,000sqm warehouse in 2017. We see great potential in Heredia's FTZ for the near future and have ambitious plans in terms of new warehouses. Besides, from an innovation and technological point of view, there is definitely potential in the area. For example, this new warehouse we plan to build will represent a turning point in terms of innovation and technological services among our facilities. We are currently holding talks with a company producing medical devices, as well as with other companies from the logistics industry. We plan to develop four new warehousing modules in this FTZ.</p><h4>How is your portfolio of companies in your FTZs divided, and what are the main markets they export to?</h4><p>Multinational companies mainly from Europe and the US operate in our industrial parks. These two markets are the main exporting points for our partner companies. Other firms also export to Asia and exports to Central America and the Caribbean are strong too. There are plenty of local companies operating in our industrial parks, close to 70 associated companies. We have a diverse profile of companies operating in these industrial parks, as well as a number of local manufacturers that are not subject to the conditions of the FTZs and operate mainly in the food and distribution sectors. We also have to highlight the role of the highly-skilled Costa Rican workforce in all these developments, which is crucial for achieving successful operations.  </p><h4>What strategy is the company implementing to attract new companies?</h4><p>We identified the medical devices sector as one of the key industries for our operations. We also understood that the metalworking industry is among the most attractive for our operations, given its special focus on several segments such as aerospace. Finally, the plastic injection industry is one of the main focuses for growth in our FTZs. In terms of attracting companies to our industrial parks, we have partnered with CINDE, which is a private organization with a public objective. CINDE has been labeled as one of the best agencies in the world in terms of attracting foreign investment. We also work alongside Procomer Costa Rica. Additionally, we do our own promotion with tools such as our own magazine and by being present in chambers of commerce and other relevant organizations.</p><h4>What are the main priorities for Z GROUP in 2017?</h4><p>We want to further consolidate and grow our activity in the previously mentioned sectors, partnering with strategic companies to enable them to take their operations to the next level. The development of the 12,000sqm warehouse is one of our top priorities for 2017, too. We believe this facility will represent a turning point in our activities and development. We have achieved a great deal of recognition at the local level for our efforts to contribute to the development of Costa Rica and we ought to continue this way. For example, in 2015 Cadexco recognized us for our continued exporting efforts after over 30 years of activity in Costa Rica. Moreover, FDI magazine, which belongs to the Financial Times Group, recently recognized the Cartago Industrial Park as the best FTZ in Central America of the year 2016. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-tempting-offer]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess AZOFRAS' contribution to the development of free trade zones in Costa Rica, and how do you support these companies?</h4><p>Our main contribution is to support these companies from a political perspective. This means representing the sector within the government; for example, with the Ministry of Finance when it comes to customs service, the Ministry of Health with operation permits, or with Procomer, the principal regulatory body. We offer representation and institutional support, not promotion, which is done by Jorge Sequeira and his team from CINDE. We fully believe in the division of responsibilities; they bring investors to the country. Procomer decides whom to authorize as a free zone company, and Azofras defends and represents them. </p><h4>Which sectors are showing the most potential for the coming years, and how is AZOFRAS working to attract new companies to these sectors?</h4><p>At the moment, we have two important sectors. One is the life sciences sector, which includes medical devices and pharmaceutical. The other is services and includes companies such as HP, Procter and Gamble, IBM, and Intel, for example. At the moment, these segments are our introduction letter to potential investors. In the future, Costa Rica should modify its entire scheme and aggressively look for companies focused on human capital. We need to promote R&amp;D with new medicines, but in a wider form. Each year, the universities graduate many biologists, chemical engineers, and doctors; yet, there is not enough work to absorb them all. To create needed labor opportunities, it is necessary to think about incentives beyond the reduction of taxes; things like providing support for a specialized workforce. We need schemes that allow companies to fully benefit from setting up here. </p><h4>There are now 80,000 people working in free zones in Costa Rica. COMEX said it will finance training programs for employees that want it. How is AZOFRAS working together with COMEX in this regard?</h4><p>We are part of this project, and in some respects it is financed by us. Companies that belong to the free trades zone finance approximately 60-70% of Procomer's budget. We are actively taking part in this; we go to the companies and ask them what they need. Though the level of trust is still in its early stage, we are getting there. </p><h4>Costa Rica has the fifth most companies operating in free zones in the region at 313. What competitive advantages do firms have coming here instead of elsewhere?</h4><p>One clearly defined advantage is the ease of access to the largest market in the world, the US. We have many daily flights to the east and west coasts. Several North American companies are flying to smaller, but still important cities inside the North American economy. Equally, we enjoy another relevant factor, which is that we have had a relatively stable economy during the last 30 years. A firm macro-economic footing has given the country a stable path, and this is a clear advantage. Our workforce is also significant, especially Costa Ricans' open minds and ability to listen and adapt to new things. Even those with only a secondary education can have the skills to adapt and be innovative people. Costa Ricans are proactive people. </p><h4>What are Azofra's main priorities for 2017?</h4><p>We have to find out how to consolidate ourselves. We are in a democratic country where human rights are respected, and congress is sovereign. There is a debate about fiscal reform being presented to the Legislative Assembly by the President of Costa Rica, which has still to be put into discussion at Congress. Therefore, our priority is to follow up with this issue while avoiding possible fluctuations in the future. Our aim is to keep an eye on what happens in congress in the next months and make our best efforts to keep the status quo without modifications. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of AMCHAM's most significant activities in its more than 40 years of operation?</h4><p>AMCHAM has been a constantly growing and evolving organization and one of the strongest chambers, because of its diverse membership base, representing not only commercial activities, but also those in industry, pharmaceuticals, tourism, shared services, logistics, and education, for example. Our membership base consequently feeds 19 different committees and forums that work on specific issues. We have 365 members, which is a nice healthy base. There are several sectors showing potential, especially those in the services sector, in which Costa Rica has evolved from transactional functions to multifunctional sophisticated processes that include financial analysis, regional centers, software development and IT, as well as engineering and design. In the Life Sciences sector, Costa Rica has developed to become Latin America's leading Med Tech hub. Over 250 high-tech manufacturing companies have chosen Costa Rica as their hub for creating a competitive, solid business operation. Costa Rica is well known for its education and literacy levels; however, when it comes to specific technical support, the local workforce can only satisfy an average 80% of the labor demand, leaving 20% of the necessary labor to be brought in from abroad. We need to match future growth with our education so that we can provide jobs for Costa Ricans. </p><h4>What percentage of AMCHAM is comprised of American companies, and what percentage is made up of other foreign and local companies?</h4><p>The breakdown between the two is a nearly even split; we have a lot of domestic companies because they see the importance of that US commercial relationship. This relates to another part of what we do: going to the US and meeting with legislators to discuss specific topics related to trade. We participate with the blanket chamber of commerce in the US, AACCLA, and we study the emerging trends at conventions that we hold three times a year. </p><h4>Can you highlight some of the goals for AMCHAM over the next year?</h4><p>We want to strengthen our committees even further, putting more technically oriented individuals on them. Meeting with the presidential candidates and presenting our voice and what our membership base wants to see happen is also a fundamental action for 2017. We also want to continuously support gender equality, as this is something that we hold passionately in our hearts as an American chamber. More services will be offered to our associates, and we are working diligently on our telecommunications and social media resources. We want to reach out not just to our membership base and politicians, but also to the general public, so as to further integrate our interests with those of the country. The number of employees collectively working for the members of our Chamber is about 300,000 people, which multiplied by 10 equals 3 million people—3 million people that we can influence directly and indirectly if we can better utilize a comprehensive communications and social media strategy. We want to work closely with the US, and one of the things that we feel adamant about is protecting this diamond, this jewel. There is a need to support a security tax in law that has not yet been voted on. Another goal is to gain more members around the country, especially in the outer regions, to collectively strengthen our organization so that it better represents all of the territories. We have a consolidated presence in 75% of the territories, but we want to increase that figure to 90%. The business environment here in Costa Rica has great potential. If we can keep everyone in the middle of the road and do the things correctly, maintain low government costs, and maximize investments in the country, we can help improve the collection of taxes and close some of the current funding gaps. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The IMF predicted a 4.2% growth for Costa Rica's GDP in 2016. Which sectors do you think will drive this growth? </h4><p>Costa Rica initiated a process of economic openness back in the 1980s with the objective of opening the country to the global economy and reaching different foreign markets. Before this strategic move, the country's economy was based on the agricultural sector, especially coffee and bananas. In the 1980s, Costa Rica began diversifying its economy and focused on high technologies and generating added value. With the arrival of Intel in the 1990s, we developed an industrial park focused on microprocessors and high technology. On top of that, Costa Rica based the diversification of its economy on its educated and highly qualified workforce. Today, we export more than 5,000 products, none of which represent more than 3-4% of Costa Rica's current volume of total exports. We have certainly seen a slowdown in FDI compared to growth rates in the past. This, however, does not mean that we do not attract FDI. We have become an economy based on services, which represents 40% of our GDP. Additionally, the financial industry, especially in terms of back office services, is one of the sectors experiencing the most promising developments in recent years. The multimedia design and software engineering industry has rapidly developed lately, and we also see interesting opportunities there. </p><h4>What actions does the Chamber of Commerce implement in order to attract foreign investment?</h4><p>In many cases, we are the initial contact point for investors arriving in the country. At the same time, the country has its own agency that promotes the arrival of investment into the country: CINDE. We also offer follow-up processes to foreign companies that arrive in the country to understand if everything goes well or if they need assistance. The country needs to work on energy tariffs in order to become even more competitive on the international stage. We have taken positive steps in the generation of energy through renewables, and we now need to take the next step forward in order to make tariffs more competitive and eliminate possible monopolies.</p><h4>What do you think will be the impact of the FTA signed with Colombia?</h4><p>That was the only FTA we missed to complete the agreements with the Pacific Alliance founding members. We ratified this FTA with Colombia in 2016 after three years of negotiations. It is too early to estimate the impact of this FTA; however, it will open doors to better market our products and services throughout South America. We should strengthen and consolidate the network of commercial offices in those countries in order to have better commercial position there as a country. The next natural step would be integration into the Pacific Alliance, and this FTA will help us further align in the commercial and economic area with those countries.</p><h4>What are the opportunities offered by the Pacific Alliance to countries like Costa Rica?</h4><p>President Luis Guillermo Solí­s does not believe in free trade and has already said that the Pacific Alliance project is something that we should put on hold. I believe the Pacific Alliance is a brilliant idea; however, it will not move forward under Solí­s' presidency. This again brings up the public expenditure problem; the president said that as long as there are no more taxes, there will not be a Pacific Alliance. However, the true problem has to do with the excessive public expenditures. We need to move forward as a country the same way that we have been doing throughout the last three decades by opening our economy to the world. The Pacific Alliance can bring positive changes to our economy such as adjustments in the way that we do business by implementing a model that better facilitates business, as well as the way local and transnational companies operate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The IMF predicted a 4.2% growth for Costa Rica in 2016. What fundamentals have led that growth? </h4><p>Costa Rica is a country with almost three decades of continued and uninterrupted growth, which has led to a much more diversified economy. We export over 2,000 products. In the last few years, services and new technologies have gained a lot of momentum. In terms of services, we have seen the establishment of service centers across the country in different economic sectors. We also have diversified and strong agribusiness exports. This diversification has allowed us to not suffer as much when prices of a certain commodity such as coffee drop and has insulated us from international crises. Another of the strong features of our economy is that we have a strong domestic market, with people enjoying a relatively good consuming power, especially compared to the rest of the region. Costa Rica enjoys a consolidated political, economic, and regulatory stability that makes our country an attractive destination for FDI. On top of that, we have registered zero inflation for two consecutive years, we enjoy freedom and good capital flows, we have enjoyed internal peace for over 100 years, we have low violence rates, and the public and private sectors always look to create synergies and jointly develop the economy of Costa Rica. </p><h4>What are the sectors with the greatest potential to attract foreign investment?<br></h4><p>The service sector is among those with the greatest potential in Costa Rica. In this context, the tourism industry should be particularly highlighted, as it has in itself a great deal to offer, such as beaches, ecotourism, gastronomy, and mountain sports, for example. In 2016, we saw a nearly 20% increase in the number of visitors. However, the northern region is leading this growth, accounting for 30% of the increase in tourist arrivals. We have attracted a lot of investments in high technologies due to the fact that we have a highly qualified and skillful workforce. Costa Rica needs to invest in rail and road infrastructure. Additionally, the fishery industry and maritime logistics have not been fully exploited and still present a lot of potential. There is also room for improvement in the export of agricultural goods with greater added value. Costa Rica has attracted the investments of many companies that have relocated their businesses and call centers here. We offer a competitive regulatory and retribution package to these kinds of companies, and we have a competitive workforce to offer as well.</p><h4>What efforts are being carried out by the government regarding green policies?</h4><p>Over 50% of Costa Rica's consists of protected natural areas. Costa Rica is mainly made of volcanic soil, which is particularly fertile. Over the years, we have developed a strategy of national parks and protected areas. We have always prioritized green policies and the protection of the environment, implementing energy policies based on renewables and 2016 we will achieve a surplus of energy generated from renewables. We have put a lot of effort into solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal energy and have promoted the use of renewable energies among the private sector. We also have nationwide plans for recycling plastics and paper, an effort in which the education sector is heavily involved. We need to further invest in wastewater and solid waste treatment, which are two areas set to offer plenty of opportunities for private investors to collaborate with the state on the development of joint projects.</p><h4>How does the Ministry work on attracting foreign investment to Costa Rica?</h4><p>Costa Rica enjoys highly valued bilateral relationships with many countries, and we are stable from a macroeconomic point of view. We also have the tools and conditions to attract foreign investment through free trade zones, the availability of qualified and skilled human resources, high quality education, and a strong network and strategy of promotion at the international level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[stretching-out]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which areas is the ministry focusing for 2016?</h4><p>We have a busy agenda because the international community is becoming more and more complex every day, particularly in terms of terrorism, immigration, drug trafficking, and climate change, as well as subchapters of all these topics and many others. One of the things we have promoted in this administration, is an institutional reform as well. We want to be more effective, more efficient, and more transparent as a whole in the government. Another thing we are pushing for strongly in 2017 is new destinations for our diplomatic relationships. Central Asia is one area that we have explored. I visited Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan in October 2015, which was the first time ever for Costa Rica and represents the start of a good relationship. Azerbaijan is going to open an embassy here and we are planning to have an embassy in Azerbaijan. Another region we want to expand in is the Gulf. We have an embassy in Qatar, but we would like more, like in the United Arab Emirates. Another destination we have been working on is Brunei. Many things are going on; we are trying to promote new destinations and not just work on the multilateral level, but to create the possibility of investments and trade. </p><h4>What is your position on the Pacific Alliance?</h4><p>The Pacific Alliance is not only about trade; it involves many other aspects: visas, cooperation, integration of stock exchanges, and so on. Trade is one of the main and most controversial pillars. When we arrived to office, there was not much clarity on what the previous administration had done except announce that we were candidates to enter the Alliance. Therefore, we needed to go into the process of scouting and finding information. There are still some sensitive sectors, such as agriculture and manufacturing, but they always complain about everything related to FTAs. There are structural problems that need to be addressed with or without the alliance. One barrier to the signing of the Pacific Alliance is the structure of our congress. We have nine parties and the government only has 13 members out of 57, which makes it difficult to get anything through congress. We need to think about what is more important: fiscal reforms or the Pacific Alliance. </p><h4>How would you assess bilateral relations between Costa Rica and the Caribbean region, and what areas of bilateral trade have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Central America and the Caribbean region should be like a domestic market, because our market is too small. Our trade relations with Central America are active. We have about USD1 billion trade with Guatemala and around USD800 million with Nicaragua. The Central American common market has existed since the 1960s. Infrastructure in the region needs improving, and we are working on that. With the Caribbean, we have an FTA that was approved by our congress in 2004. Unfortunately, many countries in the Caribbean are still to ratify the agreement. The agreement would be good for our SMEs, but it would be a fantasy to say that SMEs are going to export to the US overnight' we need the Central American experience. </p><h4>What are your priorities and targets as minister for the next year?</h4><p>We will see what the world brings. We have an expectation of opening an embassy in Indonesia, which so many people call the seat of ASEAN. We will open the embassy in Azerbaijan in 2017 and Costa Rica will continue to be active multilaterally, particularly in the UN and OAS. We have only 47 embassies around the world and five of them are multilateral while, for example Cuba has 140 and Turkey about the same. We have to be more efficient at the multilateral level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[true-values]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Costa Rica and UNESCO have always shared core common values such as a commitment to peace and development. How do you evaluate the contribution of Costa Rica to the Organization?</h4><p>Costa Rica has a long and deep commitment to UNESCO. Our partnership builds on shared values such as on human rights and dignity and cuts across Costa Rica's government and society, including the National Commission for UNESCO, the Ministry of Education, and private and non-governmental partners. We see this in Costa Rica's leadership of the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program, which supports efforts to safeguard natural and managed ecosystems and advance innovative approaches to economic development that are socially and culturally appropriate and environmentally sustainable. This is deeply relevant in the context of the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate that was adopted in December 2015, not to mention the new UN Development Agenda for 2030.</p><h4>UNESCO's field office in San José works toward achieving the organization's goals in the region of Latin America and the Caribbean. What are the main aspects of UNESCO activities in the region? </h4><p>The UNESCO San José Office works with five countries in the region, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. Our action stretches across the spectrum from providing technical cooperation through capacity development (for example, for Ministries of Education and Planning) to supporting public policy development (for example, through the revision of education policies in the light of the 2030 Agenda) and knowledge generation (in Technical and Vocational Education and Training, teacher training, early childhood education, and children out of school). The activities of the UNESCO San José Office have enabled the Central American region to receive effective and rapid responses to direct assistance when needed. An example of the challenge of social inclusion is where UNESCO has been active in supporting the capacities and engagement of youth as well as indigenous people. UNESCO works across the region to combat discrimination and racism and to deepen tolerance and mutual respect, especially for marginalized communities. All of this work is the result of partnerships with governments and societies across the region—including the private sector—which are all brought together by shared values, a commitment to build more inclusive and peaceful societies, and a new harmony with the planet and the region's unique biodiversity and outstanding cultural heritage and diversity. This includes a sharp focus on supporting freedom of expression, enhancing the safety of journalists, advancing scientific cooperation, notably on water management and risk reduction, and education for peace and human rights. </p><h4>At its 40th session, the World Heritage Committee decided not to put the Costa Rica-Panama trans-boundary Reserve of Talamanca La Amistad on the List of endangered sites until the committee does further evaluation in 2017. What factors led to this decision, and what other sites are now being evaluated?</h4><p>During the 40th session of the World Heritage Committee, which took place in Istanbul in July 2016, members examined the state of conservation of more than 150 World Heritage properties. Members welcomed the commitment of Panama and Costa Rica to the safeguarding of World Heritage, as evidenced by the constructive dialogue established by both states' parties in the framework of the recently launched joint Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) process. The committee decided to support these efforts by providing an additional year for both state parties to complete the SEA, which will no doubt strengthen their relationship and relations with local communities and NGOs. Although the state parties have made a strong commitment to developing appropriate mechanisms in order to avoid and mitigate any negative impact on the Outstanding Universal Value of the property, the Committee reiterated its position that any development of new hydropower projects prior to the finalization and adequate review of the SEA for the entire property would lead to its inscription on the World Heritage List in Danger. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In November 2014, we had the distinguished visit of President Luis Guillermo Solí­s to El Salvador. On that occasion we decided to give a new impetus to the ties that have united our two nations for more than 170 years, when the Salvadoran José Marí­a Cañas, a hero of the Central American war in the fight against the filibusteros, arrived in Costa Rica.</p><p>It was during the visit of President Solí­s that we agreed to reach a Strategic Partnership Agreement between our nations, to deepen the dialogue and develop joint initiatives in matters of political, social, and economic cooperation. Today, it is with great satisfaction that we celebrate the realization of this commitment. We have just signed the Strategic Partnership Agreement between Costa Rica and El Salvador, an instrument that will expand political dialogue on bilateral, regional, and international issues of mutual interest. This agreement will strengthen trade and investment, expand cooperation, and promote exchanges and the development of joint ventures in educational, scientific, and cultural fields.</p><p>We are countries with good practices and experiences in many fields. A sample I highlighted to President Solí­s is the valuable support that the Universidad Estatal a Distancia (UNED) and its rector, Luis Carpio, have given us to create the Universidad en Lí­nea Educación a Distancia in El Salvador. We are extremely grateful to UNED for the enormous organizational effort deployed to bring us their experience.</p><p>We have launched the 2014-2016 Technical and Scientific Cooperation Program in areas such as education, security, health, social protection, childhood and adolescence, tourism, housing, and cooperation for development. We are now identifying possible projects to be integrated into the 2017-2019 program. Likewise, in terms of trade and investment we have an important dynamic. In 2015 alone, our bilateral trade amounted more than USD506 million. In terms of investments, Costa Rica has significantly increased its presence in El Salvador in recent years, especially in areas of energy generation, construction services, machinery, industry, and air services. We will continue to strengthen this growing relationship. Soon our authorities will inaugurate the new ferry that will operate between the Port of La Unión Centroamericana in El Salvador and Puerto Caldera in Costa Rica. This is a private sector effort that will streamline trade, reduce costs, ease the border crossing, and reduce road impact.</p><p>In another area, we are exploring the possibility of sharing the physical space of our embassy in Australia to house our diplomatic headquarters in that nation. We have also discussed issues on the regional agenda that we promote through the Central American Integration System (SICA). We are convinced that we must continue to work on issues that are crucial for our peoples, such as democratic security, social integration, the fight against poverty, economic integration, climate change, comprehensive risk management, and the strengthening of institutions. The Strategic Partnership Agreement that we signed allows us to take advantage of the potential we have.</p><p>We are going through an important moment in this solid relationship, not only for having reached the 170th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties, but also for the launch of these initiatives that strengthen our ties of brotherhood and cooperation.</p><p>I reiterate my gratitude to President Solí­s for the opportunity to meet. We reiterate our vows to continue deepening the bonds of friendship, knowing that all this work translates into clear benefits for the citizens of El Salvador and Costa Rica. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What efforts is the current administration taking to improve the investment climate and promote employment creation?</h4><p>The country's economic growth is based upon the strengthening of institutions, infrastructure development, macroeconomic stability, and the development of our human capital. This is why our efforts have been focused on these four essential pillars to develop the basis of the second part of our program. To do so, we launched the 20/20 Honduras Project, which aims to improve the business climate, while focusing on the development of the following areas: agribusiness, textiles, business services (call centers), tourism, intermediate manufacturing, and housing. Taken together, we hope this initiative will generate 600,000 jobs, attract investments of USD13 billion, and boost exports. These six economic sectors are where the Honduran economy really has the potential to take off and generate enough jobs to meet the needs of the population. We already have a solid growth of 3.6% of GDP, but we think we can reach more with the implementation of the 20/20 Honduras Project. We are also organizing a scholarship system that will allow us to train and develop our human resources with priority given to areas related to the 20/20 Honduras Project.</p><h4>How will the government increase the country's competitiveness inside and outside the region?</h4><p>The elements for increasing our competitiveness all lay within the four previously mentioned pillars. In the short term, investment in infrastructure will be one of the most important elements because it will turn Honduras into a logistics corridor for all of Central America. To do so, we are building a series of corridors and improving port facilities in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Fonseca, which gives us access to the Pacific Ocean. We also have a plentiful and potentially well-qualified workforce that has already shown its strength in the maquila manufacturing industry and in rendering various business services. Furthermore, we have made important changes in the electricity sector. Since our energy production is increasingly based on renewable sources, foreign investors can be confident that their production does not jeopardize the environment. Finally, we have made various legislative advances that enhance foreign investors' legal protections, not to mention improved our competitiveness, both of which are reflected in our international rankings. For example, we moved up 23 places in the World Economic Forum's global rankings from 111th in 2014 to 88th in 2016. We know this is a difficult and long-term process, but our goal is to continue moving forward and make the country more competitive. </p><h4>Compared to 2014, Foreign Direct Investment in Honduras grew by 5.2% in 2015. Which economic sectors are most attractive for Costa Rican investment and which have the greatest potential for growth?</h4><p>Our economy is growing steadily in most of the key economic sectors, especially telecommunications, energy, finance, and construction. While these four have the potential to continue growing even more, we also need to incentivize labor-intensive sectors that generate employment, since the aforementioned sectors, with the exception of construction, do not generate mass employment. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight that we will continue promoting these sectors, as they are essential pillars for fostering the productivity and growth of other sectors, and can help strengthen this country's total productive capacities. There is a plan underway in the construction sector to invest more than USD2 billion, with which we will lay the foundations of economic expansion and the creation of thousands of jobs.</p><h4>You have expressed your desire for Costa Rica to rejoin the Central American Integration System (SICA). How is this process developing and what would be the impact for Costa Rica? </h4><p>We were able to reintegrate Costa Rica into SICA after it had left the organization during a summit in El Salvador. Costa Rica is a crucial component for regional integration, and my efforts helped bring about these positive results. Central American countries must be united and devote themselves to economic and political integration. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In October 2015, the Uruguay-Costa Rican Chamber of Commerce was inaugurated to increase the trade flow between the two countries, create investment, and intensify cultural exchange. In which areas do you believe relations between the two countries can be enhanced?</h4><p>The creation of the chamber was a step in the right direction toward sealing an ever-closer relationship between two growing countries. Trade relations between Uruguay and Costa Rica over the last 13 years have followed a positive trend, and we are happy that Costa Ricans increasingly choose the products that Uruguay exports. Exports from Uruguay to Costa Rica grew by an average of 28% between 2003 and 2015, and imports increased, to a somewhat lesser extent, by 18%. Trade between Uruguay and Costa Rica still has a lot of potential. Uruguayan exports were about USD17 million in 2015, while imports were USD4.7 million. The main products that Uruguay currently exports are food, beverage concentrates, and pharmaceuticals; meanwhile, medical equipment, boxes, and telephones were imported from Costa Rica. It is important to mention that between the two economies there are areas that have not yet been exploited. In this regard, in the food and beverages sector, where Uruguay is an exporter of quality products, Costa Rica is a market with potential, especially in the fruit, beef, dairy products, cheeses, and other foodstuffs. There are also opportunities in substances and chemical products for human and animal medicines. In order to deepen the flow of exports to Costa Rica, in 2016 Uruguay XXI was established to bring Uruguayan exporters together. In addition to our excellent diplomatic relations, in July 2016 the agency for the promotion of exports and investments, Uruguay XXI, organized a workshop to access this market. We believe that Costa Rica, which has an excellent position in the "Doing Business" ranking of the World Bank, is an excellent door to enter a significant expanded market through its agreements in Central America and North America. In 2016, a business delegation and a prospective study were conducted with Uruguayan businessmen who held meetings with the competent authorities in tax regulation, intellectual and industrial property, and food registration. In the private sector, they conducted studies with lawyers, chambers of importers, and other people who have experience working with Uruguayan exporters, and sectorial chambers such as textiles and pharmaceuticals. These regular business visits are important because companies in both countries can explore real business opportunities. Uruguay XXI and the Chamber of Commerce of Costa Rica coordinated the meetings. With respect to possible investments, both Uruguay and Costa Rica are important recipients of FDI. In the last decade, FDI accounted for 5.2% of GDP in Uruguay and 5.9% in Costa Rica.</p><h4>Looking to the future, how do you visualize the evolution of relations between Uruguay and Central America, especially Costa Rica?</h4><p>There is much room for growth in economic and investment relations between Uruguay and Central America. In terms of investments, we are both net recipients of FDI. Given the similar size of our economies, they are interesting markets. Companies from each country can settle with scale operations similar to their domestic activities. In particular, relations between Uruguay and Costa Rica have even more potential, as it is one of the countries of Central America, along with Panama, that have the greatest economic dynamism. These cultural, political, and economic affinities, coupled with an approach of openness to trade and investment, are a relevant starting point for generating opportunities for exchange in all areas in the years to come. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	FDI in Costa Rica increased to USD2.8 billion in 2015. What is your outlook for 2016, and what are you doing to increase this figure?
</h4><p>
	The investment numbers have been steadily climbing in Costa Rica at a rate of around 14% per year, as has been the case for the last three years. This is important because it indicates that the strategy of promoting investment is successful. I travel and meet with many other leaders in Silicon Valley, New York, Chicago, and cities in Europe where we meet with people that culminates in more reposed and strategically orientated work of our investment promotion industry, CINDE, develops, as well as the work that Procomer, our export promotion agency. Word-of-mouth reference accounts for about 50% of all investments that we receive in Costa Rica. One of the things we do is invite those interested in working in and investing in Costa Rica to come and talk with people who are already working here, to give them a more accurate sense of what their investment would bring.</p><h4>Are there any particular countries or regions from which you are trying to increase foreign investment?</h4><p>
	We are looking at the whole world. Costa Rica is one of the most open economies in the world, with access through FTAs or relations to 2.5 billion people, which is a significant number. We do this on a general and a global basis because of the geographical closeness and because of our traditional linkages in the past, whereby most of our investments came from the US and Western Europe. However, we have seen other strategically important investments coming from China, Korea, and Australia. Our overall strategy remains broadly focused.</p><h4>What is being done on to address the fiscal deficit, and what is the significance of the reform in the accession of Costa Rica to the Pacific Alliance and the OECD?</h4><p>
	During the political campaign we made it clear that this would be the core issue of our administration. The fiscal deficit went from 2% to 6% in less than a decade, and 15 years later we are introducing reforms. We have divided the reforms into nine bills for income and expenditures, four of which have already been approved. Costa Rica wants high-standard services but does not want to pay for them, which negatively affects our accession to the Pacific Alliance and the OECD because if we do not have financial sustainability we cannot make the most of the advantages an FTA has to offer, nor can we compensate for the negative effects that these agreements can have upon certain sectors of the economy, particularly agriculture. Our unemployment rate is around 9%, and if we are not careful this could increase. We need to reform to be successful. In a general sense, the organization is happy and advances have been significant, and there are areas in which Costa Rica provides more than would be expected from a country of our size, such as our clean energy proficiency.</p><h4>What are your priorities in the region?</h4><p>
	Central America and the Caribbean is an easy area for us to relate to. The immediate region is almost an extension of our local markets. Obviously, the US and Europe are significant markets; over 50% of what we import and export comes from and goes to the US. We are probably the largest partner of the EU in Central America, which is significant in terms of our exports too. We are also active in Latin America beyond the greater Caribbean area. Our relations with Chile and Peru are significant, and the likelihood of an agreement between Costa Rica and the Pacific Alliance is still there, though this is a decision that will have to be made after we solve the deficit. We are interested in pursuing trade relations with Asia and expanding on our agreements there. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What distinguishes IBERO's approach to education from that of other institutions?</h4><p>Our commitment to society is what sets us apart from other private universities. We contribute to solutions that are relevant to society, particularly the thought and formation of ethical and social values among our students. A second difference is that we have an integral approach to help form their will, values, intuition, and creativity, for example—aspects of life not usually valued in a market-oriented university. The third difference is that we value academic quality in our research, teaching, and relationship with society, companies, and the public and social sector.</p><h4>Which programs have the highest demand?</h4><p>Our main degrees are architecture, law, communications, and administration. As for postgraduate degrees, marketing, finance, public administration, and nutrition are the most popular.</p><h4>How would you evaluate IBERO's relationship with the private sector, and how does it satisfy the requirements of the labor market? </h4><p>The connection with the private sector is still insufficient. We have to grow more. We recently created IBERO strategic consultants, offering consulting and connecting our teachers to the private sector, and having up-to-date professors and scholars. We have 50 or 60 contracts per year with the private sector in consulting and design. That is not a low number, but we still need to develop that area much more. We will also start a business school next year offering top-level programs, starting with an executive MBA.</p><h4>How is IBERO's relationship with other international institutions, and how is it perceived on an international level?  </h4><p>We are sending 600 students and receiving 250 students approximately from other universities each year. However, there is still room for growth. Our students are mostly going to the US, Spain, the UK, and Western Europe; the first two being the most important destinations. International students are coming mostly from France. They used to come in larger numbers from the US, but they come less so now. We are also receiving some students from Asia, mainly Japan. We have sought to strengthen our relationship with 200 Jesuit universities around the world. We are going to have an encounter with deans next year in order to benefit from this network, rather than with a region. In US, the most important ones are Georgetown, Fordham, University of San Francisco, Loyola University Chicago, and Marymount University. There is also Comillas in Spain and another in Tokyo.</p><h4>What new programs will you open in the near future?</h4><p>We will open an undergraduate program in actuarial science to fortify our capacity in mathematics. Also we are opening a postgraduate in migration studies with the University of San Francisco, and a PhD in Social Welfare with Boston College. This reflects our concern for social matters of international relevance.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the role of technology within the global strategy of IBERO? </h4><p>We understand that there are new ways of learning and producing knowledge that require technology, and thus we are at the forefront of the use of new educational technologies. It is strategic; we cannot have 20th century teachers teaching 21st century students.</p><h4>According to OECD's last PISA evaluation, Mexico occupies the last place. What has to be done to advance in this field and what role can the education reform play? </h4><p>Firstly, education needs to become a public matter, not a matter of state. It has been used for social control; the matter has not been debated publicly but instead decided by small groups inside the government. This needs to be debated by the public and by private and social entities, communities, and families. Secondly, there has to be an in-depth reform that educates and incorporates new technologies and pedagogical and didactic assets. An indisputable condition is to incorporate the teachers into these reforms, which has not been done. The latest reform is authoritarian; therefore, teachers are rejecting it because it has not broken the logic of control and does not incorporate their practices and experiences.</p><h4>What needs to be done to increase the number of Mexicans with advanced degrees?</h4><p>President Peña Nieto has a goal of 40% coverage in higher education, which is unreachable. The main problem in higher education is financing; therefore, we need to allocate more resources to higher education. It is also necessary to invest in higher education with multi-year budgets that do not need to be negotiated by deans every year. It also means investing in existing public universities of greater prestige and quality, not creating new, small and low-quality state universities. That has to do with corruption.</p><h4>How would you evaluate human capital and what is IBERO doing to develop it? </h4><p>While we have problems teaching mathematics, which is reflected in our lack of engineers, others are coming to recruit engineers in Mexico. On the other hand, there are too many programs that are not required, such as law, psychology, communications, and medicine. We still need to strengthen technical careers in the country. In Eastern societies, for every bachelor there are two or three technicians; here for every six graduates we have a technician. There is a field of work there, but universities are still not contributing. At IBERO, we are strengthening our high-level technical programs. We have five now and will have eight in three more years. At present we have 500 students in these areas, but we intend to have at least 1,000. It also contributes to social mobility.</p><h4>What is the role of education in fighting inequality and corruption? </h4><p>Education is key to having a conscious, participatory citizenship that can control its rulers and hold them accountable. Only with a well-educated citizenship can this be achieved. Education cannot be exclusively professional and technical, we also have to form citizens. On the other hand, inclusion is built from the family, the schools, and even the churches, although sometimes these exclude and do not incorporate. It is important for us to have an inclusive, plural university that is respectful of different ways of being human and will contribute to a more democratic society where the majorities that will govern guarantee the rights of minorities.</p><h4>What are the priorities of IBERO University for 2017?</h4><p>Our priorities will be to have a university more linked to society and to strengthen mechanisms for outside reality to be present on campus. We think that a Jesuit university cannot be isolated, but must be in constant feedback with the society from which it springs. A second priority is to make our community an inclusive and plural one by strengthening one of our most ambitious programs, which is the incorporation of students from popular sectors within the university. We plan to incorporate 2,000 students with full scholarships. A third priority is to increase research, graduate studies, and the impact of these theoretical-academic reflections on resolving the country's problems.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With your recent appointment as Secretary General of OPEC, which areas have you set as priorities in your agenda?</h4><p>When I took the position in August I felt the scope of the tasks and challenges in front of me required my immediate and undivided attention. My priority as I saw it was to address the problems affecting the oil market and its principle players, primarily OPEC's member countries. Since the middle of 2014 the industry has been struggling to cope with one of the most difficult cycles in its history. We have gone through similar periods in the past, but nothing perhaps so prolonged or as potentially damaging as the present downturn, which has left its mark on all facets of the industry. Today, we are still facing great uncertainty, characterized by an unstable market, excess crude oil production, and volatile crude prices which continue to lie at levels that are not meeting stakeholders' needs and pose a genuine threat to future investment in the sector. Add to these conditions of dwindling revenues, excessively high petroleum stocks, and huge manpower layoffs throughout the entire industry chain and one can fully appreciate the extent of the predicament we are in. Therefore, sustainable stability is really our watchword, as it has been since OPEC was formed over half a century ago.  I cannot stress enough how without a stable market and predictability of price we cannot plan for the future with any relative certainty. Stability is essential for future petroleum output expansion to flourish and it is required for economies around the world to grow and for governments to plan their budgets. That is why the historic agreement reached at the 171st Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Vienna at the end of November 2016 is so important. By agreeing to reduce production, together with non-OPEC producers, I am confident we can get back on the road to recovery more quickly and remove the destabilizing conditions we have all been suffering under for far too long now.</p><h4>OPEC's 'Algiers Accord' in September, followed by the organization's Vienna agreement at the end of November to set production caps among member states, has been extensively welcomed by global markets. What is the significance of this move to revamp the global oil industry, and what will be the particular benefits for OPEC member countries?</h4><p>I have indeed been very fortunate in my first four months in office to have been part of not one, but two historic OPEC agreements that promise to speed up the rebalancing of the oil market. The landmark decision taken at the 170th Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Algeria at the end of September, committing the organization to a production adjustment came after many rounds of consultative meetings and intensive talks. Most significantly, the Algiers Accord paved the way for the momentous decision taken at the 171st Meeting of the Conference in Vienna at the end of November to reduce total OPEC output by a considerable 1.2 million barrels/day from 1 January 2017. And yes, the agreement was extensively welcomed by global markets, with the resultant 13% hike in crude oil prices proof of that positive resonance. This agreement was strengthened further with the subsequent announcement by the Russian Federation that it would also reduce its production by 300,000 b/d next year. It means that, at the very least, 1.5 mb/d of crude oil output will be removed from the market in 2017, which will be an instrumental factor in bringing about oil market stability, especially in eliminating the stock overhang that has continued to pressure prices. This agreement is the first by the organization since the height of the global financial crisis eight years ago and is the result of a lot of hard work and intensive shuttle diplomacy talks among both OPEC and non-OPEC producing nations, in pursuit of action deemed essential for correcting the market imbalance. Obviously, it will take time for the production adjustment to filter through to the market, but as we see it, what is important is that it will accelerate the ongoing drawdown of the crude stock overhang and bring the rebalancing of the market forward. As we have learned from past experiences, once stocks start to fall on a steady basis, then prices start to improve. And a reasonable crude price level is critical to supporting investment in the new capacity the sector will require in the expanding years ahead. We in OPEC believe the November agreement will not only be beneficial to the global oil market and the economies of our member countries, but also to the consumers and the health of the world economy as a whole. Most importantly, such equilibrium is vital for providing member countries with a fair return on the exploitation and export of their exhaustible natural resources. OPEC member states might be endowed with precious and valuable energy resources, but we must not forget that they still face the same obstacles and challenges as other developing countries, hence a regular income that fuels economic growth is a key requisite for ensuring a prosperous future.</p><h4>OPEC's 2016 World Oil Outlook (WOO) was launched outside of Vienna for the first time and you chose the UAE to hold it in. What are the highlights of the mutual cooperation between OPEC and the UAE? </h4><p>Time proved this decision was the right one. We felt that by attaching the WOO launch this year to a major industry event, in the form of the high-profile ADIPEC, we would get maximum exposure. And we did. It was a resounding success. It was also extremely beneficial for the organization to have such an event in one of its member countries. Over the years, the OPEC secretariat has forged great links with member states and the UAE has proven to be no exception. With its vibrant economy and fascinating high-tech development, I am certain it will continue in the same vein, and remain a valued and trusted member of the OPEC family. Our visit to ADIPEC proved to be an excellent opportunity to extend those relations further. In fact, also for the first time, we chose Abu Dhabi as the location to unveil a new app version of OPEC's other flagship publication, the Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB). This was done at a press conference one day before the WOO launch. Significantly, the app's development was achieved through a joint IT project team involving the UAE Energy Ministry and the OPEC secretariat. It was another example of how OPEC and its member countries are working together to improve ties and ultimately conditions in the global oil sector.</p><h4>How would you assess the participation of the UAE's national oil companies in the construction of a stable global market?</h4><p>The UAE has made startling economic and technological progress over the years and stands today as an accomplished and highly-respected member of the global community. Obviously, with petroleum fueling its development, the national energy companies have had a very important role to play. Through the capable operations of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and its many subsidiaries, the country has secured a sound economic footing that will continue to pay dividends going forward. These companies, through the application of best practices, continue to forge agreements with international oil concerns that result in the optimum management of the UAE's petroleum resources. Over the years, these national entities have gained considerable experience and knowledge of the industry and the authoritative and responsible way they conduct themselves and do business with the outside world has a direct bearing on the stability of the oil market. Consumers need to know that the oil and gas they require for their domestic needs will always be available and, in the UAE, as well as other OPEC producers, security of supply is assured. And that is ultimately down to companies such as ADNOC and the UAE's other energy firms. In the future, the UAE and OPEC member countries in general will be required to supply even more oil to global markets, so it is indeed reassuring for the consumers to know that ultimately they can always rely on these ever-evolving national oil companies for their needs to be met.</p><h4>With the current plans of the UAE government to reduce its dependence on the oil industry to below 50% of national demand, how will this transform the dynamics between other OPEC members and the UAE?</h4><p>The countries that make up this organization have reached a superior level of understanding, having spent over half a century working together on reaching a set of goals that are common to all of them. Over this long period, there have naturally been many ups and downs, but through it all members have shown a sense of unity that I think is unique to any international organization. What is striking is the great understanding they exert of each other's needs and situations, an approach that has shone through in the many informed decisions OPEC has taken over the decades. There is no doubt in my mind that this family camaraderie has enabled the organization to remain relevant and effective on the world stage and an essential element in the welfare of the global economy. OPEC has actually gone from strength-to-strength over the years. Each OPEC sovereign nation has its own needs, yet under the umbrella of the organization, members time and again display an attitude that puts sacrifice before self-interest. That is extremely commendable and one of the factors that makes OPEC so unique. Concerning the UAE's aim to reduce dependency on the domestic energy industry, it is indeed a notable quest and one that makes perfect sense. In fact, other OPEC member countries are following the same path, knowing full well that there will come a day when the oil that helped build up their nations will no longer be in abundance. Many countries, the UAE included, are looking toward alternative energy sources to supplement their domestic needs. They include renewables, such as biofuels, solar, and wind power. These other sources of energy will not take the place of conventional fossil fuels, but they will gradually increase their share in the overall mix. Many oil industry experts, OPEC included, consider that the global economy will require all forms of energy to satisfy its growing needs in the years ahead. As for the UAE, in rationalizing its use of petroleum, it will be able to keep more resources in the ground, making reserves last longer for future generations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sunny-side-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Under what mission was Symtech Solar established, and how is it realizing its sustainable innovation mission here in Oman?</h4><p>From an outside perspective, I was quite shocked to see the lack of solar uptake in Oman considering the sun shines for 320 days of the year and Oman has one of the highest solar radiances in the world. It was important for my chairman and myself to diversify into a different business sector, but one that was analogous to what we already do, which is generate electricity. As government subsidies for petrol and diesel are being reduced, government subsidies for electricity are likely the next ones in line. Recognizing that solar was a massive,    untapped opportunity and the likelihood of reductions in government subsidies for electricity being combined with reduced customized service costs in this sector, it has created a perfect storm. The government has a great opportunity to encourage the uptake of rooftop solar and that is exactly what it is doing.    </p><h4>What are the product lines and services that Symtech offers and what industries or sectors are you looking     to introduce to the technology?</h4><p>We are concentrating on three main areas: rooftop solar systems for    domestic, industrial, and commercial use, then solar street lighting and solar-powered water irrigation pumps. With regard to the rooftop solar sector, a survey was completed for the government two years ago that recognized that there was an opportunity for 1.44GW of electricity to be generated from domestic rooftops in Oman and one-third of that would be in Muscat. Muscat has low rise buildings and flat rooftops that are ideal for the installation of rooftop solar systems. My vision is to see solar PV panels fitted to the rooftops of villas in Oman. We are structuring it so that our installation teams will arrive at you home with everything necessary in one box. Within 36-48 hours, the panels will be connected and householders will be producing their own electricity. They will either be producing enough for their own consumption and not receiving monthly electricity bills and, if there is a feed-in tariff from the government, they can feed their excess electricity into the national grid and receive a credit for it on their monthly electricity bill. The excess electricity fed into the grid then goes to power schools, hospitals and their neighbors. After the sun goes down, the system automatically senses it and switches over to the grid. In the industrial and commercial sectors we are concentrating upon the hotels, tourism, food manufacturing and infrastructure sectors.</p><h4>How will you utilize these teams to carry out your solar projects and general business plans?</h4><p>The majority of our installation teams will comprise of Omani technicians, specifically Omani electricians trained here in Oman by the National Training Institute. The technicians will receive special training for installing solar systems and their competence will be approved by Symtech engineers prior to employment with us. We are an SME and we are based in Oman, although we are not the sole Symtech distributor for the Sultanate of Oman alone. We are also responsible for the MENA region and for the Eastern Coast of Africa. Symtech Oman is an SME that has recognized an opportunity and we are basing our regional operations here in Oman. Our Omani teams will form the nucleus of the installation teams out in the GCC, in MENA, and East Africa as well. We are not an Omani company that wants to stay home; this is an Omani company that sees its future in the greater MENA area and by deploying well-trained Omani installation team throughout the region we will aid the employment of more Omani-trained technicians.</p><h4>Is there a specific market apart from Oman you are focusing on?</h4><p>For obvious reasons, we will focusing on Yemen when the current hostilities cease. The war has resulted in the huge destruction of infrastructure, especially electricity infrastructure, and that will need to be improved. We believe this will offer an opportunity for Yemen to leap forward in technology, analogous to what happened in Africa with the uptake of mobile phones. This is highly likely to happen in Yemen also; we believe that Yemen will skip two or three generations and go straight to solar. The uptake of solar now in Sanaa and around Yemen is massive. When peace finally arrives, there will be an opportunity for Symtech Solar to assist in rapidly providing solar electricity to relieve the suffering of the people of Yemen.</p><h4>What are some of the projects in the pipeline for Symtech Solar?</h4><p>We have some very interesting projects in the pipeline. We are involved with providing solar solutions to new hotels, new tourist resorts located in remote desert areas, egg production facilities, a chicken farm, a dairy farm and a number of industrial users. They all have the same basic requirements, they are located some distance from the away from the national grid, they need electricity to power their facilities and they need to reduce their electricity costs. We recently won our first project with Outward Bound Oman and the solar system will be installed in February or March 2017. The Outward Bound center is located in the desert in Bidayah, approximately 3km from the nearest electrical supply. We have provided them with a totally off-grid solar solution which will provide electrical power 24 hours per day.</p><h4>What needs to be done to unleash Oman's full potential in renewable energy?</h4><p>The Authority for Electricity Regulation will need to promulgate specifications to allow solar power to connect to the national grid system. Currently, we are not allowed to connect anything to the grid for electrical safety reasons. We are expecting the AER to issue specifications for equipment and standards for installation by early 2017. Until then, we will concentrate on solar street lighting, solar powered water irrigation pumps, and totally off-grid solar systems. Incentives from the government, often called a feed-in tariff, would certainly assist in the rapid uptake in rooftop solar to achieve the government's objectives of 10% of Oman's electricity derived from renewable sources by 2020.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the next 12 months?    </h4><p>Our main priority is confirmation of additional funding. We are talking to financial institutions and potential investors and I am confident that we will be successful. Our second priority is building our management and installation teams and having them in place prior to the AER issuing their standards. The business plans for Oman, Yemen, and the UAE are already complete.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the strategic aims behind the launching of Al-Ahli's medical program on Al Jazeera Mubasher?</h4><p>This initiative is focused on enhancing public awareness about various health issues in a practical and interactive manner, where the doctors of the hospital address certain topics of interest and respond to the inquiries and comments of the viewers live on air. We have a group of highly professional physicians and surgeons from different parts of the world. Also, the hospital is known for its high quality services, so the program is very special and gives viewers valuable information in the field. The program is aired from the hospital once a week on Al Jazeera Mubasher. It also includes videos of actual surgeries with comments and explanations. What is special about the program is that it follows up on the care guests receive from the time they commence treatment at the hospital until they fully recovered. The experience of the guest would be showcased in cooperation with the concerned doctors. The necessary pre-approvals of the guest are obtained before airing anything because we put so much emphasis on guest confidentiality.</p><h4>Following your recently opened In Vitro Fertilization and Fertility Lab, what is the expected guest demand in this facility and how will this add a new dimension of healthcare under the Al-Ahli services umbrella?</h4><p>The global infertility rate is between 10-15%, and Qatar has recorded a similar statistic. The number of infertility cases is increasing because of consanguineous marriages. The consultants have proved 50% of people suffering from fertility issues can have children with medical assistance. The center offers comprehensive treatment for all cases of infertility in both men and women, Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), and standard IVF. The center can accommodate and receive 40-50 guests for consultation and can facilitate up to 10 procedures per day. Staffed with highly qualified medical team and equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, the center can address guest concerns from consultation, diagnosis, treatment, and IVF operation when necessary. Al-Ahli Hospital is also working in collaboration with scientific laboratories outside Qatar for pre-implantation genetic screening, a test that assesses the overall chromosomal normalcy in embryos. This facility increases the chances of getting a better pregnancy. Our hope is to offer our services outside of Qatar too. The Gulf area is in need of this facility. IVF has a success rate of 40-45%. We are hoping to use the new techniques that have been implemented in Europe and the US to achieve a higher success rate.</p><h4>What are your operational goals for Al-Ahli Hospital over the next 12 months? </h4><p>We at Al-Ahli Hospital have developed a well-defined five-year strategic plan that aims to expand the hospital and upgrade healthcare to promote and render unique medical services to our guests and society. In addition, we have recently been accredited by the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners as a provider of continuous professional development services. The hospital offers advanced educational and training programs that benefit clinical teams working in the hospital and has partnerships with several medical institutions and authorities. We are working to establish cooperation with specialized institutions and authorities to provide a number of medical education and continuous professional development programs for medical cadres in the state of Qatar, having secured the required accreditation status. We are planning another facility in the north, although the main expansion of Al-Ahli Hospital would be undertaken at its existing location. The expansion has been pending for past six years due to a lack of approval from the concerned authorities regarding design issues. We have expressed our concerns to the government officials and are hoping that we will be allowed to build at least a ground floor and four additional floors. We currently only have approval for ground and first floors, which does not meet our requirements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Honeywell and how has the company evolved since its establishment in Mexico?</h4><p>Honeywell's story starts in 1936 during the administration of President Cárdenas, when the oil industry was nationalized. Operating through a subsidiary called Universal Oil Products (UOP), in the subsequent 80 years we have grown to have a very large presence in the country. We now have more than 17,500 employees in Mexico at 15 manufacturing sites and our new investigation and research facility, called the Honeywell Technology Solutions Center, in Mexico City, primarily dedicated to producing software solutions for clients and customers throughout Latin America. We are evolving from being an industrial company to being a cyber-industrial company. We do not focus on the end consumer in our business operations, but instead on B2B, which we need in order to advance the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT). We are transforming the world by blending great physical products with advanced software and analytics across many industries. Additionally, although our industrial applications are not consumer-oriented, they end up being used by people in their daily lives: 15 million homes in the world are using our connectivity solutions for example. This interaction could help in the refining industry, smart buildings, airports, food and beverages, hospitality, healthcare, and retail. We have 127,000 employees and 22,000 engineers globally, over half of which are software engineers. This demonstrates how the traditional industrial orientation of Honeywell is shifting toward the cyber-industrial segment.</p><h4>How important is Mexico to Honeywell's global strategy?</h4><p>There are a couple of things that set Mexico apart from the rest of the world. In Honeywell there is a group of countries denominated as high-growth regions. Mexico is in the top five along with China, India, Brazil, and Russia. One of the most exciting things about Mexico is its diverse economic base. Automotive is where manufacturing really took off, but it has since spread into aerospace and other sectors. This diversity gives the country less of a risk profile and more of an opportunity and growth profile. As Mexico develops its infrastructure and education, we will see much more growth in the southern areas, which could be an interesting and profitable area of investment and could lead to real, sustainable development.</p><h4>Where is Honeywell located in Mexico?</h4><p>One of the first places we entered in the Mexican market was Tijuana but we have presence in cities like Chihuahua, Ciudad Juarez, San Luis Potosí­, Mexicali, Monterrey, and Mexico City of course. Our presence includes manufacturing and design of technologies that go from gas valves for air conditioners and water heaters, to aerospace, sensing, controls, security, and fire equipment, as well as commercial mobile scanning devices for large food and beverage firms, smart electrical meters for all kinds of structures and of course, our industrial software engineering center.</p><h4>What is the importance for Honeywell of this new technology center in Mexico City?</h4><p>About 60% of our global growth over the next five years is expected to be connected to software and in order to achieve that, we have Honeywell Technology Solutions (HTS), which is the engineering, technology research and development arm of Honeywell. With more than 10,000 employees worldwide and a presence in China, India, the Czech Republic, and Mexico, it serves customers with aerospace products and services, turbochargers for the automotive segment, technology for smarter and connected home and buildings, safety, sensing, and productivity solutions, and industry process technologies, process controls, and performance materials that can be applied in a spectrum of industries. HTS in Mexico will focus on designing products in Mexico for Mexico, which means that it will work to understand the needs of the local market and design products that meet and compete with the big global players in these markets.</p><h4>What are Honeywell's goals in Mexico in the next few years?</h4><p>Our vision is to ensure that our presence emphasizes the unique qualities, needs, and capabilities of the country by having people running our businesses, developing our products, and managing our factories who understand the culture, environment, and opportunity of the Mexican market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Kazakhstan play in Huawei's overall portfolio and what is the country's potential for growth in the sector?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is one of few countries that is developing dynamically during the current volatile period. The government focuses on modernization and improvement of the communication and IT infrastructure, which is vital for sustainable development. This is why Kazakhstan experiences a high demand for the newest ICT products and solutions that increase people's quality of lives and the efficiency of businesses. As a leading global ICT producer, Huawei supplies products and solutions to governments and enterprises in over 170 countries, and more than one-third of the world's population use Huawei products and solutions. Kazakhstan is a strategically important country for the company and we intend to expand our business here. The local representative office was set up in 1998, and in 2007 the company established the Huawei Almaty subsidiary, with 80% of employees being local. In 2016 company was renamed “Huawei Technologies Kazakhstan“ LLP. In Kazakhstan we cover all three of the corporation's business lines. In its carrier business, Huawei is innovating to support telecom operators' digital transformation and is driving the development of cutting-edge technologies such as 5G and IoT connectivity, which promise to reshape the role of telecom operators across numerous industries.</p><h4>How important is the consumer segment among the technology services and products of Huawei's portfolio?</h4><p>Huawei Consumer Business Group is among the top-three leading smartphone producers in terms of shipments in the world. Revenue for the year increased by 41%, while the number of smartphones shipped increased by 25%, far exceeding the growth of the market of 3.1%. In Kazakhstan, the results are much more modest. Huawei currently holds just over 6.9% of the smartphone market here and sales of Huawei smartphones for the five months of 2016 grew 5.6 fold. This increase in market share was possible thanks to the development of a retail and distribution network and increased marketing activity. We have signed a contract with major players such as Technodom, Sulpak, Mechta, Evrika, MNI, and Kcell. One of the main tasks of Huawei is to raise global awareness, so the company is investing in a variety of sports, entertainment, youth, and other projects.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your initiatives to promote cooperation in e-commerce?</h4><p>We actively work with partners to develop cloud computing and big data platforms to help customers improve the efficiency of network transformation in all aspects, including architecture, hardware, and software services. Together, we help enterprises achieve success in digitization. As for the promotion of e-commerce in Kazakhstan, Huawei is interested in cooperation and the implementation of joint projects in the field of promoting e-commerce and integration of payment systems. Ultimately, end users do not really care about the platform or application equipment being used. The main results are anywhere, anytime, with any device to obtain high-quality services. This is what we seek.</p><h4>What opportunities does the Expo present for Huawei, and what is your vision on the 2020 program?</h4><p>President Nazarbayev, during his visit to China in 2014, met with Huawei Chairwoman of the Board of Directors Ms. Sun Yafang. Huawei expressed its willingness to support Kazakhstan during EXPO by setting up connection for the exhibition premises for the numerous visitors and journalists from all over the globe could easily use mobile internet services. As for Digital Kazakhstan 2020, which aims to increase the number of regular internet users and 75% of the total population, Huawei has presented a concept for the development of national ICT projects within the framework of this program to the government. Huawei focuses on promoting the roadmap for the implementation of ICT projects. First of all we pay attention to the implementation of infrastructure projects to ensure the elimination of the digital divide and provide broadband internet access in remote settlements in rural areas, as well as the preparations for full-scale implementation of socially important systems such as e-learning and e-health.</p><h4>What other major projects does Huawei have in the pipeline in Kazakhstan, both in terms of consumer products and ICT solutions?</h4><p>We are proud that in 2013 we won the tender and became a partner of Kazakhtelecom and its subsidiary Altel network for the construction, equipment supply, and delivery of 4G next-generation communication services. Based on the contract, Huawei has to cover all the cities of Kazakhstan with 4G network by 2018. To date, most of the work has been done and the republic's population has been able to enjoy high-speed internet and make calls. Since late 2015 other operators of Kazakhstan gained the right to provide 4G services and Huawei actively cooperates with them. Another important project for Huawei in Kazakhstan refers to the creation of “smart energy,“ including a digital pipeline, digital production technology, a cloud data center, a mobile office, and others. These solutions cover all operating the segments of the oil and gas industries, such as exploration, production, transportation, and information management. Thanks to its experience in ICT, Huawei helps customers from Central Asian countries optimize the efficiency of extraction of resources, reduce energy consumption, ensure safe operations, and complete the digital conversion.</p><h4>Where do you see Huawei in five years' time, and how will the company's operations fit within Kazakhstan's market?</h4><p>It is no secret that in Kazakhstan, many still perceive Chinese products to be inferior to products from Europe and the US. However, every year we see this opinion changing, also as a result of our products. Through our goal of a broad presence in Kazakhstan, we want to prove that made-in-China Huawei products and solutions, including consumer products, are synonymous with high quality, performance, and reliability. Therefore, we are confident that in the near future the number of Huawei users will grow and they will be satisfied with our products' functionality, quality, and reliability. As for our impact in Kazakhstan, the benefits come not only from the projects themselves but together with the local companies where we train local talent and provide people with advanced IT skills. We believe that the investment in these projects will also bring some economic growth in GDP terms from investments in ICT.</p>]]></richbody0content>
