		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy has Jazeera implemented to maximize its profits and reduce its operating costs?</h4><p>From the outset, Jazeera has adopted a disciplined low-cost carrier model. We keep our internal costs low and forward the benefits to our customers in terms of lower fares. We operate a fleet of new Airbus A320s, and, in 2018, we were the first airline in the Middle East to operate Airbus' A320neo, as the launch customer in the region. This new generation aircraft delivers 18% fuel savings, which means it is far more efficient, less noisy, and more environmentally friendly. All these benefits get passed on to the customer in terms of lower cost. Jazeera has been a profitable company for many years now. In an area where it is normal for government-owned airlines to make significant losses, Jazeera is an exception. We have been delivering results with margins in excess of 15-20% over many years. Because of this strong commercial and financial performance, Jazeera has a strong balance sheet with zero debt and close to USD80 million in cash reserves. All our routes are operated for purely commercial reasons, and each route has to stand on its own feet in terms of profitability. In the last few years, we launched a number of new routes, including places like Baku and Tbilisi, along with five new routes in India and two in Pakistan. These have added to our network and made Jazeera's financial performance even more robust. We have also stepped in to help the people of Qatar during the challenging period experienced over the last two years so that they could fly to their home countries, such as Egypt, when direct air services were suspended. </p><h4>How is Jazeera increasing its fleet utilization while ensuring the safety of its aircraft?</h4><p>Kuwait's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is extremely strong and has strict regulatory authority that ensures tight compliance by its carriers. In addition, Jazeera has always taken flight safety extremely seriously. Every two years, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) does a tough safety audit (IOSA) on its member airlines. We recently renewed our IOSA certification for another two years. In terms of fleet utilization, one of the key aspects of a well-run airline is to use its assets aggressively. Over the last few years, we have increased our aircraft utilization from 9.5 hours per aircraft per day, which is the global average for the A320, up to nearly 14 hours per aircraft per day, which is one of the highest in the world for the Airbus narrow-body fleet. </p><h4>What are Jazeera's goals and expectations for 2019?</h4><p>The year began on a great note. The most important thing is to ensure our customers are satisfied to fly with us. Kuwaitis recognize Jazeera as a great, homegrown Kuwaiti company, which is something we want to continue to foster. Second, we will launch six or seven new routes over the course of 2019. In June, we will launch the first low-cost airline service between the GCC and the UK with daily non-stop service between Kuwait and London Gatwick. Fares will be around 13% less than other airlines. This will be a game changer, for example for Kuwaiti students studying in the UK. We are also launching multiple other services to Karachi, Bodrum, Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, Kathmandu, Dhaka, and a few more destinations in Saudi Arabia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the DGCA increasing the levels of effectiveness and efficiency of its airport management operations?</h4><p>The DGCA is working hard at updating all its capabilities, human resources, technologies, and infrastructure. DGCA is also aiming to establish solid partnerships with international organizations specialized in aviation, as well as the private sector in order to elevate our capabilities in all services. Our objective is to have a hub linking east with west that takes advantage of Kuwait's geographical position. Additionally, we aim to create more jobs and commercial opportunities for our citizens trough effective strategies and by implementing a plan that enhances productivity, efficiency, and financial returns of all activities in the aviation sector. Effectiveness and efficiency have been defined by ICAO-ACI six key performance areas: core, safety and security, service quality, productivity and cost effectiveness, financial and commercial status, and environmental compliance. Over the last five years, the government has invested more than USD15 billion to achieve these goals and reach that target. We are now expecting to invest more than USD20 billion in the coming 20 years. These ambitious plans started within the DGCA and our industry partners, such as Kuwait Airways, Jazeera Airways, and the National Air Services Company (NASC). All stakeholders started to work together to the level of their capabilities. Our first objective is finalizing the approval process and modernizing our aviation regulatory governance through the new draft law for aviation. This will allow us to interact in a more professional way with the private sector, both nationally and internationally. </p><h4>In what ways can DGCA collaborate with local and international groups in order to develop the aerospace sector in Kuwait?</h4><p>Our role as regulator is to certify and give support to any aviation training facility in Kuwait. It is our job to create the right working environment for these facilities, which is why we gave our full support to Boeing's program in Kuwait. It will train pilots and every other component of aviation, such as engineers. </p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2019?</h4><p>There are many important issues going on in 2019. This involves the approval of the aviation laws and regulations, revisions of the airport's master plan, setting up the aviation academy, enhancing the productivity of our current staff, and insuring the proper implementation of existing projects. We also need to set up an adequate air navigation system as well as ground handling, in addition to enhancing safety and security. We are thinking about revising our terminal's operational performance and strategy. Kuwait International Airport has four terminals that are fully operational and one under construction. It is important that in 2019 we start setting out our vision for the coming 20 years. We are also focused on finalizing the exclusive terminal two, making it operational and most importantly managed well. We are thinking about having more terminals within Kuwait International Airport as part of the new master-plan to cater for the next 20-year vision. Finally, under our contract with Incheon Airport, the recruitment of Kuwaitis and training 125 nationals every year in various airport operation and management functions will help ensure the drafted goals and DGCA's vision using dedicated budget for human resource development. Young Kuwaitis can acquire training in South Korea and Kuwait to build up their capabilities and performance as preparation for the new airport. The government is keen to see the aviation sector developing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key factors that guaranteed LH's success to win the South Saad Al-Abdullah smart city project in Kuwait? </h4><p>This project has two aspects, an opportunity and a challenge. I think LH and the Public Authority for Housing Welfare (PAHW) of Kuwait have the same goal and as partners we are ensuring we can reach this goal together. Both organizations are pursuing the public interest by developing a new town here along with enough land and affordable public housing. We are like-minded in terms of developing a new city. It makes it much easier that we are working together in the same direction to achieve our shared goals. LH stands here not for profit. In fact, we are owned by each government and run as a non-profit entity. In this regard, our purpose is to pursue the public interest through housing welfare and to improve the quality of peoples' lives and economic growth. Construction is a very large contributor to a national economy itself, and a new town has a lot of components to it including infrastructure, housing, industry, and investments in various sectors of the economy. Many economic sectors and players can participate in the development of a new town like this. If we develop a new town we can generate a lot of economic activities. We have developed many smart cities in Korea, but this project is the first global smart city that LH will develop outside Korea. This project will be an expanded version of our smart city concept in Korea and also, we are cooperating with PAHW to create this new model. In other words, it is a global smart city model that will be localized as well, rather than a typical Kuwaiti city with smart technology or a simply implemented Korean smart city in Kuwait. Therefore, this project is a good opportunity to come up with a new model for smart cities. </p><h4>In what ways is LH sharing its knowledge with Kuwaiti companies regarding sustainable construction and sustainable housing projects?</h4><p>We expect this project to be mutually beneficial from a knowledge transfer standpoint. We are going to learn from Kuwaitis and Kuwaitis can learn from us. In order to succeed in the SSAC project, the support of local companies will be indispensable. They will provide us with the local studies regarding procedures and legislation, since every official document is written in Arabic. LH will then bring all the necessary technology for this project. Kuwait's government carried out the new town project on their own finance. For this reason, we are interested in joint-investment for this project and establishing a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) with the purpose of making a joint venture. </p><h4>What is your level of confidence about Kuwait's business opportunities? </h4><p>We are pretty confident regarding this project and we know that we have established a strong relationship with the Kuwaiti government through PAHW. The organization has been extremely helpful in helping us gain confidence within this new market. It's looking forward to this partnership and strongly believes in this project. We will ensure the delivery of a highly successful project that will benefit Kuwaiti society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is digitalization changing the logistics industry?</h4>
<p>It is safe to say that there is a race to digitalize logistics. All of the big players are changing fast, with more than 40% of logistics industry executives saying they are seeing some digital change in core operations, according to McKinsey. There is also a slew of start-ups on the scene. You can follow the money trail to see that big bets are being made on logistics. Billions of dollars in venture capital funding has gone toward logistics and freight related start-ups in the last couple of years. Start-ups are tackling all aspects of the supply chain: inventory management, warehousing, trucking, sensors, supply chain visibility, and e-commerce and last mile. In fact, Agility recently announced a USD100-million investment in Shipa over three years. Change is real&mdash;and it is the present, not the future.</p>
<h4>What major social and environmental upsides come from digitalization?</h4>
<p>There is huge upside to digitization in the logistics industry. In fact, the World Economic Forum says that there are USD2.4 trillion worth of societal benefits as a result of digital transformation of the industry between now and 2025. I see environmental savings and empowering small businesses to participate in the global economy as particularly important areas. Technology can improve supply chain efficiency in ways that directly cut emissions. For example, around the world, 50% of trucks travel empty on their return journey after making a delivery. New platforms and business models allowing asset sharing can reduce both costs and carbon emissions by helping fill all those empty trucks. Agility has invested in &ldquo;Uber for trucking" start-ups in Brazil and Saudi Arabia (Homoola) that does exactly this. Similarly, the implications of widespread adoption of green technologies in facilities and in trucking fleets is enormous. Take trucking as an example. Greenhouse gas emissions from heavy-duty vehicles are actually expected to surpass emissions from passenger vehicles by 2030 in countries like the US. Agility, through its corporate ventures team has invested in a start-up that has created a technology that can turn an existing trailer into a hybrid&mdash;reducing fuel consumption by a whopping 30%.</p>
<h4>How do you see the digital outlook for Kuwait specifically?</h4>
<p>I believe that digital offers many opportunities to diversify the Kuwaiti economy and create employment opportunities for our young people. We have the majority of the basic building blocks in place. First, connectivity&mdash;Kuwait is a connected country, smartphone penetration is one of the highest in the world, and the government continues to invest in infrastructure in this space. Second, we have a young and educated population&mdash;40% of our people are under the age of 25, and they are growing up as digital natives. They understand how to operate in a digital world. That said, I think that both the public and the private sectors need to continue to work together closely on skilling the population when it comes to digital leadership and entrepreneurship. I am not just talking about in the formal education system, but with real-world opportunities to apply their knowledge. Agility recently hosted a hackathon in Kuwait with its partner MIT Media Labs, sponsored by forward-thinking institutions like KFAS and KAFO, to do exactly this. We had more than 150 people apply for 50 slots, and then broke the group into teams that used data science to tackle real-world issues ranging from e-commerce to how to tackle Kuwait's traffic challenges. It was an amazing experience.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does ALARGAN distinguish itself in the Kuwaiti market?</h4><p>Innovation is highly embedded in ALARGAN's DNA, and it is important for us to always maintain our momentum and innovative attitude. In 2014, we adopted a strategy that refocused our business from being only a real estate developer to serving primary industries, such as multi-purpose and commercial projects. Today, we focus on income-generating properties in productive sectors, such as the health and education sectors, and are keen to provide the infrastructure for these projects where required. We are also working in the health and education sector and are keen to provide infrastructure where required. We are currently working on one of the largest rehab centers in Kuwait that is expected to open its doors in 3Q2019. </p><h4>How has the real estate sector in Kuwait grown and changed over the last year?</h4><p>Since 2018, there has been considerable pressure across the real estate sector and, although we have seen some improvement, we expect these pressures to prevail until 2020. One major issue is that supply is lower than demand, which is caused by the scarcity of land in Kuwait. For example, within the industrial sector, warehouses are in high demand, yet there isn't always enough suitable land on which to build them. On a different but similar note, Kuwait's growth in recent decades took the form of an urban sprawl, with residential neighborhoods springing up to accommodate the growing need for housing, limiting the amount of land available for vital urban infrastructure and other facilities. This resulted in many new neighborhoods lacking vital services and, consequently, people started moving to towns for services unavailable in their residential areas. This problem is less pronounced in the south of Kuwait in comparison to the north. Thus, the lack of land is both a challenge and an opportunity for developers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has ICEX- Invest in Spain evolved over the years, and what have been its main achievements?</h4><p>Since 2012 Invest in Spain has been integrated as part of ICEX and this has been a major development. The integration was a complex process, but rewarding and beneficial in supporting the internationalization of the Spanish economy. Now we have a one-stop shop for the internationalization of the Spanish economy dedicated to assisting the Spanish companies in their internationalization process, as well as attracting FDI. A second important development has been the way he have been adapting and broadening the services we offer to international investors seeking investment opportunities in our country; we have been improving the personalized advice we provide investors on a wide array of issues that are going to be key in their decision making process such as sectorial information, so they can get to know who the key players are from the supply and demand side and where the clusters and niches of opportunities are. We also provide key information on legal and fiscal issues, labor market regulation, visas and incentives packages. Basically, what we do is to assist investors in a way that will help them make their decision; and, once they taken it, we help them soft-land. To do this, we work closely with the different departments of the administrations that are responsible for each specific issue, as well as with regional and local authorities. And, we have also the help of a network of 103 Economic and Trade Commissions that Spain has all around the globe. A third important development since our integration is the increasing work we are doing with Spanish companies seeking international partners to help them grow their businesses in Spain and access third markets; as a matter of fact, more often than not, when looking for an international partner, Spanish companies seek financing but also to be integrated in another company's value chain that can help them access third markets faster. This line of work has become particularly relevant. I would like to highlight to additional lines of work: the work we do to promote Spain as a solid platform for investment -we organize and/or participate in around 190 promotional activities per year, including investment fairs, conferences, and partnerships. And, the management of two programs by which we provide financial assistance to international investors. One of these programs is “The investment program for foreign companies in R&amp;D activities“, targeted to investors who want to do projects involving R&amp;D and which is financed by regional funds from Europe; and, the second one, “Rising Startup Spain“ which was initiated in 2016 and is targeted to foreign entrepreneurs in the process of scaling up their project and believe Spain could be a great place for that activity. This program creates a soft landing for start-ups that can benefit from Madrid and Barcelona being world-class start-up ecosystem hubs, capable of competing, more and more often, with more mature hubs as London, Paris, or Berlin.</p><h4>Is the legal and fiscal framework for foreign start-ups seeking to establish in Spain favorable in comparison to other European countries?</h4><p>Indeed, we have key competitive advantages that have contributed to set Spain as one of the most attractive destination for international investors. This is evident in terms of how FDI flows are entering Spain, the way the M&amp;A market is performing, and the volumes of investment in our private equity and venture capital industry. In 2017, Spain received more than EUR38 billion in FDI. In 2018, for the first three quarters, we beat that number with more than EUR40 billion. This compared to 2017 represents, in gross terms, a 75% increase and more than 150% in net terms. Looking at how the M&amp;A market performed in 2018, we can also see Spain´s interest for international investors: there was more than EUR116 billion in volume of investment, with 80% coming from international investors. And, finally, in the private equity and venture industry, we had record numbers of more than EUR6 billion of investment, a big amount of money, 77% led by international investors. Investors are seeing how strongly the Spanish economy is growing, with a strong job creation and large competitive gains. Spain closed 2018 with 2.6% GDP growth rate, the fastest-growing economy among the largest economies in the eurozone. Going forward with a 2.2% GDP growth rate, we are set to be, again in 2019, the second-fastest growing economy among the world's most advanced. The expansion is based, to a large extent, on the correction of major macroeconomic and financial imbalances together with a strong employment performance and favorable financing conditions. Yet, Spain has other competitive advantages highly valued by investors such as the size of the market: 46 million consumers, over 80 million tourists that visit our country each year and access to the EU market with more than 500 million consumers with disposable incomes of EUR30,000 on average. We also have outstanding talent, highly skilled and very competitive labor force and excellent infrastructures; and, in terms of taxes, we have a moderate tax system, with a corporate tax rate of 25% that can be as low as 15% depending on the incentives applied. Spain's tax burden, measured by the ratio of fiscal revenues over GDP, is approximately 34%, which is over five points lower than the EU average. A very important point related to the fiscal is the approximately 98 agreements to avoid double taxation that we have signed, and which are crucial to foreign investors.</p><h4>What incentives or support does the government give to foreign investors interested in R&amp;D in Spain?</h4><p>Spain, like most countries, has very important incentives for investors, with a view to promote employment, competitiveness and economic growth and, many of them place special emphasis on R&amp;D activities and technological innovation. There are numerous financial (non-refundable subsidies, soft loans or a combination of both) and tax incentives for activities in certain industries deemed to be a priority due to their potential for growth and their impact on the Spanish economy. In fact, Spain's tax incentives system for R&amp;D is one of the most beneficial and broad according to the OECD. When tax breaks and incentives are applied the effective corporate tax rate can be as low as 20%. These incentives can be complemented with the so call “Patent Box“ according to which 60% of net revenues coming from the transfer of intangible assets - models, designs, formulae, plans or even know-how-.are tax exempted. Worth mentioning is the Ministry of Science, Technology and Universities, through the Center for Industrial Technological Development (CDTI) provides loans at very advantageous terms and technical advice for R&amp;D; and it has the INNVIERTE Program, aimed at business innovation by supporting venture capital investments in technology-based companies.</p><h4>What are Invest in Spain's main objectives for the years 2019 and 2020?</h4><p>We will continue to work on our main responsibility, which is attracting FDI to Spain, but we will try to do it better and more efficiently, with and increasingly tailor-made advice for investors. We typically manage around 160-170 new projects every year, and we plan to increase that amount. First and foremost, we will keep improving our market intelligence on new sectors and areas of activity so as to be able to respond to investors' increasing interests on robotics, AI, big data. And we will continue providing ourselves with new instruments to allow us to do a better tracking of investment flows. Our annual report on Sovereign Wealth Funds and the new Global Latam, whose first edition came out this past January to trail investment flows from multilatinas, many of which have become key players in the world economy, will try to do exactly that. And, we will continue promoting our programs to encourage FDI into R&amp;D and attract foreign start-ups. In brief, we will improve our knowledge, our analysis and the way we contribute to position Spain as a great destination to invest. Spain has become one of the most attractive countries for international investors and we will work hard to keep it that way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does UFM actively contribute from the design-building stage to improve the levels of sustainability of its facilities?</h4><p>The design-building stage is the most important one since the best foundation is conducted at that stage. It is therefore recommended that projects are assigned a facility management (FM) consultant who will be involved in cost and strategic planning. The FM consultant will be involved in the concept design review at initial design stage all way to the detail design. The review focuses on operational issues and operation cost optimization in addition to provisioning for future facility used. They are in charge of designing an asset registration form through the CAFM system after reviewing the design and floor map. Failure to do so will lead to several issues that will prevent the excellent operation and testing of smart systems according to standards, in addition to not providing the necessary documentation and training where it would result to limitation in operating the systems. We have executed this process with clients such as KIPCO, Hessa Al Mubarak, and others.</p><h4>What programs does UFM have to shape the leaders of tomorrow and improve the standards among FM workers?</h4><p>UFM is a founding member of Middle East Facilities Management Association (MEFMA), giving us the ability to offer certified training courses to employees and clients based on international standards. UFM has a designated training department specialized in providing training courses regarding new and recent technologies concerning the FM industry. Moreover, UFM has a set of national and international calibers. That provides a strong base, since we are constantly sharing experiences and knowledge within each department. UFM makes sure to create a positive working environment for all its employees by conducting awareness sessions on how to follow the corporate identity. UFM attracts talented and motivated employees to join its team. From day one, our employees undergo a long-term induction program. We adopt international standards in management and share knowledge in order to constantly improve our staff.</p><h4>What systems and technologies is UFM integrating in its facility management activity in order to spur levels of efficiency?</h4><p>UFM integrates the most recent technologies, such as computer-aided facility management (CAFM) to ensure safe and efficient services to facilities. The CAFM system has many benefits, such as asset registration. In addition, we use smart systems that work together in an integrated way. For example, our AC and temperature system are configured based on the number of people in the room. The objective is to produce the best air quality and temperature indoors according to the temperature outside.</p><h4>How does UFM's socially responsible image contribute to growing its activities and attracting and increasing the number of investors?</h4><p>UFM is aware of its responsibility toward the community. For this reason, we participate in many events through different types of sponsorships. It is also an opportunity for us to meet investors and potential clients. We want to convey a positive message to our potential investors and demonstrate not only our social commitment but also our financial stability and strong presence in the market.</p><h4>What is UFM's marketing strategy to grow its activities in and out of Kuwait?</h4><p>UFM has a designated experienced development team to develop marketing strategies according to recent activities regionally and internationally and based on historical records of the market. This is done via intensive research of the market and in cooperation with an international agency. This team focuses on reaching as many clients as possible through different channels like events, workshops, and FM-related activities in and out of Kuwait. We also conduct a comprehensive benchmarking and market study to properly evaluate our competitors. Based on the results, a customized new service will come up in order to serve a certain need, or new clients will be served with certain services that their facilities require.</p><h4>Where do you envisioning UFM heading in 2019?</h4><p>Our vision in 2019 is to make positive changes to work life, and we aim to improve the workplace for UFM employees, raise awareness on the FM industry in the public and private sectors through workshops and events, and focus on adding long-terms concepts to our strategy. We also want to look into incubating new ideas, introducing new service product packages that suit best our current and potential clients, as well as exploring new markets to add to our clients' list. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways did your partnership with Bouygues help develop your business in Kuwait?</h4><p>We incorporated the company in 2008, and Bouygues became an active partner during the initial stage, bringing most of the know-how. Bouygues has a 35-year history in facility management, which it implemented in multiple PPP projects. Facility management is a key contributor to such long-term projects, where costs must be accounted for. Its know-how has strengthened Ecovert FM. It provided us with all the policies and procedures, manuals on cleaning services and health and safety, quality management, audits, and all other considerations. Notably, we operated for a year before we took on any projects in order to modify the documentation to the local market. Thereafter, we assumed our first project in 2008. Simultaneously, we began the implementation of a central help desk to manage all our projects. We implemented all policies and procedures, the uniform system of accounts, as well as management of utilities, and so on. At present, we rank among the leading facility managers in Kuwait. One of our major projects is Al Hamra Tower, which we have been managing since 2010. Another such project is Kipco Tower, which we managed for the first three years. Our third major project was Jaber Ahmed Cultural Center. In total, we have around 28 projects in Kuwait, including universities. We have contributed significantly by properly managing cleaning services, security, and operations, and auditing cooling systems to curb the operational costs of the site.</p><h4>How did all the knowledge from Bouygues apply in Kuwait?</h4><p>Facilities management was a new industry in Kuwait. Bouygues brought the systems that can be implemented to enhance the operation and prolong the lifetime of a property. It provided the benchmarking for every sector. For example, hotels calculate their energy consumption for a certain task, and those numbers are calculated against consumption and measured against a benchmark. This helps us identify where utilities are being misused and fix the problem. Clients have recently become more aware of their energy consumption. We have been recording utility consumption for the projects we have been running since 2008. We have historical data that we always provide to our clients, and that helps us better monitor all aspects of the site and offer the best adapted solution. </p><h4>In a highly price-sensitive market such as Kuwait, how does Ecovert FM differente itself from its competitors? </h4><p>The market is price driven. Eventually, we are hoping that our extra services will highlight the value of our cost. Our clients benefit from a significant ROI. This has the ability to shift a price-driven market to professional market. Many properties in Kuwait are not being properly maintained, and as a result, the lifespan of those buildings is being reduced. Furthermore, neglecting maintenance over time means more expensive renovations. It is much more cost-effective to properly and constantly maintain a building. We have been able to build long-lasting relationships with our clients. Once they see our added value, they stay with us. </p><h4>What benefits can your customers enjoy through your fully integrated solutions? </h4><p>Fully integrated companies like ours can provide an unmatched quality of service and responsiveness in the event of maintenance issues. Our people are trained to detect, assess, and report any issue to the adequate department. We want to ensure the client always receives a five-star service. We allocate 2% of our revenue to training because better training equals to better services.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>Our main goal is to expand the business. We are opening several new branches, one of which is dedicated to testing and commissioning, a vital component in the maintenance of equipment at the highest level. We will continue to train our staff, and monitor our customer satisfaction. At present, we are running at a level of around 94% customer satisfaction, and our goal is to maintain a level of above 90%. Lastly, we want to increase our net profit. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key factors have helped Ahmadiah become one of Kuwait's leading contractors?</h4><p>When it comes to the construction field in Kuwait, Ahmadiah has gained a competitive edge thanks to its hard-earned reputation for quality, know-how, and respect of its clients' time constraints. Achieving a leading position is difficult, maintaining it even more so. But we have succeeded and been able to build a record of customer satisfaction second to none in both the public and private sectors. Since its founding in 1954 on a handshake of trust between the Al Thuwainy and Al-Najjar families, our company has held an unwavering belief in the potential of Kuwait and its people. We have always regarded our human capital as our most important asset and a source of great pride. We focus on recruiting and retaining the very best people. Our employees tend to stay with us on average for 15-20 years and are a major factor in our long-lasting sustainability in such a fiercely competitive industry. We work closely with our clients, who are assured by the transparency, integrity and accountability of our corporate governance. Our high number of repeat clients trust us for our professionalism, reliability and ability to deliver quality projects on time, on budget. Today's construction projects are increasingly challenging in scale, complexity, and technique, and we continuously invest in the newest technologies and make sure the younger generation is ready to combine new ideas with Ahmadiah's values, identity, and experience.</p><h4>What types of projects and sectors is Ahmadiah involved in?</h4><p>Ahmadiah is behind many of Kuwait's milestone and landmark projects in the civil, commercial, industrial, energy, and utility sectors. The growth of the company has gone hand-in-hand with the development of Kuwait. Some of the most prestigious organizations in Kuwait have come to rely on Ahmadiah's extensive experience and complete range of specialist skills. Our portfolio includes skyscrapers, palaces, hotels and coastal developments, in addition to government and office buildings, and leisure, retail and industrial complexes. It also features numerous crucial national infrastructure projects, such as airport terminals, hospitals, power stations, bridges and highways. High-profile examples include the Bayan Palace, Kuwait Airways' headquarters, and the 414-meter 80-story Al Hamra Tower—Kuwait's tallest building. In 2019, I expect infrastructure to be the sector with the greatest activity, as this forms a large part of the New Kuwait Vision 2035 development plan. Our main focus is to deliver our national projects currently underway. There are many local companies that try to target projects abroad; however, we are proud of our decision to concentrate on large or specialized projects in Kuwait.</p><h4>Speaking of Vision 2035, what will be essential for Kuwait to achieve its national plan?</h4><p>It will be crucial to believe in our human capital, use it to its full potential, as we do in Ahmadiah, and make Vision 2035 a reality with the experience of our local companies supported by the knowledge of international partners. All companies are eager to be part of this vision, and the Supreme Council for Planning and Development is monitoring the evolution of New Kuwait to ensure we are on the right track. It will also be essential to maintain stability and continuity at the government level and reduce lengthy bureaucracy that can discourage foreign investors. In addition, companies that will be involved in Vision 2035 should have a certain level of quality of work and experience as well. We might need a more stringent grading of the companies between first, second, and third grades. Currently, only first-grade companies are invited to bid on megaprojects; however, these grades should be better defined, and the requirements should be properly set and respected. Thus far, not all companies classified as first grade are actually capable of working on mega-projects. This grading should be reviewed every three or four years, and a company should not be allowed to tender until it meets the required classification. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have Borneo Benar's operations evolved over the years?</h4>
<p>Borneo Benar was established as a timber trading and manufacturing company by my father about 30 years ago. About 20 years ago, he had the opportunity to supply timber to the Maldives, which was experiencing rapid growth as a tourist destination. Being situated in the middle of the ocean, the Maldives faces a harsh environment. Airborne salinity, the content of salt in the air, is high, and there is moisture that needs to be dealt with as well. Malaysian hardwoods can and do stand the test of time in the Maldives, as they are the most durable and suitable for the area. Word spread about our timber, and from that onward, clients in the Maldives suggested constructing villas. The company decided to give it a go along with some engineers, coming up with a prefabricated system that was tailored specifically to the Maldives. The idea was to prefabricate easily transportable elements that could be easily built in the Maldives. Logistics in the Maldives can be troublesome, as the country is spread out over separate small islands. They also lack the big machinery, so everything has to be done by manpower. We have been lucky to work with some major brands in the Maldives, like Shangri-La and Constance Group of Hotels. My father really built the brand within the Maldives and the region, and the company became known for providing quality products. Moreover, since we were associated with major brands, people would come to us when they had plans for a high-end resort.</p>
<h4>What is the scope of the products you manufacture?</h4>
<p>Essentially in the Maldives, the whole draw is to have villas that are built over water. From the concrete substructure up, we take everything that is made with timber, such as walls, frames, roofs, floors, doors, and windows. We do not do furniture or lighting, but we would work together with other companies to make sure integration is seamless.</p>
<h4>How would you like to further develop Borneo Benar's international presence?</h4>
<p>We have been involved in projects in the Seychelles, Mauritius, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, and are looking at further expansions. The Maldives has been our primary market for the past 20 years but it may reach a point of saturation as the number of resorts has skyrocketed. We have had a fantastic run, being involved with many prestigious brands. At present, there is a shift happening toward the development of mega resorts, as opposed to one island one resort. There are man-made integrated islands now with shopping malls, marinas and conference halls. We are now looking to grow the business and expand into areas outside the Maldives. We have been in talks with some potential clients in the Pacific and have also been asked to consider opportunities in the Middle East. The Southeast Asian market is competitive, but we are aiming to participate in some of the upcoming tourist developments here in Sabah itself. Sabah has so much natural beauty to offer and has the potential to become a key player in the luxury tourism sector. We hope that soon we would be able to utilize our experience and expertise to contribute to the local industry here.</p>
<h4>How do you assess the contribution of Borneo Benar to the development of the timber and wood-based industry in Sabah?</h4>
<p>The fact that we are one of the few timber-based companies in Sabah that manufactures value-added products sets us apart. The majority of the timber companies here tends to focus on sawn timber. We are one of the few who have succeeded to get exposure to international clients and let them realize there are companies from Sabah with the capabilities to produce finished products.</p>
<h4>What needs to be done to further promote local production of value-added wood products and move away from timber exports?</h4>
<p>Support from the government is crucial, and the current government is doing a fantastic job. Borneo Benar is lucky in the sense that we are involved in and get to oversee the entire process from log to finished product, which is what our clients love about us. However, over the past few years, the local timber industry has encountered issues with log availability and it has been increasingly difficult to get hold of raw materials. We are lucky in the sense that we get to control the entire process from log to finished product, which is what our clients love about us. The majority has been exported overseas, which has hampered the growth for some local timber players and made it impossible to survive for others. We need policies that prioritize local producers. The Chief Minister of Sabah is working on log export policy to protect the supply and ensure that local companies are able to fulfill their orders. There are many value-added processes that can and should be done here, and there is ample room to improve. Sabah has not promoted itself enough and has not tapped into its actual potential. There is room for so much growth, but it just needs a little bit of support and guidance.</p>
<h4>What is your roadmap for the coming years?</h4>
<p>I want to expand our reach. We have focused on the Maldives for two decades and it is time to start looking elsewhere. Thus, my biggest aim for the next five years is to establish ourselves in new regions. In terms of our actual products, I see a growing trend for bigger, mass resorts that are slightly lower range. I am working on developing two product lines; one for the higher-end customer, and one for the three- or four-star market, which is just as valuable in terms of volume. As of today, it is a relatively untapped segment for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the motivation behind rebranding the company?</h4><p>I prefer to call it “brand optimization," whereby we took our existing brand and elevated it to reflect our strategy, business plan, and direction. We have grown over the years and have managed to evolve well beyond our original business model. With time, we have expanded to become a collection of companies, each operating as a standalone entity. As part of our business plan to become a fully diversified group of interconnected, integrated business units, called “sectors," we unified key aspects of our business to operate as a single group with shared, customer-focused objectives. To communicate this effectively to the market, we simply added the word “group" to our name.</p><h4>What has been key for ACICO Group to successfully offer high-quality integrated solutions and products? </h4><p>We realized that integrated solutions were the future of our industry. As one of the first local manufacturers of pre-fabricated and aerated concrete, we noticed that the market's growth potential and ever-increasing demand for sustainable solutions was larger than supply. We strategically expanded our products and services in a vertically integrated manner and became a full-service construction group that can offer holistic solutions with the best service and highest-quality products. By overseeing and managing the entire building process, we maintained our high quality, efficiency, and sustainability at every step. Over time, the challenge to create a range of successful solutions and products has increased, with broader choices for customers and stronger competition in the market. For this reason, ACICO Group has prioritized optimization along the entirety of the solution creation process. Equally important, the group has implemented a more holistic conception of customer experiences by utilizing technology, innovation, and strategic partnerships.</p><h4>In light of Vision 2035, what areas of opportunities exist for ACICO Group? </h4><p>Under the Vision 2035, Kuwait will be implementing a total of 140 developmental projects. ACICO Group is presented with an excellent opportunity to take an active part in various nation-wide development projects. As an accredited and approved partner of numerous government entities, we have already been involved in numerous urban, construction, and infrastructure development projects. Over the years, we have also been working with the biggest players in the construction industry, and have been entrusted by major contractors in the region to provide products and solutions to cater to large-scale national development projects. For example, we have been supplying premium-quality signature interlocking blocks to projects such as Jaber Al-Ahmed, East Abdullah Al-Mubarak, and Sabah Al-Ahmed urban cities, and the new Kuwait International Airport terminal project. Our precast solutions are also perfectly suited for large-scale development projects, such as the new Ghous Road project and the bridge barriers for the Jahra Road Development project.</p><h4>What actions are being taken by ACICO Group in order to remain highly competitive and cost efficient? </h4><p>ACICO Group has adopted a one-stop shop approach to building needs. Whether the customer is a homeowner or a stakeholder in larger projects, we focus on providing tailored services. We are also committed to embracing locally manufactured products and continue to promote the Kuwaiti industrial sector. Moreover, ACICO Group's turnkey service to homeowners is unique. Similarly, our construction system for villas, compared to the conventional system used in the market, allows for faster delivery timeframes, more energy saving, and overall better quality.</p><h4>How is ACICO Group working toward sustainability?    </h4><p>We strive to create a sustainable community for generations to come by delivering high-quality building solutions. We look at sustainability as a fundamental philosophy that guides our business model. Our integrated system has been designed to support sustainability, and our autoclaved aerated concrete products are manufactured to optimize functionality and durability, as they reduce energy costs by 30%. As a large-scale national company, a big part of our ethos is to play a pivotal role in serving local communities. In fact, our precast factory has partnered up with the Kuwait Foundation for Advancement of Sciences to research the possibility of recycling concrete leftovers to be reused in the production of fresh concrete mixes. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In light of your collaboration with the government, what areas can be improved to make the country more attractive for FDI?</h4><p>China State Construction Engineering  (CSCEC) has been operating in Kuwait since 1980, establishing a permanent presence in 2008. Due to our rapid growth over the past few years and our leading position as the largest contractor in the world, we naturally decided to expand the relationship between China and the State of Kuwait by developing and executing major infrastructure plans that will support new revenue streams and trading opportunities for Kuwait. We therefore expect Kuwaitis to benefit from this and the economy to pursue its undergoing diversification. We are absolutely confident that Kuwait's public sector will remain a thoroughly robust business partner of CSCME, and moving forward, we must ensure that the bilateral cooperation is mutually beneficial and in line with both parties' goodwill and intent. We also look forward to the establishment of solid financial procedures that guarantee prompt payment while maintaining the ease of funds transfers in and out of the country. The government must continue to improve itself in terms of decision making. To achieve that, it needs to review its rules and regulations and remove the major obstacles to doing smooth business in the country.</p><h4>What key factors give your company a competitive edge during tender procedures?</h4><p>We are appreciative of the transparency with which Kuwait calls for public tenders. All the companies involved have access to rapid and transparent information regarding where they stand in terms of pricing and design. This also allows for a fair and well-regulated competition.While we are highly confident that we can always offer the most competitive bid, we may not always offer the lowest price; however, we can guarantee an unparalleled expertise and strength in depth. Our clients can be assured that we will deliver on time and on budget. We are a technology-driven company, and we utilize our R&amp;D to continuously develop new methods and construction systems. We have, for example, a high-rise construction system, called Tower Builder, that we hope to roll-out in Kuwait in the near future. We have also developed technologies that allow all utilities to be accommodated with a single tunnel culvert. This minimizes the utility footprint within the building area and largely limits intrusive and disruptive maintenance works. We hope to showcase this technology as a part of the larger infrastructure development projects in the country.</p><h4>As CSCME is about to become a local company, what main opportunities will the company obtain?</h4><p>We expect to get registered as a local company under the KDIPA in the near future. This will allow us to hire, develop, and mentor more Kuwaiti talent but at the same time allow us to enhance the qualifications of our own cadres. Our company's policies will benefit our local staff by providing training, technology, and knowledge transfer. The latter is one of the driving principles and purposes of the agreements reached between our mutual leaderships and we are happy and excited by the opportunity that we have in this regard. As a local company, we will strengthen our position as a long-term partner and by doing so, we will be able to increase our participation in the future development of Kuwait and its people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	How do you assess Cagamas' performance in 2018, and what have been the Company's main accomplishments? </h4><p>In 2018, Cagamas' business strengthened, as it continues to provide liquidity and support to the local financial institutions via competitive cost of funding raised from a diversified pool of investors. We continuously aim to deliver greater value to financial institutions with the products, services and tools to enable them to serve the market more effectively and efficiently. In 2018, Cagamas had another successful year with total assets purchased amounting to MYR12.1 billion (USD2.96 billion) and total issuances worth MYR15.8 billion (USD3.86 billion), the highest since 2008, with 22 new Cagamas debt securities and five new Cagamas foreign currency issuance exercises. Issuances raised from the domestic market was MYR14.62 billion (USD1.13 billion) amounting to 93% and 7% or MYR1.13 billion (USD276 million) equivalents were raised from our multicurrency programs that were established in 2014. In July 2018, Cagamas' tenacity to engage with investors has resulted in the inaugural issuance of US Dollar floating rate notes (FRNs). The issuance also represented the Company's second foreign currency FRNs issued under Cagamas' multicurrency programs. The first FRNs was in the Australian Dollar, issued in October 2017. We have also issued similar financial products for Hong Kong Dollars (HKD). The Bond Pricing Agency Malaysia (BPAM) had at its annual BPAM Bond Market Awards awarded Cagamas with the award for Top Issuance—All and Top Traded Amount—Conventional categories for the year 2018.</p><h4>How does Cagamas promote affordable housing? </h4><p>Staying true to its mandate, Cagamas continues to play a role in government-initiated housing programs. In promoting homeownership, Cagamas' role is in the area of providing competitive, long term, and ready financing to financial institutions for house mortgages. Therefore, Cagamas has indirectly contributed to the “accessibility" of financing to provide homes to borrowers. Cagamas is actively involved in the My First Home Scheme (SRP) and the Youth Housing Scheme (SPB) introduced by the government. These affordable housing schemes provide support and financing options to eligible Malaysians to own their first homes. For both schemes, its sister company, Cagamas SRP Bhd acts as guarantor with the banks on financing above the 90% level. What that means is if an applicant obtains 100% financing, Cagamas SRP will guarantee 10% (from 90% to 100%) of the financing. The SRP has recently included first-time home buyers who are self-employed and with monthly household income of MYR5,000 (USD1,224) and below, to purchase their first home priced up to MYR300,000 (USD73,000). This scheme is packaged with a mortgage guarantee from Cagamas to extend the financing amount above the regular 90% to a maximum of 110%. As of December 2018, Cagamas has provided guarantee for housing loans totaling MYR3.7 billion (USD906 million), enabling about 18,000 individuals and households to own their first home. <br>
	Moving forward, Cagamas is taking steps to develop innovative products focused on Sustainable Investment strategy. These products seek both financial return and social good to bring about positive change. We believe that innovative schemes such as shared equity funding, Rent-to-Own and alternative funding options, such as crowdfunding and Affordable Housing Trust will enable targeted borrowers to be more 'bankable' when purchasing their first homes. In addition, this will enable socially responsible or green investors to include these products into their portfolio, broadening Cagamas' pool of investors. Cagamas also contributed to creating knowledge in affordable housing by jointly organizing the Conference on Constructing and Financing Affordable Housing across Asia with The World Bank Group.
</p><h4>
	Are you planning to further strengthen your Islamic finance offering to capitalize on your capabilities in this area?
</h4><p>
	Being the largest issuer of debt instruments in the Malaysian capital market, we have contributed to the strengthening of Malaysia's position as a global Islamic finance hub. Cagamas' Islamic finance offering will continue to progress alongside the conventional offering. In term of sukuk issuances, Cagamas will continue to issue to meet growing domestic demand as well as create international awareness and acceptance of sukuk. The existing MTN program is being upsized and will see additional features to the existing sukuk offered under the program, which is expected to provide more options to discerning sukuk investors. Cagamas is also working to add additional sukuk structures to the existing EMTN program to tap the international market. In line with Bank Negara Malaysia's guidelines for a value-based intermediation (VBI) initiative, the Company is embarking on purchasing loans and financing related to environmental and social impact projects, in addition to piloting the issuance of sustainability bonds and sukuk to fund these initiatives and mortgage REITS. With VBI, Cagamas aims to deliver the intended outcomes of Shariah through practices, conduct and offerings that generate positive and sustainable impact to the economy, community and environment, consistent with the shareholders' sustainable returns and long-term interests. Through this initiative, Cagamas will be able to broaden our investor pool to include socially responsible or green investors that would help open the market further.
</p><h4>How do you brand your services abroad and engage international investors? </h4><p>
	A multi-pronged approach is adopted by Cagamas when it comes to our branding and engagement efforts that are done mainly through active participation in relevant speaking engagements to profile Cagamas and its product offerings to potential international investors around the Asian, Asia Pacific and EUMEA regions. Cagamas participates regularly in international investor non-deal roadshows and meetings to gain insights into investors' sentiments. These insights enable us to offer a range of products catering to both conventional and sukuk investors for the international bond markets. Corporate bonds and sukuk issued by Cagamas have tenures ranging from three months up to 20 years, which makes the papers attractive to different investor segments i.e. financial institutions, corporates, insurance companies, asset managers/trust funds as well as foreign investors Cagamas continued to be accorded the international rating of A3 by Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) and the domestic ratings of AAA by both Malaysian Rating Corporation Berhad and RAM Rating Services Berhad. This is a testament to Cagamas' consistent track record of strong governance, robust asset quality, stable profitability and prudent risk management.  As one of the largest issuers of corporate bonds in the Malaysian capital market, Cagamas was accorded the Top Conventional Bond Issuer and the Top Traded Amount—Overall Category in 2018 by Bond Pricing Agency Malaysia (BPAM). The Company's contribution towards Malaysia's continued global leadership in the Islamic Capital Market was also recognised with the award of Issuer of the Year-Quasi Sovereign and the Best Quasi-Sovereign Sukuk for the dual reopening of 3-year RM475 million ringgit sukuk and RM525million ringgit Sukuk at The Asset Triple A Islamic Finance Awards 2018. Cagamas also received the Islamic Finance Advocacy Award (Capital Markets) 2018 at the Global Islamic Finance Award (GIFA) 2018. By being a market leader in the domestic market, Cagamas is able to sail into the international capital markets with minimal challenges faced. Moving forward, Cagamas hopes to enhance and strengthen our ability to raise funding from a broad group of fixed-income investors while reducing dependence on the domestic market. A steady increase in visibility among international investors will strengthen our position as a global Malaysian corporate issuer. As the market and investors evolve to demand a higher level of sophistication in products, Cagamas continues to proactively identify opportunities, provide innovative solutions, develop more diverse financial products and leverage on digital platforms.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Gulf Consult reinvented itself over its 50 years of history?</h4><p><span></span><strong>UBED ARAIN </strong>This company started in 1967, as a small A&amp;E practice; however, in a few years the economy started to boom due to the increase in oil prices, and the government started spending on infrastructure and public housing, and this led to the company's growth. When I joined in 1975, we started to diversify our activities further into large projects, the industrial sector, and infrastructure. This allowed us to grow over the years and sustain our activity. We have been able to adapt to the needs of the market and society while maintaining a high quality of work. Our strategy is paying off, since we have many repeat clients.</p><h4>To what extent is the promotion of green buildings essential for Kuwait's sustainable development?</h4><p><strong>NAJLA H. ALGHANIM </strong>The private sector mostly seeks short-term ROI that is not possible with the capital requirements of green buildings, especially since power and water tariffs are already extremely low. In the US, it is worth investing in sustainable development because it reduces bills over time. It does not in Kuwait, so there is no incentive to have a more efficient building. Unfortunately, the government is not willing to initiate unpopular initiatives, and for this reason it will be hard to change this in the short term.</p><h4>What were the key factors that allowed Gulf Consult to obtain the design of T2 project?</h4><p><strong>UA </strong>Invitations for the project were initially sent to international companies who then had to choose a local partner and submit a joint proposal. In order to win the tender, we looked into the foreign company with the highest chance of getting the project. Foster + Partners (F+P) became the obvious choice since it had recently designed the airports in Beijing and Hong Kong. We approached it and demonstrated our credentials and ability to successfully work on government projects. Once the project was awarded, we helped F+P with project's design development and approvals from local authorities. At present, we are helping to supervise the construction of the project. The only negative factor was that the project has become much bigger and costly than initially budgeted.</p><h4>How does Gulf Consult differentiate itself from its competitors?</h4><p><strong>NHA</strong> Another aspect of our success is the strong involvement of upper management in any project from the beginning until the end. We always make sure our values trickle down to all levels of the organization, and we make sure the client feels that.In what ways are you contributing to women empowerment in your sector?</p><p><strong>NHA</strong> Women in Kuwait are extremely empowered. There are no restrictions on what they can or are allowed to do. In fact, since there are more female engineering students at Kuwait University than male, many women end up holding high positions in organizations across the country. For example, the current Minister of Public Works is a woman. Therefore, our business sector does not need to actively market itself to women. Today women can successfully have a career and a family at the same time.</p><h4>What are your objectives and expectations for 2019?</h4><p><strong>UA</strong> We have started a small diversification overseas with two projects in Bahrain, one in Sri Lanka, and one in Sudan. We are also looking at opportunities in North Africa and Bangladesh. In Kuwait, we are currently working on some PPPs, including the Umm AlHayman Treatment Plant. In order to sustain our company, it is important to continue to work on multiple projects in different sectors and to continue to explore new possibilities.</p><p><strong>NHA</strong> Moving forward, we need to invest in excellent human resources and technology. We need to keep ourselves abreast of any new advancements. Our strategy is to survive based on historic lessons, redefine ourselves, and do quality work. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What business strategies is Mabanee relying on to maintain its position in the market while increasing its market share?  </h4><p>At present, we are focusing on shopping malls and maintaining diversity by trying to improve our position in the hospitality sector that is linked with the mall business. We are trying to integrate hotels with every mall we build. In fact, according to our research, hotels linked to malls have approximately 25% higher occupancy rates. We are also working to introduce office buildings and residential developments into these projects; the idea is to create a community. Even though we have not operated any hotels yet, we are currently building two hotels in Kuwait City, one in Bahrain, four in Riyadh, and three in Khobar as well as planning to build one in Sharjah. All of them will range from three-star hotels to luxury five-star accommodations. </p><h4>In what ways is The Avenues differentiating itself from other comparable shopping malls in the region?</h4><p>The Avenues Kuwait is often compared to the big shopping malls in Dubai or The Avenues in other Gulf countries. In the Avenues, we annually count more than 40 million visitors that come to visit our 1,100 stores. Hence, we are one of the largest malls in terms of visitor and store numbers. In addition, since we opened Phase IV, we have experienced around 20-25% growth in the number of visitors, many of them coming from the GCC region. In addition, in order to differentiate ourselves from the competition, we are creating entertainment and lifestyle projects, not just shopping malls. We want people to go and have coffee, meet up with friends, stay in the hotel, and engage in a certain lifestyle, not just go shopping. </p><h4>In light of Mabanee's projects in Riyadh and Khobar as well as its introduction to the Kuwait Stock Exchange, to what extent can the company expect increasing levels of investment? </h4><p>Our project in Riyadh contains one of the largest malls and built up areas in the world at 1.7 million sqm. It will contain five towers of around 36 floors each and a shopping mall of approximately 400,000 sqm of leaseable area. There will be 1,350 stores and a car park with 18,000 spots. Moreover, there will be one office building and four hotels, part of which will be residential. The construction cost for the total project will be USD3.2 billion, excluding the fit out. Our Khobar project is also huge, at around 60% of the size and the cost of the Riyadh project. We would like to introduce a mixed-use project, including an office building, three hotels, residential units, and a shopping mall with approximately 180,000sqm of leaseable area. With both projects, we intend to double our net profit after four to six years, which is something our investors look forward to. In fact, we have a conference with our investors from all over the world after each quarterly financial result. In the Kuwait stock market, investors sometimes only take notice of the cash dividends on their stocks and because we have had projects under construction, our dividends were considered low. This is why our stock has not picked up; however, this is not something to be concerned about because the high amount of capital is tied up in the construction process, limiting the number of dividends ratio. The population around Riyadh will rise to 10 million within the next five years and while there are a few malls, they are not like the project we are going to build. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In light of your collaboration with the government, what areas can be improved to make the country more attractive for FDI?</h4><p>China State Construction Engineering (CSCEC) has been operating in Kuwait since 1980, establishing a permanent presence in 2008. Due to our rapid growth over the past few years and our leading position as the largest contractor in the world, we naturally decided to expand the relationship between China and the State of Kuwait by developing and executing major infrastructure plans that will support new revenue streams and trading opportunities for Kuwait. We therefore expect Kuwaitis to benefit from this and the economy to pursue its undergoing diversification. We are absolutely confident that Kuwait's public sector will remain a thoroughly robust business partner of CSCME, and moving forward, we must ensure that the bilateral cooperation is mutually beneficial and in line with both parties' goodwill and intent. We also look forward to the establishment of solid financial procedures that guarantee prompt payment while maintaining the ease of funds transfers in and out of the country. The government must continue to improve itself in terms of decision making. To achieve that, it needs to review its rules and regulations and remove the major obstacles to doing smooth business in the country.</p><h4>What key factors give your company a competitive edge during tender procedures?</h4><p>We are appreciative of the transparency with which Kuwait calls for public tenders. All the companies involved have access to rapid and transparent information regarding where they stand in terms of pricing and design. This also allows for a fair and well-regulated competition. While we are highly confident that we can always offer the most competitive bid, we may not always offer the lowest price; however, we can guarantee an unparalleled expertise and strength in depth. Our clients can be assured that we will deliver on time and on budget. We are a technology-driven company, and we utilize our R&amp;D to continuously develop new methods and construction systems. We have, for example, a high-rise construction system, called Tower Builder, that we hope to roll-out in Kuwait in the near future. We have also developed technologies that allow all utilities to be accommodated with a single tunnel culvert. This minimizes the utility footprint within the building area and largely limits intrusive and disruptive maintenance works. We hope to showcase this technology as a part of the larger infrastructure development projects in the country. </p><h4>As CSCME is about to become a local company, what main opportunities will the company obtain? </h4><p>We expect to get registered as a local company under the KDIPA in the near future. This will allow us to hire, develop, and mentor more Kuwaiti talent but at the same time allow us to enhance the qualifications of our own cadres. Our company's policies will benefit our local staff by providing training, technology, and knowledge transfer. The latter is one of the driving principles and purposes of the agreements reached between our mutual leaderships and we are happy and excited by the opportunity that we have in this regard. As a local company, we will strengthen our position as a long-term partner and by doing so, we will be able to increase our participation in the future development of Kuwait and its people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Everteam Role in Saudi Vision 2030]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[bilal-hmedeh-executive-manager-everteam]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will ICT play in shaping the country in its path towards Vision 2030, and where do you see gaps that can still be filled by progress towards the country's digital transformation? </h4><p>Saudi Arabia is among the leading countries in EMEA, set to achieve 4.2% increase in IT spending. In a recent study published by Technavio analysts in November 2018, the Saudi IT market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR close to 9% from 2019 to 2023. Saudi Arabia's main objective is to progress on the technology side. This has been translated through the country's willingness to invest in the IT sector and to succeed in the digital business journey. In its efforts to realize Saudi's 2030 Vision, the National Digitization Unit key program intended to ensure the transformation into “a digital society" through many aspects, with digital platforms being at its core. In Saudi Arabia, they are definitely less familiar with advanced technologies, nonetheless, they encourage its development publicly. While the primary aim of Vision 2030 is the provision of improved governmental services, we expect an increase in the use of cloud computing, the development with AI, and the demand for e-governance.</p><h4>What are the main features of the Saudi market and how do you expect the business landscape to evolve in the medium term?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is the biggest market in the region, its geographical and population size is larger than all other markets combined. It is becoming the ICT center of technology in the region due to its progressive investment in Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. The e-Government online services answer the needs that we are witnessing lately. Among these services are employment programs, e-learning services, passports and civil affairs, traffic updates and control, online issuance of commercial registers, and online payment services. Moreover, we assume an increase in demand for solutions related to data integration, analytics, and visualization. Big Data is also important, and the key lies in seeing how we can transform these technological trends to a reality that can benefit all people.</p><h4>What are the major challenges IT companies are facing when dealing with data management and potential to benefit from more data extraction and analysis?</h4><p>While new technologies are transforming key aspects of the modern business, legacy systems are holding others back, limiting innovation, opportunity, and engagement. The main challenge remains in understanding and exploiting the data that existed in those legacy systems, while keeping up with new data coming from new data sources. These new data sources deliver content in various formats such as paper documents, e-mails, text messages, photos, recordings or videos. Advanced data management tools are needed to collect, cleanse, convert, segment, code, and consolidate content data from disparate content sources to a centralized aggregated “Big Data" ready for analysis. Whether legacy or new data, discovering what is beyond those repositories and uncovering the real information is the challenge. This challenge can be addressed in two different approaches. The conventional approach which is to migrate data to a unified repository and to integrate entities together, and the new trend which is to keep the data where it is but search and analyze it from a centralized place. In my opinion, data management has two main challenges, knowing what data exists, and understanding it. Complex data needs complex processing techniques such as Computer Vision, Cognitive Services and Intelligent Recognition, and Entity Extraction. Tools such as Video, Image, and Object Analysis allow us to extract information from images and videos, convert documents and make them readable, segment them in order to separate the various entities which are then extracted and used for indexing, linking, searching, and analysis. With the above in place, controlling data becomes another challenge. That is where security comes into play, for big and small companies. Security comes in different layers. One of the main layer is how to secure the whole organization from outside attacks. This has been addressed through private cloud solutions or adding multiple layers of securing data. In Saudi Arabia, there have been some overtures to Amazon to help develop a private cloud, in which all governmental entities put their sensitive data.</p><h4>What has been the impact of Saudization in the ICT sector so far? </h4><p>One of the many goals of the Vision 2030 is the creation of rewarding opportunities by lowering the rate of unemployment from 11.6% to 7%. As such, ICT sector, which is rapidly booming, and majorly impacted by Saudization. Supported by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT), the ICT Saudization process has lately been complemented with modern training programs and incentive plans aiming at encouraging the private sector to apply the Saudization decision by interacting with other ministries. The broader picture is extremely positive: there are many talented Saudis that, after having studied at top-tier international universities, are returning to their country to put their talent into service. Both governmental and private sectors are working towards attracting and developing talent while building up capacity.</p><h4>What role does Everteam play within the digital transformation of Saudi Arabia's economy and what are your strategic priorities for 2019?</h4><p>Everteam's presence in Saudi Arabia has marked a lot of changes in digital transformation across many sectors through both our innovations and R&amp;D investments in machine learning, blockchain, and AI embedded solutions. We provide entities with information governance by helping them take control over their data and transforming them to useful information. We have worked with several sectors in Saudi Arabia such as governmental, financial, educational and health whose main goal was the development of their systems of data analysis through digital interfaces and elements of Artificial Intelligence. We built a centralized knowledge management system providing a centralized access to information across various geographically dispersed locations. We also built platforms that helped financial auditing in government entities to boost transparency and fight fraud. Starting 2019, we are hoping to create balance between local knowledge and international expertise to expand our operations and presence in Saudi Arabia as a team.  Moreover, we are willing to introduce digital transformation in the remote areas of the country and expand our focus to include them, perhaps through new partners. Additionally, we are working to develop strategies in order to collaborate with the public sector and help them achieve their own targets. Flexibility combined with financial stability is giving us an edge in this more demanding, less patient market, where the sales cycle has been shortened from at least a year to a couple of months.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Established with QAE100 Million Capital]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mohamed-khalifa-al-sada-chairman-managing-director-shail-shipping-2020vip-interview]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main areas of focus and activities that you have had as a company?</h4><p>The company was established in December 2016 with a share capital of QAR100 Million. This capital was subscribed by 343 local Qatari shareholders making it a private joint stock company in the State of Qatar. The capital was raised to purchase Dry Bulk Carriers for transporting Gabbro (used for road and civil construction works) from UAE to Qatar. The opportunity and growth of local investment into this sector was based on a report prepared for us by KPMG. So, from Jan 2017 to June 2017, the company acquired 2 x abt. 52,000 dwt geared grabbed dry bulk carriers (called as “supramax") and 2 x abt. 75,000 dwt gearless ships (called as “panamax"). Since its inception, the main focus of our company has been to create capability within Qatar to become Qatar's largest owner of Dry Bulk Carriers to primarily transport majority of about 20 — 25 million mt per annum of gabbro imported by Qatar in our own Qatari flagged &amp; registered ships. And then, to step-up to expand Qatar's role in regional and international arena in operating ships for transporting cargoes like Wheat, Grain, Soyabean, Coal, Iron Ore, Cement Clinker, Minerals etc. The KPMG report also identified potential investment in Offshore Support Vessels (used for supporting offshore Oil &amp; Gas rigs / constructions) for the growing offshore activity in the State of Qatar. The company is evaluating its options to participate in this sector for the benefit of all its stakeholders but more particularly taking pride in playing a role in adding to our country's assets, services, and capabilities.</p><h4>How did the embargo affect your operations?</h4><p>The embargo was a complete surprise and shock to the very genesis of establishing this organization. In fact, one of our ships (S'hail Al Khor, 75323 dwt) was in the midst of loading Gabbro from Fujairah in UAE when this announcement was made public. Our second ship, namely “S'hail Al Ruwais" (52,817 dwt, geared grabbed ship) was discharging Gabbro at Mesaieed in Qatar under a long term transportation contract. Further, we had third ship “S'hail Al Doha" (52455 dwt, geared grabbed ship) carrying cargo namely “Slag" from Japan to UAE. Not only this, we had entered into an agreement to purchase our fourth ship “S'hail Al Mafyar" (75522 dwt) for delivery in Fujairah on/around 9th June 2017. And then add to the fact that all our ships are not only Qatar flagged and registered but also 100% owned by Qataris. I must give credit to our extremely profession team who not only ensured to resolve the company's above contractual obligations without significant damage but also swiftly changed gears to shift the fleet to international trading. Since then, we have been successfully trading our ships world-wide from USA to China to Australia transporting dry bulk cargoes like Wheat, Grain, Soyabean, Coal, Iron Ore, Bauxite, Cement Clinkers, Minerals etc. Till date, we have globally transported about 4 million MT of various dry bulk cargoes.</p><h4>What are the next natural steps in order to continue growing the company?</h4><p>Recognizing company's excellent performance and capabilities and in consistence with Qatar's Vision 2030 document, Qatar Development Bank (QDB) found the company as an ideal business organization for funding the company's expansion plan. So, in November 2018, we purchased our 5th Ship, “S'hail Al Wajbah" 76,633 dwt, fully funded by QDB. In the meantime, during an Extra Ordinary General Meeting of the Company in October 2018, the shareholders too approved to fund the company's expansion plan. Thus, the company entered into agreement to purchase 2 additional ships for a price of about QAR75 Million. Both the ships namely “S'hail Al Rayan" (76,629 dwt) and “S'hail Al Dukhan" (74,143 dwt) will be delivered to us during June 2019. This will increase the company's fleet to 7 ships and dwt to 483,522 thereby enhancing the cargo carrying capacity and the revenue. With the on-going increase in company's exposure in transporting global dry bulk commodities, the organization is currently also engaged in identifying opportunities to diversify into other segments of shipping and maritime sectors, particularly “Offshore Support Vessels" required under long term contracts by Qatar state-owned companies and/or oil majors based in Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[he-sheikh-jassim-bin-mohamed-al-thani-vice-chairman-mohamed-bin-hamad-holding-2020]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With health as one of your main business, what are the main companies under this umbrella?</h4><p>In January 2018, Allegheny International, a Philadelphia-based hospital, came here and started operating Doha Clinic, which has been around for a while. Health is the backbone of our holding company. We have the hospital and clinics, two pharmacies, a medical company which imports and exports medicine. We have Icon Medical, which started in 2013, and is for orthopedics and neurology. We have West Bay Petroleum, which was established in the 1980s to import and export chemicals. We do a lot of business with QP and Baker Hughes. We have hospitality with Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza, which was the first hotel we invested in. It is a five-star hotel, unlike most Crowne Plaza hotels, which are usually four star. We have a good occupancy rate, even though the hotels here are suffering from the blockade. We started a Holiday Inn as a four-star hotel where Holiday Inn is usually three star. We have good food and beverage offerings in both hotels, which contributes to the hotel revenue.</p><h4>What are the new business lines you plan to open in 2019?</h4><p>By the beginning of next year we will open up a mall, with a high-end Lulu supermarket. They will start operating after they have decorated the mall. We hope for this to open in April 2020. In terms of health, there is a new hospital, which will be next to that mall. We own the whole plot, 1.1 million square meters. It used to be my father's farm. It is the biggest plot close to Doha, so we decided to develop it with the mall first and then the hospital, which will require three years, at least, to build. That will start in 2020. The whole project will be called Abu Sidra City. In 2019, we are not opening any new businesses, as we plan to invest in the stock market, which is now picking up.</p><h4>Do you see more opportunity of investment inside or outside of Qatar?</h4><p>If there is a window of opportunity, we will go for it. However, at the moment, we will focus on Doha, as Qatar is a safe place to invest money. You will not get a growth of 50%, but will always get growth of 8%. This is positive compared to the rates of interest you would get from a bank. In the medical sector, we saw growth of around 400% from 2017 to 2018. It is a sector that we know about and where we can succeed.</p><h4>How will the 2022 World Cup affect these sectors?</h4><p>Tourism picked up in 2018, as people want to know more about the country set to host the World Cup. We have seen a lot of Europeans coming to visit Doha, especially on cruises. Many people from Turkey and the UK want to come and visit, as they see Qatar advertised everywhere. There is a big integration now with Qatar Airways and the Tourism Authority, which advertise everywhere together. We have Trans Orient air services, which was the first business my father started in the group. The tourism sector is picking up. We see this through Trans Orient as many people are looking for packages and things to do in Doha. We started working on beach and desert experience packages as we have had many requests for this.</p><h4>How did the blockade affect your business and how did you adapt your model to cope?</h4><p>The blockade in 2017 came during the low season, which in Qatar is whenever Ramadan falls, and also the summer. The only sector which suffered was the hospitality sector, but this was the low season of tourism and business, so when the blockade came the occupancy rate went down to around 30%. But then it started picking up. We were able to absorb the shock because it happened during the low season, so we lowered our costs and cut our staff, which was a difficult decision, but we had no choice. We have loans to pay, The news of the blockade was absorbed by all businesses, although some are still suffering from low occupancy and low revenue. They need to make decisions to cut their cost. I have seen that with many hotels in West Bay. The occupancy went down to 12% in some hotels.</p><h4>What are your main plans and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are thinking about how we can benefit the most from the World Cup tournament, and other exhibitions happening in Doha. The hospitality sector is going to bounce back for sure. Our main focus will be on the stock market, as we see an opportunity there. At the beginning of 2020, we are going to see that many listed companies will get a boost. The World Cup is coming and the closer we get the occupancy is going up.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[50% B2B by 2025]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jaime-de-jaraiz-ceo-spain-portugal-lg-electronics]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved over the years in Spain, and what are its main products and activities?</h4><p>LG Electronics started in Valencia in 1996. We started humbly, with only 15 members, and progressed to the point where the average household in Spain has four LG products, and there are 15 million houses in the country. Our main businesses are consumer electronics, home appliances, telecom, and B2B (which includes Air Conditioning, Solar and Signage). We are either number one or two in the main categories. The only category for which we are not number one or two is mobile, though we are number five in this area. We are well consolidated and are perceived as the preferred brand in most the businesses we operate in. We are working to democratize innovation and technology by bringing state-of-the art technology to the point where almost 100% of the population can access it. Our B2C business is bigger than B2B; in Spain and Portugal, around 20% of our business is B2B. Our aim is to be at 50% by 2025. This area is growing by high double digits every year, and we expect to maintain this growth until we reach 50-50.</p><h4>What is LG's most innovative product right now?</h4><p>We have a great array of innovative technologies. One of the most innovative is our AI technology, as well as our ThinQ platform and our Web Os smart TV line. We are the market leader in smart TVs in Spain and many other places, and the difference between our smart TV and others is the usage. 90% of the smart TVs we sell are in use, while our competitors average around 50%. Our technology is significantly better and safer than our competitors, our smart TV being the only one certified for cybersecurity. We are in the business of efficiency, which is why we are that strong in B2B. We help companies become more efficient across the country. In the transition to digital business, we help many companies make their operations more efficient, and technology is essential for this. We are also one of the top five companies in the world in terms of green technology investment. In Spain, we entered in Solar market early in 2019. We are also number one globally for battery production and self-driving technology, breaks, info-tainment systems, and so on. In the GM Bolt, LG makes 65% of the components. Our business model is to help existing brands and to partner in order to enter the new electronics era.</p><h4>Do you have a strategy to push forward your mobile products to become a leader in the product area?</h4><p>Our aim is to lead every category we operate in. In mobile, we are improving in the market. Our aim is to get closer to the top of Spain in the coming years. We are excited about 5G and believe this will provide a big push for our business. We also have other state-of-the-art technologies like Time of Flight (TOF), which allows people to interact with the phone without touching the screen.</p><h4>Why is LG not already dominating the market?</h4><p>There are several issues. The market one focuses on has a large impact, and we focus more on certain markets than others. This means sometimes our products for one market are not suitable for another market. We are constantly evolving and developing more region-specific strategies, and I am certain we will improve our position in the coming years.</p><h4>What measures will the company take to make itself more sustainable and build sustainable products?</h4><p>We have the LG Smart Green program in place for just this sort of thing. This program was developed in Spain, though it was already activated in the mother company in Korea. LG is one of the top five companies in the world in terms of green energy technology and sustainable investments. Our business is efficiency at all levels and in all things. We have applied many of these things to the market in Spain in order to create an additional story. One of the first decisions we made in Spain in 2018 was to challenge ourselves to reduce our CO2 emissions by 55,000 tons. The company as a whole was doing 30 million tons of CO2 reduction, meaning we are just one facet of a global LG strategy. Our factories, products, packaging and everything else is planned with the intent of becoming greener.</p><h4>How has LG committed to energy efficiency over the years?</h4><p>We have been talking about efficiency for over 20 years, and we are number one in efficiency in every category. This is our business: to make life more efficient; however, it is not only about efficiency, and this is where the next step of our Smart Green mission comes in. In 2019, LG Spain will be the first company to plant 1.5 million trees using technology such as drones. We aim to lead a movement to plant 47 million (one per every Spaniard) trees a year in Spain. We want all brands and the global community to join us, because real change must be achieved. This aligns perfectly with our corporate strategy and goals. There is a great deal of innovation that improves people's lives in the short run but will undermine them completely in the long term. We, however, are in the business of making life better for people in the short, medium, and long term. Our main theme is that life´s good,  and to create Innovation for a Better Life and for a Better Planet and we want to work to keep it that way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Colombia's Digital Revolution]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[sylvia-constain-minister-information-communication-technologies]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will ICT play in the government's plan to develop the economy?</h4><p>ICT's role is central and takes up a whole chapter in the National Development Plan. If we look at other sectors such as health, education, labor, transportation, and agriculture, technology is all over the place. We are working hand-in-hand with every sector, and our objective is to see a change in focus in the way the government provides services and how we interact with our citizens. Our role is to make citizens' lives easier, not just on an individual level, but also for companies small, medium, or large. We want people to be able to dedicate more time to being productive and less time doing paperwork. That is what the digital transformation effort is all about: putting citizens and companies at the center and ensuring the government supports initiatives to make our workforce more competitive and our citizens happier. It is a cultural change; the digital transformation is not a software or hardware change, but a change in the approach to solving problems. One of the most important things we are doing within the National Development Plan is a bill in Congress now that modernizes the sector. President Duque has three pillars in his policies: legality, entrepreneurship, and equality. This bill hits equality directly and the others indirectly; as one becomes more connected, things such as fighting corruption become much easier with technology behind them. On the entrepreneurial end, it is easier when the government provides services rather than asking you to do everything. On the equality end, it is hard to find a better tool for equality rather than making sure everyone is connected. Our map of 4G connectivity is extremely concentrated, and a large portion of the country does not have it yet. If one leaves the main square of some cities, even just a few blocks away, they cannot make calls, get emails, or send videos. We are working extremely hard to fix that by changing the criteria by which we assign spectrum and doubling the number of years, plus shifting away from maximizing financial income to reduce the digital gap. That will give us the tools to reach many more Colombians and provide much more connectivity, and that will make a huge change in terms of the way Colombians live. The OECD and World Bank have released a great deal of data indicating that broadband has a significant impact on poverty, health, and education.</p><h4>How will improved broadband access change the Colombian economy in coming years?</h4><p>It will make it much more dynamic and innovative. There is a direct link between download speed and innovation. Colombia's download speed is half the global average and one-third of the OECD average. Our goal is to raise it to the OECD average. If we triple the download speed, we can have as much as a double-digit impact on GDP per capita, which is huge. That one indicator is a huge leap in terms of growth, productivity, and changing people's lives. There are 20 million Colombians who do not have access to broadband right now, and if we can connect them, it will be significant. We also have huge quality challenges as well, so it is not just about connecting more people, but also about connecting them better. That means not just having high-quality connectivity, but also working with the population to make sure it is being used for more than just viral content. It needs to be used for things that improves companies, or makes one a professional or a more informed person, getting access to content that they would not have otherwise. Our policy has four components. The first is creating a digital environment where the ecosystem can thrive. That includes the bill I mentioned and things like issuing decrees on PPPs in the sector. We want a framework where those projects can happen. The second component is having citizens and companies that are powered by connectivity and technology. That is where we are working on things like coding for children, as we will reach 12,000 children in 2019. We also want to provide online courses that provide basic digital skills from the start, from turning on a device to the languages we can learn to code in and which are more important for which industry. The third component is social inclusivity; some people have never been connected, and some people do not learn how to use it instantly. There is supply and demand support, and as we reach new people, we can help them integrate into the digital ecosystem. For those who are already integrated and face challenges like paying for that connectivity, we can help with our social welfare net. The fourth component is the digital transformation itself. It is a well-rounded policy moving in four areas at once, and in digital transformation in particular we are proud of the announcement that President Duque made in Davos with Professor Schwab and the mayor of Medellí­n, where it was declared that the first Spanish-speaking center for the fourth industrial revolution will be in Medellí­n.</p><h4>How will the ICT sector continue to be a driver for growth in Colombia?</h4><p>I do not see us as a sector in itself as much as a facilitator for growth in all other sectors. There is no sector that does not use technology or that does not need innovation; we have to pull that innovation and technology and bring it to all the other sectors. It creates new opportunities for people who may not have had them. That is a big change from where we were used to a certain number of years spent for degrees or certifications. Frankly, if you know how to program, get on board: we need you. We are pushing to help people get excited about it. I am part of a small group of women in tech, and we are convinced that the younger the ages of the girls when we reach them, the more impact we can have on them, as they think about careers in tech. The number of women versus men in the tech sector in particular is always behind, and not just in Colombia. When one is a woman in tech, they have to do their part to inspire other women and especially younger girls to think about it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In your current role, how are you able to drive this agenda of sustainable development and promote female leadership?</h4><p>I participated in the negotiations on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development behalf of Saudi Arabia.

During the negotiations, all countries realized that the sustainable change we are seeking cannot happen if we do not support equal opportunities for female leadership in various arenas.

Could you tell us more about that approach?</h4><p>The 2030 Agenda covers three dimensions: social, economic, and environmental in order to ensure development is sustainable because they are all interconnected to ensure continued prosperity of the people and the planet. The agenda also calls for a world “where physical, mental and social well-being are assured." This means that it's vital to incorporate these aspects to ensure healthy lives and support well-being to achieve sustainable development. Empowering individuals with equal health opportunities can increase economic growth and development.</p><h4>How do you assess the changes at the national level in recent years when it comes to your agenda, and what are your main advocacy points in terms of more female leadership and equality?</h4><p>Allowing women to drive was definitively a positive step in the right direction, because there is no way we could have grown as a nation and as people otherwise. Women's driving will boost the economy because it eases their access to the workforce allowing them to contribute to the country's development. In the past, employers discriminated against them because they did not have a secure day-to-day means of getting to work.  A great deal of work has been done in terms of providing job opportunities for women in Saudi in terms of supportive employment policies such as training and transportation subsidies. Under Vision 2030, 450,000 jobs have been created for women, and female labor force participation has increased from 12% in 2009 to 18% in 2017. One thing I would like to see change everywhere in the world is meaningful employment for women. Many women end up working in low-skilled jobs that do not have a career path, so they may not invest in their skills because they see few prospects in high-skilled jobs. In terms of policy, there has to be a focus on equal opportunities for everyone based on skills. In Saudi Arabia, there are more women with higher education than men. This says a great deal about their career prospects. Therefore, investing in women's career development and providing the necessary training and equal job opportunities for them is equally important for their careers and the economy.</p><h4>What would be your message to young female graduates entering the labor market who want to become agents of change in Saudi Arabia today?</h4><p>Often, men and women start seeking job opportunities after they graduate because the family structure is one where the head of the household is the main provider. However, I would suggest getting the necessary skills even before they graduate through internships or part-time jobs. This will help them understand the labor market and its needs and the career path they might want to choose or switch to. Second, my message to young women entering the labor market is to not be afraid to be selective about your career path and what you want to gain from your work. Women tend to be afraid to say “no" because they do not want to be perceived as incapable of doing the task or less skilled. I've noticed in work environments that women will take on dead-end tasks, such as getting the coffee and other admin work when they have the opportunity and the skills to intellectually contribute to the work environment instead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of IFEMA?</h4><p>IFEMA started 40 years ago in 1979. Before then, only Barcelona, Bilbao, Zaragoza, and Valencia could organize events such as exhibitions. That law was abolished when democracy came to Spain in 1978. At the time, there was a strong interest from the Chamber of Commerce in Madrid to build an events space. The following year, we held our first exhibition in an old building. Today, IFEMA is the undisputed leader in its sector. Indeed, 52% of the international exhibitions in Spain are held here. Strategically, these international events are important. At the moment, we are working on growth, but have not yet begun our expansion plans. In 2018, we did 117 fairs and over 700 events. We have a wide variety of events happening at IFEMA. We are organizers of some of the biggest professional  fairs in Europe, like Fitur, in tourism, or Fruit Attraction, in the fruit and vegetable industry. We also organized other public events, such as musicals and popular culture exhibitions. We want to widen our portfolio, so we are working on sporting events like Madrid Horse Week. We want to diversify because 75% of our revenues come from internal organization of events. We are also working internationally to export leading brands to other countries. We have held a Fruit Attraction in Shanghai and Egypt, and ARCO, The International Contemporary Art Fair,  in Lisbon. We have prioritized the Latin market, with projects in Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. We are running an exhibition center in Baja California. We know that we can make real success taking these exhibitions to other countries.</p><h4>What is the distribution of your client portfolio between public and private, and what is your economic contribution?</h4><p>We started doing public events two years ago. Professional events make up 85% of our portfolio. Now we are doing concerts. We have a special agreement with Mad Cool. There are peaks and troughs in the volume of events we manage. We need to focus on the summer to bring more business. We do the same with Christmas. We contribute a lot in terms of labor as we provide external works for companies coming here. Over 20,000 jobs were created in 2018. There are restaurants, hotels, and other subsidiaries. IFEMA attracts 3.6 million people every year. In 2019. we will reach 4 million. We are increasing the rate of international visitors. This is important because these visitors spend much more money than locals. We are attending many exhibitions abroad. We also visit our customers.</p><h4>What is the attractiveness of Spain for the MICE sector, and why is Madrid attractive for these organizers?</h4><p>Madrid undoubtedly has an advantage over any other European city with its climate, food, culture, and people. If you come to Madrid, the time after seeing an exhibition will be full of sightseeing and enjoyment. The average tourist's expenditure in Madrid is much higher than other regions that depend on beach tourism. We are three minutes away from the airport and 10 minutes from the city center via metro. We try to involve MICE attendees. It is important to have presidents of the region come and participate in these events. We are trying to open the city to these kinds of events . We are organizing events at the venue as well as in Madrid, where there are spectacular spaces available. Madrid has great potential, and public officials are working to improve the city's brand internationally. Our big advantage is sports. The last four Champions League finals had two teams from Madrid playing. There are so many things to do that are unique to Madrid. Real Madrid has a box to for attendees of our events. We work closely with public authorities to improve Madrid. The city government has 31% of our shares, the regional government, or autonomous community, has another 31%, and the remainder is held by the private sector, represented by the Chamber of Commerce and a foundation. IFEMA is the second biggest engine for the region after the airport. The shareholders see IFEMA as a good tool to extend Madrid's brand and attract international tourists, especially in the MICE segment. When I started I did not want a political seat. All the parties involved were aligned with IFEMA's objectives. I built a strategic plan to double the size of IFEMA in five years. We are currently overachieving that target. We are in a transformation plan that is providing the expected results. One example is the expansion of the Valdebebas Campus. That expansion is going well.</p><h4>What are some of IFEMA's plans for 2020?</h4><p>We will be working on two big projects to make IFEMA more international. We will also work on widening the portfolio of products that we offer. We see a variety of new things that can be done at the Congress Palace. We are planning to build other new products that will be released in 2020. All of our events are different, which is the most amazing thing that we have. We start the year with Fitur, then the Fashion Show, followed by gifts, furniture, and jewelry. There is so much variety week to week.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[food-choice-inspirations-leading-across-cultures]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since its establishment in 2005, what have been the key factors of growth for Food Choice?</h4><p>The quality, service, and solutions we offer have been essential to achieve our targets. Our creativity is also a key factor behind our success. We have been looking for brands that really fit the needs and demands of the Kuwaiti market, and we have succeeded in implementing and developing such brands. We started with one or two brands and only a few employees, and have grown to more than 65 brands and 200 employees. We also have a presence in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and an office in Canada. At present, we have an extensive presence in co-ops, hotels, restaurants, and pastry-bakery shops. We always want to bring innovative and creative solutions to the market in order to remain at the forefront of helping consumers improve their lifestyles. There are risks associated with going after new products and solutions, but there is also a great deal of potential.</p><h4>What elements are you considering before deciding to distribute and represent a brand in Kuwait? </h4><p>Over the years, we have developed our knowledge about the local market and we have been able to build a solid base of products that are likely to succeed. We often create an idea about what is likely to be popular in the market before starting to search for the actual product; the process of finding new products is long and resource intensive. We have to make sure that the product will fit with the demands and interests of local customers.</p><h4>What are the major trends and tastes in the Kuwaiti market? </h4><p>Kuwait is a well-traveled nation. Therefore, we try to bring Italian, French, Lebanese, Japanese, and other tastes into the market. Some of these tastes were readily accepted, but others were too ahead of their time and consumers needed to be eased into these tastes. At the end of the day, our hard work has allowed us to be in line with the tastes and demands of the local market.</p><h4>What were the key factors in your expansion outside of Kuwait?</h4><p>We recognized an opportunity in Saudi Arabia in 2012 as the Saudi market was large and relatively untapped, and thought that we could make real inroads with our unique offerings. We moved into Dubai in 2014 for similar reasons, and we developed a presence in Canada in 2013, where we only make special orders for certain clients. We are currently looking closely at Qatar and Bahrain and have established a factory in Turkey. This factory makes canned products for our own brands. We believe in being not just a distributor but in being a company that makes its own vision. We want to bring value from scratch and create something that is unique and special to us.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2019?</h4><p>2019 will be a good year for us and the market. We are always optimistic. We are always looking to meet targets and develop new products and innovative ideas. We have new brands in the pipeline. We invite experts from our suppliers and help customers discover and understand the products. We also host events that help the launch of new products. The Kuwaiti market is an important one, with a promising future for growth. It is characterized by purchasing power due to the strength of the local currency, the current economic stability, and the successive projects carried out by the state and the civil sector.</p><h4>What is your perspective of Kuwaiti youth and small enterprises?</h4><p>Young people are adventurous in nature and tend toward establishing small companies or one-man enterprises that do not need large sums of money. It allows the project owner to run his own company flexibly and independently without having to comply with the procedures required to make decisions in companies. This limited liability is the reason why many use a part of their savings or seek loans to start their dream project. Currently, in Kuwait we see many such small companies becoming an important part of the services, restaurants, and entertainment options available. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What growth potential does the agriculture and fishery sector have, and what place can it take within Kuwait's national plan?</h4><p>Kuwait's agriculture and fishery sectors face various challenges inherent to desert lands, hot climate, and water scarcity. Nevertheless, motivated by the vision of HH the Amir and the cabinet's instructions, PAAAFR has adapted a package of policies to face such challenges with the ultimate goal of developing agriculture, animal, and fish farming in the national plan of diversifying the economy away from oil and gas. PAAAFR is also working on providing opportunities to both individuals and corporations to ensure the growth of the agricultural sector and its productivity in order to achieve national food security. In this regard, the agricultural, animal, and fish farming sectors provide various services and needs, including land fit for farming, agricultural material, fertilizers, effective chemical pesticides, vaccines, vet clinics, fodder outlets, outlets to market products, labs, guidance and training, seminars, and scientific practical and theoretical courses and brochures. In addition, PAAAFR collaborates with the relevant government bodies to provide the needed capital, loans, and reasonably priced irrigation and road grids for the farms. PAAAFR has encouraged individuals and corporations that had already shown competence in farming and productivity by providing them with new farming lands to expand and increase their productivity. The agricultural sector has grown remarkably over the past few years thanks to the projects conducted by PAAAFR, which have focused on pastures and forest farming materials, water usage technology, monitoring and fighting desertification, setting regional regulations for using processed sewage water, designing and building agricultural products and marketing centers, developing palm researches, reducing the risk of using agricultural pesticides, and developing wild plants, martyrs palms, and other projects. </p><h4>What solutions are being implemented to ensure food security while reducing costs related to food imports?</h4><p>PAAAFR highly prioritizes the safety of agricultural, fish, and animal food stuff by providing the needed labs and agricultural quarantines, examining food safety, and conducting tests and applied researches to probe the most efficient irrigation technologies, fertilization rates, methods of fighting pesticides. PAAAFR has also worked on providing solutions that best suit Kuwait's environmental conditions through boosting farmers' awareness about the best quality and most productive crops, farming methods, fertilizers, pest-fighting methods, and suitable modern irrigation systems, among other issues. Using such solutions, PAAAFR achieves the best use of land and water resources, which would naturally help maintain productivity rates and cut down imports. In its work, PAAAFR also considers the special nature of Kuwait's climate and environment through setting suitable and effective solutions for soil and water problems and contributes to land reclamation projects and treating oil-related pollution to maintain the soil's ecological diversity and fertility. PAAAFR also uses biological fertilization methods instead of chemical ones as well as composted and recycled green wastes with the aim of returning basic nutrients to the soil.</p><h4>How is PAAAFR working with the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Arab Organization for Agricultural Development (AOAD) to shape a legal framework around production standards and methods?</h4><p>As an effective member of FAO and AOAD, Kuwait is working on enhancing strategic partnerships and making use of creative methods of production with the ultimate goal of fighting soil deterioration, water paucity, and climate changes. It is also evident that cooperation amongst member states will also lead to setting a legal framework on production methods and regulations. To cement cooperation with FAO and AOAD, Kuwait approved agreement on building permanent regional headquarters for both FAO and AOAD. The presence of these organizations will develop the agricultural sector, making use of the technical, administrative, and training support they provide for Kuwaiti farmers as well as the research, experiments, and studies done in Kuwait. </p>]]></richbody0content>

The company's business standards are at an international level, and our code of ethics applies to all stakeholders. Recruitment is based on talent, and all our employees are highly valued since they actively contribute to the organic growth and strength of the company.</p><h4>How is Khalid Al Kharafi &amp; Bros increasing its cost efficiency while increasing its production and quality levels?</h4><p>Execution time is the main index for any project or production. Our management monitors this through weekly reports from our projects control department. Our R&amp;D Department has significant weight in the company to help achieve these goals, and the rest of the company takes its reports into consideration and works on them. Our HR Department conducts an annual employee evaluation based on certain KPIs. Our numerous incentives also help our workforce be more efficient. We also conduct regular maintenance on our machinery and equipment within the applicable time constraints.</p><h4>Which of your activities will experience the most significant growth in the coming year?</h4><p>Our goal is to grow as a whole, given that we are one structure. We have the ability to design, supply, and build in terms of construction, as well as design, supply, and erect in terms of steel fabrication and space frames manufacturing. In addition, as part of the services we provide, we have our own galvanization plant. Therefore, predicting a significant growth in any of our sectors will depend on demand and the project pipeline in Kuwait. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you ensure thyssenkrupp's high level of competitiveness?</h4><p>We have built our position in the global market over a period of 40 years through our unique engineering capabilities and high level of innovation. thyssenkrupp is transforming the global elevator industry by improving existing products and delivering game-changing solutions to make urban mobility more efficient, comfortable, and sustainable. Competitors profile themselves as the biggest, oldest, or most profitable; however, thyssenkrupp is an innovation powerhouse that defines the future of the global industry with its unique solutions. For example, we have recently developed a groundbreaking innovative system called MULTI, a rope-free elevator that harnesses the power of linear motor technology to move multiple cabins in a single shaft, not only vertically but horizontally as well. We have also developed TWIN, allowing two cabins to operate independently in a single shaft. This system significantly reduces the space needed for elevators by up to 40%, therefore reducing construction costs and providing extra leasable space. Another key factor of our competitiveness is our adaptability. We engage in tailor-made projects and customize all our solutions based on our customers' needs. </p><h4>In what ways is thyssenkrupp ensuring the maximum level of energy efficiency?</h4><p>Energy efficiency and space scarcity are two realities in modern cities. Energy net-zero elevators, regenerative drives, and other energy-efficient solutions in our portfolio are high-visibility subjects, garnering positive coverage for our brand and supporting us in the new installation and modernization businesses. Traditional elevator products are becoming more and more efficient and sustainable, but real change can only come from truly innovative and disruptive systems. At thyssenkrupp Elevator, sustainability means investing in innovative mobility solutions that tackle the challenges of urbanization while making cities and buildings smarter and the best places to live in. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent are your Reality H FFMS and Trainer Stations improving Reality H FFMS and Trainer Stations activities? </h4><p>Thales' Reality H FFMS simulator has been in service throughout the world, providing helicopter pilots with the required training to handle complex civilian missions. Through our military-ready version of the Reality H FFMS, which we provided to the Kuwaiti Armed Forces in 2017, we have been able to offer invaluable support to train a number of users on the latest fleet of helicopters. In creating an ultra-realistic tactical and visual environment, we are able to train pilots in a variety of emergency scenarios that cannot be easily accomplished on real helicopters.</p><h4>In what ways is Thales collaborating with local authorities in Kuwait? </h4><p>Thales has been present in Kuwait for over 30 years and has developed excellent working relationships with a number of authorities across the country. For example, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Kuwait Armed Forces are our long-standing partners. Thales is supporting the Kuwait Vision 2035 and is committed to accompanying the Kuwaiti government in its infrastructure modernization plan as a long-term, trusted partner. </p><h4>What business strategy is Thales implementing in Kuwait and how is the company ensuring to capture a bigger market share?</h4><p>By building on our decades-long presence in Kuwait and aligning with Kuwait's Vision 2035, our objectives are clear: we want to be a key pillar for competitiveness and growth in the country by developing our local expertise (industrial operations and services). We also want to contribute to the dynamics of Kuwait, by promoting and enhancing creativity, agility and nurturing our talent by fostering diversity. We align with Kuwait in terms of development, localization, industrialization, innovation, digitalization, agility, reactiveness, and homogeneity. Finally, we wish to strengthen our relationship with clients in defense, civil aviation, space, and aerospace.</p><h4>What makes Kuwait an attractive destination for Thales' activities? </h4><p>The government is ambitiously steering toward achieving the country's vision 2035 of 'New Kuwait' with a strong focus on infrastructure development. The vision includes a digital component with the transformation of Kuwait toward an ICT Hub and the development of the e-government project for the justice sector. As such, we have seen heavy investment in new technology supported by the government as an early consumer of new technologies. This ecosystem is one that aligns with our strategy and offering as Thales is a recognized leader in digital solutions across a number of sectors and has proven technology that can aide governments in their transition toward a 'digital first' world.</p><h4>What areas of opportunities exist for Thales in Kuwait? </h4><p>As Kuwait begins its diversification away from oil, the government is addressing its infrastructure development and tourism opportunities. With this, we see huge opportunities in the development of ports and specifically with the modernization of the airspace environment. In addition, the redevelopment of Northern Kuwait can potentially bring more opportunities. In line with Kuwait's Vision 2035, the government is keen to create a fertile hub for international foreign investments across the nation. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead? </h4><p>According to the IMF, the Kuwaiti economy is set to expand by 2.9% in 2019, following growth of 1.7% in 2018. This is a clear indicator that the Kuwaiti economy is robust considering the decline in oil prices. As a result, we are incredibly optimistic for the year ahead due to the number of projects in the pipeline coupled with the country's financial outlook. In addition, we are seeing that Kuwait's non-oil activity is supported by a healthy labor market and a large infrastructure push. Kuwait's fertile economy coupled with strong financial growth forecasts further cements its status as a regional powerhouse. We are delighted to be working hand-in-hand with Kuwait and its people to move forward in realizing Vision 2035. We are excited for what the future holds in 2019 and beyond. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-commitment-for-the-ages]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Siemens participate in offering tailored digital solutions to the Kuwaiti market?</h4><p>In 2018, Siemens spent more than EUR5 billion globally on not only developing new technologies and applications but also on updating its existing portfolio. Kuwait's oil and gas sector has to transition toward automation and digitalization because digital technologies will help the country maximize the value of every barrel of oil. Siemens has set up a MindSphere Application Center in Abu Dhabi in order to closely work with customers on developing digital AI solutions focused on the oil and gas and process industries. Data analytics and the use of IoT-connected devices minimize downtime and production losses while saving costs and protecting critical assets.</p><h4>In which other sectors can Siemens' solutions be implemented?</h4><p>Besides the oil and gas field in Kuwait, we serve the energy industry. For example, IoT allows components in energy systems to supply data for consolidation, visualization, and evaluation, which drives efficiency and enhances grid safety and reliability. IoT solutions can be a key factor in managing complex future energy systems. In Kuwait, the vision of His Highness the Amir is to generate 15% of total power through renewable sources by 2025. This will require completely new ways of operating a grid. Siemens can deliver not only on the wind and energy solutions, but also provide and support the energy sector with digital solutions to make the grid more reliable, stable, and efficient. Kuwait has a great deal of natural resources such as oil, sun, and wind, and the Shagaya pilot project has proven that it makes sense for Kuwait to invest in these resources. Siemens has been in Kuwait for 60 years and has been the partner of choice for customers and contractors for decades.</p><h4>What medical devices solutions can Siemens bring to the table?</h4><p>In the last few years, Kuwait has invested significantly in government and private hospitals. Hospitals provide Siemens with an excellent playing field because it can offer solutions from energy systems, building management systems, digitalization, medical devices, and technologies such as CT scanners and X-ray machines. Our wide portfolio can be adapted to Kuwait's needs, and we are pleased to provide medical institutions with top-notch solutions and equipment.</p><h4>After one year, what results have you seen in your involvement in the Kuwait Vision 2035?</h4><p>Siemens Kuwait has signed an MoU with Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS) and the Sabah Al Ahmad Centre for Giftedness and Creativity (SACGC) with the intention of contributing to the Kuwait Economic Vision 2035. Siemens is providing specialized trainings and programs in the areas of energy and industry for newly graduated students and other forms of labor via the Siemens Power Academy and SITRAIN institutions. In the field of industrial automation, Siemens will roll out the Siemens Mechatronics Certification Program (SMCP) at SACGC, and as part of the program, SACGC will be provided with a mechatronics system and a training program in which the students will be tested and certified. According to our research, the time it takes to bring a graduate up to speed in industry is six to seven years, but with specialist training we will be able to halve this time.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2019?</h4><p>We are fairly positive, and since Siemens has a broad portfolio and a set of capabilities, it can address the needs and challenges of the Kuwaiti market, whether they are in oil and gas, energy, healthcare, or private industry. In addition, because we are greatly focused on digitalization, we see a big market in Kuwait; however, one challenge will be to get the right resources, because digitalization requires different skills in the future. We are keen to continue to build upon our 60-year presence in Kuwait by bringing business to society. We have a long-term commitment, and this pays off. Kuwaitis know that when Siemens takes on a challenge, it delivers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>QPIC achieved USD19.78 million in net profit in net profit in its nine months performance ended 31 December 2018 compared to USD18.01 million in 2017. What helped it attain such positive results?</h4><p>Factors aside, QPIC's ability to achieve positive, consistent growth is a testament of its balanced portfolio of investments and business model to withstand economic and geopolitical challenges currently facing the globe; however, the primary factor influencing the announced nine months results of the financial year ending in March 31, 2019 was the upswing in commodity prices toward the end of the year, in particular the increase in the price of styrene. That is apart from the USD93.26-million share of dividends received from our investments in Equate Petrochemicals that have yet to affect our financial year-end results in March 2019.</p><h4>What decisive factor is QPIC analyzing prior to investing in new ventures and established businesses?</h4><p>There are a handful of aspects that QPIC looks at. To begin with, QPIC does not invest in new, greenfield ventures. Our investment strategy begins with an identification of established, profitable, obtain a high potential for growth, and cash-generating businesses within the industrial sector, firstly in Kuwait and subsequently in the rest of the GCC region. With regard to the decisive factors, QPIC only considers businesses that are market leaders in what they do, coupled with strong managements in place and a reputable partner. Finally, these businesses must be available at reasonable valuations. QPIC expects each new investment to be an accretive acquisition, which will increase QPIC's EPS, thereby generating a positive cash yield from day one and maximizing our shareholders' wealth.</p><h4>In which sectors and region do you plan to invest in the near future to diversify QPIC's portfolio and balance the risk?</h4><p>QPIC remains committed to Kuwait, and the company will continue to eye significant stakes in industrial companies that could benefit from Kuwait's long-term development plans. In addition, the company is open to suitable investment opportunities in other GCC countries.</p><h4>What strategies are you considering or implementing to grow QPIC's presence in the MENA region?</h4><p>Apart from its primary focus on Kuwait, QPIC constantly considers industrial investment opportunities within the GCC as well. However, with regards to the latter, the company's approach or strategy will be opportunistic in nature and remains conditional to finding attractive investments, available at suitable valuations with the right risk-to-reward profile.</p><h4>How does QPIC help its subsidiary companies obtain new sources of financing to develop their activities?</h4><p>All QPIC subsidiaries are debt free and have great potential for growth. In particular, Saudia Dairy &amp; Foodstuff Company (SADAFCO) and National Petroleum Services Company (NAPESCO), our two major subsidiaries, are debt free, and both possess significant cash balances available to fund their respective growth plans. With reference to our smaller subsidiaries, QPIC continues to utilize its strong relationships with the banking community to assist the former in securing the required funding to finance their growth as and when required.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>QPIC is well positioned and poised to close the financial year ended March 31, 2019 with excellent results. We expect to register a more robust growth vis-í -vis the previous year, reinforced by the superlative performance of EQUATE Petrochemical Company and the Kuwait Olefins Company. Conversely, the coming 2019-20 financial year is expected to be more challenging given the sharp market drop in commodity prices in the last few months. The current state of the Saudi economy could represent another challenge in this regard. Nonetheless, we are beginning to witness signs of improvement in the commodity markets and strongly believe the worst is behind us. A gradual recovery of the Saudi economy is expected to shed positive light on SADAFCO in the upcoming year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[leading-from-the-front]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the key factors that helped Kuwait Portland Cement Company to win the airport tender?</h4><p>Limak Holding shortlisted two companies that were capable of handling such a project. We were one of the companies, and the next step was to evaluate quality on the basis of concrete design mixes and the specification of the project. Based on the criteria, we created a suitable concrete design mix in our lab and did a mockup at the site under Limak's supervision. Several features had to be monitored in that mockup, such as temperature of the concrete, strength, and workability. Limak brought in a specialized third party from Dubai to supervise the mockup, and after several analyses, our concrete design mix proved to be the best. Eventually, we had to compete on price, and although our competitor was aggressive and was willing to offer an extremely discounted price, we made up the difference with our quality. Limak had a clear idea of what it wanted, and for such a project, quality is not negotiable. It also considered our financial capability; we are a zero-debt company and have a strong financial situation, allowing us to have a large onsite production capacity. We have set up five batching plants on site with an average capacity of 700cbm per hour. The project resulted in huge demand and the Ministry of Public Works added pressure by asking us to accelerate the project. Nonetheless, we managed to cast the 570,000-cbm raft foundation in a record time of nine months. At present, the total quantity casted for the airport project is about 900,000cbm.</p><h4>How have you maintained a stable share value since listing in 1995?</h4><p>Kuwait Portland Cement's Ready-Mix Division was established in 2006, though the cement company has been in the market since 1979. Our share price is mostly stable, because in the last five to six years, we have maintained the same level of profits based on the market situation. We have different sectors in our company; in the industrial sector, we have ready-mix, cement, steel, and our own financial portfolios such as shares in Kuwait Stock Exchange and GCC markets as well as bonds and estate. At present, the growth in the cement sector is slow but our growth in the ready-mix sector makes up for it. The recent project awarded to us helped in that sense. In addition to the airport project, we were awarded the runway and the airport traffic control tower. In addition, we won the tender for the maternity hospital and the Al Salmi highway.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Kuwait's development plan was announced last year and there are many projects in the pipeline. Oil prices have a significant impact on the realization of projects and some megaprojects were delayed because of low oil prices. Other projects, such as the second stage of Kuwait airport, which includes hangars and car parks, will continue; Kuwait Portland Cement will tender for this. Overall, the market is improving, and we hope the number of new projects opened for tender will remain the same. It is important that the public sector allows the private sector to take a bigger share in the Kuwaiti economy. The government seeks to shift many projects to the private sector through Kuwait Authority for Partnership Projects (KAPP), and the Shamal Azzour project is probably the best example of the private sector's positive effect on the economy. Kuwait's second-biggest project is the Umm Al Hayman Wastewater Project, which is being done through KAPP. It was awarded to a consortium of Kuwaiti, German, and French companies, and we hope to be a part of this project. The metro project and phase two and three of Shamal Azzour will come through KAPP. In that sense, we hope the tendering process will become more efficient because of Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA) and other organizations established by the government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What gives Kuwait Steel its competitive edge in the Kuwaiti market?</h4><p>Being the sole steel producer in Kuwait gives us an edge. Furthermore, national products have a pricing advantage because it is mandatory to use national products in public projects. Being a national company we get a price preference advantage of 5% over Gulf States and a 10% over non-Gulf states. This law is applied across all GCC states to protect national industries from strategic steel-importing countries. Nonetheless, our pricing strategies, market intelligence, analysis, and forecasts are our priorities as they give us a competitive edge. Our main competition comes from neighboring countries where governments do not spend as much, forcing steel manufacturers to look into alternative and lucrative markets such as Kuwait, where governmental expenditure continues even when the economy experiences a slowdown. Kuwait's industrial sector is in its early stages, as the country still relies heavily on oil and gas or hydro carbon. Steel manufacturing is the second-biggest industry; however, compared to regional steel companies, we are still small scale, though we strive to grow and transform Kuwait into an industrial country. Notably, the government subsidizes energy, and our company greatly benefits from that, aiding to our competitive edge.</p><h4>What is your strategy to ensure a bigger market share locally and regionally?</h4><p>Our main priority is securing higher market share domestically and regionally, for which we need to continue focusing on efficiency, sustainability, growth, and expansion. We have a five-year expansion plan that will kick off in 2020, aimed at expanding and integrating our steel production facilities to start producing our own raw materials and become self-sufficient. To that end, Kuwait Steel is looking into building a pelletization plant and a DR module where we will be able to produce Direct Reduced Iron and Hot Briquetted Iron, which are key raw material commodities used in manufacturing steel. Moreover, we will eventually look into acquiring an iron ore mine for our own supply. We are strategically looking into integrating through our clients and are constantly liaising and lobbying with the government to educate Kuwaitis and invite them to join our workforce. The law requires us to have 4% Kuwaiti nationals among our staff, but we are currently at 7% and target 25% in five years. As one of the highest-paying companies in Kuwait, we want to share the wealth, growth, and success with our fellow citizens; however, we still face some reluctance and challenges from Kuwaitis who expect white-collar jobs after graduating from universities. New generations have to change, because at present, the government is obliged to employ Kuwaitis in the public sector, even though sometimes hiring more people isn't necessary. </p><h4>How is Kuwait Steel working to reduce emissions during the production processes?</h4><p>Kuwait Steel's environmental policy is fully committed to minimizing the effects of its manufacturing operations. Our priority is to enhance our environmental protection performance through the implementation of latest environmental management systems. For example, our melt shop has a back-house dust system that transforms all the gases into solid waste that we sell as a byproduct from which companies can extract materials such as zinc.</p><h4>How is Kuwait Steel guaranteeing the best quality management?</h4><p>All of our products pass through a quality assurance process in all stages. Furthermore, our quality assurance facilities are established on each of the manufacturing plants to provide regular feedback to our production teams, which are equipped with the latest testing and analytical tools and equipment. We are the only company in Kuwait that links its gases to the Ministry of Environment. We use radioactivity detection systems to monitor the radioactivity levels of raw materials and work with independent surveyors who survey the scrap we procure globally. We comply with the different norms and international standards in addition to being ISO and UK Cares certified. Since our establishment, independent parties have been conducting quality surveys, further cementing Kuwait Steel's credibility and reliability. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key role is KIU playing in the industry sector? </h4><p>Our main objectives are to protect the interests of industries' owners and to see if there are any difficulties and what can be implemented in order to improve the situation. In addition, if any problem arises, we are the bridge that connects owners to governmental entities, with which we have strong ties. So far, we have received positive feedback both from our members and from the public entities that collaborate with us. Most of the issues we are facing are government related; therefore, in some agencies or ministries we have joint committees between KIU and the authority or the ministry concerned in order to efficiently solve any matter that emerges. Our interest is to serve our members and push the ministry or public authority concerned to prepare more land and infrastructure for the industry sector. Our goal is to increase the industry sector's percentage of the national income, which goes hand in hand with the plan of diversification of the Kuwaiti economy. Since we are a private organization, it is important for us to implement our initiatives swiftly because processes and approvals in ministries can take a long time. A number of government agencies seek our help because we can move quickly and approach any party, cabinet, or minister. We also sometimes work as a lobby in order to shed light on specific matters.</p><h4>In what ways is KIU filling the gap between college education and workplace requirements?</h4><p>There are thousands of graduated engineers looking for work, and most of them are not suitable to work in the private sector. We mostly focus on two-year diplomas in order to employ people with a workable skillsets instead of people aiming to evolve in the administrative field. There is a psychological war where young people are afraid to work in the private sector and believe that it is more secure to work for the government, where jobs are guaranteed, less stressful, and financially more rewarding. We want to prepare people to work in the private sector and make them understand the mentality of it. We bring them to some factories to see the reality and sometimes we also make agreements with the institution in charge of promoting people to go to the private sector. We have made some contracts and our obligation is to train and employ. We guarantee employment for them by bringing motivated people who have the interest to work in the private sector. We have succeeded so far and are happy to see that our trainees have secured jobs. We also conduct a post-employment review to understand if businesses are satisfied with the people we have selected for them.</p><h4>What will be your main focus for 2019?<br></h4><p>In the short term, we will continue to follow up with the Public Authority of Industry in order to prepare the land distribution of Shandadiya industrial area, which will allow the industry to expand. Overall, there is a better business environment since there is a better understanding of the importance of industry within the economy. I appreciate that several agencies are shifting from manual to online business as this streamlines business practices. Our priorities are hiring Kuwaitis for the local factories. To that end, we are trying to improve education and training in coordination and in partnership with small businesses and the Kuwait National Fund for Small and Medium Businesses. We will also keep helping young entrepreneurs who come to us with an idea by helping them establish a feasibility study. Regarding Kuwaitization, there is a minimum percentage that companies in different sectors have to maintain. The banking sector for example has reached 79% Kuwaitization. However, the same is harder to achieve in the industry sector because jobs usually involve work that many Kuwaitis are not willing to do. In addition, the private sector is not an attractive field for many young graduates who would rather look for a job in a public institution. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is KSE managing to conduct positive changes within the country?</h4><p>A large number of government ministers and employees are members of KSE, making us one of the most influential organizations in the country. Notably, KSE led the World Engineering Federation for two years, and the Arab Engineering Federation for three terms. We also led the GCC Engineering Federation for about 10 years. Around 400 volunteers, including professors, ex-ministers, and fresh graduates, are part of KSE. We work alongside young engineers and help establish codes and regulations for buildings and construction. Our sponsors and members play a vital role since they account for a high percentage of funds that finance our initiatives. In addition, the government provides us with KWD12,000 annually. We also have several sponsors who believe in what we do. Due to our large membership, we are well connected in many places. With our members' invaluable contribution, we implemented a green mosque initiative and thus far have turned five mosques into smart mosques. The government seeks to expand this model to other mosques since it saved as much as 60% in energy usage. The government is also looking to transform Kuwait City into a smart city, which will save more than KWD1 billion.</p><h4>What initiatives do you have with universities in Kuwait? </h4><p>We have a Young Engineering Committee that seeks out future leaders. We have a partnership with Kuwait University where we work on initiatives with professors. We also have a committee that provides students with volunteering opportunities and training. We offer a six-week course that prepares them for jobs in the private sector. We try to widen the knowledge of our engineers with courses, workshops, and conferences. We have an upcoming conference on the challenges of infrastructure, and that is bringing in speakers from all around the world. We have had initiatives regarding the oil sector and smart cities, to name a few. We have a cultural attaché that helps our exchange students with immigration and coping with the foreign lifestyle. </p><h4>How do standards in Kuwait align with those elsewhere, and how does the government ensure a standard for engineers?</h4><p>There is no regulator for engineering in Kuwait. In the UK and the US, there is an engineering council that acts as the regulator. People can just go online and get an engineering degree, but one needs to work in the lab to truly understand the field. We work with American and European boards of engineers. In the US, before you work as an engineer, you need to take an exam, but we do not have this in Kuwait or anywhere in the region. Fortunately, the government is becoming more convinced about the importance of all of this. In 2019 we received 33,000 applicants, but only approved 25,000.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges in Kuwait?</h4><p>Compared to other infrastructures around the world, Kuwait is still behind. We are trying to come up with 10 or 20 points we can present to the government. 2035 is a big plan, and it will require us to increase the land use of the entire country from 6% to 8%.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2019?</h4><p>In 2019, we will have two major conferences. Our main goal is to promote electric cars and build charging stations. We want to give the government a 15-year plan for the role of engineers in the country. We have several engineers coming to the country to educate us on state-of-the-art energy harnessing projects. We are also working on a law with the government to better regulate the field. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What specific initiatives are being implemented by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to achieve Kuwait's 2035 National Development Plan?</h4><p>Over the last two years, we undertook several initiatives to achieve Kuwait's 2035 National Development Plan, starting with a strategy aiming at a more inclusive, innovative, and sustainable economy. We have invested in creating an enabling environment for investors, start-ups, and businesses, improving our competitiveness, and diversifying our economy. We are also adopting a proactive agenda to promote FDI and international trade with strategic partners in the region and around the world, with a focus on increasing non-oil exports and extending our trade relationships with countries in the Gulf, Asia, Africa, and Europe to develop partnerships with local and international stakeholders to implement megaprojects. Over the past two years, we succeeded in enhancing investors' protection regulations while reducing the time and procedures required to start a business and eliminating the minimum capital requirement. We continue to automate Kuwait Business Center to reduce the amount of time and the number of procedures to start a business by more than 60%, which will further facilitate business registration and licensing services. Reforming business environment laws will be paramount, and we are including the Companies Law, Insurance Law, Civil Procedures Law, Competition Protection Law, Industry Law, Commercial Agencies law, and regulation of Accounting Vocation law. Equally important, we are continuing our support for local innovation, SMEs, and the entrepreneurship ecosystem through one of the largest SME funds in the world, aiming for Kuwait to become a hub for innovation in the region. Additionally, in order to support industries and improve their competitive edge, we continue to provide them with financial, fiscal, and land incentives in strategic sectors of our economy.</p><h4>How can the country better utilize its bilateral trade agreements to increase its economic participation at the global stage?</h4><p>We are activating all our trade agreements and developing new ones by building on the partnerships developed over the years with the significant portfolio of investment in many countries in the world through our Kuwait Investment Authority in major global businesses and through providing easier access to foreign investment through Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA) as well as ensuring transfer of knowledge, particularly in the field of technology. Moving forward, one of our primary focuses is reducing our trade balance by building the private sector's capacity and providing incentives to businesses in order to help them become competitive in the global markets. This will significantly help Kuwait to move away from oil dependency and diversify its economy. Also, promoting the overall business and capital market environment is key to developing new strategic commerce and industrial sectors, and the legal frameworks will be paramount to encourage commercial and industrial sectors. In addition, we have helped start-ups to successfully expand globally, benefitting from all the recent reforms and support provided through the promotion of entrepreneurial start-ups and the SME ecosystem, raising youth awareness and entrepreneurship and business, improving access to financing mechanisms, and supporting services for start-ups and SMEs, and enhancing performance and quality of those service. </p><h4>What competitive advantages does Kuwait have compared to its neighboring countries?</h4><p>Kuwait is one of the most politically and economically stable countries in the region, with easy access to its market and a new generation of innovative talented Kuwaitis capable of building the future economy. Our strategic location makes us a doorway to the Gulf states, and we are working on developing our transportation infrastructure to become even more attractive as a logistics hub for the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you educate the construction sector on the importance of energy efficiency in building and environmental sustainability?</h4><p>KGBC is a membership-based organization, with members from many different sectors and backgrounds such as consultancy offices, contractors, manufacturers, and suppliers of different building materials. We also work with governmental institutions and non-profit organizations. We cover more or less the entire cycle of the real estate industry from demand to supply side of it, working closely on a variety of specially tailored activities and events to achieve our goals. With contractors and the construction sector, we work on different tailored education programs and projects based on market surveys conducted amongst our members. KGBC holds Green Talks, forums that involve a higher level of information sharing, covering various topics related to sustainability to raise the awareness of a wider population. We also have a Green Academy that includes more technical sessions and workshops targeting consultants, contractors, and engineers. Finally, we provide our members with technical workshops and trainings on different certification systems and latest green building technologies.</p><h4>What has been the evolution of the number of certified buildings in the country so far?</h4><p>In 2009, ALARGAN's headquarters in ARGAN business park was the first LEED Platinum for commercial interiors certified building in Kuwait. Since then, we have witnessed many other oil headquarters seeking or certified with LEED or GSAS certifications. The new campus of Kuwait University, particularly the College of Technological Studies, College of Business Studies, and College of Basic Education, all seek to acquire LEED certification, while the new Kuwait Airport Terminal 2 targets LEED Gold Certification. KGBC supports all green building certification systems available on the market. We help with the education and capacity building, and when the certification process starts, we connect clients and contractors with the Green Business Certification Institute that issues certifications. We have become a link between GBCI Middle East or GBCI US and local and regional consultancy offices involved in the certification process of the projects.</p><h4>What are the main needs of the market in Kuwait?</h4><p>We often visit local private and public universities and give students mentoring sessions on LEED and green buildings in general, deliver lectures and training, and help with student projects on sustainability. Construction site and field workers lack information about certification systems, how to comply with them, and how to design, build, and operate a green building. This is an opportunity for us to provide a specialized educational program to not only engineers and students but also get construction sector workers involved from the early stage of construction until operations and end users of buildings. There is a lack of green building materials, technologies, and systems available on the market, but recent trends show growing interest in this field. In order to build a green building, it is important to not only apply the proper building systems, technologies, and materials, but also source the materials within 500 miles of the location, which reduces the carbon footprint of the transportation and manufacturing process. This is where we encourage local entrepreneurs and green businesses to find an opportunity. We work with the financial sector to offer green mortgages for people to build green. KGBC, beGREEN Global, and UK Certification Authority for Reinforcing Steels have signed an MoU to run the Construction Sustainable Materials Certification Scheme (SMCS) program in Kuwait to increase productivity in their sustainability and materials efforts, save resources, and obtain certain synergies through collaboration between the parties.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We would like to grow our membership numbers so that the platform can grow, and more corporations and individuals can join. We will be more present in different local events and target the first Kuwait GBC Annual Conference &amp; Expo conference as the main event of the year. This is not only local but will spark regional interest. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent will increased regional cooperation help tackle the water scarcity issues?</h4><p>The Gulf countries have the same nature and challenges; 90% of potable water depends on desalination. We can proudly say most of the Gulf countries are considered pioneers in desalination plants, which gives them excellent experience in this field. We are currently talking about more than three or four different technologies being implemented in the region. One of them is the multi-stage flash (MSF) technology, which Kuwait has successfully used since the 1950s. In addition, different GCC countries use reverse osmosis (RO), which requires a power supply that can be provided through solar cells. If we succeed in using PV panels for RO, countries would drastically lower their energy costs. In addition, we are now using a new technique called multi-effect distillation (MED) that heats water using steam in tubes. At the moment, these ideas have not materialized into actual projects. Dubai has a small prototype unit that it is working on, and we plan to implement this technique within one to two years once we get the data that confirms it is economically feasible. We now produce over 630 million imperial gallons, and at the end of 2018 we added another 60 million imperial gallons from the new Doha West project. Many other projects are in the pipeline to cover the high demand in Kuwait; however, currently, we are able to cover local demand, which peaks at 480 million gallons in summer, and have a significant surplus that goes to strategic reservoirs. We also collaborate with Palestine to enhance its water network systems by exchanging information either on the technology side or by training the technicians running the water network there. We use the Arabic Summit in Cairo to discuss these matters and find common solutions to our common concerns.</p><h4>An ad hoc committee dealing with water issues in Arab and Islamic nations will soon be formed. To what extent will this help the region attract more private investment in the sector?</h4><p>This committee should increase the attractiveness of the water sector in the region since most countries believe the private sector should take more responsibility and involvement in the water and power side. In Kuwait, we already delivered one project, Az Zour North, and in early 2019 we will tender for Az Zour North phases II and III, which will deliver about 2.7GW and almost 100 million imperial gallons of water per day. There is another project called Al Khiran Power Station, where we plan to produce 1.5GW and 125 million imperial gallons of water per day in the first stage. In addition, we benefit from a great collaboration with the Central Agency for Public Tenders (CAPT) when it comes to tenders for power and water generation or transmission, distribution, and related services. With the new Law 49 of 2016, we aim to expedite projects faster, thereby reducing bureaucracy and making the market more attractive for possible investors. Nonetheless, private companies willing to participate will have to fulfill certain requirements before being selected on a cost basis.</p><h4>How does the government plan to review the price of electricity to make the sector more attractive?</h4><p>Since 1966, the tariff has been KWD0.002 per kW and KWD0.8 per 1,000 imperial gallons. It is illogical that the tariff has remained the same after 50 years, which is why the ministry proposed the new Law 20 in 2016 that was passed by parliament. We raised the tariff for all sectors except residential, which remained the same. We met with the private sector to discuss an acceptable increase that would not harm the market. We, therefore, decided to gradually raise the tariff and raised it to KWD0.005, which is acceptable from both sides. In summer 2018, we found great results from increasing the tariff as it allowed us to save up to 4% compared to last year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you describe the success of the Az Zour North One project in Kuwait?</h4><p>The Shamal Az Zour project started in 2013 and was ENGIE's first major project in Kuwait following the business model of the IWPP in the GCC. The project's construction fit well within the planned timeline and original budgets. The biggest challenge in dealing with a PPP is integrating all stakeholders and having everyone involved and aligned on the project's success. A project of this size in a new country was never going to be simple; however, the overall execution was successful as a result of a strong relationship with the Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW), and we are confident our stakeholders are satisfied with the current progress in Kuwait and the performance of our private partners. After this success, we decided to continue collaborating with the state of Kuwait and opened a new office in the country to develop our portfolio of all our services, including facility management, energy efficiency, LNG terminal O&amp;M, and other hybrid and renewable plants.</p><h4>What initiatives is ENGIE implementing to be more efficient in its operations in terms of risk and cost?</h4><p>In a project of that structure, we need to optimize on the construction costs, which entails finding the right EPC company and having the right risk profile. Second, we need competitive financing (international &amp; local). Finally, one must meet the efficiency and operational excellence, and this is where ENGIE is able to mobilize key personnel from other countries, especially from the GCC. We can move many engineers and experts and attract people from Saudi, Oman, and the UAE for a specific project. This is what are clients are willing to guarantee by employing us. We cannot just rely on importing the brand of ENGIE alone; we have to commit to the process and resources, and this is what we do throughout both the construction and operational phases. However, where we struggle more is in integrating female engineers into our workplace, and this is something we are actively working on improving.</p><h4>How can ENGIE actively participate in the shift away from the oil economy?</h4><p>ENGIE has pledged to the state of Kuwait that for every project it bids on, no matter if it is facility management for energy efficiency projects, it will always establish key positions for local engineers and technicians. We know the workers and the environment extremely well; we are close to the Kuwaiti society of engineers and also meet regularly with the technical colleges. Our relationships with these groups are important for us. We also strongly believe in training centers and recently had a pilot project for green mosques to reduce a building's consumption. We developed this project to demonstrate something that does not exist in the country, and eventually we will be able to further expand this philosophy in Kuwait. Under this scheme, we identified the public entities and technical departments that can learn from that experience, and we eventually convinced other facility owners to get on board.</p><h4>What specific strategies are you most excited about for the coming year?</h4><p>We have many companies and other niche services in Engie group, and as solution provider, our local team are currently working on Facility Management, but other good examples are our colleagues working on Riyadh metro systems, or smart metering systems in GCC. One of the largest projects that we would like to develop further is the activity of district cooling, following our acquisition of 40% of Tabreed, and we have an ambitious development plan for the GCC. Unfortunately, Kuwait is the only country where Tabreed has no project at the moment, and we hope to see this change in the foreseeable future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>By 2030, KISR wants to be internationally acknowledged as the region's most respected STI gateway. How will it do so?</h4><p>We are considered unique in the region, having established ourselves as a purely R&amp;D organization in the 1960s, since which time we have developed our research capabilities as an independent institute with a system not designed or administered by the government. We are currently completing our eighth five-year strategic program up to 2020. Meanwhile, we will keep developing key research programs to meet the demands and challenges the country faces in respect to science and technology development, though I also expect new generations to come up with new research ideas that will solve complex issues. We are interested in getting more contributions from industry; hence, our solid partnership with the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation. We want our research to have a positive impact on the community.</p><h4>What specific aquafarming techniques can be utilized to ensure self-sufficiency of fish and livestock?</h4><p>Our aquaculture and oceanography research started with the establishment of the institute. KISR's task is to identify economically important species in order to study the stocks and monitor their status, but also develop aquaculture techniques to grow these fish in tanks for commercialization, while enhancing their population in the open sea. We have both environmental concerns and food security issues, and the research succeeded in developing know-how and increased productivity in several species. We have expanded our research to new species as well. Currently, species such as hamour, Subaiti, and shaem are in high demand, but are also economically feasible and can easily grow within our aquaculture methods. We also crossbred subaiti and shaem to keep bolstering our fish resources. The results have been excellent so far, and we are looking at developing new commodities such as sea bass, lobster, mangrove crab, and shrimp. To achieve our objectives, we have been developing integrated farm systems in the desert that allow us to implement an agriculture system completely efficient in terms of energy, water, plant, livestock, and fish integration. Furthermore, we have been encouraging private companies to contribute 5% to our research. For the past three years, we have received increasing interest from several farmers. About 55% of the total beneficiaries of our projects are from the private sector, and its interests keeps growing.</p><h4>How is KISR addressing environmental concerns?</h4><p>KISR has an excellent relationship with the environmental authority of Kuwait. We provide it with consultation services and have a committee for emergency fish kill. We help monitor and remote sensing data, looking for any oil slicks or other contamination. We also have our own station for radiation and air pollution monitoring. In addition, we do research on coastal management, another crucial environmental issue. If there is any damage to the coast due to extreme weather conditions, we monitor it and take the adequate steps to solve the issue. We also have a program for Crises Decisions Support environmental disasters, which tries to predict any possible environmental disaster. Furthermore, we have a program specifically for climate change modeling and assessing the acidity of the water in the Gulf and how it is affecting the fish population.</p><h4>In what ways is KISR collaborating with international organizations and institutes to better develop innovative solutions?</h4><p>We currently have more than 100 international agreements with reputable research and academic institutions. We recently signed a partnership with Csiro Lab, for example, a well-known Australian lab specialized in energy, water, and the atmosphere. Moreover, we are members of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Our role within this organization is to look at ways to use nuclear energy as a safe technology for food and agriculture, as well as the environment. We use isotopes and radiation to enhance wheat production, for example, and record acidification for climate change assessment. We also assist the government in terms of nuclear safety and control. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[efficient-practices]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What advantages does the PPP model bring?</h4><p>The private sector brings high levels of efficiency and latest business practices, and Kuwait benefits from the partnering and collaboration with the international associates, ENGIE, and Sumitomo. Partnering with the private sector also provides a profit-oriented approach whilst emphasizing and implementing the highest levels of safety. Therefore, inviting foreign investors helps Kuwait to raise the bar in many aspects. On this project, our contract lasts for 40 years, making us an integral part of the Kuwaiti infrastructure. We built, operate, and will eventually hand over the plant to the state. We intend to provide power and water to Kuwait as well as value to our shareholders before the plant is transferred. Shamal is not just a commercial investment; we have approached Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) and Kuwait University to sponsor urban greenery projects and marine ecology projects. The new plant is certainly beneficial for the country as it uses modern technology and is extremely efficient and reliable. The plant was constructed on time and under budget, which is exceptional in the region. We have completed two years of successful commercial operations and recently finished the warranty period. We produce the cheapest energy in Kuwait. Shamal Az-Zour uses gas, which we consume more efficiently and with significantly lower emissions.</p><h4>What collaboration between your shareholders guarantees the success of Shamal Az-Zour?</h4><p>Firstly, we have the strength and depth of ENGIE, which has interests in more than 23 power and water production facilities in the region. This brings to the consortium a shareholder with a proven construction and operational track record. Second, Sumitomo also has a number of assets throughout the UAE and internationally. In addition, the company has a strong financial capability and brings the JBIC financing. There is an excellent track record of Sumitomo and ENGIE working together on other plants in the Gulf, so the relationship and understanding between both organizations has always been positive. There is also the strength of the local partner, Al Sagar, a well-known engineering company. It is, therefore, the perfect mix of a strong local partner and two experienced international utility companies.</p><h4>How do you lower your costs of generation while reducing emissions?</h4><p>In the power industry, as in many industries there are economies of scale. The plant itself provides over 1,500MW of power and over 100 million gallons of water per day. Operating and maintaining the plant in a professional manner using the latest control technology ensures that we sustain high levels of efficiency and availability. We have efficient combustion systems using the latest technology from General Electric, which reduces our CO2 emissions. The private sector manages cost by having highly trained and skilled engineers and utilizing synergies in procurement activities. We ask our teams to work within an operational excellence framework and promote an innovation culture. We have 120 staff for 1,530MW and 107 million gallons of water per day. The equivalent public-owned assets would have five times that number of people. In the winter, we currently provide 27% of Kuwait's power and 20% of Kuwait's water. This demonstrates the trust the Ministry of Electricity and Water has in us in terms of reliability and availability.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Within Kuwait and particularly the utility sector, I am extremely positive. Hopefully, the Phase II and Phase III tenders will be issued, as we are keen to be involved. We recently completed the winter period of maintenance outages in advance of the summer period. Demand in Kuwait increases dramatically from 5,000MW in winter to over 18,000MW in the summer. The plant has been performing well and is in an optimum condition, so I look forward to a positive seven months of summer operations. We intend to continue to remain the most reliable and the cheapest form of power and water for the Ministry of Electricity and Water. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[partner-in-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the relevance of Kuwait for Schlumberger in the GCC region?</h4><p>Kuwait has and will always be a key partner for Schlumberger in the GCC region. In fact, Schlumberger has been in Kuwait since 1939, when we recorded the first Wireline log ever performed in Kuwait on August 28, 1939. Today, the upstream sector in Kuwait and the GCC in general has been interesting to say the least. During the financial downturn, several international companies diverted their resources and attention to the region. Kuwait and the other GCC countries handled the downturn fairly well. In contrast to global exploration and production (E&amp;P) spend and observations of the international market, Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) and the other NOCs in the GCC have not reduced their spending and have enhanced their focus on growth in oil and gas production. Specifically in Kuwait, we have seen major investments in the oil and gas upstream and downstream sectors, such as the new land rigs entering the market, different integrated drilling projects coming up, including offshore, and the investment in facilities in the downstream sector that are in perfect alignment with the national development plan New Kuwait/KPC 2040 vision.</p><h4>Schlumberger is celebrating its 80th anniversary in Kuwait; in what ways has Schlumberger contributed to shaping Kuwait's oil industry?</h4><p>We have been in Kuwait for the last 80 years, collaborating with KOC and helping it reach its targets. Throughout our 80 years in Kuwait, our main two pillars have been to become a key enabler and supporter of KOC in supporting it from pore to tank to developing the national talent. Schlumberger's commitment to Kuwait is undeniable, which is why we have become the partner of choice. One milestone we have achieved jointly with KOC is early production facilities (EPF), as a result of which we have managed to cut down the construction and commissioning time of facilities significantly ensuring more hydrocarbon is delivered to KOC at a quicker pace.</p><h4>As a foreign private actor, how does Schlumberger contribute to developing local talent?</h4><p>Developing national talent is one of our pillars. Schlumberger was one of the first companies to have its regional/Middle East training center in the country. Our training and development programs are tailored to the specific needs of the company, where each employee will receive the necessary training to perform and succeed in their career. In Schlumberger, we have a limitless career opportunities policy, where we regularly challenge our workforce to deliver above their assigned roles, potentially being promoted to different functions within the organization, with an overall goal of delivering multi-disciplined yet well rounded professionals. Not only do we challenge our workforce to advance in their careers, we also have a system in place to drive creativity and innovation within the company. Any employee, regardless of their seniority or technical knowledge, can submit ideas to a global team that filters and goes through all the submitted ideas to select which suggestion can be further developed into proof of concept that would potentially be commercialized into a final product. Today, Schlumberger Kuwait has several Kuwaiti managers including myself, and our regional headquarters are also run by Kuwaiti management.</p><h4>How far is Schlumberger willing to invest in enabling digitization in Kuwait's oil industry?</h4><p>We have been key to digitalizing the Jurassic gas fields in north Kuwait, effectively transforming it into the first integrated smart pore to process system as we enhance the joint production facility and digitally integrate it into the digital production platform built into KOC's Jurassic KwiDF. The value has already been realized in production gains of 2.5% YoY before the newest venture aiming to integrate the production facility into the project. In addition to the digital enablement of Kuwait's oilfields, our cloud-based digital solutions help our clients manage their drilling and production operations, facilitating decision-making processes while mapping every relevant information through our DELFI platform. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are extremely excited for 2019 and beyond. We definitely see growth in Kuwait's oil and gas market, with the growth of rigs coming into effect by the end of 2Q2019, in addition to KOC's focus on facilities and integrated projects to boost production in line with its vision for 2040. From a technical perspective, the wells are becoming more challenging, and reservoir management is becoming more important than ever. With the right approach and the framework for enhanced partnership with Kuwait, the challenges will be overcome, as we will always be at the disposal of KOC and other Kuwaiti companies to support the overcoming of these challenges via our international expertise. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>KPC aims to increase the production capacity of crude oil to 4.75 million barrels by 2040. How will it ensure sustainable production while reducing the cost per barrel?</h4><p>KPC's 2040 strategy identified several production initiatives that will help KPC reach its target and sustain production levels. Cost efficiency through reduction of cost per barrel is definitely challenging, especially when most of the increase in the production capacities are related to the development of more complex oil types using EOR, new oil and gas, heavy oil, offshore, and unconventional oil. Therefore, utilizing the latest technology in drilling, well completion, and oil and gas production will play a pivotal role in achieving the 2040 target. Currently, KPC is implementing a number of short and long-term business improvement initiatives to ensure a sustainable production while managing and optimizing the cost per barrel, such as utilizing optimum materials and equipment, renegotiating service and maintenance contracts, and utilizing technology to promote innovative cost-reduction measures.</p><h4>How will KPC reach its objective to increase its natural gas production capacity by 2 billion scft per day between 2020 and 2040, and why is it important for KPC to grow the natural gas production capacity?</h4><p>Natural gas has always been a major factor of Kuwait's economy as the country has a long history of natural gas exploration and processing. That goes back to 1979, when Kuwait's first gas processing complex was commissioned at Mina Al-Ahmadi Refinery—KNPC. Furthermore, the development of Kuwait's gas industry continues to reach around 2 billion scft per day of rich gas production today. According to our recent forecast, our future outlook for the rich gas development will be exposed to a great expansion in the near future, when North Kuwait Jurassic fields become fully operational by the year 2023/2024, adding to the total rich gas production of Kuwait. In that regard, and to increase the natural gas production capacity, KPC has invested in few projects, such as building three Jurassic Production Facilities (JPFs) at a capacity of 120 million scft per day each, to produce free gas from North Kuwait. Those were commissioned last year. In addition, four additional JPFs are planned to be constructed and commissioned between 2022 and 2024. In addition, KPC is pursuing viable investment opportunities outside of Kuwait where economically feasible to increase KPC's portfolio of gas production and validate their applicability to be imported to Kuwait.</p><h4>In what ways will KPC maximize its financial efficiency and reduce its cost within its new strategic plan?</h4><p>The challenges ahead are substantial, and the oil recovery will be costlier than what it is today. To maximize its financial efficiency and reduce its cost within its new strategic plan, KPC is pursuing different initiatives. We are expanding and integrating through the value chain in order to enhance long-term revenues, consequently boosting operational excellence. We also aim to increase energy efficiency in operations and utilize technology especially in areas of significant savings such as advanced drilling and well maintenance. Finally, it will be paramount to have an effective allocation and management of capital as well as divesting non-profitable businesses (e.g. fertilizer plants).</p><h4>How will KPC finance its capital program under its 2018/2023 plan?</h4><p>For financing the capital programs during 2019/2023 period, KPC is considering pursuing an optimal external financing option for some of the major projects to liberate cash flow and improve project economics.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our target is to continue our focus on implementing our short-term plan covering the full supply chain from production of oil and gas, refining and petrochemicals, securing supply of fuel to meet domestic fuel demand, securing supply for our international customers, and increasing our market share in potential international markets. In addition, we are closely monitoring the execution of the ongoing projects to ensure their timely completion and commissioning of the approved capital projects to achieve our targets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent is blockchain technology being implemented in Kuwait, and how can it be utilized?</h4><p>Kuwait is still learning more about blockchain, though we have witnessed significant interest from many government institutions and private companies, as well as individuals. Agility, NBK, and Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science (KFAS) are among the businesses and organizations that have taken initiative with blockchain so far, and recently, the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) announced it is working on a digital currency that will be released in Kuwait in the next few years. This is great relative to our region, as we seem to be moving ahead of many of our neighbors. Nonetheless, the infrastructure layers are still being built, and we are not yet ready for the applications. </p><h4>In what ways can blockchain spur the growing entrepreneurial sector and turn Kuwait into a regional hub for transformative technologies?</h4><p>There are many ways blockchain can help entrepreneurs. However, since this technology is still being developed, it is difficult for entrepreneurs to utilize blockchain today for their regular activities. East Chain Co. invested in Republic, a crowdfunding platform for accredited as well as non-accredited investors in the US and around the world. Through a platform like Republic, one can invest in equities or tokens of start-ups. Kuwait has a strong entrepreneurial scene, and it needs support in funding, business development, and operations. Blockchain offers the solutions to this and revolutionizes the way we do business. Furthermore, it will transform Kuwait into a hub for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs will have a new world of opportunities and a fresh, new canvas to paint their dreams on. Blockchain is expected to generate significantly more value than the USD10 trillion already generated by the internet in the last two decades. The internet was able to create this value through online communications; we cannot imagine how much value blockchain will unlock through adding digital assets to those online communications. The internet had to be built from the ground up; however, blockchain is built on the internet, allowing a quicker spread implementation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AngelList is considered the backbone of the Silicon Valley. What needs to be done for the company to increase its participation in the Kuwaiti and MENA market?</h4><p>It is a matter of time. We have only achieved a fraction of what we are capable of in the US and have also launched in India and Canada. We are focused on growing our existing markets. Kuwait and MENA are certainly of interest, although the region is a number of years behind the US and India in terms of start-up activity.</p><h4>How can AngelList leverage its expertise to help Kuwaiti start-ups dominate the local market and eventually expand regionally?</h4><p>AngelList facilitates investments into over 1,000 start-ups each year, so we have strong visibility into the different business models that are working around the world. We can use this knowledge to help Kuwaiti start-ups get a head start on others in the market. We can also connect them with world-class operators in the US to help them out-execute the competition.</p><h4>What specific factors make Kuwait and the MENA region attractive destinations for US tech investors?</h4><p>Kuwait is especially attractive because of the depth of well-educated, local talent and its sterling international reputation. Initiatives like the Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA) also make it an attractive place to do business.</p><h4>What are your expectations regarding the evolution and growth of the tech market in Kuwait and the MENA region in 2019?</h4><p>I expect steady growth in new start-up activity. I predict that large exits—if any—will be the result of M&amp;A from foreign technology companies. Furthermore, it is a positive sign that growth funds like General Atlantic are investing in the region. I expect to see that happen more often, though only after the companies have achieved significant scale. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With KAMCO recently acquiring the majority stake of Global Investment House, what are the company's new ambitions?</h4><p>KAMCO performed well in 2018, and its results are a testament to its progressive growth and enhanced operational performance. KAMCO continuously strives to enhance its contribution to a sustainable future in the local capital market by taking the role as lead managers in several debt issuances that have stimulated local and economic growth. We acquired a 69.5% majority stake in Global Investment House, one of the leading investment firms in Kuwait and the region. As we grow into a larger entity, we will be able to offer a wider selection of diverse investment solutions and introduce new offerings that can add great value toward local and regional investors. Our acquisition is in line with the Amiri 2035 Vision. By pursuing its vision of becoming the preferred asset management and investment banking player in Kuwait and the region, KAMCO can cater to a wider network through diverse investment solutions in various asset classes. This will assist the country's vision of becoming a key regional financial hub. KAMCO has also been awarded an exclusive role in providing its extensive advisory services to assist in the Boursa Kuwait privatization initiative. KAMCO is seeking further roles and opportunities to collaborate with entities within the public sector, as well as future privatization initiatives. On a regional level, prior to purchasing the majority stake in Global, KAMCO assessed the benefits of gaining access to Global's international presence in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey. Through Global's established presence, both firms can further expand their exposure and offerings throughout the MENA region. KAMCO has now taken the first step toward its vision of becoming the preferred investment firm in the region.</p><h4>In what ways can the ratio equity market capitalization, GDP, and the debt market ratio be improved?</h4><p>Kuwait's market cap-to-GDP ratio at over 70% is broadly in line with major GCC peers. Though the market cap-to-GDP ratio for Kuwait is below some of the developed markets where the ratio is well above 100%, the ratio does not fully represent Kuwait's entire corporate market. This is mainly because the ratio excludes predominantly family-owned private businesses and conglomerate groups. Family-owned businesses in Kuwait are typically well run, funded by internal equity, and have high rates of return, which generally disincentivizes such entities from taking the IPO or listing route. Public stock markets' performance is key to pushing the market cap-to-GDP ratio up as well. The performance of stock markets after the global financial crisis did make GCC investors more risk averse and led to lower trading activity on regional indices, and Kuwait was no exception; however, we expect the trading activity in Kuwait's stock market and market performance to pick up from higher passive and active flows from regional mandates, as Kuwait witnessed upgrades in market status and features in global index compilers. The upgrades should drive the initial rally in large cap names included in these upgrades, as witnessed from the performance of the Premier Market Index YTD in 2018.</p><h4>What will the roadmap and outlook for KAMCO's key business segments and asset classes look like?</h4><p>We see potential for growth within each segment. Given the ongoing volatility in the global financial markets and the associated concentration risk for each asset class, investors should aim for a diversified portfolio of investments. We offer our clients access to all assets classes globally while assessing them with our best-in-class technology. In terms of asset classes, equity markets in the GCC are expected to see higher institutional interest going forward, and this is further solidified by the recent inclusion of certain GCC countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait as emerging markets into global index compilers such as MSCI and FTSE. As a result, we expect more passive fund flows, higher foreign ownership of stocks, and increased trading activity on the region's exchanges. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major aspects enabled Kuwait's AA/A-1+ S&amp;P rating as well as its reclassification to Emerging Market status by MSCI?</h4><p>CMA conducted a GAP analysis and found the market needed major reforms in the Post-Trade side. Thus, CMA started—along with Kuwait Clearing Company and Boursa Kuwait—the Market Development Project to be implemented in four phases. We launched the first phase in May 2017, and it included key changes such as T+3 settlement cycle with DvP mechanism, international-style corporate actions timetable, custodian rejection, enhanced default procedures, reduced tick size, and a new closing auction mechanism. In April 2018, we launched the second phase and made further changes that involved new market segments (premier, main, and auction), buy in board, off-market trades processing streamlined through automation, new indices, circuit breakers, and the enhancement of in custodian rejection facility. We also separately launched an OTC platform in November. Kuwait's progress in trade clearing and settlement, including unifying settlement cycle to a T+3 and instituting a delivery versus payment (DvP) model 1, was key for the reclassification. FTSE announced Kuwait's upgrade in September 2017, followed by S&amp;P Dow Jones' announcement to add Kuwait to the Global Benchmark Indices in November 2018 with an emerging market classification. In June 2018, MSCI announced the MSCI Kuwait Index would be included in the 2019 Annual Market Classification review for a potential reclassification from Frontier Markets to Emerging Markets status. The positive decisions from international index providers came as a result of the structural reforms in securities regulations—most importantly issuance of law No. 7/2010 and its bylaws—in addition to market reforms.</p><h4>In light of the privatization of Kuwait's stock exchange, what key role is CMA playing?</h4><p>The privatization of Boursa Kuwait will be in three phases. Firstly, between 6% and 24% will be allocated for public entities; then between 26% and 44% will be allocated to companies listed in the exchange in conjunction with an International Securities Exchange Operator, or an International Operator acting solely; and finally 50% shall be publicly offered to Kuwaiti citizens. Eventually, CMA decided to offer 44% of Boursa Kuwait shares to potential investors and 6% to the Public Institute of Social Securities. The tender was awarded to a consortium comprising of Athens Stock Exchange, National Investments Company, First Investment Company, and Arzan Financial Group. CMA intends to begin the final phase of the privatization, an initial public offering of 50% equity stake in Boursa Kuwait to Kuwaiti citizens during the upcoming year. Once the privatization of the Kuwait Stock Exchange is finalized, CMA will continue in its role as a capital markets regulator on Boursa Kuwait Securities Company. Privatizing the stock exchange will ultimately strengthen Kuwait's position as a regional financial hub and provide the private sector with an even stronger role and opportunity to develop the national economy, in line with Kuwait Vision 2035. CMA has initiated a market development program in line with international best practices that resulted in the upgrade of Boursa Kuwait by both FTSE Russel and S&amp;P Dow Johns indices.</p><h4>With the recent decision to incubate fintech companies, what outcome do you expect? </h4><p>CMA has started its own project toward embracing fintech innovations in Kuwait with the goal of incorporating technology in the financial sector, achieving greater financial inclusion, and establishing a local fintech ecosystem with the proper regulatory support and infrastructure, thereby strengthening Kuwait's international position in regard to fintech. Supporting and encouraging fintech innovations and automation of financial services will help add economic benefits by reducing the cost of operations and transactions, boosting financial inclusion, and delivering more improved and convenient financial services to a wider segment of the market. CMA's fintech project aims to establish an accommodating framework that will focus on a collaborative approach with innovators in the field of fintech to ensure new developments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What products and services is HSBC introducing to the market to align its strategy with Kuwait Vision 2035?</h4><p>In 2019, our key focus will be on trade financing and cash management. We have a selection of products that will enable customers to manage their businesses seamlessly, cost effectively, and paperless. The aim is to drive digitization through a range of products and services that are available on HSBCnet—our award-winning liquidity and cash management platform—and a number of paperless trade and receivable finance products. In May 2019, we will reintroduce our receivables finance product in Kuwait to support businesses in effectively managing cash flows. Our digital banking platform combined with our global network and footprint make it easy for companies to expand their operations into new jurisdictions, especially in Kuwait, where opportunities for investment that are aligned with the New Kuwait 2035 development plan are ample.</p><h4>How does HSBC's export finance facility help foreign investors expand their activities in Kuwait?</h4><p>The bank's unmatched international footprint supports corporates based out of different geographies worldwide to set up in Kuwait, offering them not only full available banking services but also financing using HSBC's cross-border credit policy that allows subsidiaries to benefit from their HSBC relationship with the parent company. An example of this would be Chinese investors planning to be part of the Silk City project, a joint project between Kuwait and China and aligned to both Kuwait 2035 vision as well as the well-known BRI initiative. We are active in export credit support from countries overseas. In fact, the largest-ever export finance deal in the world was done in Kuwait two years ago for Kuwait National Petroleum Company's (KNPC) Clean Fuels Project. HSBC was the main arranger and coordinator. That was a USD10-billion deal of multi-sourced export finance from five countries, including the UK and other European and Asian countries. We are working with the large groups here on future versions and upgrades of that.</p><h4>What potential does blockchain represent for the Kuwaiti banking sector and the end customer?</h4><p>HSBC globally is taking a leading role in pioneering trade transactions through blockchain. In May 2018, HSBC together with another bank used a single blockchain application as the first of its kind in an export transaction of soybeans from Argentina to Malaysia for Cargill. There is great potential to help our clients save working capital, while improving speed and security in completion of transactions. Replicating such innovation will require collaboration between local and foreign counterparties, for which HSBC is ideally positioned. We have already started presenting the technology to our core clients and exploring the solutions that would concretely meet their current needs and challenges.</p><h4>What are HSBC's operational objectives in Kuwait for 2019?</h4><p>Our first priority would be to focus our efforts on the needs of our customers. We are concentrating on our strengths in trade and cash management with mid-market and large corporates, as well as engaging with the government in all its forms, including through the sovereign wealth funds and clearing companies. We have also been working closely with Boursa Kuwait, Kuwait Clearing Company, and the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) on the upgrading and modernization of the market and stock exchange. We have an interesting business for inward custody since HSBC handles the majority of the custodian activities for international institutional investors at the moment. With the recent admission of the stock exchange into the FTSE Russell Secondary Emerging Markets Index, there were two major influxes of funds in 2018 and a re-balancing in March 2019. Kuwait is also looking for MSCI to confirm the upgrade of the market to emerging market status in June 2019, which if confirmed would take effect in 2020. HSBC is establishing itself as the key banking partner for BRI in Kuwait. HSBC remains committed and optimistic about the future in a region undergoing a significant economic transformation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[revolutionizing-the-customer-experience]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What specific strategies were employed this year to contribute to another successful year?</h4><p>Customer expectations, technological capabilities, and regulatory requirements are ever-changing and continuously reshape the banking industry. To get ahead of these challenges, KIB's newly adopted strategy has not only propelled it to the forefront of the local banking industry, but has also transformed it for the future. With its forward-thinking strategy, KIB has continued to focus on three key pillars this year, namely: transforming retail offerings through technological innovation, expanding its corporate banking arm, and building upon its history in the real estate sector. These three pillars have already become central to the bank's banking operations, as it completed a number of pivotal changes within the organization, introduced several new banking offerings, and implemented many e-banking services, contributing to KIB's continued success and sustained growth.</p><h4>How important is digitalization and e-banking services for KIB in maintaining its premier position in the Islamic banking industry?</h4><p>The digital revolution has morphed from what some view as a threat to a mandatory survival strategy for financial institutions. The ever-increasing expectations of customers are the number-one catalyst for innovation. All industries are becoming more customer-focused, adapting constantly to what customers want. At the core of KIB's new strategic transformation lies its digital banking strategy. E-banking remains one of the most important milestones under the umbrella of this digital revolution. KIB embarked on a digital modernization strategy to redefine banking convenience for its clients, providing an easy-to-use interface that simplifies everyday banking. The bank has launched the region's first-of-its-kind multichannel contact center to revolutionize the KIB customer experience and improve service quality levels. Operating around the clock, the center includes an interactive voice response (IVR) portal and offers centralized monitoring, queuing, routing, and reporting solutions. KIB also launched an innovative visual IVR service in addition to its live chat service, which provides customers access to most of its services via a visual interface, rather than just a voice-activated self-service interface, thereby offering a better call experience.</p><h4>How has KIB been able to capitalize on fintech partnerships, which are currently leading to accelerated industry evolution?</h4><p>Collaboration between fintechs and banks is essential in order to advance processes and banking offerings. FinTech collaborations have already paved the way for more improved service offerings, technological innovation, and much more. By embracing technology, KIB has managed to offer more innovative solutions for its customers, thereby meeting the demands of more digitally savvy users. With the increasing speed of technological changes in the industry, KIB has more than kept up with the pace, recently introducing a range of innovative technologies across its business that have enabled the market leading bank to better connect with its customers through multiple channels, both online and mobile.</p><h4>How does KIB give back to the local community, and why is CSR so important for KIB?</h4><p>Social responsibility has always been on the top of KIB's priority list, underscoring its integral role as a partner in the community to which it belongs. The bank's new strategic direction also transformed its social responsibility program, making it a key component of its business strategy. Together with its leading position in the banking sector, KIB aims to positively impact the community to which it belongs. KIB actively seeks to cover a range of social concerns and issues. Accordingly, the bank has committed itself to investing in various social responsibility initiatives, which fall under four main pillars of its social responsibility program, namely: youth empowerment, social impact, community development, and promoting financial and banking literacy. As part of its commitment to investing in all kinds of social responsibility initiatives, KIB has also adopted a unique financial and banking literacy program. This first-of-its-kind program in Kuwait aims at enhancing financial and banking awareness amongst all segments of the community, particularly children and youth, as they are the nation's future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>CBK's net profit of KWD6 million for 1H2018 is higher by KWD4 million YoY. What actions have contributed to such a successful year?</h4><p>Whilst this year has been successful, there is always room for improvement. In 2018, we were affected by an ongoing legal case that has been running for around 10 years. We kept the provisions belt open throughout the year, which in turn affected our financial performance in terms of figures, in spite of the fact that the bank has made operating profits of more than KWD100 million. Still, we have to keep on the side provision which was less than KWD60 million. That affected the bank's figures at the bottom line despite the good results that we made from the operations—whether that be interest income or fees. In 2Q2018, we have been successful in writing off some ongoing loan disputes. This can also affect our financial performance, but the operating profit will remain at the same level.</p><h4>What other challenges often occur in the banking sector that you have to overcome?</h4><p>Banks depend on government projects because whenever there is a major project carried out by the government, most of the Kuwaiti banks participate. On top of that, there is always an Islamic tranche and a non-Islamic tranche. When the government is not spending on projects, we have an issue because there is no momentum of capital. In such cases, we are affected in terms of our profitability. Obviously, our income depends on the government because its spending makes the economy move. The first PPP was for the Umm Al-Hayman waste-water treatment plant  and was finalized and we are one of the banks participating in this important transaction. SME business is still undeveloped, and more effort should be made to educate young business people about running a business, financing requirements, and so on. We have witnessed family issues with respect to inheritance or the difference in thinking between various generations, and this makes the work increasingly complicated. The effects of family tensions are reflected in a business. This is a trend that is evident in the GCC.<br>How important is digitalization for the future of the banking sector?<br>The new generation forms the bulk of customers in the banking sector, but they do not visit branches to take care of their banking matters; they do everything online. Therefore, we have machines and kiosks in every branch. Moreover, we offer virtual banking, which means that you just make a phone call to the call center and everything can be dealt with over the phone. At the call center, people specialize in different services such as premier banking, account opening, and banking emergencies, for example. Full automation is the future of this industry.</p><h4>What are the challenges of being a powerful woman in a sector dominated by men?</h4><p>People assume that it is difficult for women to gain high-ranking positions in the Middle East. However, when I travel to Europe or the US, I do not find women in top-level positions. In fact, in Saudi Arabia for instance, women are claiming their positions on the frontline, and it was a pleasure to attend a seminar in Jeddah recently with so many inspiring women. As for Kuwait, I have been here for nearly 35 years, and I have seen few women in the banking sector. However, when the Amir opened the door for women to enter parliament, things started to change. For example, CBK has two women board members and nine high-ranking women executives. Similarly, there is a growing trend in the Middle East where women outnumber men in universities. A recent report stated that nearly 70% of the students graduating from university in the GCC are women. These results are not due to legislation, but rather evidence of positive steps toward a fairer, meritocratic society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the banking sector and CBK sustaining the Kuwaiti oil sector?</h4><p>Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) has announced it intends to have more private sector funding for its future projects. We have seen various PPP projects funded by the banks and look forward to joining hands with the oil sector to provide it with the necessary funding and solutions to increase production capacity. The fact that the oil sector is increasingly relying on local and international banks represents many opportunities for us. In fact, during the small crisis due to the drop in oil prices, Kuwaiti companies did not stop investing. They approached banks for funding. We put USD150 million into the Duqm refinery project, a 50/50 joint venture between Oman and KPC. The idea was to build a refinery outside The Strait of Hormuz on the Arabian Sea coast. The output of that refinery will feed a great deal of growth in East Africa for refined products because of the booming economies there. The more inter-linkages we have in the Gulf, the better.</p><h4>How can increased private-sector participation help the government reduce its expected budget deficit of USD25.3 billion? </h4><p>The private sector can provide those services currently provided by the government at a lower price and at the same or higher quality. Competition, profit motive, and the dynamism of the private sector give it an advantage in delivering quality services. We have seen examples of this all around the economy, for instance in the banking sector. This will take a great deal of weight off the government in terms of cost and resources to provide these services, shrinking the public deficit.</p><h4>What main challenges have you encountered thus far in the privatization process of the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE)? </h4><p>CBK was one of two qualified bidders for Boursa Kuwait. During the bidding process, we went through many contracts and studies and dealt with the different government regulators and groups. There is definitely a push to privatize. The Central Market Authority (CMA) was supportive of privatizing the KSE and provided assistance in terms of meetings and correspondence, as was the Central Bank of Kuwait. It was a positive experience to see how much those government entities wanted this privatization project to succeed. Even though the other consortium won the bid, everyone won. As a bank and as part of the private sector, we will also experience the benefits of having a more efficient, lean stock exchange. CBK wants to be a key part in sharing that economic expansion. We hope the privatization of KSE will encourage more private companies and public oil companies to list on Boursa Kuwait. We expect the capital markets to expand their funding for SMEs. It is another way to get capital rather than just coming to the banks or raising capital privately. I definitely believe in our friends in the other consortium being able to really motivate more companies to list.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>One key emphasis moving forward, especially in this volatile region, is stability, both economic and political. Economic activity requires people to trust the system. Regarding PPPs, it is important to know that one's rights and obligations are protected and that there is recourse to the law. Kuwait has this environment of trust, and this will continue, giving us the ability to project this stability onto our plans. Even on a commercial bank level, our planning for new services all depends on having no unforeseen events. New changes come after a long process rather than unexpectedly. Going forward, I trust in the three Ss: slow, stable, and steady growth. On that basis, one can really build something with momentum rather than seeing fast change that evaporates. Slow, stable, and steady describes growth in Kuwait, and it is a strength on which the country can depend. </p>]]></richbody0content>

We have broadly achieved that, though simplicity is an on-going journey. Therefore, when we came up with the new 2018-2020 strategy update, we decided to focus on four core aspects. The first aspect is about keeping our simplification drive in order to significantly reduce our turnaround time, mainly on the retail side, by re-engineering our processes and implementing a new core banking system (Finacle), which is one of the most well-known worldwide. It allows us to extract efficiencies and also lets us move many of our activities from face to face to online with as little disruption as possible. However, it has been challenging for us to establish a centralized point that would drive and would encourage cross functional partnership. We therefore decided to create an EPMO to streamline and remap all our processes. The second aspect of the strategy was to change our corporate culture and enhance collaboration and solidarity within the company. It is a complex and long-term undertaking that requires external assistance to guide through this lengthy process. In addition, we also need to better empower our people by devolving authority closer to the customer. This will also contribute in accelerating many processes on our branches. The third aspect of our plan is to further develop our digital banking channels. We call our digital strategy “A-square, B-square, C-square", and it covers AI and Robotic Process Automation (A-square), Blockchain and Big Data (B-square), and Cybersecurity and Cloud computing (C-square). We are progressing rapidly on all these fronts. The fourth aspect is looking at certain business initiatives that we need to promote further. For instance, we opened an offshore branch in DIFC that allows us to attend regional businesses in addition to positioning ABK as one of the top banking institutions for certain complex transactions such as structured finance, non-recourse project finance, or debt capital market syndications, which require a great deal of specialization.</p><h4>What evolution have you witnessed since the implementation of your online banking system, and to what extent did that reduce ABK's operative cost?</h4><p>Our app has been highly successful. Since the early 2010's, the total annual number of transactions flowing through the branch system is about half a million a year, increasing by 5-6% a year. On the other hand, until 2015, only 60,000 transactions were done online. A year ago, that number doubled to 120,000 transactions, and in 2018, it jumped to over 200,000 transactions. In 2015, only about 10% of our transactions were done online, while in 2018, that proportion had reached nearly 40%. In 2019, we expect to break through the 50% mark. The key to this success is the simplicity and the attractiveness of both our online system and mobile app. Moreover, ABK has a competitive advantage versus all the other banks in Kuwait due to the simple fact that we have the lowest branch presence of any conventional bank, and therefore the lowest fixed cost as well!</p><h4>What results have you seen since launching your wealth management business activity?</h4><p>Wealth Management and Private Banking have brought many benefits to ABK, although they are not necessarily all reflected in the bottom line. The benefit on the bottom line is perhaps KWD1 million (USD3.3 million), or just about 1% of our operating profit. In terms of volume though, it has translated into much more, because we have generated significant interest in the new investment products we offer, which has allowed us to retain many clients that would have perhaps gone elsewhere or abroad for their investment purposes. The banks in Kuwait are essentially geared for commercial and retail banking; they are not really geared toward high-end, private banking because they do not have attractive investment products to offer, although some of the larger banks have critical mass and can offer proprietary investment products. In terms of product offering, we are neither an open platform nor a proprietary platform; we fall somewhere in between, as we now outsource a dozen investment products from top class global and local providers, plus two existing products that we manufacture in-house: one is a Kuwaiti high-quality equity fund and the other is a high-quality regional equity fund. The beauty about that extra KWD1 million that we are earning from this business is that this profit is low-risk and low-volatility (unlike proprietary trading). Our core competency is not in managing assets or funds; it is in distributing products manufactured elsewhere to a large pool of people even if it is just for a small fee. This has really expanded our profile substantially, especially through our Al Ahli Capital Investment Company (ACIC) subsidiary, through which we now offer a relatively diversified and sophisticated product mix on the investment side, including local, regional and international products, in addition to certain Sharia-compliant products — and in all cases, we have outsourced the management of the assets or funds to the best-in-class provider. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was key to your success in 2018, and how did you significantly grow your loan book?</h4><p>We operate in different jurisdictions, including Kuwait, Turkey, Germany, Malaysia, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. Throughout those locations, the growth trajectory for each economy is different. In Kuwait, we focus specifically on infrastructure projects, primarily in the oil and gas sector in addition to financing trade-related business. We provide most of the corporates with the necessary financing requirements when they import goods. In addition, we focus on the large corporate sector that has not been banked by KFH in the past. We take market share from other banking participants, which helps the general growth of KFH on the corporate and SME sides. On the retail side, KFH enjoys likely the largest customer base in terms of numbers; we are the second-largest bank in Kuwait and the largest Islamic bank. Our strength lies in our retail portfolio and the diversity of our deposit base. This is primarily driven by KFH being the only Islamic bank upon its establishment in 1977 up to 2003.</p><h4>What factors differentiate KFH from its main competitors in Kuwait?</h4><p>We have been in the market for much longer than the rest and have extensive experience and know-how in Islamic banking, as we were one of the pioneers driving that movement forward. We are the only Islamic bank that offers as part of our sustainable development goals and financial inclusion pillar female-only branches to cater to the needs of an important part of the population.</p><h4>How is KFH adjusting its strategy to the new trend of digitalization?</h4><p>The digitalization strategy started about three years ago. Each of our eight KFH business lines had its own system managing the same customer base; the same customer would reside in multiple databases without any links. We changed our system into a relationship-based approach rather than a product-based one and segmented our customers based on their business activity. On another level, we implemented robotics to reduce the process time for time-consuming applications such as onboarding. With our new systems, we reduced processing time by a third. We also made significant improvements to our mobile banking app that cover almost 90% of the services a branch can provide. We launched a concept called KFH Go, our new vision for what future branches should look like on a self-service basis. Those branches' footprints are about one-fifth of the existing branches' footprints, which drastically diminishes rental costs and overheads. This is a full-fledged electronic branch that does roughly 90% of what one could do in a branch. Printing of checks and instantaneous issuance of cards are services that will soon be available as well. We will have 10 electronic branches that we will be installed in 2019 and 2020 so that we can have 24/7 banking available to all our customers in key locations.</p><h4>What sector will experience significant growth in 2019 and become of interest for KFH's investments?</h4><p>We are looking to finance the solar farm project built by KPC. There is also the solid waste plant that we are working on and hoping to close. Finally, there are plans for new cities in the north and south that will be developed through the PPP structure. We see those projects coming to completion rather than just being tendered; once complete, the infrastructure would be ready, the city will start flourishing, and activities will begin. In the oil sector, there are hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of projects over the next five years that involve LNG and the improvement of upstream and downstream processes through the fourth refinery, which is one of the key projects that will be introduced. However, less government bureaucracy will be key in order to cut down on delays. Another main factor will be the urgency of completing the national plan; as long as oil prices remain above USD60, there is less urgency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does KBA seek to improve labor conditions in the banking sector?</h4><p>As technology transforms the nature of work, incumbents should not lose sight of upskilling their talent. Training employees to work with and, more importantly, supervise advanced technology platforms could become critical in a world marked by an accelerated speed of computing and growing sophistication of cyber attacks. Thus, banks are keen and continuously strive to support and empower their employees by providing training and development programs designed in line with the highest academic and professional standards through international training centers or the Institute of Banking Studies in Kuwait (IBS). Based on KBA's objective to improve the professional, cultural, and social levels of the association members' employees, KBA organizes seminars and specialized technical workshops on current banking topics to provide training and development opportunities, aiming to enhance the banking profession. With the full support of local banks, IBS runs several successful training programs ranging from providing new graduates with the practical knowledge to work in the banking sector and maintain cyber and data security, to offering master's degree scholarships at leading international universities in all fields related to the banking industry. IBS ran 257 programs in 2017/2018, reaching 5,350 trainees.</p><h4>How is KBA collaborating with banks and local institutions in order to act against fraud?</h4><p>With the growing excitement around technology and innovation in banking, there is a growing risk as well. This puts pressure on Kuwaiti banks to put cyber and data security at the top of their agendas and make sure to not only invest in technology and digitization, but also to pay attention to the risks associated with this emerging trend. The banks are committed to all the necessary precautions required by the Central Bank of Kuwait; they also use the latest equipment to counter card fraud and update all software immediately and continuously while promoting awareness of cyber threats and the vulnerabilities associated with cyberspace usage. As well as following best practices in the field of cybersecurity and applying the best protection systems, KBA also pays great attention to empowering the knowledge and education of society, providing customers with information on the cyber risks they are exposed to and the required protection tools and techniques for cyberspace-connected financial information. Under this objective, KBA has a specialized committee composed of representatives from the local banks that discusses the latest and most important developments in this field. The committee is held in coordination with the Central Bank of Kuwait.</p><h4>What initiatives has KBA taken to enhance the service banks give to their clients and build trust in the system?</h4><p>Financial literacy has become a key life skill for individuals as well as micro and small businesses. We are convinced that new technologies can present huge opportunities, though we need to always be aware that, if unchecked, they can be equally destructive. For the benefit of customers, KBA cooperates with the Central Bank of Kuwait to implement a national strategy for customer awareness. The strategy includes several instruments to develop and implement a wide range of financial education activities to meet the needs of different ages and social segments through programs dedicated to several major sectors of society, for both men and women. The strategy focuses on many topics, including protection against cybercrime, banking services for special needs people, the settlement of loans and damages resulting from such practices, the rationalization of consumer and installment finance, and the mechanism for complaints and grievances. In addition, KBA has launched SMS and social media campaigns to protect customers against payment-related fraud, focusing on the drawbacks of cards double swiping on point-of-sale (POS) devices, as well as the Security Week campaign, launched in cooperation with VISA international and aimed at empowering consumers to protect themselves from fraud and build consumer trust in electronic payments. KBA also holds lectures for students at universities and schools regarding a variety of banking topics to improve and increase the level of consumer banking awareness. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dynamic-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main challenges is Kuwait facing and how can they be addressed?</h4><p>Around 90% of Kuwait's revenue comes from oil and gas, which poses a long-term risk for the country, but fortunately, the Kuwait Vision 2035 focuses on diversifying the economy. The second issue is that the government is the largest employer of Kuwaitis. This consumes over 60% of the yearly budget. In addition, every year there are 25,000 people joining the labor force. The oil sector only employs around 50,000 people as it is not a human intensive business. The solution is multi-faceted, and the first element is to change the role of government from being almost omnipotent to being a true regulator where other operations in education, energy, health, or infrastructure go to the private sector. This will enhance operational efficiency and allow many government jobs to be shifted to the private sector. Notably, the Higher Planning Council is conducting a study together with KFAS and UNDP on how to reform the government.</p><h4>To what extent will the activation of the private sector help Kuwait's economy? </h4><p>Kuwaitis have the ability to create businesses and flourish, and building the Kuwaiti culture of entrepreneurship and the private sector is a main target of the Vision 2035. This dynamic could be encouraged by reforming education, creating an ecosystem that encourages SMEs, and eliminating all the obstacles that prevent young Kuwaitis from creating businesses. Kuwait wants to create a diversified economy, and there are three main resources that can help to develop this: a youth with an entrepreneurial DNA, a beautiful piece of land up north with five beautiful untouched islands, and a strong foreign policy. We want to create an international economic zone that eliminates all the red tape. The plan is for this new territory to have its own law and be managed by one corporation that will lease the land for 99 years. It could become a logistic hub with a port, railroad, and airport, as well as a financial city with entertainment and environmental tourism. The plan also involves running the entire project on renewable energy.</p><h4>What main steps need to be taken to ensure the development of North Kuwait? </h4><p>The first step is for this law to be enacted, which is in the process of being finalized, and then it requires sanctioning by the parliament. However, we still have many challenges, including a strong regulatory environment that is detrimental to all businesses. We hope to attract investment through incentives such as tax exemption, long-term leases, and giving companies easy access to the region. Execution remains challenging though. The current system is not built on meritocracy; instead, people are parachuted into wrong positions. Therefore, solving issues related to meritocracy, efficiency, and governance will ensure the success or failure of the project. In order to realize the true potential of the project, the board of directors for the corporation will include international figures, and the CEO will be appointed based on track record and ability. </p><h4>What initiatives have been taken in the public and private domains to further empower Kuwaiti women?</h4><p>There are a few initiatives that are being taken, but women won't be truly empowered until they are placed in actual managerial positions. Kuwait has two women ministers and one female member of parliament, whereas Europe has 50% female representation at a government level. Until we get to that point, I do not think we can promote the cause of women. In Dubai, every company's board must have 30% women representation. We could use this quota system to push many women into decision making. This allows you to create the system and then disband it to make it free for all. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what specific areas is Ibtkar promoting and facilitating women inclusion in Kuwait and the region?</h4><p>Ibtkar has been working with both private sector and NGO organizations to promote women's empowerment in Kuwait, as well as leading the Empowering Kuwaiti Women in Politics program that included a year-long training for 15 Kuwaiti women from various backgrounds in political leadership. We have worked with large corporations like AlGhanim Industries in developing specific diversity and inclusion gender-forward trainings, and we have assisted Kuwait-based CSOs like the Women Mentor Forum in building their strategy and vision from the ground up so that they become a resource for promoting gender leadership and inclusion in the private sector.</p><h4>How is Ibtkar making sure to provide the best training and assessment to women in order to enhance their inclusion in the labor market?</h4><p>Our trainings are created to suit the needs of each industry, so they are culturally sensitive and include real-life success stories as well as practical guides to self-improvement. By mapping out the likely obstacles, cognitive biases and blind spots inherent in different situations, and setting out clear KPIs for monitoring and evaluating progress we prepare both women and their employers to navigate a clearer path to greater inclusion.</p><h4>What positive correlation can be established between an increased inclusion of women in the private and/or public sector and levels of productivity?</h4><p>Studies have shown the more inclusive teams make better decisions in less time and get significantly better results. The detrimental effects of “group think" where the decision makers all come from the same background have been well documented, a recent example would be the boardroom decisions in the lead up to the financial crisis of 2008. Increasing women's employment would increase GDP and would shift the balance towards more community-oriented projects. According to a WEF article women are 10% more productive than men in the office as they get assigned more work, and that should be recognized more than it is right now.</p><h4>In what ways is Ibtkar collaborating with eastern countries, international institutions, and local governments in order to promote women empowerment in Kuwait?</h4><p>We have done cultural sensitivity trainings for UK-based entities such as Great Ormond Street Hospital and the Royal College of Arts in collaboration with SOAS and have advised international NGOs such as Save the Children, as well as working with MEPI in the US through Partners Global on the EKWIP program. We see the latter as a direct translation of the 2035 Vision where women's empowerment and inclusion has been highlighted as a goal, and we have also collaborated with other institutional clients in the GCC to look into increasing inclusion and diversity in the public and private sector. We also work with a number of executive clients to develop their skill sets for aspirational leadership within their unique sectors and that is having a great impact on transforming mindsets and challenging the status quo.</p><h4>What does the Empower Kuwaiti Women in Politics (EKWIP) initiative entails?</h4><p>This was a year-long training that covered over 200 hours of intensive soft skills and campaign skills training for 15 Kuwaiti women whose ages ranged from mid 20s to mid 50s. Public speaking, fund raising, dealing with the media, networking, digital identity, and executive marketing where all part of the program that took place in Kuwait following a two-week study tour in the US. These ambitious women were exposed to decision makers in Kuwait and in the US including Ministers, MPs, leaders of industry, and board members of powerful NGOs. Three of these women have already announced their intention to run for office in 2020. Many of them are making a great impact on CSO activity in Kuwait following the EKWIP program, and one in particular has been courted by a current candidate running in order to help him with his campaign in the 2019 by-elections. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What areas should be targeted to make public entities more cost efficient? </h4><p>Kuwait has had a history of solid economic growth; however, its development aspirations are hampered by various competitive factors within an oil-based economy. To tackle these, Kuwait has embarked on a transformational journey under the umbrella of New Kuwait 2035 Vision, which provides an overall direction for the diversification of the country's economy. Palladium is well positioned to partner with the Kuwaiti government and support the achievement of necessary transformational outcomes and facilitate change across key target areas, such as government restructuring through the streamlining of some of its functions and by revisiting existing policies, mandates, and ecosystem dynamics for enhanced impact. The company can also share its expertise in the rationalization of services and use of new technologies that help streamline government operations and expenses. We can also help the government find ways to increase job creation via the private sector. While current unemployment is not alarming, there is a skills-to-employment gap. To absorb job seekers, the government has historically expanded the public sector. But to meet the New Kuwait 2035 Vision targets of economic diversification, a competitive workforce needs to be developed with the participation of the private sector. We can also monitor and manage performance. The overall execution of vision initiatives must be successful if Kuwaiti is to realise its development aspirations. Consequently, government agencies must have a clear strategic management framework that integrates the new processes. This will ensure agile decision making based on performance and results.</p><h4>How can Palladium help mitigate the aforementioned skills-to-employment challenges?</h4><p>According to WEF's Global Human Capital Report, the quality of primary schools, general skillset of graduates, and English-language proficiency in Kuwait rank among the lowest in the GCC. This creates challenges in finding and recruiting talent capable of driving business and the much-needed government transformation. Addressing the existing skills-to-employment gap thus requires a phased redevelopment approach whereby the private sector participates across the education value chain and innovative learning tools are encouraged to drive development. The government continues to facilitate the necessary regulatory reforms in education aimed at responding to the rapidly shifting requirements associated with the diversification of Kuwait's economy. Palladium is well-equipped to catalyze such a redevelopment approach by driving a needs-based conceptualisation of the “student of the future of Kuwait," whose skills are fully aligned with the New Kuwait 2035 Vision. This can be achieved by implementing a series of initiatives to redefine the way in which education is carried out. For example, redefining the curriculum to be student-centric and experiential, in which collaboration and problem-solving skills are built through project-based learning methods; readdressing the role of teachers, first within the education system, by positioning them as facilitators and enablers of knowledge that students rely on to help them engage with information, and then within the society, by enhancing their status through stricter qualification requirements, and training; and enabling the use of data and technology in learning as a complement to human judgement and personal experience.</p><h4>How can you help build a dynamic tourist ecosystem in Kuwait? </h4><p>Compared to other countries in the Gulf, the contribution of Kuwait's tourism sector to the economy is the lowest as measured by GDP and employment. However, per capita, Kuwait has the biggest internal domestic demand and the largest expenditure on foreign travel and tourism across the GCC. In this context, realizing opportunities generated by the existing supply and demand gap requires a stronger and more efficient tourism ecosystem that is effectively integrated into the national agenda. Palladium can help by locating market-centric, organisational, and cultural elements and mobilizing significant investment in a series of ambitious projects to accelerate its development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes NASCO a unique and standout consulting and advisory firm in Kuwait? </h4><p>NASCO was established as a streamlined firm in 2014 to provide value proposition and consulting and advisory solutions and practices under the umbrella of NTEC Group. This way, NTEC could better identify requirements and needs within Kuwait's public and private sectors. NASCO is uniquely positioned to leverage its capabilities and network within the public sector to identify opportunities and build relationships with public and quasi-government institutions, helping them better understand and address their challenges and requirements. We, at NASCO, have the capacity to efficiently and effectively implement and execute a consulting and/or advisory solution for a public sector/quasi-government institution that is facing serious difficulties in terms of engaging and working with consultants and advisors to achieve a good ROI particularly in terms of execution and implementation of a given solution. We realized that there has always been a gap between what is required by the client, and efficiently and effectively assisting them while executing a service or solution. Most of NASCO's Staff come from the private sector; we, therefore, brought with us a sharp value driven private sector mindset and enthusiasm. In addition, having deep and detailed knowledge of the environment we work in gives us a distinct advantage over our competitors. We also engage through G2G mechanisms and our strong network to create a competitive and impactful edge in the market. We collaborate with a host of third-party service providers and associates on delivering engagements, which enables for the conducive introduction of specialist consulting, advisory, and implementation firms and capabilities to Kuwait.</p><h4>What services and systems are you implementing to increase process efficiency and effectiveness in public institutions? </h4><p>We are uniquely positioned, as a “State-owned Enterprise" under the purview of NTEC and the KIA, to understand the public sector and especially its main points and challenges. Our approach is also unique in that we offer an end-to-end value proposition and solution. We tend to hand hold the client from the initial stages of undertaking a current state assessment; where we understand their needs, through to the implementation and execution phase, which could entail that of a strategy, implementation business plan, or a range of other specific solutions. </p><h4>In light of Vision 2035; what opportunities exist for NASCO? </h4><p>There are many opportunities, and we are part and a contributor to this initiative. We have an ongoing engagement and mandate with Kuwait's Supreme Council For Planning &amp; Development. We have developed the Supreme Council's design architecture for an advanced and full-fledged Performance Management System and Dashboard. We delivered the architecture for The Supreme Council's new performance management system to be rolled out in the next phase as we move into implementation. </p><h4>What are your expectations and goals for 2019?</h4><p>Being part of the public sector, we are mindful of prevailing challenges. We are optimistic in terms of key initiatives and programs like Vision 2035. Having said that however, we are also faced with a host of challenges. We are, therefore, cautiously optimistic, yet fully committed going forward; being part and parcel of the all-important public sector. We will continue to assist and work closely with the public sector, thus being able to make a real and marked contribution to Kuwait's economic reform programs and the 2035 Vision. We intend to continue to be among those players and contributors that benefit Kuwait and its people impactfully and sustainably. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies have been recently implemented by KIPCO to attain sustainable growth? </h4><p>Our long-term strategy of acquiring, building, scaling, and selling companies in the MENA region has worked successfully for close to 30 years. Through this strategy, we have created a portfolio of diverse operational companies with a primary focus on financial services, media, real estate, manufacturing, and education. This diversity, together with our experienced management team, prudent risk management, and internal streamlining of operations, has been crucial to our performance and strength during both favorable and difficult economic circumstances.</p><h4>Which sectors of KIPCO's operations have been most affected by market changes in 2019?</h4><p>The group has significantly expanded its operations in the last 20 years. We have a geographically diverse banking group under Burgan Bank, a pioneering insurance network under Gulf Insurance Group, a unique presence in the media sector through OSN, distinguished petrochemical and manufacturing operations through Qurain Petrochemical Industries, and a food production operation under SAFADCO in Saudi Arabia. Our education network is growing and now covers kindergarten through university. Having said that, our core businesses have had to face some challenging external circumstances in the last few years, such as the implementation of new banking regulations, the introduction of new technology and piracy in the media business, currency volatility, regional tensions, and a weakened operating environment. Thanks to prudent internal controls, good governance, and sound operations, we have been able to withstand these headwinds. It is worth noting that almost all of our companies have continued to profit and are in growth mode. In the media sector in particular, OSN has been facing fierce competition, which we continue to counter with new client-centric strategies that bring unrivalled quality content at prices that suit everyone. </p><h4>What can be done to increase the level of engagement and involvement of the private sector within Vision 2035?</h4><p>The private sector has much to offer in the realization of Vision 2035, and the government will not be able to work alone. KIPCO Group has much to offer, and we hope that there is a role for us to play, given the diverse industries we operate in such as health, insurance, banking, petrochemicals, and real estate development. The private sector has the ability to build and operate projects with high efficiency and is innovative in its approach. We believe the government must look to private companies as partners in these projects, and how much we are involved will depend on the government's policies and strategies.</p><h4>What is KIPCO doing to ensure that women have more opportunities in the workplace across society?</h4><p>We look to the commitment of KIPCO, represented by two of its largest core companies—Burgan Bank and Gulf Insurance Group—to implement the WEPs as part of our contribution to the realization of Kuwait's Vision 2035. At KIPCO, we believe it is important to understand the key challenges that women face in the workforce and what can be done to motivate and drive more of them to join the private sector, as well as to create an internal culture where women can thrive in their work and also rise up the ranks. The participation of women in our companies, at all levels, makes sound business sense and serves to broaden the pool of talent we employ. At KIPCO, we believe equal opportunities for women and men in the workplace are important to ensuring the sustainability of our operations, apart from also being the right thing to do. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[growth-plans]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the key to Bukhamseen Group's strong competitiveness across all the sectors?</h4><p>We have always been a top player in the real estate sector, but we have learned a great deal from our involvement in other sectors. Every sector drops from time to time, and crises become a trigger to reinvent management strategies along with financial planning. We started by massively investing in every sector and eventually decided to focus on markets that will experience growth in the future. We have also rearranged our management. Every brother is responsible for a certain sector and in charge for the company and sector he is managing. As managing directors of the company, we put forward the best effort in being the leader in the private sector. Our father empowered and entrusted us, and we now carry his faith and vision.</p><h4>What main obstacles and challenges need to be addressed in order to increase the level of FDI?</h4><p>The current by-laws are outdated as evident from feasibility studies on market demand and supply. For the past 20 years, BOT projects have been leased agreements. The new laws took many years to change and still need to be improved. The government needs to be closer to the private sector in order to properly address the by-laws. Current bylaws are not in favor of projects. The first obstacle is that projects are tendered in a non-feasible way. Tendering companies had to join forces and tell the government to change the tender. Moreover, in Kuwait, we also face the government audit bill. They have been viewed as an obstacle since they tend to over regulate. We want this auditing strategy to change in order to attract and benefit both private and government sectors in terms of achievements and developments.</p><h4>How could the stock market financing be improved in order to help the development of new business?</h4><p>Over the past few years, the laws have been improved due to the CMA regulations and the involvement of the financial authority. Specially, it was a positive step to start filtering out companies. We must delist the companies that are not at the expected level, which could mislead stock investors. Second, the regulation of the stock market and the financial authority has to improve to attract new companies and list them on the stock market. Unfortunately, the opposite is happening, and many do not consider being listed as an added value. Since the private sector recently took over the market, this has contributed to the development of new businesses that entice private investors to invest in the stock market.</p><h4>What are your predictions for the country's future?</h4><p>We have multibillion high-rise mega projects in the design stage. One of them is a mix-used project that combines retail, hospitality, and offices; this will be highly beneficial for Kuwait's private sectors. We are proud that Kuwait is one of the leading countries to sign a bilateral agreement with China. This is a unique example of distinguished bilateral relations based on strategic partnership and will develop the market of construction and building materials. Banks will benefit from the financing, and insurance companies will get their slice of the pie as well. The hospitality sector will also experience a significant growth. There are plans to develop the islands and build hotels and recreational entertainment to boost internal and international tourism. In order to achieve this, it is primordial to establish a stable framework, have high-quality airports, hotels, and attractive entertainment and tourism places. Kuwait has improved substantially in the last five years, building new opera theaters, museums, and a scientific center. There are also some plans for the tourism enterprises to develop the entertainment city. All these developments will help usher a new era in Kuwait, and the Bukhamseen Group will play a vital role in turning future plans into reality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key factors of Al Tamimi's successful expansion in the region? </h4><p>One of the most important factors for a successful expansion in the GCC was the willingness of the firm and its lawyers to learn, understand, and adapt its practice to the local laws, regulations, and legal practices of each jurisdiction. Additionally, Al Tamimi's lawyers dedicate their time to understanding the practices, procedures, and legal interpretations employed by government authorities and ministries. The firm also offers, either directly or through the hiring of local partners, local litigation services to ensure its clients have access to a full-service law firm and understand how contracts and laws will be interpreted and applied in each jurisdiction. As a regional firm, Al Tamimi has dedicated itself to understanding and advising on local laws in each jurisdiction to ensure that clients are fully protected and receive top-quality advice. This ability to offer advice throughout the GCC and provide a comparative analysis to clients operating in multiple jurisdictions has certainly contributed to our successful expansion. Another important factor for successful expansion has been our commitment to hiring sector-specialist lawyers who are best placed to provide the most effective legal advice and services. For example, throughout the region, in addition to core practices such as corporate, commercial, and banking, Al Tamimi has lawyers specialized in areas that include shipping, insurance, intellectual property, telecommunications, media, hospitality, healthcare, real estate, and tax, just to name a few. Al Tamimi prides itself on providing local law services at international firm standards. It is a distinct and unique concept in the GCC, and Al Tamimi is truly the only firm to have successfully implemented this model. </p><h4>How does Al Tamimi differentiate itself from other international law firms in Kuwait? </h4><p>Al Tamimi has taken the same approach to Kuwait as it has throughout the region. It has embedded itself within the local legal environment and culture to ensure its clients receive a full-service legal offering at international standards. Whilst many international law firms focus on the application of foreign laws, Al Tamimi centers its focus on the application of local Kuwait law (or other local laws depending on the jurisdiction). This distinguishing factor, combined with its dedication to international standards, allows Al Tamimi to forge strong and long-lasting relationships with law firms from around the globe to provide local, regional, and international legal services to clients in tandem with these international law firms when the matter requires. Furthermore, in Kuwait Al Tamimi operates through its joint venture partner, Yaqoub Yousef Al Munayae, and hires Kuwaiti, regional, and internationally qualified lawyers that work together with the common goal of providing the best legal service possible. The firm also offers local litigation services through its Kuwaiti partner and has brought in lawyers who specialize in varying areas of practice as opposed to using the same lawyers as generalists for all matters. This way, Al Tamimi can provide the client with the most experienced and appropriate lawyers for the matter at hand. It also offers full English, Arabic, and bilingual services to ensure that all the needs of its clients are professionally met. </p><h4>How does Al Tamimi support foreign companies that seek to invest in Kuwait? </h4><p>With offices throughout the GCC and Middle East, Al Tamimi is able to support foreign companies that conduct business in one country or throughout the region. This allows Al Tamimi to support foreign companies that have chosen to invest in Kuwait while also offering clients the platform to support investment throughout the Middle East via one seamless and fully integrated law firm.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been key for Carriage's success and intensive growth in such a short period of time?</h4><p>My partners and I launched Carriage because we found a major need in the market for the services we offered. Targeted clients needed a tech solution that could run in the background and drive the logistics support efforts we were focused on. The best way to address this was to create our own customized system to address the suburban landscape in Kuwait, which makes delivery more challenging. The country is geographically dispersed, and we had to tackle this problem and make it feasible from a business perspective. We needed to make sure we could reach the maximum number of people in the shortest amount of time. We therefore developed algorithms and all our systems internally, thanks to our CTO, to provide customers with the fastest on-demand delivery platform. We started with the food sector, knowing that we would have the option to transfer into other verticals. We developed algorithms that take into consideration preparation, travel, and transit time to customers, even the amount of time it takes the consumer to pick up their order from the delivery personnel, before providing an ETA. We offered transparency and live tracking for the consumer, services that were appreciated by the end user. As such, we had a huge influx of consumers right off the bat, and a large number of restaurants started to deliver through us.</p><h4>What factors allowed Carriage to properly and quickly implement it services in other parts of the region?</h4><p>The entrepreneurial drive we have as founders is essential. We tend not to worry about bureaucracy and always think outside the box in terms of the solutions we implement. We are extremely agile. The way we operate in Kuwait is not the same as we operate in other regions. In Kuwait, for example, we have our own drivers, while in Saudi Arabia we hire freelancers. We are always working to understand the dynamics of the environment we are operating in. By understanding how each market operates, we are able to enter it in the most effective way. We are now attracting international players because we have the know-how and specialized knowledge to navigate the region. We were targeted by many international entities and sat down with a number of them. We were also growth driven and numbers oriented, meaning we were burning through cash in terms of marketing and customer growth. We wanted to ensure we could corner the market and develop the best possible service. One of the most important metrics of our success is the growing number of on-demand delivery platforms appearing in the market, which has also created healthy competition.</p><h4>What have been your biggest challenges in the past year, and how have you managed them?</h4><p>There have been two major problems: scale and talent acquisition. Talent acquisition was an issue across the board, especially in the tech department and other areas of our operations. Along the way, you need to make sure your team understands the company's strategy and goals. We had to make sure we were spoonfeeding strategy to our people to ensure they were onboard every step of the way. We usually like to hire from within. In Saudi Arabia, we used to have a Saudi GM, who is now is a deputy CEO. We have a Bahraini in charge in Bahrain; in fact, 99% of our employees in Bahrain are locals. Whenever we expand, we work on developing a workforce that is composed of that nationality. No one understands the market better than locals, which is the approach we try to take. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key factors are making Faith Capital such a successful and unique company? </h4><p>Faith Capital was established in early 2017 to focus on investing in the technology space, predominantly by supporting Arab individuals who work in the technology sector. It has invested in six companies to date, and there will also be further investments in 2019, God willing. Furthermore, we are creating a new marketing team that will establish a solid and highly strategic plan to drive our business growth in 2019 and subsequent years. What makes us different from other VCs is our active participation in the companies we invest in. At the end of the day, we are entrepreneurs investing in and supporting other entrepreneurs by constantly advising and nurturing them. This includes HR, operational, and technical assistance, or simply by brainstorming ideas. In addition, we seek sharia-compliant businesses, as we want to put an emphasis on advancing business in an ethical way. We believe that religion can lead to successful and fulfilling businesses—a powerful lesson I learned from my grandfather's success. It was this that encouraged me in 2008 to initiate my own entrepreneurial journey. A decade later, our activities are flourishing, and my everyday challenge is to keep applying these principles in order to ensure continued success in business. On top of it all, we are blessed to be surrounded by believers, achievers, and people who share the belief that a business has to be equally beneficial for every party involved by applying logical Islamic values. </p><h4>What key changes in the market has Faith Capital had to consider when making investments?</h4><p>In this part of the world, we are behind the Europeans and Americans when it comes to investing in the tech space. However, over the last three years, this sector has attracted a lot of money from within the GCC. An increasing number of investors from the region are investing in technology because they truly believe in its potential. The trend is moving forward in the right direction. As a result, Faith Capital is not working alone, as other players enter this space and start to gather more confidence in the industry. Of course, this is not without its risks and requires patience. At present, investors in this part of the world are starting to understand how the game is played when it comes to tech companies, and the sector is, therefore, evolving at a fast pace. Governments are also taking positive steps to create initiatives to invest in both tech and non-tech start-ups and to improve entrepreneurship among Kuwaitis. Even though this is recognized as a long-term process, we have noticed a consistent and positive evolution that makes us very hopeful for the future. </p><h4>Have you seen any initiatives from the private or public sector to incentivize entrepreneurship in Kuwait? </h4><p>We have the Kuwait National Fund for SME Development where I was a board member for a year. The National Fund is continuously evolving and constantly improving. The government's aim with this fund is to encourage entrepreneurship and develop the broader SME ecosystem. Since the economy is shifting away from oil revenues, it is of paramount importance for Kuwait to expand and diversify the rest of the economy by investing in Kuwaitis and encouraging them to do business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key factors do you analyze before investing in the tech space?</h4><p>Many investors make the mistake of venturing into technological investments that are unoriginal and do not have a competitive advantage. It is important to follow an investment and understand it from genesis and germination all the way to IPO. One has to identify where the company is going and its revenue and success drivers. In my 22 years of working with technology, knowing the lead investor in all deals helped me become more successful. I always look at who is investing in the deal, who is actively involved, and who is behind the brand before I make a decision. Another big mistake is that investors sometimes do not know what they are investing in. We only do direct, primary, and preferred shares, which is why when we promote a particular transaction, other investors pay attention because they know it is probably an oversubscribed deal. I focused on venture capital, because people in the region did not have the proper background or access to high-quality transactions. Small funds invest in the local community or regionally, but nobody was really dedicated to investing in and promoting deals in Silicon Valley. I knew we could address this market need, so we started to advise US-based funds and companies on how to approach and navigate through the regional investor landscape, specially engaging with HNW family offices, institutional investors, and the regional sovereign wealth funds, since the decision makers regionally were not seeing or did not have access to those deals.</p><h4>What is Kuwait's potential in the tech sector, and how it is positioned at a regional scale?</h4><p>The deal flow is in San Francisco, and the cash flow is in Kuwait and the GCC. Thus far, the only real tech unicorn that came out of MENA is Careem, out of Dubai. In Kuwait, there are great apps like Talabat, which was acquired by a European company for USD170 million, Carriage, 4Sale, and so on; however, these are small sums compared to deals in the US. It is a whole different league, and Kuwait has a long way to go. That is not to belittle players in Kuwait's tech sector because they are leading the path for the next generation. Kuwaitis in general are entrepreneurial in spirit, and the new generation of Kuwaitis is highly creative. The smart ones will find ways to adopt the latest technologies, localize it, and scale it. Equally important, Kuwait is slowly changing the laws and market dynamics that allow for innovation to grow. Kuwaitis are entrepreneurs who can create, compete, come up with good ideas, and fund them locally. That is the barometer we need to utilize when comparing regional countries.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Kuwait is one of the greatest tech investors in the world, and the government, through its different sovereign investment funds, has been early investors in Google, Apple, Uber, AirBnB, and Thumbtack, to name a few. One of the reasons for this is the country's sound investment policy. 2019/20 will be a major infliction point for the stock market in general and the tech market specifically, because a number of big companies “Decacorns" like Uber, Lyft, AirBnB, Slack, and Pinterest are getting ready to launch their IPOs. Uber's will be the biggest IPO in history, and it will change the dynamic of the US market, which will cause a tsunami and suck all the money before redeploying it across the market. As a result, there will be a huge M&amp;A wave where several small companies will be acquired and people will be cashing out. This will create another wave of liquidity searching for deals, which in return will fund the development of other sub-sectors in the market and leading to further advances, such as in digitalization, robotics AI. Based on all this, 2019 will be extremely significant. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to the creation of Just Clean, and what has it achieved so far?</h4><p>After my brother and I moved back to Kuwait from the UK, we realized that despite the abundance of laundry and dry cleaners, these kinds of places were operating at full capacity. As a result, we decided to do research to find out whether the majority of people were doing laundry at home or through professional services, and what further capacity there was in this space. At the same time, we noticed a trend with consumers using online services much more readily. We were doing all of this just when we saw the high-profile sale of Talabat.com, the online food delivery platform, which gave us a definite incentive to move ahead with the business. After meeting app developers, deciding what we needed, forming contracts with laundry service companies, and approaching the legal authorities, we finally realized how to penetrate this market ourselves. From our own resources, we formed an initial capital budget of KWD15,000 and took out a loan for the rest of what was needed. The entire process from developing the idea to launching it took approximately six months. It has now been two and half years since the Just Clean launch, and we are now active across the GCC, with operations in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Bahrain. We are planning to expand into Saudi Arabia as well in the coming months. Deciding to partner with our investors was a big risk that has definitely paid off.</p><h4>Since the acquisition of Just Clean by Faith Capital Holding, how has the business been affected?</h4><p>It was a difficult process knowing with whom to collaborate after being approached by so many different high-level investors. My brother and I took an interest in Faith Capital because it was not just making the financial investment but also putting an effort into the business itself. It has become a true partnership, and Faith Capital has fully engaged with us in the operations and continuously builds upon the business, which has led to an early expansion across the GCC. The partnership is really reassuring as we utilize its experience.</p><h4>What differentiates Just Clean with its competitors? How does marketing fit into those strategies?</h4><p>Just Clean is the first of its kind in the marketplace. There are apps in London and Germany offering a similar service, but they only draw upon a single laundry service. We offer the option to select from a wide range of providers. We also allow options and a section where customers can read and write reviews. We look after our customers so that if for any reason they are dissatisfied with a particular provider, they can select another and post feedback, which other users will be able to view. In terms of competition, there is no one else in the marketplace because we have taken a unique approach within this service. 2019 will be challenging as we will have to execute operations in Kuwait, the UAE, and Bahrain simultaneously; each market is home to cultural differences that must be separately addressed. There are also other variables to take into consideration, such as the number of expatriates present in each country. Our experienced marketing team has created an amazing strategy for 2019, but Just Clean is always ready if there are any changes. We evolve with the needs of our customers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-three-year-odyssey]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the National Fund creating an inclusive ecosystem for SMEs and diversifying Kuwait's economy?</h4><p>It takes time to build an ecosystem, which is why we are taking this process seriously and cautiously and paying close attention to every step we take. Initially, the National Fund was created to loan funds to entrepreneurs. We eventually decided to restructure the entire fund to have more flexibility. Today, our activities are more diversified, with several departments in charge of building the ecosystem, We have a sector headed by an assistant general manager with the objective of building ties with property owners in order to provide SMEs with better prices. We also have a division that takes care of education, incubation, and project acceleration. We also work closely with local and global training organizations that help entrepreneurs get the necessary knowledge to start and grow a company. We currently have five incubators owned and managed by the private sector that help us provide specialized training to entrepreneurs. The role of universities is also worth highlighting, since we are about to establish special curricula for entrepreneurs where we introduce scientific incubators. The Kuwaiti market is definitely growing in terms of SMEs; however, it is still challenging for organizations to identify real needs and provide adequate solutions. VCs are progressively showing up in light of highly successful SME ventures that encouraged a number of investors to partner with technical people. The market is growing, but needs our input in order for SMEs to be a significant actor in Kuwait's economy. We do not want to change the rules of the market, but need to incorporate SMEs within the rules.</p><h4>How eager are Kuwaitis to create their own business?</h4><p>It is challenging, as government jobs are extremely appealing for Kuwaitis. Public sector employment provides higher wages and shorter hours, while the SME market involves a higher degree of risk and uncertainty, making it challenging to attract good people. Nevertheless, Kuwaitis traditionally have a highly entrepreneurial mindset. However, many do not realize how complex and challenging this journey is. Through the law and our operations, we seek to ease that transition. We have a program for government employees who want to try their luck starting a business. If they apply with a viable idea, they can get a three-year paid leave to start their business with us or come back to their initial job if the adventure does not succeed. We encourage them to get out of their comfort zone. Our current portfolio has about 25% government employees, meaning this initiative is taking root—the number of applications has doubled in the past year alone. </p><h4>What steps need to be taken to help a company emerge from the seed stage? </h4><p>We are trying to provide guidance and different routes for businesses to flourish. The advice and services we provide depend on the type of business and knowledge people have about business creation. The first option is to directly apply through our website by completing a form that eventually provides the applicant with a business plan. The second solution we provide is through Kuwait University and Sabah Al-Ahmad Creative Center, which help students working on science projects patent their ideas. These ideas are then referred back to us, where we help them develop the commercialization of the patented idea by funding it. We also collaborate with incubation centers that help businesses grow until they can be released into the market by helping finance them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways can PPPs increase the attractiveness of Kuwait and spur higher levels of FDI?</h4><p>By tendering strategic and significant infrastructure and service-related projects, the state of Kuwait is encouraging strategic local and global investors to finance these kinds of projects on exclusive bilateral agreements, while also sharing the risks associated with such projects. All of this reflects the state's interest in supporting FDI, as well as its efforts to encourage the private sector to import the necessary technology and know-how, reduce operating costs, and improve service efficiency.</p><h4>In which sectors could PPPs have the most significant impact on Kuwait's economy? </h4><p>Infrastructure and service-delivery projects related to public services have the most significant potential, since they can establish joint stock companies with ownership of 50% for public shareholders. Projects of that magnitude increase imports, labor, and job creation, as well as opportunities for local and international financing and B2B opportunities. That said, every sector is important to Kuwait's economy, especially the ones that provide social services. </p><h4>How is Kuwait shaping up its PPP regulations to enhance this model?</h4><p>PPPs were first regulated in 2008 by Law No. 7. Before that, simpler forms of BOTs were regulated under Law 105 of 1980. However, due to the shortcomings of Law No. 7 of 2008, Kuwait enacted the current PPP Law No. 116 of 2014. This and its executive regulation enacted by decree No. 78 of 2015 set out the legal framework of PPPs in Kuwait. A special law regulating PPP projects for power plants and water desalination, Law No. 39 of 2010, also exists. KAPP is the governmental entity responsible for the tender of PPP projects pursuant to said regulations.</p><h4>What should be done to reduce the time between announcing a project and assigning to the winning bidder? </h4><p>KAPP strives to enhance the tender process and expedite procedures. Currently, a detailed study is being carried out to mitigate the obstacles that delay tendering projects or their procurement. Within this study, KAPP is proposing amendments in the PPP legal framework to ensure a smooth and fast tendering process.</p><h4>In light of the Az-Zour North IPO, how can Kuwaitis directly benefit from PPPs? </h4><p>On the investment side, Kuwaitis can add steady payments to their income portfolio in the form of dividends. At the same time, a company such as Shamal Az-Zour is under stringent employment requirements, in which the employment of Kuwaiti nationals should be no less than 70% of the total workforce. In addition, Kuwaiti salaries must represent 70% of total salaries.</p><h4>How can can PPPs help Kuwait lead the region in terms of FDI? </h4><p>Vision 2035 is not truly in direct competition with national development plans in neighboring countries. Its purpose has been to stimulate the local economy, improve living standards, and ensure a means of revenue aside from oil. Kuwait's PPP program is set to improve its current public services, attract foreign investment, and help make the local economy more progressive by creating new investment opportunities.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead? </h4><p>In 2019, the IPO for Shamal Az-Zour Al-Oula Company will be completed, aside from the planned signing of the PPP agreement for the Um Al Hayman WWTP project. These achievements will boost confidence in the ability of the state to stay true to its mandate regarding PPPs and give investors good indicators for upcoming tenders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In light of Zain's impressive 28% YoY growth in 2018, what strategy has the company implemented in order to ensure the continuation of these astonishing results?</h4><p>At Zain, we have worked hard on growing both our revenues and bottom lines. We have designed and implemented targeted commercial strategies in each of our markets, together with a strong focus on execution. We have refreshed our brand, both visually and in terms of positioning. Our new positioning is centered on helping our customers to unlock opportunities, i.e. putting the customer at the heart of everything we do. We have spent a great deal of time listening to our customers and ensuring our activities are localized to suit each market. Customers who are happy with their brands tend to stay with them longer and are willing to spend more with brands if they are delivering real value—that can be in terms of offering relevant offers or by providing new services that deliver on customer needs, i.e. helping them to get things done. The demand for data also continues to rise significantly, fueled by smartphones with bigger and higher-definition screens, higher-quality content, and a massive expansion in the number of apps. In terms of home connectivity, a similar trend is also occurring. We believe that by offering the best data network, the latest devices, and great customer support we are winning in this space. Elsewhere, we have developed our B2B offerings from being somewhat “one size fits all" in the past into end-to-end, segment-specific offerings, from SMEs through to large corporations. We have focused on targeted value propositions going beyond mobile into fixed and solutions; again, putting the customer first we aim to be their trusted business partner. We aim to play a bigger role in our customers' lives, transforming ourselves into a digital lifestyle operator—to that end, we have made numerous investments in this space. Some examples include Zain Life in Kuwait; Zain Cash in Iraq and Jordan; and our Group API platform that connects our customers to the best and latest digital content available worldwide. We have continued to invest in the customer experience—we launched the first AI chatbot in Kuwait, and later in Bahrain. Our “Voice of the Customer" program provides us with real-time customer feedback following on from their interactions with our products and channels, giving us insights into how we can improve and simplify.</p><h4>Kuwait has one of the highest mobile penetration rates in the MENA region. What new opportunities can Zain exploit in the country in order to increase its presence? </h4><p>We are going beyond mobile and into the digital lifestyle space—we will empower homes with the fastest connectivity via BEAM, our wireless “fiber" high-speed home data product, and later 5G, and via our Zain LIFE smart living platform. We will work tirelessly to be the preferred brand for the youth segment; indeed, this is one of the key drivers of our digital lifestyle focus. We will be a key player in the IoT space in Kuwait. We aim to partner with the government on its journey to Vision 2035. We were a main partner in the Kuwait smart meters projects and are involved in a number of initiatives. We believe we are well positioned with NXN, our smart cities company, and also with our other investments, such as Zain Drone, to play a key part in this vision.<br>What will be the key factors in order to succeed in and effectively implement a 5G network in the country? <br>Initially, 5G will focus on high-speed wireless broadband competing with fiber in terms of home connectivity. So, the key here will be having a regulatory framework that enables the right amount of investment and also of course the short-term availability of devices. In the second phase, we will see low-latency applications evolving; these have the potential to change everything from gaming, education, drones, and industry to fintech, healthcare, and farming. We will be entering an era of increased innovation and we will see many firsts due to 5G. We believe that ZINC, our innovation incubator in Jordan and Kuwait, will also help us to take the lead in some of these applications, e.g. virtual and augmented reality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current main focus of SCPD?</h4><p>SCPD continually focuses on investing in capital projects, CAPEX, and development projects. Current examples include the Jaber Causeway and Silk City. Our focus is the same regardless of the oil price. We use a custom-made system for the preparation and monitoring of progress of the national plan, which allows the manager of each project to update us with their individual status, which in turn adds responsibility and accountability to the role of the SCPD. We constantly strive to improve the efficiency of our project management and development, one example of which is the integration of our new Astrolabe system, which optimizes project selection, our decision support system, and data entry with macro-models. We are currently focusing on patenting this system, which is unique insomuch as it carries out follow-ups by incorporating the use of artificial intelligence into project selection and simulation.</p><h4>What is the SCPD's stance on collaborating with the private sector?</h4><p>We are actively pushing for the government to support more PPPs and encouraging other entities in the government to secure projects that the private sector will perceive as attractive. Results are not achieved instantaneously; success in this regard is a lengthy process. The only way the Kuwaiti government can develop trust in the private sector is by producing economic results, boosting job creation, and giving the private sector significantly more freedom to conduct its own business operations. Trust between the private sector and government is also gradually improving. There are an increasing number of infrastructure projects undergoing development, and the results are becoming more evident. Infrastructural projects, power stations, and Shamal Resort are the only PPPs that have been successfully implemented thus far, which is undoubtedly insufficient. However, dealing with energy waste, city development, wastewater treatment, stages two, three, four, and five of the power stations, and the Agella beach tourist attraction are all examples of PPPs that we are currently in the process of implementing. These projects are all in line with our overall vision of diversification and shifting the economy away from oil. We aim to do this through innovation, human capital, and increasing the inclusion of women in industry across society.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your plan for women's empowerment?</h4><p>We have a full-fledged program to help increase the political and economic inclusion of women. In our most recent initiative, for example, we had 61 women fully engaged in a program designed specifically to help them enter the business community and political sphere. Part two was launched in October in collaboration with UN Women, Kuwaiti universities, and the Women Studies Center. </p><h4>What are SCPD's goals and objectives for 2019?</h4><p>In 2019, we will present our voluntary national report on the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN. It is a substantial project led by SCPD that will engage with all government entities, the private sector, NGOs, the World Bank, and the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce. We have our own PR strategy, which involves the complete rebranding of the Kuwaiti national plan, an initiative has been fully supported by every ministry. So far, the OECD, UN, World Bank, international think tanks, and universities have all acknowledged our National Vision for 2035, demonstrating the success of our PR efforts. Though our projects will take time, the end results speak for themselves, as our brand's credibility has gradually solidified on a global scale. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What specific actions have you implemented to increase levels of FDI into the country?</h4><p>KDIPA adopts a pro-active approach to attract value-added direct investments supported by an integrated promotional strategy serving Kuwait's developmental goals in line with its National Vision 2035. KDIPA launched the Kuwait Investment Forum (KIF) to convey a consistent message to the local and international business community on developments and reflect achievements as well as display lucrative opportunities. KIF was co-organized by KDIPA and the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) and is regarded as one of the biggest economic events in the country. This forum clearly reiterates the government's commitment to support investment led growth that will favorably impact the economy and expedite its ability to cope with accelerated technological advances. In conjunction, KDIPA also launched the Kuwait Investment Outreach Roadshow (KIO) in association with the Financial Times Group and in strategic partnership with Kuwaiti companies that kicked off in London in 2017 and continued in Silicon Valley in 2018, with the final leg of this roadshow scheduled to take place in Singapore in March 2019. This was further supported by numerous other collaborations and outreach programs with KCCI and other parties. The successful implementation of these key promotional initiatives resulted an extensive network of interested investors and yielded a total of around USD2.8 billion of investments in leading services sectors like ICT, renewable energy, healthcare, entertainment, and consulting, among others. On another note, KDIPA continues to develop its three economic zones in Abdali and Wafra to avail needed space for land and create sector-driven competitive clusters.</p><h4>In which industries is Kuwait attracting higher levels of FDI?</h4><p>Kuwait has attracted direct investments primarily in the services sector. The cumulative approved direct investments since KDIPA started its operations in early 2015 until March 2018 were focused in activities relating to ICT, oil and gas, construction, training, health, energy, recreational, and consulting services. With increased commitment by the Kuwaiti government to embrace digitalization and innovation, in a transparent environment adopting sound governance and integrity practices, as well as intellectual property rights protection, its ICT sector is witnessing unprecedented blossom. These investments came from 16 different countries, both developed and emerging. During KIF 2018 an exclusive session was held where Kuwaiti high-ranked officials and ministers presented a series of projects across diverse sectors of the economy—from infrastructure development and renewable energy to the digital transformation initiatives. Furthermore, path-breaking announcements were made to boost the status of Kuwait as a financial and capital market hub.</p><h4>How has KDIPA assisted in the improvement of the Kuwait's business environment?</h4><p>Kuwait's business climate has been on a steady progress course, reflecting the commitment of the government to improve business environment. There are also other relevant reform programs that are part of the national efforts to improve doing business in full collaboration with the concerned government authorities, the private sector, and civil society, and with technical support by the World Bank. The national agenda for streamlining business environment in Kuwait (Tahseen Program) was duly conducted under KDIPA as the head of the Permanent Committee for Streamlining Business Environment &amp; Enhancing Competitiveness in the State of Kuwait (PCK), established by a council of ministers' decision 1551/2013. To follow up implementation of the Tahseen Program, the Tahseen Portal was launched through the KDIPA website with a transparent dashboard aimed to document all the reforms by competent government authorities. KDIPA fosters its advocacy role further by providing direct channel and constant support through a series of open dialogues between the public and private sectors to depict potential obstacles and address them duly and collaboratively. Furthermore, KDIPA adopts a full facilitation paradigm based on investors-services to encourage business retention and expansion. The hope is that these efforts will attain the expected results to enhancing economic diversification for a sustainable future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Kuwait-UK relationship evolved in the past 120 years? </h4><p>We are indeed marking 120 years of friendship between both nations, but we are also marking the deep and broad cooperation that Britain and Kuwait have together today, and we are looking ahead as well to developing that in the future. We have a very effective bilateral framework in the form of the Joint Steering Group (JSG), a result of a state visit by HH the Amir to the UK in 2012. That JSG will be meeting in summer 2019 for the 14th time, bringing together officials from both sides across multiple areas such as trade and investment, defense, and security. The relationship has evolved in positive directions. We are able to work together in areas that require a lot of trust and confidence on both sides. Our bilateral relationship is flourishing and, from our experience, we can observe a 20% YoY increase in British exports to Kuwait. </p><h4>What initiatives are both nations implementing to strengthen their defense cooperation? </h4><p>Defense and security are high priority areas for us, and always have been. Kuwait is a key friend and ally for us in the region, and more broadly. We have longstanding and excellent bilateral cooperation in this area, and actually have a permanent British presence in Kuwait in the form of the British Military Mission and 36 officers embedded with the Kuwaiti Armed Forces. We also have regular joint exercising and training between the Kuwaiti and the British Armed Forces. We jointly decided in December 2018 to step up the pace and frequency of our joint exercises and training activities. We completed an exercise called Desert Warrior in January 2019, which we will repeat in January 2020. There will be another joint exercise in the meantime in autumn, supplemented by an increased pace in short-term training teams. Additionally, we were pleased to recently welcome a Type 45 Royal Navy Destroyer HMS Dragon, which is one of the more modern ships in the Royal Navy. This was possible because now, under the Gulf Strategy, and for the first time in 40 years, the UK has a permanent military presence in the region in the shape of the naval facility in Bahrain. Another aspect of our international security cooperation was the Saif Sareea 3 exercise in Oman at the end of 2018, which was the largest exercise in the region going on for 20 years. There has been a stronger emphasis under the Gulf Strategy since the Prime Minister's speech in Bahrain at the end of 2016, and we are now delivering on that. We see Kuwait and other countries of the Gulf as very important allies for the UK in defending our joint interests in the region. Furthermore, Kuwait is an important ally for us in the anti-Daesh coalition. </p><h4>In what ways can UK companies help Kuwait increase its production capacity and modernize its industry and infrastructure? </h4><p>There are two parts to that question. In terms of production capacity in the oil and gas sector, British companies are playing an important part in helping the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) increase production capacity, but also meet stringent, improved environmental standards. BP and Shell have both signed Enhanced Technical Services Agreements with KOC to improve their extraction of hydrocarbons, capacity building, improved reservoir management, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) using concentrated solar power, and carbon-capture storage and usage. Separately, BP is working with Kuwait Integrated Petroleum Industries Company (KIPIC) under another Enhanced Technical Service Agreement to offer innovative technical expertise for the Al Zour Refinery Project, using the latest UK technology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>2019 marks 120 years of cooperation and friendship between Kuwait and the UK. It is a relationship that promises only to strengthen in the 21st century as both countries enter new arenas of cooperation. </p><p>When the first Treaty of Friendship was signed between the Sheikhdom of Kuwait and the British Empire in 1899, it is unlikely that either side imagined 120 years later both countries would have such a close and mutually beneficial relationship. That today thousands of British and Kuwaiti students, oil and gas experts, diplomats, and travelers would call each other's countries' home would have seemed outlandish, perhaps. </p><p>The treaty was a smart move for both parties. Kuwaitis would assert their independence from the Ottoman Empire, and the British would defend Kuwaiti sovereignty. The British would deliver an annual tribute of  GBP1,000, or about GBP127,434 today, and Kuwait would reciprocate as an exporter of valuable pearls, in abundance in Kuwaiti waters. Both countries enjoy a mutually beneficial, multi-billion-dollar trade relationship after those humble beginnings. Indeed, investment by Kuwait in London and investment by the UK in Kuwait has hit an annual volume of USD4.5 billion.<br>Neither side could have imagined that this small start would blossom into the robust trade in petrochemicals, security collaboration, and educational exchange so vital to both countries today. </p><p>“Defense and security are high priority areas for us and always have been. Kuwait is a key friend and ally for us in the region, and more broadly. We have longstanding and excellent bilateral cooperation in this area, and actually have a permanent British presence in Kuwait in the form of the British Military Mission and 36 officers embedded with the Kuwaiti Armed Forces," Britain's Ambassador to Kuwait, Michael Davenport, told TBY. “We see Kuwait and other countries of the Gulf as very important allies for the UK in defending our joint interests in the region."</p><p>“The relationship has evolved in positive directions. We are able to work together in areas that require a lot of trust and confidence on both sides. Our bilateral relationship is flourishing and, from our experience, we can observe a 20% YoY increase in British exports to Kuwait," Davenport added.  </p><p>Kuwait is a key diplomatic partner for all of its allies for its strategic location and deep port, making it a longstanding hub for trade in the region, but also because of its humanitarian and far-sighted role in raising and delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen, Syria, and Myanmar, where warfare and ethnic cleansing have forced millions of people to flee for their lives. In this sense, Kuwait helps the UK achieve its wider foreign policy goals of promoting human rights and protecting the vulnerable. <br>“The UK has proven to be a trustworthy partner over the years and has stood by Kuwait through thick and thin," Sheikh Sabah Khaled Al-Hamad Al Sabah, Kuwait's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, told The Arab Times in January. <br>The friendship between the two countries was forged over the last 120 years by prosperous trade and security arrangements, but also in the conflagration of the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who was keen on seizing Kuwait's oil wealth and realizing illegitimate territorial claims. The invasion force not only harmed Kuwaitis, but also took British citizens hostage, among other nationalities. Although both countries had changed drastically in the intervening decades since the Friendship Treaty's signing, the UK and its ally the US came to the defense of Kuwaiti sovereignty, just as the original treaty agreement entailed. With the successful removal of Iraqi invasion forces, Kuwait was able to reassert its independence and control over its own destiny, a right it has gone on to help others achieve. </p><p>With peace has come opportunities for intellectual pursuits, for both Kuwaitis and British citizens, who study, work, and teach in each other's countries. A successful diplomatic union is the result of countless hours of conversations between citizens of the two countries involved. That conversation began more than a century ago between Britons and Kuwaitis, eager to find ways to help each other. Those conversations will certainly continue for the next century and beyond. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major factors make Kuwait a strategic diplomatic partner in the GCC region?</h4><p>Kuwait is a stabilizing factor in the region; it has always tried to mediate and de-escalate and continues to do so, for example with regards to the ongoing rift within the GCC. It pursues a value-based foreign policy and supports multilateral approaches within the framework of the UN and is currently an elected member of the UN Security Council, similar to Germany. Kuwait is also heavily engaged in humanitarian assistance within the region and beyond, a fact that has been recognized through the nomination of HH Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah as “Humanitarian Leader" by the UN. Through all this, Kuwait has a soft power that goes far beyond its size or population and makes it an important diplomatic partner in the region.</p><h4>Kuwaiti investment in Germany has reached about EUR30 billion while German exports to Kuwait are worth over EUR1.3 billion; are you satisfied with these numbers or do you see room for improvement?</h4><p>I am extremely pleased with these numbers. More importantly, all these investments have been beneficial to the Kuwaiti investors as well as the German companies involved, because Kuwaitis tend to have long-term view on investments that corresponds very well with the German approach. And on the trade side, Germany is still the largest European exporter of goods to Kuwait. However, I would not be a good ambassador if I did not try to increase these already positive numbers. We plan to organize an investment seminar to showcase investment opportunities in Germany and will certainly continue to promote Kuwait as a stable and wealthy market to German companies.</p><h4>How are Germany and Kuwait enhancing collaboration in the education field in order to boost the number of Kuwaiti students in German universities?</h4><p>One of my personal objectives as ambassador is to increase the number of Kuwaiti students in Germany. It is a strategic advantage to have a certain number of Kuwaitis who studied in Germany, hopefully learnt the language, and know the German culture. Such a pool of Kuwaitis will be instrumental to improving bilateral relations—from a level that is already very high—and to bring even more German business to Kuwait. Now, I also recognize the challenges on this path, in particular the language. This is why we have started an initiative that will create a German ecosystem in Kuwait at various levels. We will first strengthen language training in not only schools, but also in institutions of higher education. In parallel, we will strive to increase the number of postgraduate and doctoral students, because many of these programs can be done entirely in English, and this will help to develop new academic ties between Germany and Kuwait. And we are also in contact with the Ministry of Higher Education to find ways to increase the number of undergraduate students in Germany. One argument there is that the high-quality education in Germany is free of charge.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>For our bilateral relations, I expect a continuation of the very high level of cooperation we currently enjoy as elected members of the UN Security Council and in other fields. With regard to our commercial relations, I foresee a further increase after the implementation of German-led projects in Kuwait. I am confident the German companies that have been awarded contracts will not only bring a number of smaller German companies in their tow, but also convince Kuwaitis through the quality and reliability of their work. And in cultural relations, I hope to see the first fruits of our efforts to increase the number of Kuwaiti students in Germany. I will personally not experience all this, because I will return to Germany at the end of July. Hence, this is a great occasion to thank my Kuwaiti friends for the cordial hospitality and friendship they have offered to my wife and I. Kuwait has a big space in our hearts and will be there forever. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies contributed to your recent upgrade to BBB+ rating?</h4><p>Due to our more than 25 years of experience in the regional market and our philosophy of always having our clients' best interest at heart, we have established an active treasury parameter within a risk management scheme. We were pioneers in the country and have been present since the beginning of the Dominican Republic's securities market. The recent upgrade to BBB+ rating is a direct result of the work we have been doing over the past 12 years. Moving forward, our successful strategy and philosophy will not change. </p><h4>Where do you see the most opportunity for JMMB?</h4><p>We started diversifying when we began opening different lines of business. We have been shaping the industry with our retirement fund. We have positioned ourselves ahead of the competition due to the services we provide and our loyalty program. Notably, AFP JMMB BDI achieved the highest yield results at the closing of December 2018, as well as January and February 2019, providing the highest return rate for our affiliates' retirement savings. This data was presented by the Pension Superintendence (SIPEN), the Dominican Authority for Pension Funds Management. If our affiliates stay with us in the long run, they will recover money that many other pension fund administrators (AFPs) do not. The idea is to diversify the risk for the company and generate different business, given the uncertain times for some emerging markets. This way we are able to cover our clients through their life cycle thanks to our wide range of products, from savings accounts to products for investors.</p><h4>What is your outlook for private pension funds in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>There are a number of benefits to creating a retirement fund, even considering that many Latinos do not generally like to save. The regulator is starting to pressure other AFPs because we started to talk about issues that have long been ignored. Retirement funds are the best way to save because the money is protected and in your name; the administrator may change, but the fund is always yours. We are trying to educate people on the importance of AFPs, and we do this in many ways. We have monthly statements, a webpage, a monthly email newsletter, and in our sales pitch, we explain the importance of having a fund like this. There are thousands of people who don't have an accidental insurance or have died without their right to receive their pension, for themselves and their families. The regulators now ask for information about beneficiaries if the client dies. This is something that happened because we brought up the issue. Moreover, this allows the financing of different economic activities, like infrastructure projects or public housing. These funds are stable long-term investments that benefit not only the client but the entire country.</p><h4>How do you expect your client portfolio to evolve in the short term, and what type of clients are you interested in?</h4><p>We serve all types of clients, including individuals, retail, and corporations. Our new target over the next two-to-three years is SMEs. We expect these sectors to grow in the short term. We also want to increase our relationship with high-net worth individuals. </p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2020?</h4><p>We know that the Dominican Republic's economy is growing. We plan to take advantage of this opportunity and continue to grow our business. We expect to see an improvement in the levels of liquidity, and thus in the levels of consumer optimism, which leads to people spending more money. 2020 is an election year, and we have to pay attention to public sentiment because people are more cautious in election years. Investments tend to slow down, and the growth of the country will be a little slower. The government has the opportunity to make some investments on its own to keep the economy running. We believe 2019 will be a harvest year. We are going to reap what we have sowed in previous years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of the Clinic since 2017?</h4><p>We have a new professional building, a new laboratory, and new surgery for kidney transplants. We have also developed new technologies, including techniques to treat irregular heartbeats and pacemaker extraction. We have been working in heart physiology the most. The intensive care unit is new, with eight beds and the latest generation monitors and ventilators. We started a neonatal intensive care unit for premature babies. </p><h4>How important is medical tourism in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Medical tourism is big. About 70% of our patients come from the US. We also have patients coming from Europe and the surrounding islands. There are a lot of Dominicans in Europe returning here to receive less expensive surgeries at a similar or higher quality. We do everything at Clinica Corazones Unidos, but plastic surgery is definitely the biggest part of medical tourism.</p><h4>What makes Corazones Unidos different from other private clinics?</h4><p>We have a personalized medical experience. Each patient has their own nurse. We do everything except heart transplantation and congenital heart disease in infants weighing less than 10kg. We are the first center to have a heart surgery program. We do approximately four open heart surgeries a week. </p><h4>How does the Dominican Republic measure in terms of general health and health infrastructure?</h4><p>We have an excellent health care system, one of the best in the Caribbean. The Dominican Republic ranks higher than Cuba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico; however, the same is not true for private and public healthcare centers. Unfortunately, there is a great difference between the private sector, those who can afford international insurance, and everyone else. We would like to see a more equal playing field for medicine in the future. The same facilities and resources are not always readily available in public hospitals. Since the 2001 social security law, we have noticed positive changes, although there is still a long way to go. There are better physicians and centers in private healthcare. Moreover, insurance companies send patients to specific places, not to where the patients request. SeNaSa is the best public insurance; however, other companies do not offer SeNaSa. This is the problem. I hope in the future SeNaSa will cover everything. I would like to see this in the next five to 10 years. </p><h4>What are the future goals for the clinic?</h4><p>At present, we will continue to expand our rooms and beds. We want to increase our patient capacity. We have future plans to increase our areas, including psychiatry. It is an area that is not well developed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the vision behind RD2044?</h4><p>In 2008, after becoming president for the third time, Leonel Fernándéz launched RD2044 to provide a plan for the construction of the necessary infrastructure set to be completed by 2044, the bicentennial of the founding of the Dominican Republic. Planning requires studying the country, looking for the needs of today and tomorrow, and conducting a proper grassroots project. We visited each province of the country and spoke to the communities. We conducted over 5,000 interviews in a four-year period, and it took us almost four years to research, listen, and establish what the real needs were. We put together a plan involving 1,200 infrastructure projects in the realms of agriculture, energy, tourism, education, communications, and social well-being. Each province will have an average of 26-30 projects, and each government has to select four projects per province during their four-year tenure. We encourage people to put pressure on politicians to adopt these projects as their agenda. Half of the budget for these projects will come from the national budget, while the half will come from PPPs. There are already talks with private companies, though these are in the early stages.</p><h4>How did you assess the 'real needs'?</h4><p>First, we had a pre-modern agenda, namely the need for water supply, power supply, and a healthcare system. With urban planners and economic and social developers, we designed projects to help rural communities develop. We mix these pre-modern aspects with a modern agenda, conducted by researchers from prestigious universities such as Columbia University, Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, and Oxford's Saïd Business School.</p><h4>What projects stand out?</h4><p>One important project is the passenger and cargo train Juan Pablo Duarte, which will significantly improve the current state of cargo transportation. We move 20 million tons of cargo each year and are growing at a rate of 15-20% per year. We can connect all the ports to create dry ports as well. We can have large dry ports like parking lots of containers, connecting them to the main ports, allowing the entire network of cargo to move in and out from local businesses. If we add passenger trains that can go on the same rails at different times, we have a great business opportunity. Another project that personally interests me, as civil engineer, is the underwater Ozama River tunnel in Santo Domingo, which is still at a preliminary design stage.</p><h4>What stage are you in and what are the next steps?</h4><p>We recently completed the projecting phase and are currently in the communication phase. At the same time, we are working with the government to pass a PPP law. We are waiting for this political process to end so that we can start pushing for all these projects to start, hopefully by the end of 2019 or the start of 2020. The project we have put together is the most serious project undertaken in the Dominican Republic, and we are incredibly proud of the research that has been undertaken to reflect the needs and requirements of the Dominican people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your SME construction entrepreneurship program?</h4><p>At the moment, we have various educational programs, aimed at SMEs in the construction sector. With these programs, we work in collaboration with nine of the main universities in the country. We work with young professionals who have recently graduated with high academic degrees, from engineering and architecture majors; we take it on our own to guide and form their companies. We provide them with all the necessary technical preparation, so that they can begin their careers as entrepreneurs in their desired sector. Universities prepare them in their profession, as we prepare them as entrepreneurs to compete and face the dynamics of the construction market. We make it our responsibility to train them in topics such as labor security, social security, tax payments, and state tenders, among other issues of the construction market, as well as dealing with the financial sector. Likewise, we provide them opportunities for participation as entrepreneurs in our projects as well as other public and private institutions. The idea of this program is not for professionals to become employees, but to create opportunities for them to become successful entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurship program has had extraordinary results; to such an extent that we started in 2017/2018 with 24 students and concluded with 106 fully prepared and competitive professionals. Today, in 2019, we have laid the foundations to receive 300 new professionals from extraordinary universities, with the aim of finishing more than 500 entrepreneurs and construction SMEs in the year 2020. We have managed to awaken the interest of many students and professionals in participating in our program. Not only do major universities support us, but public and private institutions also see the vison and results of our program. </p><h4>What should change to help state funds find their way to SMEs in construction industry?</h4><p>In the Dominican Republic, the construction sector follows a somewhat despicable tendency. While the years of 2015 and 2016 marked positive growth, the construction sector in 2017 slowed down remarkably, only to rebound again in 2018. According to my conclusions, these fluctuations are the result of huge investments made through large companies, which have intervened in the overall growth. However, the positive trend of 2018 in the SME sector does not feel such growth. While the government has established a legal framework to safeguard and support SMEs, very little of this has been implemented. Evidently, the funds released from the legal reserve for the development of low-cost housing have been allocated for the purposes in recent years. SMEs in the construction sector simply need opportunities. If the state facilitates some of the funds released by the Central Bank to small construction companies instead of directing them to large companies, it would provide a great opportunity for the country in the general growth of the economy. Through the “Fideico COPYMECON" program, we are developing housing and tourism projects in which it will be built by the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). As a result of their participation with us, they will be able to manage their own trust projects. </p><h4>What are you goals and expectation for 2019?</h4><p>We hope to see considerable opportunities for SMEs in the construction sector, continue developing important construction projects and promote our initiated projects (low-cost housing in which we built 2,400 low-cost apartments, up to 10,000 units), and encourage support for women in the construction field, with the objective of creating greater opportunities. We also want to continue developing educational programs, as well as work to integrate 300 small businesses in our new projects and promote a solid year in which we hope to have the support of the central government to help us reach our goals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the first projects you did?</h4><p>I arrived in Bávaro in 2004 and started to work on small buildings, ancillary structures for hotels I saw that big construction companies were not interested in doing small jobs so I realized there was a business niche in that area, and I started with these small things no one wanted, such as security booths, construction works like renovations at uncomfortable times, night shifts, and more. Right after starting my business formally as Therrestra, I had the good fortune to meet Pablo Piñero, the founder and owner of Bahí­a Prí­ncipe Hotels (Grupo Piñero), a person to whom we are grateful for the opportunity he gave us at that time. As a company, we worked hard for his hotel group, always fulfilling our commitments and we never disappointed Piñero. In response to our engagement he helped us, offering us more and more work and helping us to grow through the years, till we got to expand internationally. One of the most memorable projects we have done in the last years is Hotel Fantasia, a hotel with a new concept intended for families. That year, 2016, 15 hotels were built at the same time in Punta Cana. There was a shortage of labor, high levels of migration, and continuous rains for three months. We had to finish the Hotel Fantasia in seven months. Despite the challenges, the project ended up as a success. The hotel has 550 rooms. Its family concept makes it different from other hotels. We have the satisfaction of having built the hotel in record time, despite many setbacks. It has been so successful that its design was replicated in 2018 in Tenerife, and it will continue to be replicated in many more places. Since our beginning the DR has shown a huge demand for hotels. We intend to be a trustworthy platform for hotel chains, executing their projects simplifying the construction, building hotels with full quality and in the shortest times. </p><h4>What is the comparative advantage of Constructora Therrestra?</h4><p>Execution time is our greatest strength. Thanks to Pablo Piñero, we have accelerated our efforts. In the past, an average hotel with about 500 rooms was completed in around a year and a half, but now we have achieved to develop an efficient management, optimizing the construction process and allowing us to finish them in seven or eight months. In addition, we give the customer a personalized service. We are well positioned; we have become a solid company and we have earned respect from our competitors and repeat clients for our quality signature and our effective management. We work hard and our projects speak for themselves. We take care of every detail and delivery accuracy and promptness. We have a staff of 250 engineers and more than 4,000 workers distributed in the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. For us Jamaica is an interesting emerging market; however, the DR remains at the top of the game, with great tax-friendly incentives for investors, strong human capacity, and a high tourist appeal. </p><h4>What is the importance of the training courses you support? </h4><p>We have reach some agreements with some of the best universities in the country, INTEC, PUCMM and with the local school EDUCARE, among other institutions, with the main goal of being a knowledge facilitator tool for children in need and outstanding students. One of the most important things we would like to share with others is the knowledge we have acquired, and as a company we would like to be an example of what people can achieve by working with dedication and commitment. We have decided to be part of the solution. We must stop complaining about problems and work on solutions. We want to give our collaborators all the tools they need to be better professionally and personally, because human capital is part of our success and strength. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Data Accuracy Over 99%]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[marwan-ahmad-lutfi-ceo-al-etihad-credit-bureau]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did centralized credit data reporting come to evolve in the UAE market, and where does it stand compared to the rest of the GCC?</h4><p>Centralized credit data reporting is not new to the UAE, where the Central Bank has used it for a long time. The establishment of Al Etihad Credit Bureau, however, marks a change in that we operate under the regulatory oversight of the Central Bank, but aim to integrate with all of the other banks so that data flow could become more systematic and automated. Our goal is to build a totally interconnected, objective system with minimal manual intervention that allows us to monitor any errors with ease. From our original product, the credit report and score, we have grown to offer around 10 products. The last two years, especially, saw a kind of revolution in our offering. While the UAE was one of the last GCC countries to establish a credit bureau, we have achieved in only four years a level of operation that puts us almost head-to-head with our counterparts in Saudi Arabia, for example, who have been operating for 15 years. Our system is as advanced as it can get, with data accuracy rates of over 99%, which we achieved within one year. What's more, some other GCC countries approach us to learn how they can achieve that. That said, we are not reinventing the wheel, as we use experienced vendors.</p><h4>What role does Al Etihad Credit Bureau play in the Emirati banking sector?</h4><p>Al Etihad Credit Bureau's products are intended to optimize a commercial bank's internal processes. When we introduced the Credit Report in 2014, and the Credit Score in 2017, it was still a new concept in the Emirates. It is still critical for banks to facilitate the underwriting process, and we have multiple value-added services that allow them to monitor portfolios. We also offer our own alert services, wherein we can observe all of the customers in a bank's portfolio every day, and then send the bank reports on sensitive events that might impact its credit risk . Through this offering, we act as an early warning system for banks. Our efforts to push our system within the marketplace paid off, as we saw immediate adoption of the credit score within the national banking system— one year in, almost 80% of all reports issued included the Credit Score. The UAE has a highly progressive banking sector, which tends to jump on anything that can add more value. Credit scores were only the beginning, and now we are working on developing several other indicators that can benefit market operators and, ultimately, the economy itself. In 2018, for example, we launched the Skip Indicator, tailored to loans, which gives banks an indication of the likelihood of an individual to miss more than two payments successively. This has proven extremely useful, and over the next year we will launch several other indicators that will add even more value.</p><h4>How is the Credit Bureau expanding its portfolio of indicators, and what kinds of data inputs drive this expansion?</h4><p>Al Etihad Credit Bureau receives extensive inputs from banks—nearly 120 data points. If you factor in the internal aggregation of this data, we have more than 2,000 relevant data points. The bureau has not, however, stopped at financial services. We have also begun drawing from the telecommunications sector, which is probably the highest-volume market. We now have the UAE's two main operators supplying data to us. Their data primarily concerns obligations and defaults. As the business model of the telecom industry evolves, our output plugs into their decision-making systems as well. These days, phones are as expensive as laptops, and no one pays cash for them. Consequently, operators are pushing mobile devices on payment plans, and once you get into payment-plan mode, you are automatically in credit mode. So, telecom companies have in many cases become credit providers and need to assess the ability of people to repay them. Another type of data we are getting into is from the utilities sector. In this space, as well as telecoms, we want to develop alternative scores not necessarily based on credit information. There is a huge population in the UAE that has never borrowed before. When someone lacks any credit history, we have to ask ourselves how we can provide some indication of their credit risk. Enter telecoms, utilities, and other sources. Utility bills are a form of obligation, meaning that everyone who engages with them creates a record of payments, which in turn might indicate how a person will behave with credit. The Credit Bureau already has a system in place for some non-borrowers, but our current goal is to develop it further. When it comes to putting data into action, machine learning and predictive analytics, in particular, have played an integral role. In 2018, we ran deep and extensive analytics to help develop our credit scoring model. We adopted cutting-edge machine learning technology to help us with this, which has made our model even more powerful from a prediction standpoint. Now, the second generation of these technologies is under review. We are always reviewing our machine learning model with the Central Bank and using regulatory standards on par with Europe or the US. When we talk about machine learning, our philosophy is that it is more about increasing efficiency in identifying behavioral trends than it is about just letting machines do the work.</p><h4>In the UAE's expatriate-heavy economy, how does credit reporting flow across borders?</h4><p>With respect to individuals arriving in the UAE from other countries, gleaning data can prove to be difficult. The laws around cross-border data exchange are extremely cumbersome. Most countries are protective, as is the UAE, and under the current laws data export is a prohibitive process. We have looked into collaborating with other markets, but the legal challenges and thinking are all the same. Several entities with which we are in talks believe that data is proprietary, and they are restricted from sharing data outside their country. Of course, everyone has a mandate, but in reality, data belongs to the individual. The Credit Bureau's borrowers hail from more than 100 countries, and so we are focused on setting an example by exploring ways to make our own data more accessible overseas.  The people that get penalized the most by preventing data movement are the good borrowers, because they sometimes have spent decades developing a strong credit history, only to have to start anew when they return home. To some extent, we have already been successful. Our recently launched digital channel allows individuals to access their credit reports online, anytime and anywhere. Two weeks after we launched our App, we had downloads from over 100 countries, and purchases from around 20, indicating that people were possibly utilizing their UAE credit history to re-establish their creditworthiness elsewhere. This was a use case that really surprised us. It has also been the highest and fastest adoption of any digital channel we have ever seen, with 85% of reports now being accessed digitally. The majority of those who use offline access methods are companies because identifying the legal representative is not as easy as it is for individuals requesting their own credit reports. But we are looking for ways to automate the process for them as well.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to build a climate of credit market awareness and financial literacy within the UAE?</h4><p>The Credit Bureau's website is an excellent source of information about what credit scores are, and what impact them. Since 2018, we have also been highly active in credit education initiatives for the public. For example, we recently signed an MoU with Visa, to partner with them to run financial literacy and education missions in the UAE. We run similar programs with the Ministry of Youth, Injaz and Emirates Foundation. On the industry side, our mandate and the ease and transparency of our services increase banks' awareness on multiple fronts. When we first started, some people thought that a credit bureau would slow down business. Now, however, if you compare banks' financial reports before and after the launch of the bureau, there is a clear trend in profit growth, which is potentially linked to a reduction in non-performing loans. Since late 2017, the Central Bank of the UAE has mandated that all banks must do a credit assessment for any loan application they receive. This has taken away any reason a bank might have to say that they were unaware of certain reporting data. Furthermore, banks are able to see all of the data points in the system. Alternatively, banks can also take higher risks and price them accordingly, and in fact some entities specialize in this. Our other value-added services also play a role in strengthening financial literacy for customers. For example, the portfolio monitoring services and the early warning systems allow institutions to proactively engage clients who may be facing financial stress, making them more aware of what they need to be doing to maintain a healthy credit score.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about the results that the five power generation plants have had in Panama?</h4><p>We have seven power plants in Panama. In 2018, we had 777MW installed in Panama, with 705MW based on hydroelectricity. Five of the hydro plants are in Bayano, La Estrella, Los Valles, Esti and Changuinola, additionally we have a bunker-based barge. In 2015, we won a tender with the distributors to deliver, starting in September 2018, of the first natural gas-based power plant in Panama and Central America. Another 381MW plant was ready on time. From then until now, that plant has generated at maximum capacity, generating power 24/7 over the summer. This is good because hydroelectric plants don't produce much energy in the summer. With more diverse energy sources, you can have a much more flexible energy market for Panamanians. This new plant allows you to fill the capacity gaps in the national grid.</p><h4>What are the strategies to reinforce the fact that you're producing more than 24% of energy for the country? </h4><p>The plant we made generates 381MW, and this is treated in turn with another plant from us, with a terminal that is based on liquefied natural gas and has the capacity to receive ships up to 160,000 cubic meters and a storage tank of 180,000 cubic meters, this tank only uses 25% for this plant and the remaining 75% we see it positively so that it enters into other development issues within the country. Additionally, we see that natural gas will contribute to sectors such as transport. In the industry today, all that work with boiler-based, refrigeration-based, diesel fuels, all can be switched to natural gas, this makes the industry much more efficient. Our plant that does not only work with generation for electrical energy but also will touch these elements that are important. Regarding to bunkering, we're there at the door of the Panama Canal and the terminal has the capacity to receive and deliver from 3,000 to 160,000 cubic meters. In fact, we also see everything that has to do with transport, trucks and tanks; it can be done with natural gas. Later, gas pipelines or barges that can take liquified natural gas (LNG) not only to the country but also to other ports in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica can also be made later.</p><h4>How are you planning to achieve your medium- and long-term vision?</h4><p>We are developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project with Bahia Investment Group. In this project, we put around 37% equity of both companies, over 200 million for each one. The goal is to have the financial muscle for the other 67%. To do this, we have different multilaterals such as the IFC, the BCIE and local banking such as Bancolombia and Banco General. Finally, the different institutions and agencies of the state must also be aligned so that they can support the project to be developed in the time needed by the country. The main stakeholders of this project are the banks, the partners, the state and the communities surrounding the project. The community is an important factor, which is why we started about 10 different social projects. We wanted the community to grow through education and training, while providing funds for so the microenterprise could work and grow.</p><h4>Could you talk about the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 2030? </h4><p>By 2030, there is a clear goal of reducing carbon emissions by up to 70%. That's not easy, especially when you have a company like AES that has been working in other countries with coal plants. But the decision was made at the corporate level that we would be leaving these coal plants to replace them through renewable, batteries technology, distributed generation and natural gas, depending on what can be applied in each country. In Panama, we chose gas because we saw that it was making the force to have a much more mature energy matrix. However, that does not mean that we are not going to grow here with other renewable energies. We are seeing several projects for 2019 and 2020, around 50 and 70MW of solar energy.</p><h4>What are the latest initiatives that are affecting the social development of the country?</h4><p>We have programs around the communities where we're working, for example in Changuinola we have given over 12 years more than 89 million dollars in social action in the form of construction of aqueducts, schools, construction of four medical dispensaries, four houses of prayer and training for the people of the community. Also, we have a hydro-biological center where we are reproducing fish that can be placed in the reservoirs behind dams. They can be part of the economy of the community. We're always aware of the communities where we operate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[areas-of-advantage]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the first logistics company in the Port of the Americas, what advantages does the direct access give you and your clients?</h4><p>Having a logistics center within the port gives our customers a more efficient supply chain. At Caucedo Logistics, as soon as the containers are unloaded from the vessel, we bring it straight to the warehouse, which produces efficiency in time and cost. Another advantage is customs processes. Customs controls the perimeter of the port; therefore, we can create swifter interactions with customs to expedite the time between port and warehouse and vice versa.</p><h4>What is the comparative advantage of the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Compared to Panama, our main competitor, our largest advantages are our strong local market, being one of the largest Caribbean economies, the fastest-growing economy, and many multinationals. The latter want to establish their logistics center in a place where they can sell their products too. The free port in the Bahamas has almost no local market; the same is true for Jamaica and its port in Kingston. We share the island with Haiti, which lacks all types of infrastructure, and many companies use us as a platform to get to Haiti. Another of our clear advantages is our extremely modern legal framework. There is minimal human intervention, with automated customs approvals and simplified procedures. DP World also sees a great deal of opportunity in the LATAM region. We recently acquired two ports in Chile and have developed ports in Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and Argentina. There are other markets in the region experiencing growth. We are keen to look at economies that are growing. We see a great deal of inefficiencies in the logistics sector in the region, and with our global network we can help make it more efficient and up-to-date.</p><h4>What are your future investment plans?</h4><p>In December 2018, we began our expansion project that is expected to be ready by 1Q2020. That includes the addition of 420m of additional cays. Our main quay will be 1-km long, in addition to some 300 additional meters. This also includes the acquisition of three super post-Panamax cranes, the biggest available today, the expansion of our container yard, and three additional warehouses this year. We will also purchase 800,000sqm for the future development of the logistics park. This will make us one of the largest and most efficient ports in the region. We will increase our throughput capacity by about 1 million additional TEUs, making us among the top 10 Latin American ports. This will ensure the country has world-class port infrastructure that will allow for more services, such as bigger and larger vessels. We will be the deepest port in the region. In addition, we will be one of the only ports able to host large vessels, providing benefits to our local businesses and exporters.</p><h4>What is the profile of your clients, and how do you see it changing?</h4><p>We currently have many logistics operators. We have furniture companies like IKEA, as well as foodstuff operators using the country as a consolidation hub for all the different products they buy from around the world. We have vehicle manufactures that have stock inventory here for redistribution in the region. I do not see our portfolio changing, but rather more products coming into the country. More companies and products will use the country as a logistics platform to enter regional markets. In the first two months of 2019, we surpassed the total amount of containers re-exported from logistics centers here. This means we will be able to re-export four or five times more in 2019 compared to 2018. And in 2018, we re-exported double the figure of the previous year. There is a trend here in the number of companies using the country as a logistics hub. More companies now understand the value of the Dominican Republic. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-hub-for-all-hankerings]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about plans to develop the Dominican Republic as a regional distribution hub?</h4><p>Over the past two years, we were able to convince the government to create a legal structure, particularly for customs clearance, such that the Dominican Republican can become a distribution hub, both for local customers and the wider Caribbean region. The Dominican Republic enjoys the most efficient maritime and airline connections in the region, which makes it an ideal point of distribution for global customers. There are adequate facilities to accommodate maritime and airline operators, and we also have considerable warehousing space for allocation to cargo handling and distribution. This makes the country highly competitive in supply chain logistics, not only for cargo being brought here from the rest of the world, but also for that being produced locally for shipment to the US, Europe, South America, and the Caribbean. Free zones have also grown significantly over the past few years in line with the infrastructure required to facilitate that growth. Last year alone, I saw a strong rise in the number of shipping companies and airlines entering the country, and today this is even more so the case; we are concretely on track to become the regional logistic hub for transportation and distribution.</p><h4>How does Marí­tima Dominicana stand in comparison to other competitors?</h4><p>The vital ingredient is our ability to provide all services that shipping airliners and global customers require, which means attending ships and airplanes in ports and airports and helping them with loading, discharging, customs clearance, local transportation, warehousing and local distribution, or reshipment to other destinations. This is what we call supply chain logistics, and it is one of the key components of our services. Over the past two years, we have increased the capacity of our warehouses at ports and airports to better provide these supply chain services, which is why we have gained an increasing number of global customers. Another asset is the digitalization process we have recently undergone. As a service provider for global customers in transportation and import/export operations, it is essential for us to connect all parties digitally, enabling customers to determine at any time where their products are being warehoused or transported, what the costs are, and what the inventory is.</p><h4>What are the main markets of operations for the merchandise you handle?</h4><p>The largest market for imports and exports remains the US, but we are developing additional markets for the export of agricultural products, particularly in Europe and the Caribbean. I see a real opportunity to efficiently develop the agricultural sector and expand its export reach. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your opinion on the digitalization of the country and your company?</h4><p>Digital transformation enables organizations to seek profitability by creating digital processes and experiences that enable them to obtain efficiencies, while at the same time increasing customer loyalty. GBM is committed to helping spread the technologies that will allow these institutions to achieve this goal. This will be a long and difficult process. In order to help our customer with the digital transformation journey, GBM has three lines of work: consulting (SAP), managed services (outsourcing), and software. It is through the implementation of our cloud and software solutions that we enable our customers to achieve their goals of creating a digital environment that will bring their end users an easier way to interact with the organizations. The software area is based on three basic pillars: AI, hybrid cloud, and security. The focus on the security area is extremely important to our customers; companies need to be aware of their vulnerabilities to offer a secure platform on their complex environments, which needs to be safe on every interaction with the end user. The cloud service is a reality, though the move to the cloud involves many challenges. One is the increased communications cost of the connections to access data on the cloud. The cloud also represents a challenge for companies that have data location regulations, such as the financial sector. In the Dominican Republic, we need legislation that can allow institutions to store information on the cloud regardless the final destination of the data. The cloud can also offer a platform where a company does not have to manage the solutions and take risks of having their data outside a controlled environment; the decision on which data is sent to the cloud depends on the industry and the maturity level of the company. GBM advises and provides products/services that ease the transition to the cloud. AI is becoming a part of all the new solutions on present and future products, and through our AI platform we intend to learn from past interactions to improve the decision-making process and become autonomous. Such technologies need an accompanying process to be done correctly because each customer demands specifications according to their industry and a great deal of consulting.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the IT the sector in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The technology industry will have solid growth in the country in the coming years because there is a strong process of technological transition, especially with AI and cloud computing, which will strongly transform everything we are doing. Digital transformation summarizes everything that is happening in the market and in the world for customers and consumers. Interactions have been completely transformed. Machine learning and 5G will generate an exponential transition, allowing one to do things with a cellular connection that were not possible before. In precision agriculture, for example, we can have sensors connected to a network and, with cellular communication, to a central office to be monitored in real time. This means millions of bytes of data flowing from one place to another. With 5G, one can build a call center with a group of people connected only by a cell phone without the need for fiber optics. AI, 5G, and cloud computing will transform the way we see technology.</p><h4>How do you predict the environment for IT tech entrepreneurs to evolve?</h4><p>In the Dominican Republic, little is done on this subject because the country is not characterized by encouraging entrepreneurs, much less entrepreneurship in technology. Lending in the the country for these purposes is extremely difficult. The state should participate and provide more encouragement and mechanisms to provide for these loans. We do have many capable and talented people with great ideas, but what we are lacking is central support. More needs to be done in order to exploit the potential the country has to offer. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities does the unreliability of the Dominican Republic's power sector present for ESD?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic's energy sector has been struggling with a financial crisis since it started privatization in 1998 to get foreign investors to participate in infrastructure on both the distribution and generation sides. However, at the time, most generators depended on fuel oil prices, and as issues in the Middle East became more severe, fuel prices increased. As a result, there were several financial crises. The government and private sector continued to work together and obtained a fuel mix for the generation side that could bring down the price of electricity generation. The government had the opportunity to focus on the distribution side, and since 2008, it started to invest in a distribution rehabilitation project financed by the World Bank. Since 2008, the Dominican government has invested more than USD500 million, and losses have fallen from 50% to 28%. In a few years' time, all distribution companies will be financially sustainable. This will allow the government to cut back on its subsidies to the industry so it can invest this money in other areas. I am confident that in the coming years, the Dominican Republic will overcome the electrical pricing issues that have prevailed over the last decade. On the front of renewables, the Dominican Republic has successfully implemented policies to attract investors and due to the competitiveness of its market, an increasing number of renewable power projects are being developed. At present, more than 500MW of renewable energy is installed, which is a remarkable number for Central America and the Caribbean. Small-scale renewable generation can be extremely important, and rooftop systems can have a significant impact.</p><h4>What are your most interesting projects in the pipeline?</h4><p>We are confident generation costs will remain low, and distribution will continue to become more efficient. We want to focus on opportunities in electric vehicles and bring in the infrastructure necessary for charging stations and platforms. Outside of the Dominican Republic, we are focusing heavily on Guyana. We recently delivered 11 5.5-MW generators to the country. We are in discussions about expanding that capacity to 11MW. Guyana is our main target, because it will be an oil producer within one year.</p><h4>Where do you see the biggest challenges in the local market, and what needs to be done to address these issues?</h4><p>The generation side is fairly saturated; there are enough power generators to satisfy demand. Additionally, the government plans to expand and extend generation from gas-fired power plants in the coming years. On the generation side, there will be a great deal of competition in terms of pricing. Distribution still lies in the hands of the government, so it can do more in terms of creating efficiencies. This includes developing better services aimed at supplying customers with electricity. This could be resolved as the Dominican government invests more in the rehabilitation of the line. Most rural areas have poorly constructed distribution lines, and with more investment, the lines could be rebuilt to allow for better customer service. This can improve standards of living and boost local economies.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for ESD?</h4><p>ESD wants to bring value to the market. The Dominican Republic is the fastest-growing country in the region, politically stable, and considerate of outside investment, and we are focusing on the local market. The country is also young; 42% of the population is under 25. As the country invests more on education, we want to bring the fourth industrial revolution and develop the country into a more advanced economy. Additionally, we want to transform the image of the Dominican Republic to that of a more environmentally friendly country. This will benefit the nation as a destination for European and American tourists. People all over the world are concerned about sustainability, and if the country can become a leader in electrical sustainability, it will attract more people and investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was Evergreen's main interest in having a representative in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Marí­tima del Caribe Dominicana was established in 1995 as the sole and exclusive agent of Evergreen Marine Corporation (Evergreen) in the Dominican Republic. At the time, Evergreen had only just established a container port in Panama. When it commenced feeder services from Panama to Caribbean countries, it needed a foothold in the Dominican Republic. Our growth here has been a continuous process since 1995, initially in step with that of the local economy, but subsequently exceeding it in terms of our TEU volumes.</p><h4>What is your comparative advantage?</h4><p>In comparison to our competitors, we have one of the strongest customer service departments here as far as container shipping agents are concerned, which is borne out by our customers' feedback. Other companies outsource their customer service to third-party services overseas, and our experience is that customers do not favor this practice.</p><h4>What trends have you observed in the local maritime transport sector?</h4><p>The trend worldwide certainly is for larger vessels reaching higher economies of scale. Vessels going through the Panama Canal used to have a maximum capacity of around 5,000TEUs, but with the inauguration of the new Panama Canal, that figure has now reached almost 14,000TEUs. This also has an impact on the Dominican Republic: the ports of Caucedo and Rio Haina, which Evergreen calls both, have had to expand their capacity to serve larger vessels. Another reason for the larger vessel trend in even smaller trade lanes is the greater operational cooperation between competing carriers. Until five or six years ago, each shipping line called the country with stand-alone services, but since then, carriers started operating joint services with their competitors. As a consequence, the number of lines offering services has increased, while the number of services has remained more or less stable. This, together with significant improvements in infrastructure—such as ports, roads, and warehouses—and favorable changes in the regulatory framework, has enabled the Dominican Republic to become a regional logistics hub. Additional investments are planned or already under way, which will further increase the movement of cargo to and from the country. All of this sets the Dominican Republic apart from other Caribbean countries.</p><h4>What are your main markets of operations?</h4><p>Our main markets are the Far East, the East Coast of the US, the Caribbean, Central America, and the West Coast of South America, among others. We are among the leading carriers in the Far East because Evergreen has three strings of services from there to its regional hub at Colón Container Terminal in Panama. No other carrier has the range and frequency that Evergreen has in this regard.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2020?</h4><p>We want to reach our KPIs for each quarter, both by volume and customer satisfaction. While vessel occupation and volumes have been satisfactory for 2018, we surely will improve our performance for 2019.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you outline Akuo Energy's presence in the region?</h4><p>Akuo Energy is an independent power producer with a short 10-year history, but a wide range of operations in all fields of renewable energy, namely wind, solar, biomass, and micro hydropower. The main objective of the company is sustainable development through technical solutions; we are specialized in structuring, financing, building, and operating long-term high-quality energy projects that will benefit the territory where they are being implemented. We are present in 15 countries; our activities began in France, which remains the market in which we have the largest number of projects, although not the largest ones. We entered the Caribbean with an island-specific strategy, based on French overseas territories and a concept called “agri-energy," which combines renewable energy production, or storage, and agriculture to address the issue of land scarcity. With our presence in the French Caribbean, we have developed an interest in the Dominican Republic since 2013, when many renewable energy projects existed in the country without being either complete or viable. We raised the bar in terms of quality and as a result those projects gained traction with international investors, such as the World Bank and the IFC. After those initial projects, we continued investing and building our long-term strategy in the country.</p><h4>Are you looking to open new projects in the region?</h4><p>Yes, absolutely. We are currently investigating the state of renewable energy incentives available in various territories. Besides having typical renewable energy projects, we have certain specific solutions that we would like to apply to other islands. These include solar gems, which are solar panels in a container that can be replaced easily during a hurricane or tropical storm—entirely appropriate given the weather factor in the Caribbean region. We also have solar tiles, which look exactly the same as house roof tiles, but can be used to generate energy and replaced with everyday tiles should the need arise. We are also developing a hydrogen production solution that can be paired with transportation, a solution that could be interesting for the Caribbean.</p><h4>What noteworthy projects do you have in the Dominican Republic? </h4><p>The company's main project in the country is a windfarm with an installed capacity of 50MW in Monte Cristi, in the north of the country. When we started the evaluation in 2013, we realized that although there were several concession permits, there was only one wind farm, in the south of the country. The Pecasa wind farm emerged as the most viable project, taking into account resources, population, and environmental constraints. It will consist of 25 turbines designed by Siemens-Gamesa. Construction is due for completion by July 2019, and the project will enter service immediately thereafter. Our immediate plans then are to expand the wind farm and undertake the second phase of the project. We are also looking at solar projects, which we consider to be an important complement to wind farms, operating as they do almost at opposite times. We are looking for projects that already exist, and seek to partner with them to bring them to life.</p><h4>What is your view on the Dominican Republic's renewable energy sector?</h4><p>There is a lot that has been done, but there are improvements needed in terms of how legislation is structured. There is a need for procedural stability to enable a smooth continuity. Local participation on this front is strong and active, while foreign firms like us come to offer experience and financing inputs. For the future, most financial institutions in the Dominican Republic are keen to invest and support renewable energy. The influx of a number of international companies into the Dominican Republic's renewable energy market has helped improve local knowledge of technology and raise awareness. This is a collective development of all players within the industry, and those local firms are strong enough to sustain growth internally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your previous experiences abroad shaped your current involvement in the renewable energy sector?</h4><p>From an early age, I have always been drawn to the idea that through innovation, we can impact people's lives, particularly those that are most vulnerable. After completing my MBA in the US, I spent a good portion of my professional life abroad, working with pioneering technology start-ups in countries such as the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Colombia, Canada, the UK, and Singapore. Although incredibly enriching, I wanted to begin focusing my work on addressing some the truly complex issues our global community faces, such as inequality and climate change. I decided to enroll at Columbia University to pursue another graduate degree in the area of economic development. While there, I participated in a research project in Machakos, Kenya. In this very rural setting, I had the opportunity to observe the massive economic impact of solar panels in operation, with all the positive social repercussions on the community's livelihoods. Seeing this, I realized that solar energy could also represent the solution for the huge electricity problems that my home country faced. I knew that there was an opportunity to intervene and that it was up to me to take action. Therefore, after 10 years away from the Dominican Republic, my husband and I decided to return home and dedicate our efforts to developing, financing, constructing, and operating solar energy systems. We spent a full summer talking to government officials, leaders of the private and public sectors, and various academics to understand how the new law that incentivized renewable energy was being implemented. As soon as our company became operational, we were confronted with the possibility that the incentives in the renewable energy law were going to be eliminated. This was 2012, and a turning point for the whole sector. We banded together with other companies to fight the proposed changes, which culminated in a meeting with the Senate, at which point we obtained an agreement to save the majority of the incentives. This pumped vitality into the green energy sector, bringing together all players who shared the same vision and giving us a united voice that is supported by solid studies on the financial and environmental impact of renewables. To date, the Asociación para el Fomento de las Energí­as Renovables (ASOFER) counts almost 100 member companies and is active throughout the Caribbean region. Importantly, ASOFER exerts pressure on the Dominican government to achieve the renewable energy targets outlined by the president of the country: reduce CO2 emissions by 25% by 2025 and increase the percentage of renewable sources of energy up to 32% by 2030.</p><h4>How does KAYA Energy stand out from other providers of solar energy? </h4><p>Solar energy has now become a commodity, and we have a great number of local companies active in the sector. One of our key differentiators is our multi-disciplinary and multicultural team, which is dedicated to providing our clients with high-performing solar energy systems. Another point that sets us apart is our regional reach, as we are providing project management and project design services throughout region, which enables us to engage the expertise and experience of these different locations. Moreover, something that is very important to us is our CSR involvement. Inspired by the success stories I was able to witness first-hand in Kenya, we have worked alongside communities in the DR to bring them solar energy.</p><h4>What are your goals for the upcoming years?</h4><p>We will continue to push to expand the share of electricity produced from renewables as much as possible. There are many improvements needed by the green energy sector. Large-scale projects need to be approved faster. Also, we should further educate people on the importance of installing solar panels or other types of renewables in households. Renewable energies are not only the responsibility of big companies or public institutions; in fact, every household can play an essential role in enabling our country to comply with its energy and emissions commitments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-real-measure-of-value]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What potential does the Dominican Republic have in renewable energy?</h4><p>We have been focusing most of our efforts over the last 10 years on investing in renewable energy, and today we are the leaders in the country and the region. Most of this has been from wind farms. Today, we have 175MW of installed capacity. This has been an investment that has surpassed USD400 million from EGE Haina. If we factor in all renewables, including hydro, they only make up 12% of the country's energy makeup. Although the Dominican Republic has enough renewable resources to supply all of its electricity consumption, what limits a country like us from reaching 100% renewables is that, as an island country, we have mostly wind and sun, which are intermittent energy sources, unlike hydro. We do not produce fossil fuels either; therefore, we will depend on energy imports for the foreseeable future. The current administration's plan is to reach 30% renewable penetration by 2030. Since the major end users of power are distribution companies owned by the government, they need to buy into the idea that new capacity should be renewable and go about contracting the installation of that capacity. From our perspective, we share the vision that all new capacity in the coming years should be led by renewables, particularly solar. </p><h4>How will your new projects impact the overall energy sector in the country?</h4><p>One of our key projects going forward involves the conversion of existing power plants to natural gas. We own two major power plants located in San Pedro de Macoris, which currently generate 378MW based on HFO: Quisqueya 2, which is already capable of burning natural gas; and Sultana del Este, which can be converted to burn natural gas. Over the last year, we have been working on securing the supply of gas to where the plants are located, as well as securing infrastructure investment for long-term gas supply. The impact of this initiative will be significant. Not only will it reduce the price of the electricity we generate; it will also affect the entire system by completely eliminating the link between electricity prices and oil-based products. We have calculated these savings to be close to USD550 million for the government. </p><h4>In terms of investment opportunities, how does the Dominican Republic compare to other Caribbean countries?</h4><p>In the Caribbean and Central America, the Dominican Republic is the largest economy and has the largest power demand and is thus the largest market. In the Caribbean, we are also the largest and fastest-growing market. We project energy demand will grow around 3-4% per year over the next 20 years, which will double consumption by 2040. This will require a lot of investment and new capacity, which translates to opportunities for the private sector.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2019, and what is your long-term vision for EGE Haina?</h4><p>2019 will be a milestone year for the power sector. We have a significant new player entering the market, Punta Catalina, a big government-led investment in a coal-fired 700 MW power plant, which covers roughly 30% of market demand. It is a significant event and change in the outlook of the power sector and will affect smaller and less-efficient players in the market. EGE Haina has been doing the necessary investments to diversify its energy matrix. Moving forward, we see a market that has sufficient traditional thermal power installed, particularly considering the entry of 700MW of new coal-fired power plants. Therefore, any incremental energy demand should be led by renewables. It is not just a trend, but the most cost-effective decision. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-new-gilded-age]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current state of the business climate in the country?</h4><p>The business climate in the Dominican Republic is fairly stable. Within the region, the Dominican Republic has had sustained growth over the last decade. In 2018, the economy grew by 6.3%, the highest sustained growth of any country. Measures have also been taken to favor and encourage the creation of new businesses such as the Single Tax System, a simplified tax payment scheme for small businesses. ANJE has worked with the General Directorate of Internal Taxes and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the vice-presidency of MIPYMES. These measures facilitate the dynamism of microenterprises. Whereas before there were many bureaucratic obstacles and extremely long and expensive permitting processes for a start-up or company, the single tax system will reduce the whole process to merely once a year, allowing both entrepreneurs and microentrepreneurs to devote more time to their businesses. For this reason, the Dominican Republic could become a regional platform for the creation of new businesses especially in technology and exports.</p><h4>What main problems does ANJE seek to tackle?</h4><p>We have drawn up a management plan for 2019. Institutionalism is a transversal axis to all sectors of the economy to achieve a healthier business climate, greater transparency, and more legal security. We have made a series of agreements with other associations to carry out the management plans and worked with the National Council of Private Companies (CONEP) and the Foundation for Institutionality and Justice (FINJUS) on the specific issue of citizen security. ANJE and FINJUS worked on a project in 2017 related to climate of public insecurity and its costs for SMEs. We discovered how much it costs a micro and medium business to maintain security, and the replacement cost when a company is the victim of a crime or theft. These significantly affect cash flow and significantly hinder rapid growth. </p><h4>How do you characterize the level of collaboration and understanding between the public and private sector?</h4><p>We have developed a healthy relationship between the public and private sectors. Guilds like ANJE serve as a channel between its affiliated members and the private and public sector. The communication is fluid and transparent, and we are forming important agreements to continue developing the Dominican economy. There is a great deal of optimism for 2019. One exception is the national development strategy law, which mandates the signing of a fiscal pact. The fiscal pact was left on the table, and the government has already made it public that it will not be addressed in this management. Beyond that, the Dominican economy saw extremely positive growth in 2018 across all indicators and sectors such as tourism, trade, free zones, and exports. There will be sustained growth for 2019.</p><h4>What are your upcoming priorities and objectives?</h4><p>We are focused on generating institutionalization. We will continue to participate along with other business associations in spaces and tables of decision-making, such as the Economic and Social Council, where the electric and education pacts are being discussed. ANJE also participates with CONEP in the National Council of Magistrates, where high court judges' performances are evaluated. We play a fundamental role in the final process of selecting judges in the constitutional court. We are currently working with CONEP on the subject of judges in the Supreme Court of Justice. ANJE should play a role as a guild and an ideal channel between society, the government, and every actor involved in making decisions at the national level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of fiscal year 2018 in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>From an economic perspective, 2018 was an excellent year for the Dominican Republic. We grew at 7%, the highest in Latin America and the world. This growth rate was obtained with a low level of inflation (1.17%), well below the lower limit set by the Central Bank. Regarding international reserves, we reached USD7.6 billion, the equivalent to 4.4 months of imports, far above our initial target. Our current account deficit is at one of its lowest levels in decades, about USD800 million, or 1.4% of GDP. In 2017, it was 0.2% due to low oil prices, but we saw a rebound in 2018 as the rest of the economy picked up. We have low levels of fiscal deficits compared to 2012. Poverty levels also dropped from 39.9% in 2012 to 23% in 2018, while critical poverty has declined from 9.9% to 2.9% in 2018. The economy generates a large amount of hard currency. Most of this comes from the tourism sector. In 2018, we saw 6 million tourist arrivals, making us the number-one Caribbean nation in terms of tourist arrivals. This generates USD7.6 billion in revenues. We saw diversification on the exports side as well as an increase in FDI over the last decade. On average, FDI is around USD2.5 billion per year. In 2018, we saw an FDI of USD2.513 billion. </p><h4>What are the most pressing challenges that the country still needs to face?</h4><p>One of the main challenges is improving competitiveness to promote access to other markets in terms of exports. Additionally, there is a governmental plan to promote 19 new measures to get more competitiveness in our exports. We are also making numerous efforts to improve education and develop new technologies. This can serve as a way to give more opportunities to young people. We also want to maintain local conditions to promote FDI and growth in the country. The Central Bank has a mandate to maintain a stable monetary system, keeping control over inflation, maintaining currency levels that do not impact the markets, and supporting a healthy financial system. Right now, the financial system in the country enjoys high levels of capitalization and solvency. In terms of our strategies for maintaining macroeconomic stability, we have a proven monetary policy based on the inflation targeting regime that we started in 2012. We also have prudent fiscal management, and we have seen consolidation across fiscal accounts. These two policy arms are working together to promote and maintain stability within the Dominican Republic. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies contributed to your recent upgrade to BBB+ rating?</h4><p>Due to our more than 25 years of experience in the regional market and our philosophy of always having our clients' best interest at heart, we have established an active treasury parameter within a risk management scheme. We were pioneers in the country and have been present since the beginning of the Dominican Republic's securities market. The recent upgrade to BBB+ rating is a direct result of the work we have been doing over the past 12 years. Moving forward, our successful strategy and philosophy will not change. </p><h4>Where do you see the most opportunity for JMMB?</h4><p>We started diversifying when we began opening different lines of business. We have been shaping the industry with our retirement fund. We have positioned ourselves ahead of the competition due to the services we provide and our loyalty program. Notably, AFP JMMB BDI achieved the highest yield results at the closing of December 2018, as well as January and February 2019, providing the highest return rate for our affiliates' retirement savings. This data was presented by the Pension Superintendence (SIPEN), the Dominican Authority for Pension Funds Management. If our affiliates stay with us in the long run, they will recover money that many other pension fund administrators (AFPs) do not. The idea is to diversify the risk for the company and generate different business, given the uncertain times for some emerging markets. This way we are able to cover our clients through their life cycle thanks to our wide range of products, from savings accounts to products for investors.</p><h4>What is your outlook for private pension funds in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>There are a number of benefits to creating a retirement fund, even considering that many Latinos do not generally like to save. The regulator is starting to pressure other AFPs because we started to talk about issues that have long been ignored. Retirement funds are the best way to save because the money is protected and in your name; the administrator may change, but the fund is always yours. We are trying to educate people on the importance of AFPs, and we do this in many ways. We have monthly statements, a webpage, a monthly email newsletter, and in our sales pitch, we explain the importance of having a fund like this. There are thousands of people who don't have an accidental insurance or have died without their right to receive their pension, for themselves and their families. The regulators now ask for information about beneficiaries if the client dies. This is something that happened because we brought up the issue. Moreover, this allows the financing of different economic activities, like infrastructure projects or public housing. These funds are stable long-term investments that benefit not only the client but the entire country.</p><h4>How do you expect your client portfolio to evolve in the short term, and what type of clients are you interested in?</h4><p>We serve all types of clients, including individuals, retail, and corporations. Our new target over the next two-to-three years is SMEs. We expect these sectors to grow in the short term. We also want to increase our relationship with high-net worth individuals. </p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2020?</h4><p>We know that the Dominican Republic's economy is growing. We plan to take advantage of this opportunity and continue to grow our business. We expect to see an improvement in the levels of liquidity, and thus in the levels of consumer optimism, which leads to people spending more money. 2020 is an election year, and we have to pay attention to public sentiment because people are more cautious in election years. Investments tend to slow down, and the growth of the country will be a little slower. The government has the opportunity to make some investments on its own to keep the economy running. We believe 2019 will be a harvest year. We are going to reap what we have sowed in previous years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

In addition, over the years several local media outlets have established a presence in the market, and some of them represent important chains and publishing houses. The Dominican Republic is a small country despite having one of the highest economic growth rates in Latin America. The country's advertising sector concentrates on two sectors: retail and telecommunications, followed by alcoholic beverages, which are increasingly subject to tax regulations. International investors and the local business community have shown great interest in investing to promote tourism and renewable energies, especially wind and solar. Given the country's climate, geographical location, and political stability, the market represents attractive opportunities for those interested in the tourism and energy sectors.</p><h4>How is Revista Mercado planning to face upcoming challenges in the industry? </h4><p>With 25 years of experience, Revista Mercado has positioned itself as a leader on the back of consistence quality work and the objectivity of the business journalism that develops its editorial and commercial team. Revista Mercado has now joined its corporate events unit and digital platform. The local media landscape presents a great challenge for traditional media, which depend on large structures that are no longer profitable. Thus, the traditional press is now forced to reinvent itself, following the latest trends and changes in the field of media across the world.</p><h4>What is Mercado's outlook for 2019? </h4><p>2019 is an extremely important year for Mercado and Mercado Media Network Magazine because of the development of the company's Mercado Exchange unit and the advent of new editorial projects. The consolidation of Mercado's digital platform continues to be one of its great challenges. To tackle that and other challenges, we have developed a cross-border strategy to capture the interest of the Spanish-speaking business community. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your relocation of regional headquarters to Colombia changed Coca-Cola's regional operations?</h4><p>We had several objectives, the first being to be based in our biggest market with the greatest opportunities. Colombia's time has come, and locating the sector hub here was in the best interest of our company and its associates. We still have a hub in San José, Costa Rica, and spread the Board of Directors across those two hubs. There is a great talent pool available in Colombia. Meanwhile, Latin America accounts for a third of the company's global business and ranks among the top 25 countries in the world, though we intend to make it bigger still. These factors all played a role in our decision to relocate. We saw a steady increase in the volume of sales in 2018. We are still on a learning curve as we progress toward becoming a total beverage company. In 2018, the trademark brand grew at a healthy rate, in particular our Sin Azucar, or sugar-free variant. We have launched close to 40 products and reformulated about 70% of them. Some worked really well, others less so. This is the learning aspect, where we listen to the consumer, make quick tests and reformulations, and repackage accordingly. The World Cup activation in 2018 was fantastic. As a company with over 30 years in the market, we need to be a little less anxious and better learn from the market without holding back. We also need to learn and experiment just as start-ups do. With that in mind, my number-one goal for 2019 is to see more empowered associates that feel free to experiment and adapt. With empowered associates comes greater innovation and more differentiation in processes for each aspect of the business.</p><h4>How is Coca-Cola using new technology to revolutionize its processes?</h4><p>We have a co-generation project in Colombia with Air Liquide for power and CO2 to make a plant virtually self-sustaining. We are using technology to also increase the percentage of recycled plastic in our bottles. In Colombia, 42% of the plastic in every bottle on the market is recycled PET. This is one of the highest percentages in the world, and we continue to test technologies to drive that. In 2018, we made a global commitment called World Without Waste. We aim to collect and recycle plastic containers equivalent to the amount we produce, and we are well on our way to achieving that. We continue to experiment with technologies in the recuperation of plastic and are specifically more ahead in the recyclability of our packages. Another way in which we use technology to change the way we do things is by working with start-ups and food aggregators, such as Rappi. Our team associated with that is engaged and coming up with new ways to deliver and sell Coca-Cola products, including AdeS, our soy-based beverage, and Frutal, a nectar we launched last year. There is considerable work being done leveraging technology. We also work to engage customers in a digital world, encouraging them to become digital natives, and progress there has been brisk. We have even hired a vice president of digital with a background in the telecoms industry that is helping us draft a plan to address and capture that opportunity. Coca-Cola is the most ubiquitous product in the world, and we want to ensure its presence remains on all platforms. At the close of 2018, 300,000 consumers had downloaded an application that allows them to experience Coca-Cola activities and products. We are testing the app now and learning a lot through consumer engagement. We are testing across Latin America, not just in Colombia, and have created a digital council for the region. With regard to digital marketing, there are many opportunities there to monetize. It is not only important to connect, but also to take a consumer to the product, ensuring the technology provides the consumer with a sample. This hopefully closes the loop so a prospective consumer becomes a part of your consumer base. Technology can help by removing barriers and by rendering processes seamless, especially in creating a consumer base. </p><h4>How is Coca-Cola responding to the changing market demand for new, healthier, products?</h4><p>What we do best is listen to consumers. They want beverages that taste good, but also want a variety depending on their preference at any given point. And that is what we are doing. We have reformulated our portfolio, 35% of which now corresponds to lower sugar or sugar-free variants. Many Coca-Cola trademark consumers actually like the red and may want an original taste Coca-Cola; they do not want to be disappointed with the flavor. Even our juices have a low sugar content. From the get go, new products reflect consumers' wishes. We want our juices to mostly have sugars from the juice base, and not added sugars, as well as taste good. The importance of the whole innovation process is that consumers change and look for new variety while maintaining their desire to have something that tastes good. We underwent a new process that prioritized effectiveness and have found that when we focus on fewer, bigger, and bolder bets we do better than when we are spread across different efforts that may dilute our energy and investments. A perfect example is the Red Coke No Sugar instead of Coke Zero. Instead of spending money branding many different brands, we have built one brand, called Coca-Cola with Variants. It is part of being more effective, while at the same time being more efficient, because we are marketing one brand instead of three. Over 60% of consumers thought that Coke Zero had sugar. Our CEO has also spoken of 'killing zombies;' the zombies in Coca-Cola are all the little brands and products that exist due to inertia. In this region, we have identified over 100 zombies. We are in the process of killing about 40 of those and no longer want to waste resources on brands that do not generate growth. </p><h4>What will be the next big, bold bet for Coca-Cola in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We are focusing on making our products available, both original and no sugar, to empower the customer in their decision and remind them that both are always available. We are betting strongly on returnability, so will soon launch a campaign that promotes the reuse of our glass bottles in synergy with our World Without Waste initiative. 23% of our portfolio is already returnable, a figure we intend to increase.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the Emirates Foundation?</h4><p>The Emirates Foundation was created by the Government of Abu Dhabi, but works across the whole UAE. We are focused on equipping Emirati youth for the future through several flagship programs designed on the basis of regular, rigorous research that we conduct around the country every three years. Our largest program concerns building a culture of volunteerism within the UAE and creating opportunities for youth to give back to their society in a structured manner. Volunteerism is a great way to develop skills, build your networks, get access to job opportunities and develop self-esteem and soft skills. Ours is now the biggest volunteering program within the UAE. Its centerpiece is Voluneeters.ae, an online government platform managed by Emirates Foundation that coordinates volunteering activities. Another major Emirates Foundation focus is entrepreneurship, particularly social entrepreneurship, which is a major priority of the government. We have developed training programs, prizes, and partnerships with various entities geared towards promoting entrepreneurship and incubating the projects of youth entrepreneurs. Our main priority, however, is equipping youth well in advance (between ages 15 and 17) with the skills they need to create their own enterprises one day. For the past eight years, Emirates Foundation has invested in a program called Think Science, which is now the region's biggest youth science and technology fair, almost equivalent in scale to ISEF in the United States. In 2019, we had 4,000 submissions from the UAE alone, and in 2020 we are planning to scale it up to become a truly global science competition. Several years ago, research showed us that more work has to be done in the area of promoting financial literacy among young people—not just in the UAE, but globally. Emirates Foundation decided to create a UAE-wide financial literacy program called 'Esref Sah,' which in Arabic means “spend right,“ and this is precisely the message it promotes to young people. We provide mentors and workshops, conduct awareness campaigns, and work with the education authorities to integrate financial literacy into the moral curriculum of Emirati schools. We recently completed the most comprehensive youth survey that has ever been conducted in the UAE, called the National Youth Index.  When it is published, the index will provide important insights to various entities across government and society on what the country's youth want and need, making initiatives for the youth more targeted and impactful.</p><h4>What are the most important ways that young Emiratis can prepare for the job market of the future?</h4><p>Emirates Foundation focuses on the workforce of tomorrow, the youth, and for that demographic we believe that adaptability—navigating the complexity of the future and reading the opportunities available around you—is the skill they will need the most. Soft skills, like adaptability, are always on the top of the list because they are not really the core focus of the formal educational system, so as a foundation we try to fill that gap. Other, related soft skills that we emphasize include interpersonal skills, boosting self-esteem, and leadership skills. Within the Emirates there are no hard and fast rules about career paths. With the right soft skills, you can become a leader in different sectors. We are constantly assessing the future skills needed in the Emirati market by reading publications, attending conferences, and consulting decision-makers and thought leaders. Our partners in the private sector are also very helpful. Our collaborations with private sector partners do a lot for the broader national effort of 'Emiratization' because employers sometimes have difficulty finding the right local candidates for their openings, and our huge database of youth across the UAE helps to bridge the gap. </p><h4>How would you assess the current state of environmental awareness among the youth in the UAE?</h4><p>Environmental awareness has certainly grown as a whole across the UAE, especially among our youth. Our Think Science competition for youth innovators involves government entities presenting an array of environmental and social issues to the participants. The students must propose solutions to these issues. I have been super impressed with the level of awareness and curiosity from our young people. They can articulate issues such as climate change and resource scarcity. Some were even able to link these challenges to the national strategies in place to address them. There is a willingness among younger people to be active participants in society and to be part of the solution to environmental challenges. </p><h4>What are some of the ways in which the private sector is involved with Emirates Foundation's work? </h4><p>Emirates Foundation projects are 100% funded by the private sector. In 2015 we created an endowment fund based on private sector contributions, which was then matched by the government as gesture of encouragement. In addition to funding, we also rely on the business community for technical and advisory support. Many private sector entities also have a passion for our entrepreneurship program 'KAF'AT' and supply funding for this. For example, we have a partnership with Google whereby they provide our digital marketing content. Shell has a program called Explorer that is focuses on building entrepreneurial skills and teaching young people how to tackle problems being faced in the real world. Facebook also has a program called She Means Business, which encourages female entrepreneurship through participation in digital spaces. Similarly, we have entered into another program with UPS which seek to help women bring their products to the export market. </p><h4>What does the Emirates Foundation offer to companies looking to integrate better into the UAE market?</h4><p>The Emirates foundation helps new businesses in the UAE to better understand how they can socially invest within UAE society by acting as an information source for them. Moreover, the foundation provides advice on where to invest and how investments can link to the national strategy. Our board consists of ministers and members of the Royal family. We are well connected and aim to ensure that investments are well measured, impactful, and properly directed. The Emirates Foundation has been successful in its partnerships because it provides organizations looking to undertake social development initiatives with a benchmarked system with a clear recognition of return on investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[wael-el-kabbany-managing-director-enterprise-mea-microsoft]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about Microsoft's positioning within the UAE and MENA IT sectors?</h4><p>Microsoft has been in the region for decades and has been a significant contributor towards the technological advancement of the region. Our goal is to enable businesses and governments to use IT services to deliver on their objectives and transform their societies. MENA covers a large area, with pockets that are as advanced and maybe even more advanced than other regions. Some of our customers here, in government as well as enterprise, are using cutting-edge technologies that Microsoft itself uses in developing its own product sets globally. There are locations where we are working predominantly on the infrastructure layer, helping to build a vibrant IT base that can act as a springboard for national development and close skills or education gaps. In other, more advanced locations, like the UAE, we are working with local enterprises and government institutions to help them adopt today's most transformative technologies, from IoT, AI, and blockchain and quantum computing. Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), for example, has adopted Microsoft AI, Mixed Reality and other cloud computing solutions to transform their service delivery and reinvent the customer experience.  DEWA is also collaborating with Microsoft and exploring the use of quantum computing. Another example is Majid Al Futtaim, which is reimagining its entire customer experience by adopting AI at the core of their business to analyze data insights. Overall, we are well positioned in a market that is keen to adopt the most advanced technology solutions.</p><h4>What impact does investing in advanced technologies have on a company's bottom line in the Middle East, and what is Microsoft doing to ensure that such investments pay off?</h4><p>Microsoft has seen some cases with a number of our key customers, as well as government agencies, where adopting our cloud architecture results in an immediate benefit to their bottom line. However, that is not the most exciting part. The real benefit is when our customers' adoption of cloud technologies transforms their policies, their interaction with their customers, and ultimately their whole business model. That is when we see them really disrupt their markets, and give themselves what I call a 'risk insurance certificate' against being disrupted by competitors and other industries. We have great examples of disruption, from banking to insurance and even agriculture, in companies that have really sought to use these technologies not just for immediate cost-savings, but to really affect their customers and the societies in which they are operating.</p><h4>How can large corporations like Microsoft help companies alleviate cyber-fatigue and prepare better for cloud adoption?</h4><p>One of the biggest inhibitors to adopting and embracing new technology is a lack of necessary, prerequisite skills. We are sharing something we call the cloud-readiness model or the cloud-adoption framework, which helps enterprises and governments examine their readiness for adoption. We have also embarked on a number of activities over the past few years, including Microsoft Cloud Society, an online education and up-skilling portal that helps individuals and corporations educate their employees on cloud skills. With Etihad Airways, we've helped to create an AI Academy to train their employees — not just the IT teams, but other employees as well — in understanding AI and embracing new technology in their daily business. These kinds of initiatives, once carried out in an adequate and scalable way, have a massive impact end-to-end.</p><h4>Have you seen any improvement in the cost ratios of connectivity in the Gulf in recent years?</h4><p>In general, I would say the GCC's international data and voice connectivity cost ratios are competitive. Security and reliability costs can create challenges business progress but at the same time these are opportunities for other industry players to come up with cost effective solutions. o the whole, we have seen organizations compensate for a lot of those infrastructure costs through cloud security adoption and building cloud-based reliability models on an enterprise level.</p><h4>How would you rate the GCC's progress on its regulatory clarity with respect to cloud computing, and what kinds of improvements would you recommend to the regulatory environment?</h4><p>I would say that there is decent progress, not only in the UAE, but across the GCC. Kuwait, for example, recently adopted the Cloud Act. We have also seen a number of governments adopting cloud-first policies, which was never the case two or three years ago. The question in the Gulf is no longer about whether we should embrace or work on the cloud, but rather about how we can do it and how we can create the best model of adoption, including associated legal frameworks. It is no longer a matter of 'if,' but 'how.'</p><h4>What do you see as the role of the private sector here in the UAE in democratizing AI and delivering its benefits correctly?</h4><p>I would compare the role of AI in democratizing information today to the role of the printing press in the 15th century. We are lucky to be in this era and to witness this type of change. The word 'democratizing' is key in AI because we have to ensure that we are making AI for every individual and every government or organization, regardless of their size. That is why we are on a mission to democratize AI. That mission is founded on driving AI adoption in a fair, sustainable, and scalable way, including with our 17,800 partners in the MENA region. We want to help them to develop their applications and services using Microsoft's AI engine, so that it can reach the public in an ethical, fair, and scalable manner.</p><hr><hr>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[tunde-coker-managing-director-rack-centre]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the competitive advantage of Rack Centre?</h4><p>There are a few aspects to Rack Centre's competitive advantage.  Carrier or Network neutrality and comprehensive interconnectivity; Rack Centre is the leading network-neutral data centre in West Africa. Network, or carrier neutral companies are not owned by any one carrier or internet service provider but instead can build multi-carrier ecosystems where carriers can coexist and interact, and customers have seamless access to all the carriers.  All the undersea cables serving the Atlantic coast are directly connected to Rack Centre, so, every country on the Atlantic coast of Africa is directly connected to Rack Centre.  The Internet Exchange Point of Nigeria operates within Rack Centre, as does the regional internet exchange point for West Africa, under a mandate from the Africa Union. This ensures Internet traffic is localised in Nigeria or within West Africa as required, significantly enhancing the performance of the Internet. Nigeria's geophysical location is an advantage, because it is halfway in terms of the latency of data traffic between South Africa and Europe. It is a fantastic location for connecting Africa and Nigeria to the world.  Quality and reliability; since its launch in October 2013, Rack Centre has operated with 100% uptime, with not a second of downtime.  Rack Centre was the first Carrier Neutral Data Centre in Africa to be Tier III Constructed Facility Certified by the Uptime Institute, the global authority on data centre quality.  This intrinsic quality has also been acknowledged by the wide range of international awards and accolades Rack Centre has received, so our customers can rest, assured of the quality of hosting.  Indeed, I was recognised with the Africa Trailblazer Award by the Uptime Institute in July 2018.  Cloud services; we now offer major Cloud platforms in the Rack Centre 'Cloud on Ground' ecosystem.  This means customers can host data locally in Nigeria, while enjoying the benefits of leading Cloud platforms operating from Rack Centre, ensuring companies meet local data hosting requirements, while enjoying the benefits of world-class Cloud services.  </p><p>What are the benefits of co-locating and outsourcing infrastructure?</p><p>The data centre underpins the reliability of IT systems and if the hosting facility is down, either in house or outsourced, then the business is down, with significant negative or catastrophic reputational, financial and customer experience impact.  It is therefore essential to have reliable hosting.  Through colocation, companies can expend scarce capital on core business and earning assets.  Imagine not having to think about your data centre power 24/7 and being able to focus time and capital on running and expanding the core business.  We are now seeing that the most successful companies outsource and are discerning by outsourcing to reputable reliable providers.  With our comprehensive interconnectivity, companies that host at Rack Centre can save up to 30% on their networking costs as our clients have access to the ecosystem of interconnection.  A company can go live quickly and can scale up or down in an elastic manner.  Imagine having to wait 18 months for your data centre to be built or expanded before you can grow your company?  Your competitors that are outsources leave you standing.  That is why the most agile companies outsource to high quality providers.  Lastly, peace of mind, focusing on core business knowing that their core critical IT assets are in the best place at assessed global standards. Our intention is to have a footprint across Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><h4>How have businesses in Nigeria embraced the concept of data centres?</h4><p>It has been quite a journey and a challenge to raise awareness, and it takes time to build the reputation of trust and efficiency.  That I believe is by and large achieved, and Rack Centre's reputation is now not just Nigerian or African, but global.  We are now a leading globally recognised brand located in Africa.  Some in the past elected to host abroad due to the absence of local world class quality, and this has now changed.  We now also have the competitive environment as businesses are increasingly driven and dependent on efficient and reliable IT.  We now have the top banks in the country and pan-African banks hosting here, as well as all the leading telecommunication companies hosted, and/or, connected. Companies are now leveraging the benefits of Cloud services.  With our increasing ecosystem of leading global Cloud platforms and services hosted in Rack Centre, it is now possible to exploit these services within the country.  This will become a significant growth area, in particular for the professions SMEs, such as accountancy firms, architects, hospitals, educational establishments, etc.  You can pay as you grow for these services.  Businesses in Nigeria are now embracing outsourcing hosting and leveraging Cloud services locally.  This is bound to increase with enforcement of sovereign data laws where country data must be hosted locally.</p><h4>How would you assess the data centre space in Nigeria?</h4><p>The market is at an inflexion point of significant growth.  To date, the availability and demand has just not been in line with the size of the economy; but that is now changing.  Technology is playing an increasingly strong role in the economy as a direct proportion of GDP, and even more significantly the indirect impact on the larger proportion of GDP.  The key players in the market will have to rapidly expand capacity to generate and also meet demand; we certainly will.  We will deliver multiple high-quality locations in the market over the next few years.  We assessed the market capacity pessimistically to be 45MW of IT power demand a couple of years ago.  We are serving only less than 10% of that potential capacity with currently installed capacity. 2019 should be the tipping point year for significant growth as the Nigerian economy needs it.</p><h4>What do you expect for the Rack Centre in 2019?</h4><p>We are expanding, and 2019 will be an exciting and busy year for us because of the strong trajectory toward our strategic capacity plan. We will double our capacity, and then commence the doubling of that capacity again.  Our customers want us in multiple locations for disaster recovery, and we will do that in Lagos and elsewhere in the country.  We also have growth to other African countries in our expansion plans.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Self-sufficiency in Refining Products]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[segun-adebutu-chairman-petrolex]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Petrolex was founded in 2007, but only came under the spotlight in 2015 when you made announcements for major projects. What was the reason behind this?</h4><p>It was a matter of being ready to transform Nigeria. The company prioritizes organic growth; after spotting an opportunity during my late 20s, I started trading small batches of petroleum products, which powered electrical generators in homes and industries across Nigeria. After facing congestion and distribution issues during the initial stages, I concluded that there is a need to create a company in order to solve the issues at hand. At that time, Storage and Distribution (S&amp;D) seemed to be the best area to evolve into, and also the easiest in terms of capital. I had a eureka moment around eight years ago when I found the ideal place to set up an S&amp;D facility in Ibafo, which is on the border between Ogun and Lagos. After setting the foundation, I started real estate acquisition in 2010 and block construction in 2013; the company received its first cargo in 2Q2018. Equally important, we were able to acquire a refinery license. At present, we have a depot with a total capacity of for 200 million liters, which is the largest depot for petroleum products in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><h4>Can tell us more about your tank, which PWC valued at USD330 million, and how did you finance the investment?</h4><p>Notably, there was a revised valuation which is now worth more than USD400 million. The key ingredient that went into financing it was sheer hard work. While we did raise some funds from local banks because of a debt-equity split, the majority of the funds were generated internally, and, therefore, it took five-eight years to develop the resources. Our plan it to reinvest our profits in the business so the company can grow in size and launch an IPO.</p><h4>What is the comparative advantage of your tank versus the existing ones in the country? Can you charge a premium for providing an alternative to the Apapa congestion?</h4><p>Our tank's storage capacity is about 60% of the competition's combined capacity. Economies of scale set in, and it is perfectly suited for overcoming traditional deficiencies in the market in a profitable manner. Congestion and challenges in terms of loading and offloading in Apapa push the average turnaround for a tanker to around three days, whereas in Ibafo, it is about three hours. Eventually, we want our business to sell itself, and at the right time we will open the premium, but since we recently entered the market, we must be competitive, even if that means giving up an apparent income stream to attract business. In a year's time, when we have a fuller balance sheet, we can explore other income streams to hit optimum capacity. At present, we are handling 30,000-60,000 tons every four-six weeks, but we have the capacity to turn around twice the storage capacity of 300 million liters.</p><h4>The success of your tank partly stems from the failure of Apapa, as you provide an alternative route for your petroleum products. If the situation in Apapa was dramatically improved, would that impact your business model?</h4><p>There is an average of 3,000 trucks that use the facilities in Apapa, so if we capture even 10-20% share of the market, congestion will be reduced by 300-600 trucks in Apapa. Even if the situation in Apapa is dramatically improved in 10 years' time, we will be able to maintain our edge through improved efficiencies and growing demand.</p><h4>What is the funding model for the LPG plant and fertilizer plant?</h4><p>We keep our books clean and professional because our end goal is to go public. To that end, we are entering into strategic partnerships with companies; various groups have approached us to buy into our existing facilities. While we are ready to form partnerships in some branches of our business, we want to keep those operations separate that are projected to grow massively over the next five years.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the refinery?</h4><p>I have a refinery license for 250,000 barrels, but I do not plant to rollout 250,000 all at once. It is easier and less costly to develop in stages as its possible to expand through profits. This is why our first phase is only limited to 20,000 barrels while our second phase will double the number of barrels. Thereafter, we will reinvest profits and reach our target of 250,000 barrels. All the refineries in Nigeria are government owned and since ours is the first privately-owned refinery, we must approach the business with a certain level of caution.</p><h4>Why is there such little activity in the refining space? </h4><p>The biggest reason is that operating a refinery is a long-term investment. At the same time, since local banks require yearly ROI, it is difficult to arrange finances. Anywhere between three-seven years are required for a refinery to generate healthy cash flow and the majority of Nigerians are looking for quicker returns.</p><h4>When do you think Nigeria can achieve self-sufficiency in refining products?</h4><p>There is a possibility to develop local refining capability that can provide for the Nigerian fuel demand. There are sectors of the economy that are untapped, such as oil sands, mineral, lithium. Such targets take time and it will be at least four years until we reach bankable feasibility. For a long time, Nigeria has been an import-based country, it will take time to change this culture, but we can achieve it through a collective effort. The only way to achieve this is through long-term infrastructure that provides for the development of an internal market.</p><h4>What do you expect for Petrolex in 2019?</h4><p>The first phase of the refinery, which is essentially the storage tank, will take time and resources. We have a lot on our plate for the coming year, and we are confident and optimistic.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What policies and measures have you implemented to boost commerce and trade in Kano State?</h4><p>We recently enacted several policies and established relevant vehicles to ensure their implementation. Significant successes have been recorded in several spheres. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje OFR, the Executive Governor, has been leading a campaign to improve the ease of doing business in the state, thereby attracting significant inflow of investments both from other parts of Nigeria and foreign countries. Kano was instrumental in moving up Nigeria's rank on the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business report from 169 to 145 in 2017, for which it earned an award from the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC). Some of the major policy developments include the automation of the registration of business premises, the automation of acquiring land titles, the appointment of consultants for Kano Urban Planning and Development Authority (KNUPDA) to facilitate building approvals, supervision, and certification, the establishment of special magistrates courts to address small claims and dispute resolutions, and the establishment of the Kano Investments Promotion Agency. Other measures include the development of an integrated international market, the Kano Economic City (KEC), established under a PPP arrangement between the state and foremost construction company Brains &amp; Hammers. We have also provided ultra-modern shops for traders and improved access to roads, flyovers, and underpasses to improve movability across the state. The governor was honored for being the most security-conscious and responsive governor.</p><h4>You have emphasized the importance of PPPs to grow the economy. How and where do you seek such partnerships, and in which sectors would you welcome them the most?</h4><p>We have a special agency for the promotion of PPPs, the Kano Investments Promotion Agency (KANINVEST), and we also appointed a hybrid state standing committee for investments advisory committee headed by His Highness, the Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II. Areas of special interest for PPPs include the development of new markets, energy, cluster development, solid minerals, entrepreneurship development, and skills acquisition.</p><h4>Which sectors present the highest potential for growth over the next few years and the largest investment opportunities?</h4><p>We see the largest investment opportunities in the industrial and manufacturing sectors, in the cluster development of SMEs as well as the exploration of solid minerals. However, identifying and formalizing the informal sectors of the economy is also a priority as it can also be an important source of revenue.</p><h4>You are passionate about developing the potential of Kano's deep cultural heritage and tourism. What measures are you undertaking to place Kano on the regional tourism map?</h4><p>Our annual Sallah festivities can promote the image of Kano State as a tourism and cultural center. Dr. Ganduje has appointed a standing committee under my chairmanship for the upgrade of the Durbar festivities, which has been adjudged as the second-largest assemblage of horses in the world. Also, we are committed to upgrading all the preexisting tourist attractions such as the Dala, the Goron Dutse leather works, the Tiga Rock Cattles Hotel located at Tudun Wada LGA, the RuRum Resort Center, the Dawakin Tofa pottery centers, Minjibir weaving village, and Kano State's diverse wildlife. We also plan to reposition the Magwan and Daula hotels to increase their attractiveness. To boost tourism, we are also working to attract more international flights to Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport</p><h4>What is your outlook for Kano State in 2019?</h4><p>Our mission and vision for 2019 is clear: we are determined to make Kano a major commercial hub and tourism destination in Africa. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the measures implemented by the government of Kano to improve the economy since you entered office?</h4><p>It has been a difficult time for Nigeria due to the low oil prices, and the President was determined to foster agriculture production to reduce food imports. We needed to develop our internal revenue in order to develop our economy, and we had to reform the system by revamping the board of internal revenue, which used to be handled by government officials. That was not efficient enough and suffered from corruption. We created a board for collections that employed young, educated, and well-motivated graduates and made it independent. We also established an independent tax collection body to expand the tax net. As for agriculture, we held various meetings with farmers associations to identify farmers' main issues. Most farmers were not producing at a profitable rate, which discouraged them. They imported rice, wheat, and tomato paste, for example, at lower prices than what it took to produce. The federal government had to ban the imports of certain foods to protect them. We provided NGN100 million (USD275,000) for the purchase of improved seeds, which has increased participation. Another issue was with fertilizers, which were scarce and, therefore, expensive. We provided new machinery to a local fertilizer company, serviced its old ones, and built up new management. Now, we are home to the largest fertilizer producer in northern Nigeria.</p><h4>As Kano increasingly becomes a megacity, how will it overcome the associated socioeconomic challenges?</h4><p>In order to make it a true megacity, we have to look into the transportation system and road network. We have identified some areas that see a great deal of traffic congestion. We have entered into an agreement with a consulting firm to review the city's master plan that will hopefully generate a better plan for a well-articulated road network, drainage network, and the type of infrastructure we need to provide. Another problem that a megacity faces is unemployment. We have undertaken the collection of data on the number of unemployed and the type of unemployment in the city. In the short term, we provide skills to the youth through institutions. We also offer empowerment through different equipment. We have identified 24 different types of trades where youth can gain automatic employment if they are able to acquire the correct skills. Correspondingly, we are building a modern skills acquisition center in Kano. Also in the short term, we have entered an agreement with Peugeot Nigeria. We lack well-trained auto mechanics, and we offer scholarships to 75 young people for one year. We also enrolled 100 girls and 50 boys to become automotive engineers. All 150 graduated without a single drop out. Peugeot will construct new factories with the latest equipment and technology in Kano, and our students will be qualified to work in those areas. </p><h4>What message would you send to the local and international investor community about doing business in Kano State?</h4><p>We have zero tolerance for corruption and created an anti-corruption body that is independent. It has a working relationship with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and we have trained some of the staff. We are building anti-corruption offices across 44 parts of the state. We want to assure investors that action will be taken in cases of corruption. We also make business transactions easy; we have reformed the system for those who require land or documents and have reduced the amount of time it takes. We have also succeeded in reducing the time it takes to get approvals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the agency's main focuses and achievements since being established in 2016?</h4><p>KANINVEST has focused on the role of attracting investment into Kano State. Since its inception in 2016, it has attracted foreign investment in the areas of energy, textile, and solid minerals. In the area of energy, an agreement for the production of 100MW of electricity each has been signed with three companies from the US, Spain, and China. An investment of about USD600 million has been made by Chinese company Rvi Group for a textile industrial park in the state. KANINVEST has also attracted some domestic investors in the area of agro-allied industry and chemicals.</p><h4>Which sectors of Kano's economy present the largest investment opportunities for international investors and the greatest potential for growth over the next few years?</h4><p>Kano State is not endowed with hydrocarbon resources and does not receive revenue from hydrocarbons. This is truly an exception considering the dominance of hydrocarbons in the drive of revenue in Nigeria. KANINVEST is therefore focusing on areas that Kano State has comparative advantages in. In the coming years, KANINVEST will concentrate on attracting global and international investors in the areas of solid minerals, agriculture- and agro-based industries, and large-scale manufacturing due to the huge market in Kano State. We are also making an effort to attract international investors in the energy sector. Furthermore, there are many closed industries in Kano that we are looking at for international investors to acquire and revive for the benefit of the state economy.</p><h4>The Kano State government has embarked on a drive to establish PPPs to drive economic growth. Where and how are you looking for these partnerships, and in which sectors will PPPs be most beneficial?</h4><p>KANINVEST is assisting the Kano state government in sourcing PPP partners in the areas of housing, market development, and other areas that have significant impact on the economy of Kano State. The construction of an ultra-modern market in Kano is being undertaken under a PPP arrangement with Brains &amp; Hammers Company, a Nigerian company involved in the construction of mass housing project in Abuja and Dubai. The development of the market has already reached advanced stages of construction. There are also proposals under consideration for mass housing program under a PPP arrangement. A modern abattoir is also to be constructed by an Egyptian company under a PPP arrangement. There is also a proposal for the production of electricity from waste under the same PPP arrangement, and this is receiving the consideration of the state government.</p><h4>What message would you send to the global investor community about investing in Kano? How are you working toward raising awareness of Kano's investment attractiveness?</h4><p>The main message to the global investor community is to come to Kano and invest. There are vast areas of opportunity for investment, and the Kano state government is willing to provide free land to any investor who comes to Kano to invest. KANINVEST is also prepared to assist the investor with any issues relating to getting federal or state government approvals. KANINVEST has a dedicated website that provides investors with all the information they need to invest in Kano. On certain occasions, KANINVEST has arranged international tours and roadshows to attract investors. Likewise, investors are encouraged and invited to visit Kano to see for themselves the opportunities available. Both the Executive Governor of Kano State and His Highness the Emir of Kano undertake trips to different parts of the world in order to attract investment to Kano. KANINVEST has also printed a special brochure for distribution by all agencies of Kano State that give potential investors a comprehensive run-down of the opportunities for investment.</p><h4>What is your outlook for KANINVEST in 2019?</h4><p>In 2019, KANINVEST will work to ensure the actualization of all previous agreements as well as engaging in other new proposals regarding investment in Kano State. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[waste-into-wealth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the core activities of Owel-Linkso?</h4><p>Our main activities can be classified into two major areas: the gas sector, where we pioneered the first gas distribution company in Nigeria, and the service sector, where we provide a number of engineering and technical services to the oil and gas industry. We started our gas infrastructural development from the distribution end through Gaslink, which we promoted and managed as part of Owel-Linkso Group, until we did a share swap with Oando. We have since moved into the mid-stream with a view to capturing gas at the flare and process and fraction it for distribution, thus creating a vertically integrated operation for gas production and distribution. Consequently, we created two companies: City Gas, which is purely for gas distribution and includes LPG and Gas Train, is operating its first gas processing plant in Delta State and is probably the only independent gas processing company in Nigeria. These infrastructural development initiatives have been supported by our in-house engineering and project management capabilities. We want to develop more gas plants and infrastructure to remain relevant and significant in the sector, while extending services to more companies.</p><h4>What types of services do you provide?</h4><p>We offer engineering, project management, inspection, and certification services through Linkso Nigeria Limited, which has been involved in all major gas projects in the country. Beginning with the Nigeria LNG, we project-managed the development of the 1bcf/d Soku gas plant. We also managed the West African Gas Pipeline and today are managing the Escravos-Lagos gas pipeline. We are not EPC contractors, as it is not our core business, but we do undertake engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM), while we outsource the actual construction and installation of equipment. This we have done a number of times, installing gas plants for clients, including multinationals who, satisfied with our services, choose us to guarantee their deliveries. In all the areas related to gas, we have been involved from conception to the development and operation.</p><h4>What is your involvement with LNG?</h4><p>We are not involved in LNG, though we are interested in it. Currently, we capture gas at the flare and turn waste into wealth. We process gas that would have been flared and produce four products: condensate, which is naphtha; LPG, which is household cooking gas; propane, which we sell to industrial and commercial users or blend with butane as domestic gas; and a clean lean gas, which is piped by the producer to power plants, CNG, and mini-LNG plant operators. In the future, we see opportunities for engaging in the LNG space, which we are still studying and intend to take advantage of.</p><h4>Do you see a great deal of activity and investment coming in gas infrastructure in Nigeria?</h4><p>Yes, it is inevitable. 30 years ago, we started talking about Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK), and if we had gone ahead with the plan, that pipeline would have been commissioned in 1992. However, the politics and policies of the time slowed down gas development. But now, driven by the demand for power, politics is beginning to give way to rational policies leading toward a willing seller and buyer market. Thus, with policy clarity and consistency and the right price and economics, investors are more willing to participate. Investors will invest if they are sure the contract and commercial environment can be trusted. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Has your clientele changed as indigenous companies like yours increased their contribution to the industry?</h4><p>Increased participation of indigenous companies in the oil and gas sector is a government initiative through the local content philosophy (Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board); however, progress has been slow. Makon's clientele has remained essentially the same over the past years. SPDC replaced some of the contracts, one of which was with Eroton Exploration and Production Company Limited. Another contract was with Nigerian Petroleum Development Company, with ND Western as Joint Venture partner. The composition of our clients is still skewed toward IOCs and local indigenous exploration and production players. We bid for projects with both local and international companies. For example, we are working hard to be a part of Nigeria LNG's Train 7 project, and if successful, it would be a major deal for us.</p><h4>How was last year for Makon Group?</h4><p>2018 was a better year for Makon. I understand by my training that debt is cheaper than equity, therefore we utilize debts as a tool for business growth. We are committed to keep servicing our debt. 2017 was a rough year as we could not conclude many of our projects due to cash call challenge, but in 2018 we made remarkable progress with projects such as Egbema NAG/AG Gas plants, Ughelli East, Ughelli West, and Utorogu Gas Projects (3Us), which aims to remove flares from different flow stations. We also made progress on the NLNG Central Control Room upgrade project, which is now in final stages. Previously concluded projects, such as Utorogu NAG2 for ND Western/NPDC JV, which delivers 150 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscfd), are kept up and running.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your projects?</h4><p>Our major projects involve the installation of gas handling and processing plants. Nigeria flares substantial amount of gas, which is bad for the economy. It is also hazardous to the environment, which is why there was a decision to reverse this trend. We have contributed significantly in this regard. Among projects that have been completed are Utorogu NAG2, a 150-MMscfd natural gas handling and processing facility; Bonny AG, a 5-MMscfd gas project; and Adibawa AG, a 5-MMscfd gas project. Other projects such as Alakiri Non-Associated Gas, Egbema Associated Gas and Non-Associated Gas processing plants, and Ughelli East, Ughelli West, and Utorogu Plants are in process at different stages of completion.</p><h4>Going forward, will debt continue to fund further growth?</h4><p>Debt is cheaper than equity, so we will still depend on debt for our operations. As a private company, we endeavor to be prudent to keep our cost at reasonable levels. In terms of raising capital by getting listed on the stage exchange, I cannot disclose if we are considering that route at the moment.</p><h4>How do you assess investment sentiment and activity in Nigeria's oil and gas sector?</h4><p>The government is determined to reduce the burden on its cash calls; this was made clear in the budget assumptions, and we expect it will result in using public-private partnerships to self-fund projects. We welcome this move because it would afford creativity in our business approach. There are numerous upcoming gas projects, which is our area of focus. Notably, Nigeria still has an estimated 165 trillion standard cubic feet of gas, including 75.4 trillion standard cubic feet of non-associated gas. We certainly have ample opportunity for our operations within the country.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2019?</h4><p>Our slogan is “consolidate and expand," and we look to complete three major projects in 2019, with the possibility of signing additional contracts. We want to ensure better brand visibility. We currently have a strong brand that we intend to leverage for better growth. We have a strong workforce with tremendous competence in-house.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the past three years of low prices forced you to optimize your operation?</h4><p>Prices fell in 2015, and six months later was the outage of Trans Forcados Pipeline, so this was a challenge. We were averaging about 10,000bpd at a low-price regime. We had to react quickly, and the first thing we did was to rejig our 2015 and 2016 work programs and reduce operations to a bare minimum. We combined this with also minimizing our OPEX costs. We had to improve efficiency and reduce costs, as our goal at the time was to survive. Finally, by mid 2017 we saw the light at the end of the tunnel, and by the end of 2017 we were back to full production. We were then able to start addressing the quality of our balance sheet, and the results were seen in 1Q2018.</p><h4>What role will your recent USD350-million bond offering play?</h4><p>The entire refinancing package was targeted at two things. The first was to reduce our cost of borrowing with Nigerian banks, which was approaching 12% dollar debt, and about 7% for our revolver with foreign banks. In the aggregate, the combined bond and bank loan gives us a gross debt of USD550 million at a cost that is closer to 8.15%, rather than 12%. Over the next three years, it gives us a great deal of room to accumulate cash, which we can then re-invest. This gives us some money to spend on increased CAPEX. In 2016 and 2017, CAPEX spending was minimal, and we now have to go on a more aggressive spending spree. For 2H2018, we were back to drilling wells, and in 2019 we will increase the number of wells and critical facilities to maintain production and eliminate any drop in production. We will also have a balance sheet strong enough to support any acquisition that falls our way. In addition to organic growth by spending more money on the ground, we are also looking at inorganic growth by acquisition.</p><h4>What role has the government played in the development of the gas sector?</h4><p>The government has done a fantastic job since 2012 to boost domestic demand and capacity to increase domestic supply through the gas master plan. Demand already captures a market-driven price. Any government intervention now will only be in the way; the transition is over and it should only supervise willing buyer and willing seller negotiations rather than impose prices.</p><h4>What is your vision for the year ahead?</h4><p>In 2018, we moved to the beginning of our build stage, which is where we are currently. 2018 and 2019 are years of building up our business, strengthening our balance sheet, and returning to and maintaining profitability. We have told the market that we want to be able to consistently pay dividends and be consistently profitable through growing the business with both oil and gas production and oil and gas reserves. By the end of 2019 we want a large chunk of our future business to be fairly predictable in terms of balance sheet quality, profit, and production. The building blocks in order to do so involves spending more CAPEX in drilling and so on and looking at acquisitions when they are available. We are preparing the balance sheet to be ready for those building blocks so that business will be more solid and predictable in the future no matter where the oil price takes us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How relevant is NLNG to the Nigerian gas sector?</h4><p>NLNG is perhaps the most relevant piece of the Nigerian gas jigsaw puzzle and one of the best-run companies in the world. We have been in operation for 20 years, though we built up our plant capacity from 1999 to 2006. Our vision is to be a global player, helping to build a better Nigeria. To date, we have generated over USD90 billion in revenue and paid more than USD33 billion in dividends to shareholders and an additional USD6 billion in taxes to the federal government. We have also made a significant contribution to the environment. Before NLNG was created, Nigeria was on the ignominious list of gas-flaring nations, right behind Russia, which is still number one. Today, NLNG has helped reduce flaring in the country from about 65% to 20%. We have also contributed heavily to the domestic gas space. Though many think we are only export market-oriented, we are also involved in domestic LPG, or cooking gas. Before we did so, the overall capacity was just 50,000 tons for a country of more than 180 million people. We currently contribute 50% of today's capacity of 500,000 tons. We will continue to push LPG into the country to change the tragic fact that around 100,000 people (predominately women and children) die from smoke inhalation in Nigeria annually.</p><h4>What role does LNG play in your operations versus LPG?</h4><p>Our business is LNG, while LPG is a by-product that occupies only around 5% of production output. We are not just trying to make money; we are trying to help the nation by eliminating gas-flaring in Nigeria, preventing women and children dying from smoke inhalation, and bridging the infrastructure gap that negatively impacts power availability by encouraging the use of LNG in the country. We have power plants but no gas supply, because the infrastructure is poor. The future of Nigeria will be largely underpinned by gas because the energy transition is happening. The world wants more and cleaner energy, which puts pressure in terms of resources. With climate change, we have an advantage as a gas business because the energy transition will accentuate its relevance. It may downplay certain dirtier fuels such as coal, though in the end, it will have to be about the competitiveness of gas.</p><h4>How can Nigeria monetize its huge natural resources?</h4><p>There are countries that wish they had even half the reserves Nigeria has, and had to shut down their LNG plants because they ran out of gas and had no capacity to grow. We, on the other hand, have proven that we can, through what we achieved with Trains 1 to 6. Now, many of the regulatory and fiscal responsibilities need to align in favor of positive investment in gas both for domestic and export. Oil has taken us 50 years, and the next 50 years has to be about gas. Nigeria is a gas nation that also has some oil, so we must make that count, as the future is gas. Industrialization, agriculture, power, and petrochemicals are critical pillars that can be turned around by gas, and until we really strengthen the gas turf, these four elements will not contribute enough to GDP. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since investing in Kainji and Jebba in 2013, what have been your master achievements?</h4><p>We are expected to recover the storage capacity of both plants within five years, a total storage capacity of 1,338MW. When we took over Kainji in November 2013, there was no single generating unit running. We immediately put into place a robust capacity recovery plan and had the plant in place by 2014. We currently have 440MW from Kainji. We could have done better, though there were issues with the market. Our invoices were not paid, which limited our income. The single off-taker in Nigeria is Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET), which buys from us and sells to distribution companies (discos), which in turn are expected to remit the money back to NBET. Discos were not performing, so payments were not delivered. This limited our ability to complete the capacity recovery as planned. We are still in the process of capacity recovery. Of the 1,338MW, we have 922MW available. In addition, we are putting in place an expansion program. Kainji was designed for a storage capacity of 960MW, and there is room for an additional four turbines that can be installed to expand the capacity.</p><h4>Mainstream injected USD26 million to rehabilitate Kainji Plant. How was that funded, and how do you plan to fund your further expansion?</h4><p>We funded the rehabilitation through our own cash flow. Meanwhile, for the expansion program, we are looking at financial and technical partners to recover the investment and day-to-day operations. We seek a partnership in the sense of equity and participation. On the technical side, we expect our partners to have a direct link to or partner that is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or a suitable engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor. We wanted a financing partner and started with African Development Bank, which approved a USD1-million line for us with 20/80 equity and debt. To date, we have paid off the total debt. We intend to continue to use our own income for the capacity recovery through our cash flow, whereas for the expansion we will seek external funding. Today, we contribute 20% to Nigeria's power generation. Both our plants are in the northern central part, along the River Niger. The arrangement is such that generation companies (gencos) do not service a particular area, but our energy is sorted through the grid network. Even the thermal plants that were sold outright still have to sell their energy through the off-taker, NBET. It is an interim arrangement until the market develops. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the alternative evacuation plan affected the business from a cost perspective?</h4><p>We approached that project in an unusual project delivery manner and did not follow the typical project delivery scheme, which creates the design, verifies it, and makes a final design decision, all of which take time. Typically, a project that follows this cycle will deliver between 24 and 36 months, and we did not have that time. We built the aircraft as we were flying it. This is great in the sense that the time to delivery is shorter, though it is risky because that far into project delivery, if something had not been taken care of in the design stage, the entire thing would have to be reworked. We were fortunate, and the bottom line was that the cost of delivering the alternative evacuation system was significantly cheaper than if we had followed the traditional project delivery route. We are already beginning to see returns in terms of value. The only way we make money is by selling crude; whilst the Trans Forcados Pipeline was out, we could not produce crude, as we could not evacuate. Today, we have better up-times with our wells as we do not have to shut down our wells as often as we had to with the oft-vandalized Trans Forcados Pipeline.</p><h4>How was this project financed?</h4><p>When we acquired the asset, most of it had been destroyed as a result of the violence in the Niger Delta. In addition to the shareholder funds that went into acquiring the asset, we had to take out loans to rehabilitate the assets and get them producing again. A great deal of the loans went into that, though we financed the alternative evacuation partly from shareholder funding and partly from the operational costs of the Asset Management Team, a Joint Venture management team between Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Neconde.</p><h4>Do you see gas playing a bigger role in your revenue portfolio in the near future?</h4><p>Our fields Odidi and Jones Creek are extremely rich in gas, and most of the reservoir models we are working with go back many years. We have not done new studies but have good reasons to believe that when we go looking for gas, we will find more.</p><h4>What should be done to improve oil and gas infrastructure in Nigeria?</h4><p>The simple answer is developing new infrastructure and upgrading the existing ones; however, the challenge is doing so. Most of the infrastructure in use today was built by Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and others. Other than the Escravos Lagos pipeline system, the rest were built by IOCs based on long-term economics and justified by ongoing oil projects. We need to find the value proposition for a private operator to invest the large sums of money needed to develop such infrastructure. I say private operator, as I do not think the government should get involved in this. A government has no business doing business. We need to find private operators and give them incentives to carry out the development and manage the infrastructure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is GasInvest's core business?</h4><p>GasInvest is a bespoke natural gas consultancy firm that operates in concert with its sister company, GasHub, a gas distribution, aggregation, and infrastructure company. Both companies started operations in 2016. Across the globe, gas is increasingly taking center stage. Nigeria is set for an explosive growth in the sector, yet its structure is still in its infancy. In essence, as much as there are huge opportunities, investment risks can be high if the sector is not adequately navigated. GasInvest also provides insight into the Nigerian gas market for potential investors, both local and international. We help navigate the complexities of the sector, allowing our clients to understand this new and dynamic space. We target a wide variety of investors, including oil and gas producers looking to monetize gas reserves, downstream operators looking for gas, investors looking to invest in gas infrastructure, or governments looking for gas-based strategies for industrializing. We work closely with the power sector, too.</p><h4>How exactly do you work with the indigenous producers and IOCs?</h4><p>Specifically with producers, our focus has been on helping with strategies to monetize gas through credible market opportunities. We work with clients to co-create markets and advise around making such projects bankable for the purpose of monetizing the gas. Through our network, we have access to a variety of potential market outlets and leverage this access to structure outlets for bankability. The biggest challenge for producers is bankable markets, an area where GasInvest aims to focus. With state governments, we create platforms for industrialization. For example, we advise the Delta state government on gas industrialization. Delta state probably has the largest gas reserves in the country, but its sector is less industrialized. The government is looking for a gas-based energy strategy that can attract manufacturing investment into the state, so we are working with the government to develop an energy blueprint, while simultaneously helping them develop the Kwale Gas Industrial Park, which is intended to be a manufacturing center. The Kwale Industrial Park is also being developed as a leading manufacturing hub to target small to medium scale gas manufacturers, e.g. ceramics, glass, chemicals, and more. Designed to offer world-class levels of energy uptime, it should guarantee 24/7 energy at competitive rates.</p><h4>How would you assess Nigeria's current gas production?</h4><p>The market continues to evolve, though there is still long way to go. A decade ago, the domestic gas price was low, as low as USD0.1/mcf.This was a disincentive to supply growth. Part of the Gas Master Plan effort was to reform the commercials for the domestic market. Today, the domestic market gas price is almost on par with international rates, i.e. at export parity. Often, there is a misconception about export gas receiving higher prices, but this is not true; on the contrary, transfer prices to domestic market are on par or even higher than exporting LNG. The challenge with the domestic market is therefore not pricing, but more payment assurance. The payment track record of purchasers in the domestic market is also poor. Power plants are not paying, and payment guarantees are not working. Investors would rather get paid half price than be promised a full price that never materializes. The focus, therefore, has to be on improving the payment credibility of the market as opposed to price.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide some background to how the concept of Belanova came about and to the hotel's operations since its establishment? </h4><p>The Belanova Apartments and Suites project was conceptualized while visiting similar serviced apartments in France, the UK, the US, and Dubai. The experience sparked the idea of domesticating a truly convenient home away from home. The vision is to be the preferred option in hospitality for our guests, employees, and partners and be synonymous with excellent quality and service, while putting a Nigerian brand on the global radar of the best-known boutique hospitality brands. To pursue this vision, the operations in Belanova were setup by leading professionals in the hospitality industry with close guidance of the board of directors, who are particular on the standards we are looking to achieve. Since the commencement of operations, the board of directors and management of Belanova have diligently implemented our mission, which is to delight every guest by guaranteeing quality accommodation, excellent service, and unique memories, as well as provide dignified means of livelihood for our employees, vendors, and contractors.</p><h4>How do you ensure you maintain an edge over your competition, and what features and services make Belanova stand out? </h4><p>The product we offer is already quite unique on its own as true apartment hotels are not particularly popular in Abuja. Besides, we are conscious of the fact that maintenance culture is the bane of most laudable initiatives in Nigeria and so we prioritize and invest in maintenance to ensure our facilities and services are quality assured at all times. We also realize that globally, the best strategy you can adapt in the hospitality industry is to be customer service oriented and the onus is on us to maintain a high standard in delivering excellent customer service. Therefore, all decisions made at the organization center focus on how much value we are bringing our guests. </p><h4>How would you describe the clientele you aim to target, and what are your main strategies to continue building on your reputation, strengthening the brands and gaining more customers? </h4><p>Our target audience includes global citizens and millennials with discerning taste for a home away from home anywhere from a few weeks to a year. We aim to strengthen the brand and build a reputation by doing the right things right and prioritizing safety and security, customer service, quality and tasty meals, and of course cleanliness.</p><h4>What trends are you observing in the demand for your services and for hospitality in general? What are the peculiarities of the Abuja hospitality (both business and leisure) sector? </h4><p>The Abuja hospitality industry's trend is quite seasonal and responds differentially to government activities, religious festivities, and public holidays. For instance, patronage is quite low during the Ramadan season, but picks up substantially right after. </p><h4>What are some challenges (whether regulatory, logistical, or economy-related) that Nigerian hospitality businesses like Belanova might have to contend with in the near future? What can be done to enhance the hospitality sector in Abuja? </h4><p>I could spend all day talking about challenges we face in the hospitality industry in Nigeria; however, I believe power is one of the more prevalent issues affecting us. We do not have 24/7 electricity supply in Nigeria, and we have to supplement with diesel generators which are quite expensive and harmful to the environment.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Belanova and for the sector in 2019? </h4><p>2019 will really be our first full year of business since commencing operations. During this period, we hope to build a wider clientele base and increase occupancy substantially. This is highly desirable given that a lot of investment has been put down to get to the point we are today, and we are really looking to recoup some of those investments and inch our way toward realizing the dream of making Belanova a global chain. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the impact of the rebranding on Axxela's identity and operations?</h4><p>After 19 years, Oando Gas and Power sold its majority stake to Helios Capital Partners, and we rebranded as Axxela, a convergence of “acceleration and excellence." The financial markets have created new room for us and come to accept the brand and understand what we stand for: excellence in pioneering gas businesses, continued professionalism, and asserting ourselves as the partner of choice to provide energy solutions for industries and other institutions.</p><h4>Axxela has spent USD500 million on gas infrastructure development. How do you make such investments and expand the business in a capital-intensive industry?</h4><p>A great deal of our early growth was project financing from the local markets; however, with the advent of new investors, we are now reaching out to larger international markets and development finance institutions (DFIs). Local interest rates were indeed high, though as we diversified, we managed to bring down the coupon rates. We are an infrastructure company, so we will always need funding; however, all the legacy debts have been paid, and any projects we embark upon today are matched to our current assets. We are constantly on the lookout for new investors, collaborators, and partners, and have broadened our partnership scope beyond just finance.</p><h4>What is Axxela's role in filling the gaps in the gas infrastructure in Nigeria?</h4><p>There are other impediments to the sector's development, though infrastructure is a big gap and the weakest link in the value chain. It is, therefore, an area on which we are concentrating our efforts. The government started out investing heavily, though that has stopped in the last 15-20 years after large projects were completed, and not much has been done domestically because the government cannot do everything. That was an opportunity for Axxela and other companies to fill in the gap. The issues that arise as we build infrastructure are winning the mandates to build the infrastructure, structuring agreements in a manner that works for all parties, and financing the infrastructure. Axxela has been able to create an ecosystem that creates a solution that one can take to the bank. In terms of contribution, Axxela has played a huge role and is one of the largest private sector players in the market. We have built over 240km of gas pipelines and a compressed natural gas plant; we supply over 80 million scf of gas per day, a figure that increases to 100 million if we include our West African businesses. Furthermore, about 400MW of power in Cross River, Port Harcourt, and Lagos, a fifth of what Nigeria generates today, is directly attributed to Axxela. Our impact in terms of GDP and putting money and jobs in people's hands has been clear.</p><h4>What is your take on the regulated gas price regime?</h4><p>Gas is about scale; as you increase the scale, the denominator gets larger, and the average price comes down. That is how we need to protect the gas sector; we cannot let the sector go the way of the power sector, with regulated prices that stunt growth. We should allow the infrastructure to come in, and it will become clear to providers that they need to be competitive. There are many things we can do to push the sector forward; however, price regulation is not one of them. The policy says we will push the market to be as deregulated as possible, and import-parity will ultimately be established. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tourism, arts, and culture are all truly broad sectors. What is your main focus?</h4><p>We are particularly keen on the creative industries and hospitality. We try to be a hub for Lagos's talents, arts, and cultural activities. When we say Lagos, we do not only refer to Lagos Island; Lagos includes other surrounding regions, the same way New York is not just Manhattan. We believe there is talent all over Lagos. The city is blessed to have the Atlantic Ocean on one side and the lagoon on the other. The blueprint document that we recently prepared is going to be particularly important. The Lagos State Tourism Master plan focuses on six essential pillars that the tourism and creative industries stand on. We believe Lagos State's tourism is driven by entertainment and art in the form of festivals, cultural events, and so on. Lagos is the home of Nollywood, the biggest African film industry and the third biggest film industry in the world. Afrobeat originated here. Badagry, a beautiful town in Lagos State, is an important site for the history of slavery in Africa. Our message to tourists is that we can make your visit easy and fun; and we can also help tour operators, travel agencies, and tour guides with their planning to bring in more people. We, as Lagos State Ministry of Tourism, Arts, and Culture, have published a calendar of art events both in print and online to show travel bloggers, journalists, and promoters the planned yearly activities.</p><h4>Does Lagos and the country at large represent a large enough potential tourist base?</h4><p>Lagos is a city of 21 million people—a population larger than that of many countries. If you manage to attract a quarter of the residents to something other than trade and commerce, you will succeed in that activity. The country's population is 190 million. Lagos is one of the most-visited cities in Africa not just because of tourism, but mainly because of commerce. However, it is possible to turn those business travellers into tourists, including medical tourism. The Lagos Fashion Fair, one of the biggest fashion shows in Africa, is yet another attraction. Our job is to give people who come to Lagos for business a reason to stay an extra couple of days to discover the less-known parts of Lagos. The New Afrika Shrine, for example, became an iconic place after President Macron of France visited it. It was also the first place that Seal, the musician of Nigerian descent, visited when he returned to Nigeria after 15 years. In short, we want to engage visitors in more activities than they originally came here for. We are building a museum and developing the Sungbo's Eredo rampart, which have to do with the legend of the Queen of Sheba. It is believed that the amount of sand excavated to build the Sungbo's Eredo wall is more than the amount of sand used in building the pyramids in Egypt, and these stories need to be told.</p><h4>What do you think is needed to increase the quality of Nigerian films?</h4><p>I do not believe our aim should be to become like Hollywood; the aim should be to standardize quality. The Toronto International Nollywood Film Festival acknowledged Nollywood two years ago and eight films from Lagos were selected for red carpet premiers. No city in Africa has achieved a similar feat in the past. There have been measureable improvements since the production of Half of a Yellow Sun in 2013, which went to the Toronto Film Festival and included many Hollywood actors. An increasing number of Nigerian films are making a name for themselves globally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>FOr some time, Nigeria has been making the headlines for all the wrong reasons. The country's name used to be associated with drug and human trafficking, cybercrime, and corruption, which led many to think of the country as unsafe and deeply troubled. Boko Haram and its campaign of terror were not helping the country's international image either. </p><p>At the same time, there is no denying that Nigeria has been a major player in West Africa for as long as anyone can remember, not least due to its sizeable population, booming petroleum industry and large oil reserves, and relatively higher standards of living. Barack Obama once went as far as calling Nigeria the most critical part of the continent, adding that “If Nigeria does not get it right, Africa will really not make more progress."</p><p>Nigeria has seen a number of ambitious rebranding efforts carried out—for instance—by Dora Akunyili, the country's former Minister of Information, among other people, which have definitely been right steps in the right direction in their own time. However, Nigeria's growing soft power seems to be far more effective in changing the country's image than campaigns overseen by government committees.</p><p>The soft power factor that has come into play in recent years and made all the difference in rebranding the country largely draws on Nigeria's music and film industry—commonly referred to as Nollywood. Recently, a well-known Nigerian musician expressed his amazement at hearing Nigerian music during his visit to Iran. Similarly, Nollywood has gone beyond Nigeria's borders, popularizing the Nigerian accent, dressing style, and mannerism. In a sense, “Nigerianness" is already in the process of becoming something desirable rather than a red flag.<br>This growing cultural influence is rebranding the country not only in the region but also in the world—so much so that a positive correlation can be seen between Nollywood's rising popularity and the number of arrivals to Nigeria—which went up by 12% in 2017 to reach an all-time-high of 2 million visitors.</p><p>Once only visited by adventure-seeking backpackers, Nigeria is now also hosting families and mainstream travelers. Indeed, four out of 10 countries with the highest arrivals in Nigeria are outside of Africa; the fact that that British, Indian, Chinese, and American travelers have been heading for Nigeria in great numbers in 2018 is a sign of Nigeria's improved image and growing soft power.</p><p>This is not to say that all issues bedeviling Nigeria have disappeared overnight. The country is still facing pressing problems in areas such as education, food security, transportation, and administrative transparency, which will not go unnoticed by the world. Some might even argue that Nollywood's sensational portrayal of the Nigerian life is doing more harm than good.<br>However, one must remember that the entertainment industry is, more often than not, promoting those very same values which hold the Nigerian society together. The music industry, in particular, is providing a space for a rereading many narratives of life as experienced in Nigeria in an understandable and popular language. </p><p>Although, as with everywhere else, the music industry has its fair share of boastful songs focusing on violence and sex, more and more songs with authentic narratives can be heard these days. It is even conceivable that this retelling of the shared Nigerian experiences in the form of hit songs is functioning as a kind of mass therapy to overcome the traumas—to let go.<br>In an interview with TBY, Falz, a Nigerian rapper and entertainer, emphasized the elements of “story," “message," and “humor" in his hip-hop lyrics—themes which are becoming typical of not only hip-hop but also Nigeria's other well-known music genre: Afrobeat.</p><p>According to Falz, “many things are not in place in Nigeria. We come in contact with these things every day, and as an artist, one is affected by the environment. It is impossible to live somewhere and not draw inspiration from the environment around us. Our voices, as entertainers, are perhaps the loudest right now." In this view, the entertainment industry is not merely contributing to Nigeria's soft power; it is also giving a voice to its people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main challenge for an artist like you to become so successful with a weak infrastructure?</h4><p>First of all, any artist who wants to succeed in Nigeria must have a strong character to overcome the challenging structure here. For me, it was about arranging finances, but fortunately, I met a producer that was interested in my project and brand, so he offered me a recording deal to produce an album. After recording the album, I went straight into the spotlight. A large sum of money is needed to record, promote, and make a video for a song; therefore, it is difficult for upcoming artists that do not have any support.</p><h4>How long did it take for you to be where you are now?</h4><p>My music career started in 2000 and I met a producer in 2005. I worked with him until 2010, when I was able to record my first official single. The majority of artists are only able to make waves in the industry after two albums or 10 songs, but luckily for me, my first single turned out to be a huge hit. </p><h4>How has piracy affected your sales?</h4><p>Piracy is the number-one problem in the music industry because the artist does not make any money out of it. Since there are no ways to eliminate this practice, sometimes it is better to give the album to illegal vendors in order to increase the hype. On a positive note, iTunes has really made things easier for artists and we hope more music-streaming services, such as Spotify and Tidal, will soon start their operations in Nigeria, which would significantly help the local music industry and benefit the artists.</p><h4>Why has the industry not yet evolved into a business with an appropriate structure?</h4><p>There are way too many issues in Nigeria that occupy people's minds, meaning we need to adopt a more serious approach in order to evolve.</p><h4>You sing mostly in Yoruba; do you think that could be a constraint for international markets?</h4><p>That is not true because music breaches all boundaries. For example, I do not understand the language in which Daddy Yankee sings but I love his music. So, I don't think language is a barrier, as long as the music is appealing to the soul and ears. </p><h4>Are you planning to capitalize on featuring more international artists in your songs?</h4><p>I am still working on my plans while trying to discover myself some more and building my own brand. I want people to love my songs for what they are and not because I did some collaboration with a famous artist; however, if I have the opportunity to work with international artists, I would definitely grab it.</p><h4>Whose role is it to develop the music industry in Nigeria?</h4><p>In my view, the government has a major role, because at the end of the day, we musicians are paying taxes. Although the government is not entirely responsible, it can help in terms of investors, people who can help develop the industry, and companies who can build the structure for the Nigerian music industry.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>I have recently signed a couple of artists, Lyta, Limerick, Fire Boy, Picazo &amp; Yomi Ika to my record label, so 2019 is going to be mostly about putting the record out there and pushing their talent for more media exposure. For this project I will be focused on the production side but it might include some singles from me as well as more collaborations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How challenging has it been to become successful and to create your own brand in the Nigerian environment?</h4><p>It has been tough, as there are many challenges in the industry. This is such a saturated market; we are blessed with an astonishing amount of talent, so it is tough for anyone to succeed. What made me stand out was my uniqueness. I have always been different. My music is typically hip-hop, but with a contemporary twist. I always infuse traditional Nigerian sounds and modernize them. There is always a story or message in my lyrics. The element of humor is also a constant in my music. There is a certain persona in Falz The Bahd Guy that I brought out: the funny guy and crazy guy. People started to relate to him and his music, and that was the breaking point.</p><h4>How important is the fact that you include political issues in your music?</h4><p>In the current social and political climate, it is extremely important because many things are not in place in Nigeria. We come in contact with these things every day, and as an artist, one is affected by the environment. It is impossible to live somewhere and not draw inspiration from the environment around us. Our voices, as entertainers, are perhaps the loudest right now. We are the most followed on social media. People almost worship entertainers, and we must leverage  this. That is the reason why I make conscious music. People need to wake up, and Nigerians are resilient people. It is an amazing thing, though it can become a problem when we become complacent and not react to things that are happening. People need to be more awake. I am currently working on an album that is all about conscious music, tackling our issues and making people stop, listen, and think about what is going on and how they should react.</p><h4>Were you concerned that 'This is Nigeria' would push a negative narrative about Nigeria?</h4><p>I knew it would draw some controversy, though I did not expect it to be that much, and it was a pleasant surprise. The more talked about something is, the better. It was time to say what is going on, and it got people talking. Many people mentioned it might show the country in a negative light; however, if I had kept that in the back of my mind, then I would have sugarcoated our issues, which was not the point. Things are truly messed up, and we need to wake up. If someone's child is doing something wrong, they will not sugarcoat it; they would try to say it in a way that helps them realize what they are doing is not right.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for Nigerian musicians?</h4><p>The main challenge is that there is no structure; we do not have a proper system of tracking records. In the US and the UK, artists go gold if they sell 500,000 copies and platinum if they sell 1 million. Here, there is no way to know how much one is selling. People on the streets have been selling records without permission. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the industry in 2019?</h4><p>The industry is going somewhere promising. I see many artists starting to perform all around the world, and Afrobeat is penetrating other markets. I see growth and an emergence of a new crop of talent. 2019 will be an important year. There are multiple A-list artists now, more than ever. Everyone is pulling out big crowds and making large sums of money. The sky is big enough for everyone to fly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do your non-entertainment operations fit within the group?</h4><p>Although Quilox is the most popular brand in the Aquila group and Aquila records has also gained widespread recognition, they contribute less than 10% to the revenue of the group. I went into the entertainment and hospitality space due to my passion and the genuine belief that I could redefine the industries. I am not sure entertainment was meant to fit but it is part of a diversification strategy driven by passion and conviction. Aquila Group is a conglomerate with interests in oil and gas although we focused more on the downstream side of the business. However, now we are restructuring to move more into EPCI, mid-stream, and upstream. The construction subsidiary has also executed several projects for government and the private sector. In fact, Aquila Building and Projects built Quilox, so if that expertise wasn't resident in the group, then setting up Quilox would have been a bigger challenge. We also have a few properties that we build and sell, such us our residential project Eagle Heights, which is coming up in Banana Island soon. We also do a great deal of procurement and supplies for private companies and the government with Aquila Global Resources Limited. On the entertainment side, Aquila Records was established to help developing and talented Nigerians and Africans become superstars. We have artists like Air Boy, as well as my brother, Que Peller, the only artist magician in the world. We also have Base One, an indigenous rap artist, Beezy, and my daughter, Naomi Peller. Quilox was established with the goal of revolutionizing nightlife in Nigeria; hence, the name, which means redefinition. My financial advisors thought I was overexposing myself in a business that has a notoriously short life span. However, Nigeria was one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, and I knew Lagos, as the commercial capital of Nigeria, had great potential. I saw a gap in the nightlife industry that needed to be filled. Quilox has been around for five years now.</p><h4>How large is the entertainment portfolio of the group compared to the other areas?</h4><p>It would be unfair to compare some of the other businesses in the group to the entertainment side because the industry structures are fundamentally different. I am more concerned about the impact of each business on its market, though the contribution of my entertainment portfolio to the group is about 10%, which is quite decent.</p><h4>What are the main challenges in the entertainment business?</h4><p>The main issue is power. I spend an average of NGN8 million (USD22,000) a month powering our clubs via generators. On unstable power, we spend an average of between NGN700,000 and NGN1 million. This is a huge factor and a key expense. Security within the country is also a major issue, and the government needs to focus more on security. This would create a better business environment, because more people would be interested in coming and spending money. Other important factors are levies and taxes, and the government should work on streamlining the tax and levy structure. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the group in 2019, particularly the entertainment side?</h4><p>In 2019, I was elected to a national legislative position. The time for armchair politics is over. I have joined politics as a technocrat, which will allow me to help shape economic and business policy in the most effective way. I have been involved in many philanthropic activities, and I am excited to represent a new set of ideals. I have structured my businesses such that they will function smoothly in my absence during 2019. I foresee the price of oil continuing to stabilize. The government will continue to work on diversifying the economy as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You worked at GSK for many years. What drove you to establish your own company?</h4><p>I decided to operate outside of the multinationals space as I saw a number of opportunities beyond what multinationals consider priority in this clime at this moment. My partner and I decided to come together to fill some of those gaps. There are massive gaps in the pharmaceutical industry in terms of capacity, local manufacturing capabilities, the types of products being locally manufactured, and the human capability. It was time to try to put my expertise beyond multinational companies to see how it could benefit the entire industry. We are currently looking at pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and vaccines. </p><h4>What ambitions do you have about expanding beyond the Nigerian borders?</h4><p>We are into cardio metabolic, which is related to things like diabetes. We have positioned it to go beyond the shores of Nigeria. Nigeria today accounts for close to 25% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, if we have a business proposition that can be successful in Nigeria, it is easier to increase our capacity and serve other African countries. For some of these projects Nigeria will serve as a hub for Africa.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>2019 will be a year when big things can happen. This will be through our special purpose investment vehicles, which we will ensure become a reality. For us, the motivation is not the return on investment; we want to prove the point that some things can be done differently in the healthcare and pharmaceutical space within Nigeria and Africa. We want to ensure that we tie into the government's vision of making Nigeria self-sufficient, which we will do in terms of medicine production, and we have a clear roadmap toward this goal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the origins of Oasis Medspa?</h4><p>Seven years ago, I had severe adult acne and I visited multiple spas around Lagos trying to find a solution, but nothing worked. I tried international spas and found some effective solutions and products for my skin type. In 2014, we opened Oasis Medspa to work with expertly trained international doctors and medical aestheticians who are experienced in anti-aging, esthetic, and integrative medicine.</p><h4>How have the services you provide evolved over time?</h4><p>Oasis Medspa is a premium corrective skin clinic and luxury day spa in Ikoyi. We are the avant-garde of beauty, esthetics, nutrition and medicine. When we started, we did a great deal of corrective skincare treatments. We then evolved into fat reduction and skin tightening treatments, as well as laser hair removal using state-of-the-art equipment. We initially tried to acquire a UK-based franchise, but there were challenges with partnering with established international medspa brands in Nigeria, so we decided to create a world-class facility on our own.</p><h4>What are some of the most popular treatments at Oasis Medspa?</h4><p>The most effective facial you can get is the hydrafacial, which is the only hydradermabrasion procedure that combines cleansing, exfoliation, extraction, and antioxidant protection, simultaneously resulting in clearer and more radiant skin. It is an anti-aging treatment suitable for all skin types as well as an acne prone skin. The Royal body polish is a surface exfoliation, and we use enzymes and our signature body scrub to exfoliate dead skin cells. No one performs this service but us. The third treatment, EXILIS ELITE is a non-invasive face and body contouring device designed to reduce fat, tighten loose skin, and minimize fine lines and wrinkles. Using a combination of ultrasound and radiofrequency, Exilis delivers safe thermal energy that kills fat cells. Fat drains into the lymphatic system and is expelled from the body. The thermal energy also stimulates collagen and tightens the skin. Finally, the NDYAG laser treatment is very popular, even though most people think it is only about hair removal. We can perform over 100 treatments with our laser. The Quanta system's Q-switch NDYAG laser machine is a versatile tool that is effective against a wide variety of issues, including acne scars, tattoo removal, varicose veins, stretch marks, nail fungus, and many more. We are amongst only a few spas in Nigeria with this technology.</p><h4>How is demand for more traditional rejuvenation treatments in Nigeria?</h4><p>We have more demand for traditional rejuvenation treatments such as Botox, dermal fillers, PDO thread lift, and laser resurfacing, for example. Awareness has significantly improved in the last few years, and more people are interested in taking care of themselves. </p><h4>How is demand for plastic surgery services at your clinic?</h4><p>Currently, we have about 20-30 patients utilizing these services every two months, which is when we fly plastic surgeons from the US to Nigeria to perform them. Some women are interested in liposuction, while others want Brazilian butt lifts and other surgeries. Most of our surgeons are Nigerian-American doctors practicing in the US. Liposuction and fat transfer services are the most popular. It involves performing liposuction first, and we take fat from the abdomen or flanks to infuse to the buttocks. Awareness of these services is high, and demand for plastic surgery services is exploding.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>I would love to bring in new products, services, and equipment in 2019. Additionally, I plan to further build my skincare line and work to ensure it is affordable. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us some background into the company?</h4><p>In 1994, I started my first gas company, a gas refilling plant. By 1997, we were expanding, though we were at times forced to import due to local supply shortages. In mid-2005, we were selected by NLNG to participate in a new model created to enhance the system. We grew over time and now have more than three plants. A terminal is also being developed in Delta state, where products can be easily offloaded. We already export to Cote d'Ivoire, and plan to export more. We are also trying to further develop our domestic market. We are working on developing more skid plants as well. It is a small modular plant that allows for easy fuel tank refilling. We currently have about 40 and plan to put out almost 500 in different locations. We are also interested in gas processing and the gas flare process, though this can take time and a great deal of input from the government, which can be fairly slow. We want to find the best way to send cooking gas to people's homes to improve the quality of their lives and substantially reduce the amount of pollution that enters the atmosphere. Finally, we are driving the power game; Nigeria produces around 4GW of electricity, though we need far more. We need to use the gas we have to develop the country's power infrastructure.</p><h4>How would you describe your portfolio of clients?</h4><p>Most of our clients are in the domestic space interested in cooking at home. We utilize the various gas distributors and send our product through their lines to the homes. With low volumes, we had enough capacity with existing terminals; however, as the domestic market grows, we will need greater capacity, which is where the importance of new terminals lies. From the terminal, complanies like us take gas and deliver it to our plants, from which we then sell directly to consumers. There are many small entrepreneurs that own gas plants, and these are the largest pieces of our client portfolio. We do not have a relationship with the government in this space.We produce 500,000 tons annually, and at this level Nigeria cannot perform as well as it should be doing in terms of LPG penetration and use. We also need to study what countries such as China and Malaysia have done in terms of expanding this market. The best way to do so is to maximize our cylinder infrastructure and distribute them as deeply as we can. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC) facilitate Malaysia's transition toward a climate-resilient green economy?</h4><p>MESTECC increased its 2025 target for the share of renewable energy in the total electricity generation of the country from 2% to 20%, excluding large hydro. In the next seven years, we need to add 3.9GW of installed renewable energy capacity. We announced a new policy on Net Energy Metering to incentivize people with large roofs to install rooftop solar panels. We have 3.2 million residential properties, 450,000 commercial lots, 90,000 terraced factories, and 21,000 factories, which illustrates the great potential for rooftop solar in Malaysia, and we should maximize the unused land first. In addition, MESTECC has liberalized solar leasing, which makes it easier to arrange supply agreements. The asset owner no longer needs to be the building owner, which incentivizes companies. With the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, we are going into energy efficiency, one of the lowest-hanging fruits to decarbonize the economy as well as save money. With about 5,000 buildings, the government is the largest owner in Malaysia, and many of them are not efficient. Moving forward, we want to close Energy Performance Contract in which companies invest in retrofitting these buildings and share in the savings, so that over a period of time they receive a net positive return on investment. In 2019, we will conduct this method with 50 government buildings as a pilot project. Going into electricity performance contracting will catalyze the energy service industry in Malaysia, while at the same time helping us be more efficient without a big capital investment from the government. We are finalizing a standard template to share, educate, and incentivize the government on all levels to go into energy performance contracts. Another important initiative of MESTECC is the Roadmap Towards Zero Single-Use Plastics, which we launched in October 2018. We do not want to talk merely about reducing and recycling; it is vital to talk about replacing too. We want to incentivize companies to replace hydrocarbon-based single-use plastics by eco-friendly alternatives. In November 2018 the Ministry of Finance announced a tax incentive status for companies that invest in biopolymers or bio-products. We want to create an ecosystem which fosters this green agenda regardless of any government investment. This ecosystem depends on four pillars: talent, technology, the regulatory framework and private capital investment. We are looking into green financing to create a macro-environment that incentivizes green investment in Malaysia. Eventually, we want to see Malaysia as a green economy hub, and as a green financing hub for all green projects around the Southeast Asia region. Green financing is a subset of Islamic financing so we are seeing synergies with some of our banks that have strong capabilities in this area. However, we are not restricting ourselves to Islamic financing and are liaising with stakeholders, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to better understand the models we can employ and the support they can provide to help develop Malaysia. If the international development banks are to play a role in Malaysia's green financing road map, it has to serve as a model for other developing countries as well. The eventual goal is indeed to be the model and example of other developing countries.</p><h4>What are your expectations around the Large Scale Solar 3 (LSS3) scheme?</h4><p>MESTECC has announced the Large Scale Solar 3 scheme tender for 500MW worth MYR2 billion (USD448.84 million), which will close for submission in August 2019. I expect LSS3 to be even more competitive than LSS2 and LSS1. We have more local players with whom foreign players can start a joint venture. Malaysian regulation requires 51% Malaysian ownership, which is not a restriction for foreign direct investment, as LSS is to a large extent about local land issues. For LSS3, we are mainly looking at competitiveness, while LSS4, which will be announced in 2020, will be more innovative. Projects for LSS3 can be undertaken anywhere, though bonus points will be given for utilizing unusable land. There is also an improvement where any one developer or joint venture can tender up to a maximum of 100MW compared with the previous restriction at 50MW. Apart from environmental motivations, renewable energy is an important driver for job creation, and it even creates more jobs per GWh than conventional energy. Prices for renewable energy, and solar energy in particular, have dropped by 80% since 2009, and grid parity can be achieved soon. Our policies our far from only based on the decarbonization of the economy or meeting our obligations under the Paris Agreement but also take into account the economic feasibility. Renewable energy gives us better tariffs, is more sustainable and generates new investment and job creation.</p><h4>What are some ways in which the value chain in the power sector can become more competitive?</h4><p>We aim to reform the sector and open it up to more competition. Investors will see a more comparative electricity power sector in Malaysia, with a more competitive environment. I see the power sector as a nurturing ground for our players to eventually export their services to other Southeast Asian countries. The goal is to make Malaysia a pivotal point for FDI in Southeast Asia. We will be more cost competitive than Singapore, with the same high level of talent, technology, and regulatory framework, and a competitive local market located close to other important Southeast Asian markets.</p><h4>MESTECC recently launched its 2019 strategic plan called “Own It. Do It. Ace It.“ Can you expand on the underlying vision and philosophy of this strategic plan?</h4><p>There are around 7,000 people across Malaysia working under MESTECC agencies, and we want to drive the machinery of the government to ensure we run at full capacity. People tend to believe the private sector is more competitive; however, imagine a public sector that becomes efficient. There are many benefits that we can generate. We have set out around 20 initiatives each for energy, science, technology, and climate change, which we break down into timelines where KPIs must be met for each quarter. In this way, we systematically track our progress and achievements. We want to instill a new way of thinking in government agencies of being innovative and driven to achieve something bigger than what is deemed possible. The government is the country's biggest consumer in many aspects, such as building electricity use and catering, so how do we use government consumption to incentivize and help our industry to grow? How do we use taxpayers' money to a multiplier for our economy? These are questions we seek to address every day.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Dubai's efforts to establish itself as a data hub and a smart city, and in what way is NetApp assisting?</h4><p>Dubai has proven to be one of the most progressive cities in the Middle East. It is at the forefront of digitalization, digital transformation, artificial intelligence (AI), smart cities, and Internet of Things (IoT). Investment is an important aspect but backing it up with expertise and skilled resources to drive the vision is another. In 2017, H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Prime Minister and Vice President and Ruler of Dubai, appointed the country's first Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence. This indicates the high value of Dubai's transition into a digital society. It is definitely a city full of forward-thinking, futuristic projects and it is exciting to contribute to this innovative spirit. What role does NetApp play in this context? Data is the lifeblood of every organization and NetApp is the data authority for hybrid multi-cloud, providing a full range of cloud data services that simplify the management of applications and data to accelerate digital transformation. Throughout the life cycle of data, NetApp supports companies across all verticals like governments, the public sector, the private sector, and enterprises to kick-start — if they have not started it already — their digital transformation journey at their own pace. Recently, we have launched FlexPod AI, a converged infrastructure solution that is optimized for analytic workloads using a validated design with NetApp's ecosystem partners. With the capability to learn from data and make more informed, faster decisions, organizations are better positioned to understand the market requirements in order to deliver innovative products and services in an increasingly competitive marketplace. </p><h4>What are the highlights of NetApp in terms of products and services? </h4><p>Gartner's recent recognition of Data Fabric as a top technology trend in Data and Analytics is a strong validation of NetApp's vision. Only NetApp can deliver a Data Fabric with consistent data services for data visibility and insights, data access and control, and data protection and security. We help customers modernize their data center, by allowing them to do more with a lower total cost of ownership. All-flash array technology is the de facto choice as customers seek performance and economic benefits from replacing hard disk installations. With a highly differentiated and broad portfolio of all-flash and hybrid array offerings, NetApp enables customers to accomplish this transition. According to IDC, NetApp is the leader in All-Flash in EMEA. We want the customer to determine where to keep their data safe and how to manage it. NetApp provides solutions for all cloud workloads and Kubernetes applications and also has an excellent cooperation with the big hyperscalers — Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. As an example, NetApp was recently named 2018 Google Cloud Technology Partner of the Year for Infrastructure. Customers benefit from our open collaboration with other technology leaders to create specific solutions. We were incorporated in 1992 and created the world's first networked storage appliance. Today, we offer a portfolio of products and services that satisfy a broad range of customer workloads across different data types and deployment models. NetApp is a member of NASDAQ 100, a Fortune 500 company and a member of S&amp;P 500.</p><h4>How is then our data safer with NetApp?</h4><p>The NetApp Data Fabric enables companies an enterprise data security approach that spans their entire data infrastructure. NetApp encrypts its data at the lowest level, whether it is at rest, moving through the network or stored in the cloud — therefore granting the provision of consistent data security policies across flash, disk, and cloud — with visibility into all customers' storage devices.</p><h4>Which regions and markets are you looking at for future expansion and what is your primary business objective this year?</h4><p>We see the majority of the businesses in the GCC in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, followed by Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain. The market has been good for us and we have been doing well. I look after the Middle East, Africa and Pakistan and my areas of responsibility tend to be full of surprises, but we manage well. Our main objective for 2019 is to sustain our market leadership in the region and maintain our overall strong business performance. We will continue to integrate innovation into our portfolio, cater to business needs, and create fruitful partnerships. We are also looking at continuously laying a solid foundation for the organization to strategically participate in building new smart city ecosystems, the future urbanism.Through our solutions, including NetApp Data Fabric, hybrid multi-cloud connectivity, and NetApp HCI systems, we can contribute to the smart transformation efforts taking place in different parts of the region such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we will aim to create awareness of the benefits of digital transformation and how our solutions can help make this happen. And like the previous years, we will continue to enhance customer experience by consistently delivering world-class and outstanding digital solutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess 2018 in terms of your growth and the development of Sharjah?</h4>
<p>For SHAMS, 2018 was a good year. In 2017, when we started we saw that there is good potential for business to come through SHAMS as a free zone authority. Although it was obvious from the market around us that industries are a little bit affected by the slowdown of the economy. However, for SHAMS we did not feel or see that, maybe because we are new and do not have a long history to compare against. We continued to work on preparing the infrastructure and buildings, in response to all the interest in SHAMS. We are working on arranging and serving that interest even further, but what we have achieved in 2018 is satisfying. We have exceeded expectations.</p>
<h4>Why does SHAMS actively support entrepreneurs and SME's here in Sharjah?</h4>
<p>We thought about entrepreneurs from different aspects. They aren't just looking for funding. They are looking for easy setup and a community to work within. They want to increase their knowledge through specific courses, with good instructors. We thought about establishing the community, trying to have them participate in events that we worked on through the team, training courses, start-up meetings, and moving some of their products to show them the best way to market those. We are also working on preparing financial support. We are not only concentrating on their soft skills through courses, we are also trying to give them the chance to meet their peers and interact with them by creating a community around SHAMS. We are also looking at establishing a program to support these companies and start-ups to continue and further their successes.</p>
<h4>How would you describe the strength of regulations and how they help start-ups to establish something new and exciting in Sharjah?</h4>
<p>We have good knowledge about how it is done within other free zones and inside the Emirate itself. We thought that we could be supporting the start-ups and entrepreneurs to make it easy to start up their companies and get them licensed, have them meet their clients and anticipate their markets. We have not reached the stage where we can certainly say this is the way forward, but we are partnering with other initiatives within the Emirate of Sharjah, such as Sheraa. We are trying to see what is missing for the entrepreneurs and start-ups, and then fill those gaps. Therefore, it took longer than just one year, 2018, to get into that business. It needs to be mastered really well. One third of our building is going to be dedicated to the start-ups and entrepreneurs. We will be trying to have a program specifically for that sector.</p>
<h4>What kind of licenses do you offer in SHAMS?</h4>
<p>We have lots of different licenses but are concentrating on media and creativity. We have a good response from the market for companies and individuals who want to embark on working in media or creative businesses. Anything related to that sector we license. We have a list of activities where we can license companies. It is on our website, shams.ae.</p>
<h4>What kind of machine learning and AI implementations do you see here in Sharjah?</h4>
<p>At SHAMS, we want to be at the forefront of digitalization. Many of our projects made use of technology and advancements in this field. A lot of our interaction with the clients already licensed by SHAMS happens online.</p>
<h4>Do you have any international partnerships?</h4>
<p>We believe in partnerships. We welcome that and a lot of our business travel is done to establish those contacts and communication channels. We have travelled to many parts of the world during 2018. We will keep doing that in 2019, too.</p>
<h4>What are your main goals and objectives for 2019?</h4>
<p>Starting work from the new headquarters will allow us to show the business community and media and creativity sector that there is a new place for them. This first building is never going to be the only one, because we are already planning for other buildings and the plan is to even further showcase SHAMS as a master development project for interested companies, specifically for the media sector to establish their presence in the Emirate. We will be building this plan on partnerships and getting the right partners in place at different levels. There are companies more into infrastructure development and construction and companies offering technology, serving a smart development or smart city. I think 2019 will be an active year for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[alberto-martinez-president-ceo-mundipharma]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of Mundipharma?</h4><p>Mundipharma is a mid-sized fully-integrated pharmaceutical company whose purpose is to move medicine forward. Its expertise covers the full life cycle of the product, from development and manufacturing, to regulatory and market access, through to supply and commercialization of innovative assets across European markets. It is privately owned, and the network has a presence in well over 120 countries worldwide, employing thousands of people, 2,000 of them in Europe. Mundipharma started as an antiseptics and laxatives business in the 1950s, and in the 1960s acquired Napp, a UK company with know-how in controlled release mechanisms. This technology was applied to different therapeutic areas, from cardiovascular and respiratory to analgesia, which has been the company's main focus for the past three decades. In the last four years, three of the top four medicines in the portfolio were losing patent exclusivity across Europe. Mundipharma needed a new focus and it underwent a major business transformation during this period. At the end of 2014, when I moved to the UK, we initiated a timely transformation of our organization that has since expanded across Europe and has proven successful not only in terms of business results, with records in sales and profitability in 2018, but also in terms of effectiveness and mindset of our leadership and employees.</p><h4>Did this involve diversifying your products?</h4><p>Yes, Mundipharma has managed to grow through the loss of exclusivity of its pain business by delivering commercial excellence with a diversified portfolio that has been accessed through strategic partnerships with other Companies in areas like biosimilars, respiratory diseases and diabetes. We no longer promote opioid analgesics in Europe and our present and future is about demonstrating the value we can bring to our commercial and healthcare partners in other areas. Today, Mundipharma in Europe is a leader in the commercialization of biosimilars and is a reference commercial partner in specialist driven primary care. In 2015, we launched infliximab, the first monoclonal antibody biosimilar. Just 4 years later, our biosimilars' sales had grown to  be in excess of ‚¬350 million in 2018 and we are proud to have contributed to saving more than ‚¬800 million to healthcare systems over that period. Moreover, it is particularly fulfilling and fitting with our purpose that these biosimilars are allowing many more thousands of patients to have access to innovative biologic treatments that were not accessible to them for costs reasons. Through our commercial partnership with Celltrion, Mundipharma is today the European biosimilar market leader with infliximab, rituximab and trastuzumab, and our recent acquisition of Cinfa Biotech has enabled our successful expansion into development and commercialization across the whole of Europe. Similarly, our strategic partnerships with Janssen and Vectura in diabetes and respiratory recognize our ability to tailor our market access and commercial propositions to every market in order to deliver a competitive performance in the complex primary care environment.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your business model?</h4><p>Our business model is based upon three key pillars: innovation and commercial excellence through partnerships. It is about innovation, as the company is focused on medicines that can bring real value to patients and healthcare providers, assets that we can be proud of developing and commercializing. It is about commercial excellence. We are neither a generic company nor a big pharma, but as a specialty company we have the local understanding of our customers' needs and the footprint and capabilities that enable us to move quickly, to adapt and establish our commercial platforms in new markets.  It is this agility that provides our competitive advantage, allowing us to execute competitively and cost effectively, as we have recently proven in biosimilars or diabetes. And both innovation and commercial excellence can only happen through fostering strong partnerships. Partnerships with other pharmaceutical and biotech companies that see in Mundipharma their partner in development or commercialization of innovative assets. Partnerships with our customers, healthcare professionals and healthcare providers that entrust Mundipharma's professionalism and commitment to move medicine forward together. And partnerships internally within the organization and with our shareholders so that we truly operate as one, with clear direction and focus. Our ambition is to continue to grow with a portfolio of innovative assets through in-licensing and co-development, since a growing environment is always one that brings opportunity for people to develop. We invest a great deal in human capital development to create a high performing and learning environment for everyone in the organization, and this continues to be recognized by our employees with leading Great Place to Work awards across Europe. Mundipharma is a great place to grow for high performing individuals who want to take ownership, demonstrate accountability and make a real impact to the business and to move medicine forward.</p><h4>What is the breakdown of your client portfolio, and do you partner with distributors or focus on direct sales?</h4><p>In Europe, we primarily focus on direct sales through our capabilities across 20 markets where we bring our “local brilliance," a tailored commercial approach to every healthcare environment. The customer target in pharma has changed dramatically over the past years from being primarily doctors to expanding to a much larger customer group that includes national and regional healthcare authorities and private insurers. Fully integrated market access capabilities centrally and locally have become a critical area of expertise to excel in these complex healthcare environments.</p><h4>How do you assess the attractiveness of the Spanish pharmaceutical industry for foreign investors?</h4><p>Spain is already one of the major suppliers of high quality medicines in Europe and Brexit provides an opportunity for Spanish manufacturing operations to step up in this area. Mundipharma recognized this excellence by acquiring Cinfa Biotech in 2018 and, over the past months we have strengthened our partnerships with ROVI and 3P to launch a pegfilgrastim biosimilar fully developed in Spain across Europe. Our partnership with ESTEVE in the development of new molecules to target novel pain receptors is also testament to our belief in the innovation potential of the Spanish pharmaceutical industry.</p><h4>Why did you decide to be a part of Cambridge Science Park and do you collaborate with the University?</h4><p>Cambridge is a privileged hub of innovation and creativity and we feel privileged to be one of the pioneers in the Science Park, which is owned by Trinity College. Mundipharma and its UK subsidiaries Napp and Bard Pharmaceuticals, have a large presence in the campus with 1,000 employees. Our commitment to develop, manufacture and commercialize high quality medicines is also exemplified with us retaining our manufacturing and R&amp;D capabilities within the Science Park providing services across the globe. We believe that our open space offices, cycling to work or meeting while walking around the Science Park also contribute to the high performing and learning environment that we want to foster for our employees at Mundipharma. Our collaboration with Cambridge University has been limited over the past but it is now an area of interest as we focus on innovation through partnerships. We are also proud of our contributions to the community through educational initiatives that have enabled more than 3,000 school children to spark their interest in science through our long-running Science Ambassador programs.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for Mundipharma in the next couple of years?</h4><p>As we successfully complete our transformation, our main focus will be around two elements of our business model; partnerships and innovation, which are expected to be the key drivers of the continued growth of our organization. At Mundipharma, we will continue to partner with healthcare providers to listen to their needs and enable the access to innovative medicines while supporting the education and training of doctors and patients in their appropriate use. Our proven commercial excellence is “agnostic" from a therapeutic area perspective and this enlarges our ability to partner with companies who want to bring their innovation into Europe regardless of the therapeutic area. Mundipharma offers them a fully integrated development and commercialization partner that can successfully navigate the complex European healthcare environment and will ensure their innovation reaches the appropriate patients in an ethical and responsible manner.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Turnkey Solutions]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[georges-khouzami-chief-operations-officer-al-thuriah]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What recent economic and market trends have you noticed in Sharjah and how have they impacted the construction and real estate sector?</h4>
<p>Al Thuriah specializes in offering turnkey solutions to institutions and investors by combining Real Estate Development, Construction, Leasing and Facilities Management into one seamless service. The real estate sector in Sharjah remains very healthy in terms of demand and supply; however, the price volatility of the neighboring emirates has an immediate effect on Sharjah's. We have noticed that end-users and investors are spoiled for choices in terms of payment schemes and limited time offers, but here at Al Thuriah, we decided to focus our efforts on better living standards. All our projects have superior living spaces that are 50% above market sizes along with premium finishes and amenities. In turn, our products fulfill the requirements of better living. Moreover, Sharjah granted foreign nationals the right to buy long-term leasehold properties which proved to be a great starting stimulus to our industry.</p>
<h4>What is the status of your La Plage Tower and Sahara Tower 6 projects?</h4>
<p>La Plage Tower and Sahara Tower 6 are the only projects in our portfolio that are for sale as individual apartments. Sahara Tower 6 is the final jewel of the Sahara Complex. The final tower in the series means all the improvements learned throughout the years were incorporated in its design and execution to create our best product yet. Sahara Tower 6 is due for completion during 4Q2019, ahead by 60 days of its official completion date. On the other hand, La Plage Tower was designed to set a new benchmark in high-rise residential living. The Tower offers 90 different floor plans that will cater to all cultures and tastes. The concept of exclusivity was the foundation of our approach and design. The Tower is split into three sections that slightly twist from one another, its terraces are 2m wide for supreme utilization and its window frames are 1.5m wide for the ultimate views. La Plage Tower is on sale now and slated for completion in 4Q2022.</p>
<h4>How are you working to increase sustainability in your projects?</h4>
<p>Sustainability is a subjective word. At Al Thuriah, sustainability means keeping the same standard of the project on handover throughout its life cycle. To achieve this, our facilities management subsidiary weighs in during the design for valuable insights and recommendations. Furthermore, we always keep a sinking fund that accumulates yearly for every project in order to take immediate action for any asset that shows wear and tear. Keeping a hands-on approach with a preventive mindset are the key to increasing our sustainability.</p>
<h4>Which of your service has yielded the highest revenue?</h4>
<p>All our services are integrated into one turnkey solution.</p>
<h4>How will the change in visa and investment opportunities for foreigners benefit Sharjah?</h4>
<p>The approval to allow foreigners to invest on a long-term leasehold basis opened a new pool of end-users and investors. Our target market increased tenfold overnight which greatly benefited all developers and the emirate of Sharjah as a whole.</p>
<h4>What kind of AI or machine learning solutions are you using?</h4>
<p>Real Estate is a long-term business which requires analysis for the near future and future. Machine learning does not help in creating futurity assumptions; however, it does help in comparing current data with historical data to establish a baseline.</p>
<h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2019?</h4>
<p>Our primary goal is to complete our transition to an international Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) which will create a coherent journey for our customers and reduce the operating time to complete tasks. The ERP will also allow all our companies to share its data in a single structure to improve our processes resulting in greater efficiencies and customer care. We have a very healthy backlog of projects. However, we will still evaluate new launches or partnerships in the near future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been key for AAW to establish major business relationships with brands in consumer goods, pharmaceuticals, and other fields?</h4>
<p>Our company's core values were key for establishing and sustaining such relationships. From the beginnings to now, our company has been known for its high level of integrity, transparency, and our commitment to excellence. This has been the key reason why this company has continued to grow all these years. In addition, multinational companies not only look for partners with good values, but also with ones that enjoy a proven record of good performance. Our partners, therefore, see AAW as a very dependable company with high standard.</p>
<h4>How is AAW managing to integrate all its business lines and maintaining the highest level of competitiveness in the market?</h4>
<p>The market is constantly evolving and this creates new competition in the market., And In order for us to be on top of our game we run our business in a very efficient manner. We took a bold but important decision many years back; to consolidate AAW's distribution center for all business units under one roof and its considered to be one of the biggest in the country<br />Investing in our e-commerce at a relatively early stage also helped us grab new market share. Last but not least, our data driven strategy has always helped us anticipate new trends or changes in the market and enabled us to move faster than our peers.</p>
<h4>Which one of your business lines has experienced the most significant growth and why?</h4>
<p>We have experienced great growth in multiple lines of our business over the past few years. The retail part of our business and specifically in the pharmaceutical (Roche, Merk) &amp; Outdoor (The North Face, Patagonia, Vans) business units have been enjoying good retail growth. We have also rolled out recently multiple showrooms for our Kitchens &amp; Home Appliances business (Bosch, Nolte) and results look promising. On the wholesale part, our FMCG business unit (P&amp;G, Clorox, Hersheys) continues to Grow its market share despite the market challenges. Our e-commerce business is also very promising. Last but not least, our Real Estate business has always been one of the great performers. On the project business, our Kitchens &amp; Home Appliances business unit (BOSCH, Nolte) has been aggressively closing many contracts and gaining serious market share. On the other hand, our Home &amp; office furniture business unit has encountered some challenges due to fierce competition and severe market fragmentation. We responded by partnering with one of the fastest growing furniture brands in the world, Jysk, and we have started to rollout multiple locations.</p>
<h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead in terms of growth and business?</h4>
<p>The retail market in Kuwait has suffered over the past five to six years. By the beginning of 2018, we felt that the market slightly initiated its recovering process. Consumer confidence seem still shaky but improving. In 2019, we see the online business across all our business units booming. We also see the unrolling of government and private projects which will positively impact our business. We are optimistic about the year ahead and our financials &amp; independent market reports indicate that we are on the right track.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sefine Shipyard exports its vessels around the world, particularly to the European market. Can you break down Sefine's European involvement and, more broadly, where the company hopes to grow in the future?</h4><p>Sefine Shipyard has been involved in many 'firsts' in Europe. We were the first Turkish company to begin making turnkey ferries for Norway, which is where we still have our strongest European presence. After our first work in Norway, we produced two ferryboats for the Estonian market, again a first for a Turkish company, which also represented the largest single Turkish export to Estonia. In 2018, we built a hybrid LNG-diesel electric ferry for Italy, the first LNG powered ferry in the Mediterranean. We are seeking to broaden our market to other Scandinavian countries, like Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Iceland because we specialize in two types of vessels—ferryboats and live fish carriers. Scandinavian countries in particular use these two types of vessels, so we have plans to continue growing our market share in those markets. We have had 40 new builds to date, almost all for the European market, with five or six of them in Turkey. It is difficult to expand beyond Europe because we are a boutique shipyard and not like a huge Korean-type shipyard. It is hard to compete with the Far East shipyards, which is why we focus on tailor-made ships for European countries. For this reason, we will not go to markets beyond Europe.</p><h4>Sefine Shipyard is also involved in the repair and conversion of vessels. What projects has the company done in this field?</h4><p>We have completed six cement carrier conversions for the Italian market and two livestock carrier conversions for the Gulf. Ship conversion is a different market; one never knows when the next conversion project will come. One cannot market this service in the usual way; people will seek them out for specific projects. Sefine Shipyard is successful in conversion projects because we have a great design office, and we are more economical than other shipyard countries. Clients prefer us, as we are the most convenient and economical shipyard for such a project. Conversion projects are specialized work, where one needs to be extremely precise about following the rules. If we make one mistake, the job is ruined, and correcting mistakes is extremely expensive.</p><h4>Sefine Shipyard has also done steelwork for Istanbul's new third airport. How did Sefine develop the competencies necessary for this work?</h4><p>We have done several mega steel projects. We started out building the steel components for Osmangazi Bridge, which is near our shipyard. We were able to be competitive for that project because we did not have any logistical expenses as we are located close by. Nevertheless, it was difficult because mega steelworks are different to building a vessel. To solve this issue, our strategy was to set up a new team and department to specialize in steel work. For the new airport, we did the steel roofs, the steel construction for the hotel in the airport, and the aerobridges. It was a difficult job, and we worked day and night to get it done within the deadline. These projects are how we fill in the gaps that come with the shipbuilding business. It is a second business line for us and a hedging strategy for the company to safeguard us against the ups and downs of shipbuilding.</p><h4>The local shipbuilding industry is known for its versatility and capabilities in niche sectors. What niche markets has Sefine defined for itself among global shipbuilders?</h4><p>In Turkey, we generally do tailor-made jobs, so our advantage is that local shipbuilders are able to enter niche markets, as we did. In our case, we used to produce bulk carriers, tankers, and tugboats like everyone else in the world; however, we later realized we needed something else to give us more competitive advantages. We entered the ferryboat market before anyone else and now dominate the segment. Sefine Shipyard is now the leader in the ferry market. However, that was not enough to survive and keep the business sustainable. We had to find other markets and after conducting some research, we identified the live fish carrier segment. That is also a niche market. It is not big, though if one enters a market first and dominates that field, they become a known brand. Other Turkish shipyards have followed our strategy and either entered the same or found their own niche markets to pursue.</p><h4>The depreciation of the lira has benefited many exporters in Turkey. How has it impacted Sefine Shipyard?</h4><p>Initially, the depreciation was difficult for us, because although our labor costs are in lira, everything else is in foreign currency, such as euro, dollars, or even the Norwegian krone. We had to wait two or three months for the lira to stabilize to find the correct costing for us. Sometimes, our suppliers and sub-contractors were afraid to even provide us with quotes. But once the currency stabilized, we were able to start pricing accurately for our customers again. We have not benefitted as much as other exporters have from the depreciation.</p><h4>What are Sefine Shipyard's biggest plans and primary objectives for the coming 12 months?</h4><p>We are almost at full capacity for the next two years, so we need to invest in our shipyard infrastructure and buildings; for example, we have a new social building because we previously had 1,500 employees and now require facilities for 4,000 people. We are also investing in more workshops. Our primary objective for the year is to complete all our infrastructure investments to continue growing Sefine Shipyard.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the drivers behind your decision to enter the Lagos market with E-Fitness?</h4><p>The current fitness, health and beauty trends worldwide have showcased a blend between aesthetics and technology. This growing field has been delivering outstanding results. Here at E-Fitness, we aspire to be pioneers of esthetic technology in Nigeria and we have achieved this by being the first to introduce cutting-edge technologies in the Lagos market such as fat freezing, Electric Muscle Stimulation (EMS), and Styku 3D body scanning, for example. </p><h4>Which service among the ones you offer is the most in demand, and can you tell us more about how your treatments work?</h4><p>At E-Fitness, we offer different innovative services that cover esthetic, health, and fitness needs, starting from fat freezing to the EMS workout to laser hair removal. For fat freezing, we use a CoolTech machine that effectively reduces localized fat tissue using a controlled freezing system with a non-invasive, safe, and effective method. The technique used is called cryolypolisis. It works on breaking down fat cells. An applicator is attached to the targeted area to extract heat from the underlined fat tissue while protecting the skin, nerves, muscles and other tissues. CoolTech treatment can be done on the abdomen, thighs, knees, adductors, hips, arms, and flanks. Results in localized fat reduction are seen as soon as two weeks. Another procedure is EMS. It is a 20 minute-long full body workout using low impulse current. These impulses reach deep muscle layers, which are hard to activate during conventional training. It is the safest and most efficient way to rapidly lose weight, strengthen muscles, and tone the body. It has the convenience of one session per week, where you burn up to 500 calories during and then up to 3,000 calories in the following two days. This workout will help you achieve faster results with less effort. Our E-Fitness boot camp is a group physical program conducted by a professional trainer using military style and every-day outdoor equipment. The combination of team atmosphere, intense full-body cardiovascular, strength workouts, and fitness education make the class very effective at reducing excess body weight, improving cardiovascular endurance, increasing lean muscle mass and improving overall coordination and balance.</p><h4>How do you plan to further scale your business in Nigeria, and what are your expansion plans in terms of geographic locations or services?</h4><p>Our team is always scouting for the latest technological trends in health, fitness and beauty. E-Fitness will expand geographically by adding new branches and growing our portfolio of services by introducing new machines and technologies.<br></p><h4>How would you assess the process of setting up a business in Nigeria?</h4><p>Setting up a business in general requires a good plan, thorough execution, and appropriate ongoing management. Nigeria definitely has its specific challenges and setting up E-Fitness in Nigeria didn't prove to be an easy venture. One of the most difficult challenges was creating awareness about the services we provide. In terms of return on investment (ROI), this business is looking promising. People are really interested in being physically healthy and fit and want to achieve the best results in the fastest and most efficient way.</p><h4>What trends do you foresee in the fitness space in Nigeria in particular, and where do you see the sector going?</h4><p>People have been highly receptive about fat freezing, as this technology has been delivering great results and remarkable transformations, while being completely safe and FDA approved. The sector proves that it has a significant potential and a promising outlook.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>I foresee more success stories, more of our efficient and reliable services, and of course more customers who share our passion for health and fitness. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Notore become the leading agro-allied company in Nigeria?</h4><p>Our most important initiative was spending time developing an extensive network of 90-100 distributors to ensure fertilizers get to the end consumer where they are actually needed. Below them are over 3,000 retailers and then village promoters, or private-sector extension services workers. We train them to teach farmers agricultural best practices in the use of fertilizers. Nationwide, we have 3,000-4,000 small plots of land less than 1/8 of a ha for demonstrations in the heart of the farming village communities. The promoters employ traditional practices on one portion and Notore's best practice on the second. Come harvest time, farmers can compare and see how to gain 10 times as much crop yield per ha. That is how we have been able to enhance the use of fertilizers. We have taken a commodity and made it a consumer product supported by the brand, which helped us gain the leadership position.</p><h4>African farmers are among the lowest users of fertilizers. Why is this so?</h4><p>It is a combination of factors. Best practices should be as much as 200kg of fertilizer per ha; in sub-Saharan Africa, we use an average of 8-10kg per ha. Nigeria currently uses about 12-13kg, though that is still low because farmers do not know what fertilizers can do, they may not be available or correctly used, and because logistic problems have resulted in their price being significantly higher than other markets. It is extremely important for farmers to understand the impact of the use of fertilizers and improved seeds that respond positively to the application of fertilizers. Farmers in Nigeria use farm safe seeds, which is not enough to get the kind of impact we want. They need hybrid seeds that respond positively to the application of fertilizer and are more drought resistant. Education is crucial to improve yields and assist Nigeria in eventually becoming a net food exporter.<br>How does Notore contribute to boosting fertilizer demand in Nigeria?<br>We hold 60-70% of local market share, especially for urea. We will continue to deepen our channels and train farmers. We have also brought about a change of attitude. The previous mentality was “one type fits all," which is erroneous. Different qualities and types of plants require different ratios of macronutrients, and we will put specific fertilizers for specific plants into the market. The urea super granule we developed a few years ago in the long run helps farmers save on fertilizer costs because the release into the soil is slower, and the plants retain 40% more because of the slow release. Farmers use less fertilizer and their crops get more nutrients.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans?</h4><p>We have a fertilizer plant that was the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa. For Notore's Train II, we intend to build a co-production-plant, which will produce a significant amount of fertilizer and methanol, therefore increasing our overall fertilizer output and diversifying our revenue stream. We expect to complete the turn-around maintenance by 4Q2019, which will bring the existing plant back to producing at 100% of its designed capacity. </p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>We are extremely proud to have educated millions of farmers in Nigeria. Farmers are today more aware of the impact of fertilizers on their crops and yields. When we first started, many farmers believed that as long as there was rain, the soil would be fertile. Post-harvest losses averaged 50%. Now we are beginning to see a mending of the value chains that were previously broken. Farmers now know how to channel their products into the market. That creates an additional hunger for farmers to continue to improve their yields. This is how the green revolution will occur moving forward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are your plans progressing to build your new hospital, and what are the challenges for Nordica Fertility Clinic in finding international partners?</h4><p>Building a new hospital is a slow process. The company is in discussions with investors; however, we are still looking for suitable investors. Our selection process is focused on finding partners that share our view and concept for the hospital. It could be that we have not been looking in the right places, but we are working to put it together.</p><h4>What is the investment climate like in healthcare in Nigeria?</h4><p>Healthcare sector is not viewed as a good investment option due to its long-term nature. However, it is unlikely for a hospital to fail once it is profitable. We are looking for partners that have the proper hospital management expertise. Nordica Fertility Clinic has been doing IVF for about 16 years, so we have the right structure in place in this field. Our aim is to extend the high standards we are known for to a full-scale hospital. Another issue in terms of investment is, for example, getting investment funds from an institution in dollars and then operating the hospital with local currency.</p><h4>How competitive is the fertility segment of the healthcare industry in Nigeria?</h4><p>On paper it is becoming competitive; however, we need to focus on improving the quality of our services. Quality is still a problem in Nigeria because no regulatory body is governing the fertility segment. There is a misconception that it is easy to operate a fertility clinic and generate profits from it. As a result, competition is increasing in comparison to a few years ago.</p><h4>Why is there no regulation in place?</h4><p>This is not exclusively an issue in Nigeria; there are just a handful of countries with fertility regulatory bodies. In case of Nigeria, the country lacks the infrastructure, which is why we are working on building a self-regulatory body. Moreover, an association of fertility and reproductive doctors and other practitioners are trying collectively to set standards that clinics should meet before they are allowed to practice.</p><h4>How attractive is this segment of medicine for investors compared to other areas of healthcare in Nigeria?</h4><p>The bane of any medical practice in Nigeria is not that it is unprofitable, but that it is badly managed most of the time—even general medicine in Nigeria suffers from this. There are no state-of-the-art hospitals in Nigeria, a country of 180 million people—but why not? These are the questions we need to start asking. Due to these issues, the healthcare sector in Nigeria is still in its infancy stage.</p><h4>What do you think is the barrier to developing top hospitals here?</h4><p>One factor is that many companies are reluctant to expand in Nigeria. There was a similar issue with the telecommunications industry in 2001, but MTN was one of the companies that decided to expand, and Nigeria is turning out to be a great investment for MTN. The perception is slowly changing, but there are still a number of misconceptions about safety in Nigeria. </p><h4>You recently stated that the same attention that has been given to HIV should be given to endometriosis. Can you elaborate on this?</h4><p>A few years ago, HIV was something that no one in Nigeria spoke about. In fact, people interviewed about HIV would insist on being veiled so that no one could recognize them. This led to a lot of quacks inventing new, ineffective drugs. However, with continuous research, treatments started to emerge, and the attention shifted to qualified scientists providing genuine solutions. Endometriosis is facing the same problem. We are continuously trying to create an African platform in order to raise the profile of endometriosis. While citizens are helping us create awareness, the government is yet to lend its support. In 2018, around 1,000 people joined our march for endometriosis; given where we started this campaign from, that was a huge crowd.</p><h4>Are you seeing increased confidence in local medical institutions from Nigerians who used to go abroad for specialist treatments?</h4><p>There is no one definite answer. Nigerians continue to head abroad for treatment, but at the same time, the number of Nigerians who prefer to receive treatment here is increasing. Even foreigners and Nigerians from countries like Canada, Australia, the US, and the UK are flying to Nigeria due to cheap, high-quality treatment. For Nigerians who live abroad, it also gives them an opportunity to visit their homeland. This is one of the ideas we are focusing on—making Nigeria a health tourism destination for the diaspora.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Nordica Fertility Clinic and the Nigerian economy in 2019?</h4><p>For Nordica, the next step is constructing a hospital. The Nigerian economy is attracting an increasing number of international players; Africa is set to be the next region in focus for development. In order to facilitate that, African governments need to provide security, quality infrastructure, and a corruption-free system. If Nigeria can ensure that, it could become the next China or India, because Nigeria has a population that can support new services; however, despite the enormous potential, it is necessary for Nigeria and its people to lay down a groundwork that will uplift investors' confidence. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Lambert Electromec's main operations?</h4><p>We are an electrical and mechanical engineering contracting company, previously in partnership with a leading Canadian company called Lambert Somec, which started operations in Port Harcourt in 2001. In 2004, operational independence was attained in Nigeria, and by 2007 we became Lambert Electromec Ltd. Our first projects were in Port Harcourt, mainly electro-mechanical works for buildings and infrastructure within the built environment, which remains our core business. Throughout the years, we have developed several in-house divisions, and today we have a power division, a data center division, a maintenance division, and a new division in the oil and gas industry specializing in modular refineries. We have partnered with Houston-based Vfuels Ltd. for the EPC construction of refineries. In 2017, we signed our first contract for a refinery to be built in Imo State for 5,000bpd, which broke ground in 2019. We are currently designing others.</p><h4>What maintenance services do you provide?</h4><p>Our maintenance services provide a complete and comprehensive solution to all our clients' facility maintenance requirements. We have the expertise and equipment to handle a wide range of scope for industrial, commercial, and residential sectors. Our approach is to work closely with clients, understand their requirements, and provide cost-effective solutions, thereby minimizing operational costs and optimizing service delivery.</p><h4>How would you split the operations between your divisions?</h4><p>Though about 65% of our core operation centers around the building division for the past decade, we are already witnessing significant growth in the power and oil and gas sectors around West African countries.</p><h4>What power projects do you have in the pipeline?</h4><p>We are in discussion with various stakeholders in Nigeria for EPC power projects varying between 10MW and 100MW utilizing several sources of energy such as gas, solar, waste-to-energy, and other hydrocarbons. </p><h4>How challenging is it to obtain funding from the international markets as a Nigerian company?</h4><p>It is challenging, yet there is significant interest from the international community in developing projects in Africa, mainly for infrastructure and renewable energy.</p><h4>What does it take to stay ahead of the competition?</h4><p>Maintaining our standards and quality is how we differentiate ourselves. We do a great deal of training of our personnel to be able to meet these standards. We have a robust and strong engineering team abroad and in Nigeria to provide the quality that our clients seek. While we are mainly local, we have many resources and partners overseas who provide us support.</p><h4>How is the operating environment today compared to before the recession?</h4><p>The market has definitely changed; we find it more difficult to convince our clients to maintain certain standards because they are more cost oriented. However, the positive side of this is that we have become more cost effective and have optimized our operations. The construction industry has not significantly improved, as we still face many challenges. There are currently very few construction projects coming up, so we hope the economy will grow again in 2019. Our international clients definitely look forward to making many investments in 2019 and 2020; however, 2018 has been difficult and slow in terms of the construction sector.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2019?</h4><p>We would like to maintain our leadership position and growth in the industry and building sectors; however, we are focusing more on the power, oil and gas, and maintenance divisions. We are also working toward enlarging our clientele and have been operating in several regions where we did not previously have a presence. We operate mainly in Lagos, Port Harcourt, Abuja, and Accra but today we are also in Bayelsa, Delta, Ibadan, Imo, and Ogun, as well as the Ivory Coast, Cameroon, and Togo. Although there are many challenges with expanding our operations, we are eager to widen our reach all the while overcoming the obstacles that this entails. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an update on the Eko Atlantic project?</h4><p>The project is still ongoing. The entire project will feature about 10 million sqm of land to be reclaimed. To date, more than 7 million sqm of backfill has been completed. Construction of the Great Wall of Lagos, a sea wall that wraps around the project, is still ongoing. The infrastructure is more than 90% complete in terms of roads. There are some residents in the project, and the 15-story office complex is fully inhabited. We have moved our offices here to ensure we are closer to the project. The ITB life camp is here, and we have ITB staff living here. We have developed a strong foundation to understand exactly what the space needs in terms of power requirements and emergency services. The city is completely self sufficient, including its own local services and infrastructure. It will have its own waste management system, though it will still tie part of the larger Lagos system for regulatory purposes. On the Azuri project, we are well advanced in terms of the structure. The first two towers are at their full 32-storys height, while the third tower is at 29-storys. Structural works are 85% complete. The development is mixed steel and concrete, and it is advancing at a rapid pace. With the hiccups in the economy in the last several years, many did not have the funds to continue their payments, and we needed to reassess how we could best make this a success. In construction, once you start, you must finish; postponing results in almost twice as much cost. The owners of the company decided that this could not happen and thus found ingenious ways to source further financing to keep the project going. We are ambassadors for Africa, and we are extremely mindful of this role. We want to keep our promises to both our contractors and the larger public.</p><h4>Are your targets international investors or locals?</h4><p>The project transcends its location. We interviewed the diaspora in many countries and determined what truly attracts them. We want to develop based on all the strengths of the various places that the diaspora lives in. We are keen to sell to anyone discerning enough and show off the added value of our products.</p><h4>How have the efforts to turn Eko Atlantic into a free zone progressed?</h4><p>Eko Atlantic is now a free zone. The operator of the license manages all the enterprises that are registered within Eko Atlantic. For example, we have done our own registration, and we now have a subsidiary company that operates out of the free zone. </p><h4>How would you define the impact of Eko Atlantic on the economy of Nigeria?</h4><p>Eko Atlantic has put Lagos back on the map for viable projects. The media is filled with negative stories about Nigeria; however, Eko Atlantic offers a completely new and positive narrative of the country. We are a tangible example of the way that Nigeria can and should do business. We have had many visits from missions backed by various embassies and chambers of commerce that are interested in seeing exactly how we operate. The dialogue has started; people now understand that something important and vital is happening in Nigeria. Individuals interested in expanding their business are now extremely interested in Nigeria via Eko Atlantic. This is massive in terms of positive perceptions regarding the company and country. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>From a company perspective, 2019 will be marked by a great deal of strategic reorganization. The company will grow and these strategies will come to fruition with many positive results. There are obstacles, and there will always be obstacles; however, we thrive in this environment. 2019 will be significantly better than 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2018 for Unireach?</h4><p>The market started to improve in 3Q2018, and, as a result, our clients imported more goods as compared to 2017 and 1H2018. This gave us an indication that Nigeria's economy is bouncing back, which is why we have high hopes for 2019.</p><h4>What kind of goods are you focusing on the most?</h4><p>In 2017, following the devaluation of the naira, big manufacturers that used to import 200 containers a month dropped almost 60% of their importation but in 3Q2018 we saw a significant increase in importation. We bring in different types of finished goods for traders such as electronics, chemicals, spare parts, machineries, and other construction materials, and recently we got in the supply chain of a couple of oil and gas companies.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the diversification of the group?</h4><p>In mid-2017, we partnered with Premium Partners, a multinational company operating in 19 countries including Nigeria. It is specialized in marketing and procurement solutions. We offer procurement solutions and provide companies with what they require in order to promote and market their products. We have major clients such as Swipha, BAT, IHS, and Airtel, for example. </p><h4>Are you exploring further areas of diversification?</h4><p>That has been a major focus for us since 2017, when we established Select Minerals in order to trade in minerals. We have identified local medium to large miners and suppliers throughout Nigeria and have established a business relationship with offtakers abroad. In fact, we are presently busy delivering our first pilot shipment. </p><h4>How are you trying to gain more clients for Unireach?</h4><p>Initially, Unireach was focused on turnkey, full supply chain projects for telecoms, power, construction, and mainly inbound and outbound CAPEX for existing and new clients. When the naira devaluated, many projects were put on hold. We had to widen our angle and approach regular importers, since we have the infrastructure, expertise, and manpower to do the job. It has proven to be the right decision for us.</p><h4>What is your financial engineering strategy to further finance your growth?</h4><p>We have been working with local banks and have proposed to expand the business together because. We can use financing from banks to keep investing in the market. We have been using our own working capital to expand the business for the last 10 years and we can keep on doing that but since there are several new opportunities—we could make use of more finances. Discussions are still ongoing on that matter.</p><h4>How challenging is the Nigerian transportation sector? Has there been any progress in road conditions?</h4><p>Logistics-related services in general are considered to be one of the most challenging and stressful businesses in the world, and the lack of local supporting infrastructure at Lagos ports makes the job even tougher for us. There has not been much progress in that area, unfortunately. In April 2018, the transport union held a large-scale strike due to the quality of roads around the port and, as a result, transportation costs drastically increased, by up to 300%. However, fortunately, it has dropped slightly from January 2019, mainly due to government improvement of road network. </p><h4>Do you see your efforts hampered by degraded roads?</h4><p>Yes, to a certain extent. Roads are generally in bad shape, and we ended spending large sums of money on trucks repairs. For that reason, we got rid of our trucks and outsourced the whole transportation sector to reliable haulage partners of ours. A few months ago, the cost of transportation within Nigeria was almost equivalent to the sea freight cost of a container from China to Lagos port.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>I am an optimistic person and even in the worst years I remained positive. We have a good feeling about 2019 based on the number of bids, projects, and requests we are constantly receiving from existing and new clients. We are confident of the level of services we provide at Unireach and the trust of our clients keeps us going forward. We believe that the best is yet to come. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your mix-use development in Lekki?</h4><p>It is extremely unique. It is a mid-market development for us, though many people would still call it luxury because it is 60% of the price of what we are selling here, if not less. That is also exciting because it is a new concept altogether. It is a residential development on top of an entertainment area. We have a swimming pool, tennis courts, gardens, basement parking for cars, and 20,000sqm of shopping mall. It will be amazing.</p><h4>What makes the Lekki development a better investment compared to your luxury tower on Bourdillon in Ikoyi?</h4><p>The apartments in the Bourdillon tower are 510sqm; they are huge. They are meant for owners and occupiers. To rent, the yields would be extremely low. When people rent homes in Nigeria, it is based on the number of bedrooms. The Lekki development is based on European sizes, and we have one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments and significantly smaller sizes, which is great for investment. The profiles of our buyers are people buying it for their children or investing in apartments that they can later rent out. Once that development is complete, it will command the rental rate of the entire area. It is a great target for the diaspora, which has a great problem investing here because when they send money back for investment, the money just disappears. This development provides a safer channel for them to invest their money. Our partner in this project is Africa Capital Alliance, one of the biggest private equity funds in Nigeria.</p><h4>How do you plan to target the diaspora?</h4><p>We have several ideas; we are reaching out to professional associations, Nigerian doctors associations in the US and the UK, architects, churches, and others.</p><h4>What should be done to fill the housing gap in Nigeria, and should the government cover part of the cost?</h4><p>Anything the government provides for free does not really work, which is the case globally. It should instead facilitate. The government could provide tax breaks for people who want to set up industries; it does not have to be outright grants. It can create tax breaks for the concrete industry, for example, to produce bricks.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the progress made in the timing for construction permits, taxes, and land registration periods?</h4><p>Consent fees are still 6 or 7%, so they have not fallen. Moreover, the government has just increased land use charges and multiplied the land use cost by 10. Taxes are on the rise as well. There is a huge disconnect between what the government wants to do and how plans are being implemented. The failure has always been in the implementation.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the industry?</h4><p>This is currently the best time to come in and invest. We hit rock bottom in 2017, and the only way now is up. There is demand and greater stability in the forex market, which was a huge problem before. Now, there is more visibility and stability, and demand has increased.</p><h4>Some believe oversupply in the luxury market is due to the fact that such developments are not actually luxury. What is your opinion?</h4><p>I disagree; the market contracted and many companies reviewed their housing policies. For example, some companies used to house their staff in Ikoyi and Victoria Island and now they give them allowances. Demand has fallen, which is why we are looking at the middle end, and it is strategic because it is with the private equity fund. This is our first venture with a private equity fund.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>With the elections behind us, things will start moving quickly. 2019 looks good for us; we have a fairly great pipeline of work. We will complete our fourth project and are looking at something else in the luxury end as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the Department of Transportation's priorities over the past years?</h4><p>At least 100 people enter Lagos State every hour and the majority of them decide to stay. However, since Nigeria's independence in the 1960s, Lagos' infrastructure, when the state's population was less than 3 million, has not improved to accommodate a population that is now 10 times larger. In addition, the pipelines for the distribution of petroleum products are regularly sabotaged and dysfunctional, posing another key issue, especially considering that Lagos is the origin of most of the petroleum products used across Nigeria. Moreover, with the key Apapa and Tin Can ports in Lagos, the city imports goods for two-thirds of Nigeria's 180 million people. Our challenges have further increased because of the laxity observed in terms of regulation of those activities. Notably, since Nigeria is run by a federal system of governmens, the state government is constrained as bridges and highways around ports are to be maintained by the federal government.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the waterways?</h4><p>I am excited about water transportation because of the size of its expected impact. At least a quarter of Lagos' surface area comprises water but, unfortunately, water transportation accounts for less than 2% of total transportation, mainly because water transportation requires huge, long-term investments along with the fact that a large number of Nigerians are unaccustomed to water transport. Nonetheless, I commissioned a thinktank to develop a roadmap that was later shared with the governor, who provided his input. Similarly, we held a Water Transportation Roundtable with representatives from South Africa, the US, the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany, and all parties showed interest in investing in the plan. Other than that, what is important is to involve the two ports of Lagos into discussion because they clog up the major arteries of the main road system. We need to develop jetties, terminals, and water lines to ensure that the unidirectional movements can be reduced by distributing traffic across the waterways.</p><h4>What is the timeframe for the waterways project?</h4><p>The University of Lagos has agreed to host the pilot project so that we can make use of its research facilities in terms of the mechanical and passenger movement. Importantly, the university has a waterfront and at least 50,000 people visit it every day, allowing us to test run the water transport solution. According to my estimates, the university project can kick off by the end of 2019. By 2020, we want to scale up with financial and other partners. We are aware that we need to further advocate the project and spread knowledge regarding its benefits to counter common fears. </p><h4>What is the Ministry of Transportation's outlook in 2019?</h4><p>The challenges we face right now present a great opportunity for us to think outside of the box and harness the great potential we have in terms of human capacity and the potential for water transportation. In addition, high on the agenda is the use of renewable energies and how we can harness this to solve the challenges and create opportunities for our people. Lagos State, in terms of economic size, is the fifth-largest in Africa, and if we harness the potential of the water transportation sector, we can deepen the economic base to a point where Nigeria can catch up with Algeria, which is ranked fourth, and beyond. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[keep-on-trucking]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on your milestone projects?</h4><p>The establishment of our maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) center was extremely important for us. It is an important facility focused on aircraft maintenance, and we are advisers to the Federal Ministry of Transportation (aviation). The procurement process is ongoing. We are working on a PPP for a truck-transit park for the Nigeria Shippers Council that will be a rest area for truckers, so they do not end up parked on roads. We are also working on the Agge Deep Seaport. We are working with state and federal governments on various projects across Nigeria.</p><h4>Moving forward, which areas promise the greatest opportunities for growth?</h4><p>Provision of road infrastructure and electronic tolls will represent a large area of growth. This includes the development of toll roads, truck parks, and logistics facilities. Rail will also be another growth sector over the next decade. We need to truly look at our rail strategy, because one of the things I am focused on is recovering our investment via utilization. We have to think about what we want to put on rail before we build the rail infrastructure. Rail is not city-driven; it is driven from the perspective of the provision of infrastructure. The rail system should have a primary rail line to major cities and secondary rail lines to smaller cities. We currently have a rail line that greatly reduces the efficiency of travel between cities that should have extremely speedy rail connections. There is a great deal of opportunity in aviation as well, and this comes in the form of airport concessions of the international airports, which need complete upgrade and expansion. When Lagos Airport was built, it was meant to cater to about 500,000 passengers per annum; today, it is doing 8 million. We need to transform the airports and subsequently the experience of travelers. As the industry grows, there will be opportunities for ground handling companies as well. All over the world, the growth of private aviation is expanding.</p><h4>How would you assess the transportation and infrastructure sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>The transportation sector is filled with opportunities, and as our country grows the opportunities will grow. There is a whole gamut of investment that will be required. Power is a great example of a growth area that is also extremely complex. However, these sectors need long-term investment. In the past, we sold assets in foreign currency that will only generate naira returns, which makes it hard to hedge against risk. There is thus a great opportunity, though it is critical for the government to review the processes of all these opportunities. I am not a great fan of bureaucracy; we need to address the things that make our economy slower and less efficient. Our infrastructure issues cause the government to turn more to the private sector, and the private sector needs to move at the speed we are used to. We need a joint understanding that we have a large infrastructure deficit, and we need to come together to find an efficient and effective way forward. We need to move faster and guarantee that people invest. We see improvements, though we need to greatly improve the speed with which we do transactions.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Catamaran Group in 2019?</h4><p>We want to expand our offerings in terms of PPP advisory services in 2019. We are looking at certain opportunities in the maritime sector that we want to invest in. We are also looking at opportunities in toll roads, both in Nigeria and West Africa. We are actively putting in proposals for toll roads, and we hope that over the next one to two years we will be able to start that. We also hope that our inland container depot will begin operations, and we want to expand our maritime training operations. Our container tracking business will also start in 2019. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the current business environment in Nigeria?</h4><p>It was definitely better in 2018, though it took longer to turn around from 2017 than we had hoped. We now see some real activity with stability in the foreign exchange market, higher oil prices, and the government understanding the challenges better. It took the new administration a bit of time to assess the situation and put its policies in place.</p><h4>Has the government's policy to promote local companies, industry, and the Made in Nigeria brand worked?</h4><p>The Made in Nigeria campaign resulted not only from policy, but also from circumstance. It was expensive to import anything, and we realized the country did not need to do this. There was a shift to businesses operating at a commercial level that made sense. First, because people could not access the dollar and, second, it was difficult to price one's goods in naira when businesses materials were imported in dollars. The focus turned inward to determine what could be produced in-country. People also started focusing more on trying to export. This showed it is possible to operate here despite the transportation infrastructure challenges. People started realizing it is possible to use local raw materials for their finished products. Many international companies moved out of the country as well because the unfavorable forex situation meant it did not make economic sense for them to stay here.</p><h4>How did the international companies leaving Nigeria impact your client base and business?</h4><p>Many of our clients were in the oil and gas service sector; hence, there was a significant impact. We had to shift our focus from predominantly oil and gas clients; now, we have many commercial clients in Nigeria as well. This forced us to look at a different model, particularly partnering with other companies to have backward integration of our services. We are also considering doing things directly ourselves because the more of the chain we can manage and control, the better the solution we can provide to clients. Especially in logistics, it is about finding solutions for our clients to create a better platform in order to grow our business.</p><h4>Do you see the road logistics situation improving in the near future?</h4><p>We are still months away from the road network improving. The new road is being done; however, trailer parks need to be built where trucks can wait, off the road. There are many truck breakdowns, though another problem was trucks blocking the roads. If there is somewhere for them to wait to come into the port, it will make a big difference. </p><h4>What are your expectations from 2019?</h4><p>As the business environment picks up, 2019 will see an improvement on 2018 in terms of activity levels and some of the policies will come to fruition. Hopefully 2019 will be a better year. For Eko Support Services as a company, we want to get the technology and software we require, which will have to be custom-made for us. We are in talks with bright young programmers here, as well as with a company in the US about designing and assisting us with exactly what we need. If we manage to do this and increase Eko Support Services' footprint, we will be able to provide a better and complete logistics solution, not only to the oil and gas sector, but to other sectors as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the ministry's priorities in terms of improving infrastructure?</h4><p>The priority is the railway. There are 84,000km of rail in Africa and nearly 80% of that is found in South Africa while the rest is mostly in North Africa. West Africa has not done well with railway integration in terms of transportation; what it has is mostly for the transportation of cargo. Road transportation suffers significantly in West Africa and most parts of Africa because we move our freight by road. The government has worked to enhance the movement of goods and services and ensure that we protect our roads. We have engaged GE for a concession agreement to rebuild about 3,300km of roads. We are also working on the standard gauge railway, where we have concluded 108km between Abuja and Kaduna and are currently working on 168km between Lagos and Ibadan. We hope to have these completed by December 2018 or early January 2019 and for commercial activities to commence. That is expected to move about 3-5 million tons of cargo by road and pass through Abeokuta, the capital of Ogun state. We are also trying to continue from Ibadan to Kano and have applied for a loan through a Chinese concession. I have also approved seeking facilities that will let us construct towers and 500km of rail from Lagos to Calabar, the south flank of our rail system. We have also approved building 3,000km of rail line from Port Harcourt to Maiduguri, passing through all the state capitals along that line. All these rail lines will cover most of the country, and a line from Abuja to Etabi will be outstanding. Railway is definitely the focus, though we are also doing a great deal for aviation and maritime.</p><h4>What challenges do local airlines face today and what potential does Nigeria have to become an aviation hub in Africa?</h4><p>The challenge for local airlines is that they require the facilities; it is not only about airport infrastructure and the terminals but also about flying from point A to point B safely and ensuring that everything else is perfect because it is a delicate form of transport. If all the facilities are not in place, then passengers' lives are in danger; therefore, we emphasize safety first and after that security. We are currently focused on building airport terminals. Nigeria could be a hub within the West African region as it takes about four hours to North Africa, four hours to East Africa, and about six hours to South Africa. It is also six hours to London, between nine and 10 hours to the US, and 13 hours to China. Typically, people say there is no infrastructure for transport; however, there has to be infrastructure to understand which transport will be made available. If we make all the seaports available but there are no vessels coming, then it is useless.</p><h4>What is the progress on road construction to Apapa port?</h4><p>Roads in swampy areas and even elsewhere cannot be constructed in one month; they take up to two years and we have contractors working onsite to complete the project. This affects business and currently we are trucking most of the cargo via a safe road through the Nairobi Nigeria line.</p><h4>What framework is Nigeria looking at in terms of future infrastructure investment?</h4><p>The president encourages local investors, foreign investors, and PPP arrangements. We have to create employment and to do so, we have to create job opportunities. With maritime, railways, and airlines we encourage PPPs and foreign investors to come in. We would be glad to enter into partnership with investors who want to engage in funding any form of transportation.</p><h4>How attractive is doing business in Nigeria for foreign investors?</h4><p>There are 180 million Nigerians, which represents the staying power of India and China. So companies can never make a loss. Nigerians certainly have purchasing power for commodities, which is what we tell investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the latest investments in agriculture in the last few years?</h4><p>Our strategic vision is to feed the nation every day. As the leading food and agro-allied business in Nigeria, our focus has always been to build linkages and become fully integrated right from the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors across the food value chain. In the agro-allied space, we have continued to consolidate our investments in the five key value chains of starch, sweeteners, protein, oil and fat, and grains. In Kwara State, we have a 3,500-ha cassava farm where we cultivate and produce cassava tubers in partnership with smallholder farmers and farmers groups through an outgrower scheme. We have also invested in a processing plant where we convert the cassava tubers into high-quality cassava flour and have recently developed a local content product line,  introducing Golden Penny Garri to the market. Garri is a popular staple food in Nigeria, and while the product itself is not new, ours is perhaps the first attempt to produce garri on an industrial scale.</p><h4>What crops are the most relevant in your portfolio?</h4><p>We are directly involved in the cultivation of sugarcane, cassava, maize, palm, and soybean. While a significant percentage of our wheat is still imported, we have invested considerably in developing local capacity. We actively support the Wheat Farmers Association of Nigeria through R&amp;D, provision of high yielding seeds, and other initiatives aimed at promoting Nigeria's vision for self-sufficiency in wheat production. Palm oil, is however, our mainstay. Nigeria used to be the biggest producer of palm oil in the 1950s and 1960s, and although we have long lost our edge in the global market, the government is working hard to return to the world stage. Over the years, FMN has invested heavily in the development of the oils and fat value chain in Nigeria. For instance, in Edo state, we have a 4,500-ha oil palm plantation that provides raw materials for our edible oils factory.<br>How would you assess the current business environment?<br>Things are improving at the macroeconomic level. Policies are now clearer, more stable, and are being properly executed. Newer policies that are introduced are also more inclusive, which is extremely important to encourage investment. The government's initiative for the ease of doing business in Nigeria has been extremely helpful, especially in terms of infrastructural development. We have also observed improved monetary policies, leading to better lending and lower rates.</p><h4>What is FMN's vision for import substitution?</h4><p>First, we must lay the foundation for agriculture by looking at soft and hard infrastructure. We recently announced a partnership with DowDuPont to develop high-yielding hybrid seeds for maize, soybean, cassava, and palm oil. The partnership will also promote modern farming techniques and practices for local production, including crop protection. Moreover, there is a need to lay the foundation for fertilizers, and several companies have started to move into that sector. We also need to take a closer look at proper agronomy methods—to train and increase capacity by choosing the right seed, chemicals, and other modern agronomic practices. Irrigation is also extremely important as we cannot continue to rely solely on rain-fed agriculture. Similarly, the government has to develop crop-processing zones as crops cannot be grown in the north and processed in the south. That is our model and vision to get Nigeria on the map of developed agricultural states.</p><h4>What do you expect for FMN and the general business environment in 2019?</h4><p>Nigeria has just emerged from some of the most challenging times for businesses. While we are appreciative of the improving economy, things are still somewhat fragile, although it is important to note that the government is doing everything possible to build the base for stability. 2019 can only be a growth year for us in terms of increasing our market share in the sectors that we operate in. Notably, our share price more than doubled over the last year. In the agro-allied space, we are securing our supply chain and ensuring that our core food business continues to get stronger.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Have you recently experienced any uptake in Nigeria's business environment?</h4><p>We see definite signs of recovery in the economy, particularly in the construction industry, which is one of our key sectors. This indicates that there are further investments and infrastructure projects going on in the country. If Nigeria were to follow normal economic indicators, we should see significantly higher growth, but we are not. This is not yet a reason for concern, but being a major driver for our business, we will keep a close watch. We still expect our businesses to progress steadily in the coming months. However, we must watch out for a certain number of indicators. From our perspective, despite the progress made, there are huge gaps in the development of infrastructure, education, and healthcare, which are all necessary for the ultimate uplifting of any country. The oil and gas, upstream, agriculture, and construction segments are all doing relatively well, but it would not take much to disrupt the system if the oil and gas sector were to experience a major shock.</p><h4>What has led to the current state of the consumer market?</h4><p>The consumer market is heavily dependent on disposable income. It does not take much for a market such as ours to slow down once the economy comes under pressure. There is pressure on disposable income due to high unemployment rates, coupled with double-digit inflation. Nigeria is one of the few countries in Africa where GDP growth does not necessarily translate into development. That is a major constraint because development means more schools, better healthcare, and improved infrastructure, pulling the entire economy forward in the long run.</p><h4>Have some suspended projects resumed due to better economic conditions?</h4><p>Due to the recession, there was a dearth of infrastructural development in 2017, but there have been significant investments by the government in 2018, as many railways, roads, and bridges are currently underway. </p><h4>How has the ease of doing business in Nigeria improved?</h4><p>The process of registering a business for a new entrant has been simplified considerably. The situation has undoubtedly improved, but Nigeria remains one of the most complex places to run a business in the world. Looking at it from an investment standpoint, Nigeria is competing against countries like Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, or the Ivory Coast, and Nigeria needs to continue to put in efforts to facilitate managing businesses. A major issue is the condition of ports, which are extremely congested, especially due to poor road networks. All these factors affect our ability to create more value in Nigeria. In addition, this does not help us convince our internal investors to do more business in Nigeria, and I am certain it is the same for other multinational companies.</p><h4>Do you import any raw materials?</h4><p>We only import the raw materials that cannot be sourced locally. The challenge is, due to the sophisticated level of the technology required to produce these inputs and the absence of a minimum critical mass for technology-driven manufacturing, we have yet to find local substitutes for them. We will keep working on developing locally available substitutes, as we know that is the best way to create the value here in Nigeria.</p><h4>In 2017, you had plans to increase the number of BASF global businesses entering Nigeria. How has that progressed?</h4><p>We have doubled what we had in 2017. So far, in 2018, six more business entered the market, two of which were completely unexpected for us. This is a clear indication that some of our internal investors still see potential in Nigeria. Sustainability is fast becoming a major topic for us in Nigeria. At present, we have opportunities for circular economy projects and new business models. We will not necessarily do this all by ourselves; we see ourselves as enablers for several small and large businesses, particularly social entrepreneurs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us some background into your business and activities?</h4><p>Coronation Capital is focused on the key sectors of financial services, consumer goods and services, and technology solutions in Nigeria and other West African economies. We bring together dynamic businesses and strong management teams that together create stable platforms for future growth and expansion in home markets and throughout West Africa and the entire continent. Our goal is to create African champions. All businesses in Africa, even those that have performed well over time, require a great deal of work to develop into champions. For us, a major component of that success comes from focusing on environmental, social, and governance issues (ESG). In order to create a sustainable and successful business, one must be focused on successfully addressing ESG issues. We spend a great deal of time working with companies to inculcate these vital aspects of a modern business.</p><h4>What is your strategy to identify companies with attractive investment opportunities?</h4><p>We focus on our strengths. For example, we actively seek to invest in the financial services sector where we have deep institutional knowledge and a history of real leadership from both an operations and investment perspective. We are also focused broadly on consumer products and services. For us, this includes food and beverage, retail, and fast-food restaurants, as well as light manufacturing, education, and healthcare. The consumer space is important for us, because a large part of the Nigerian and African story are the attractive demographics. These demographics speak to a growing young population moving into the middle class that demands products and services. Additionally, we look at technology-enabled solutions. This includes fintech, online insurance products, or any innovative way that solves a problem we find in our market.</p><h4>How large is the typical company you invest in?</h4><p>We typically look to write equity checks of USD10-25 million. If we are investing in a platform we may scale that investment over time with add-on acquisitions. This generally translates into companies with USD15-50 million. We are able to structure our transactions in a way that meet the needs of investee company shareholders and also provide us the flexibility to optimally manage our investments and exits. </p><h4>What is the role of capital markets in the economic development of Nigeria?</h4><p>This is an interesting and vexing question. Our capital markets are not as robust as they could be. Capital markets are a way that many companies around the world finance their operations. However, the lack of IPOs is a real challenge in this market. It is a multifaceted issue, and there are different ways to tackle it. As a nation and as individual market participants, we are trying to find ways to keep the ball rolling. For example, we have a budding pension industry in Nigeria, which is broadly modeled off the Chilean system. This model has proven to be a huge success in Chile. At one point, there were 20 or so pension businesses, though over time regulations and business development whittled this down to a handful of strong players. The contribution scheme is such that pension funds have to invest a large amount of capital into the Chilean stock market. This created a robust capital market in Chile, and it has been an engine of growth in the country. We hope for something like that to occur here. We still have many pension businesses, though there will be a great deal of consolidation over time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did your expansion plans progress in 2018, including opening a South Africa office?</h4><p>We modified our strategy and are working on setting up a banking license, as we feel there is space within the commercial banking sector, which is why we broadened our service offering to ensure an enduring customer base. We currently have the investment banking business, which is Cowry Asset with an issuing house, underwriting, and financial advisory services. We also have Cowry Treasurers, a mutual fund manager, and Cowry Realty, which came about due to the needs of our customers. Many of our customers have their wealth in real estate; therefore, we set up Cowry Realty to manage their real estate assets. </p><h4>Did you see an uplift in the economy in 2018?</h4><p>Some aspects of our business saw a major increase, such as wealth management. The size of the portfolios we manage tripled in 2018. Because of the economic downturn, many investors did not want to manage their resources themselves, so we enjoyed a lot of referrals throughout the year. </p><h4>Are you trying to keep a balance between corporate and individual clients?</h4><p>Around 60% of our clients are high net worth individuals, but corporate clients give us more volume but less income. For visibility you need the corporate clients, even though they give minimal income. </p><h4>In 2Q2018 the oil sector shrank by 4%, whereas the non-oil sector and services grew by 3.1% and 2.1%. Does this make you more optimistic? </h4><p>In 2018, the oil sector shrank by 4% in Q3 but still contributed 8.8% to GDP. When you look at the oil sector performance you are looking at volume of production, which was about 1.8 million barrels per day, while the government target was 2.3 million. If the rate of production is higher you will see an uptake in terms of that sector's performance, but if the performance is lower you will see a decrease. The reduction we saw in terms of crude production was more than compensated for in terms of crude prices. When you have negative volume but positive price variance, the implication is that the other sectors of the economy will still report a decline. The oil and gas sector contributes around 8.5 to 9% to GDP, but the main contributor to the GDP is the agriculture sector, followed by trade, telecommunications, manufacturing, oil, and construction. If you look at non-oil sectors, the agricultural sector slowed from a 3.2% to a 3%. Manufacturing and telecommunications also slowed down, while trade came out of recession.</p><h4>40% of tax revenues come from the oil sector, which only represents 8.5% of GDP. How can this be changed?</h4><p>Other sectors have to grow. The tax rate in the oil and gas sector is steep: the petroleum tax is about 95%. It is high compared to all other industries. Corporate tax in Nigeria is 30%. In addition, because the hydrocarbon tax is calculated in dollar terms, when you convert it to naira it is even higher, while other taxes are calculated in naira. For that to reverse, a couple of things need to happen. The economy needs to be formalized, as a lot of economic activities are not taxed correctly since the government cannot track them. The largest economic sector, agriculture, is not formalized, and hence 20% of the economy off the bat is not taxed. The trade sector accounts for 16% of GDP, but again, many traders do not have formal structures so are not taxed. You need major formalization to generate tax revenue from these huge sectors. </p><h4>How competitive is the sector for the type of services you provide?</h4><p>We provide a more personalized service than most of our competitors, and in a lot of instances we end up creating a close personal relationship with our clients. They cannot get this kind of personalized service from conventional banks. You can have somebody that will call you at 1am just to clarify something or ask you a question, which cannot be done with most of the financial institutions. We have developed a culture that fits into the Nigerian social fabric. We build a personal relationship so that the client feels attached to you. That is the key element to private banking, which a lot of large institutions do not have the capacity to provide. </p><h4>What is your outlook for Cowry in 2019?</h4><p>2019 will be interesting both for the company and country. To look at the prospects for the former, we need to consider the outlook for the economy, which starts at the political level. With the elections now behind us, investor confidence will be restored. Some people think the economy will boom, but we do not. We expect there will be a scramble for Nigerian assets. The Nigerian stock market lost close to 18% of its value, but beyond that, the price-to-earnings ratio of any of these companies fell 9 to 10 times to among the lowest in Africa today. That means that people who bought into Nigerian equities before the elections are now seeing a recovery, which means we see a lot of investment opportunities. We also expect a lot of FDI in the form of equity in corporate entities. These are areas that will play major roles where we guide foreign investors on where to invest. We also help local institutions invest, either within or outside the country. Finally, we think the bond market will recover in 2019 and generate good returns. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What projects have you completed since establishing the company?</h4><p><span></span>Since closing the fund, we have invested equity in two major projects. One is in Nigeria, the Azura-Edo independent power plant (IPP), a 459-MW open cycle power generation plant constructed on the outskirts of Benin City in Edo State. The project went into commercial operation in May 2018 and has since been contributing between 6 and 9% to the national grid. The second project is in Ghana, also in power generation. It is called the Amandi IPP, a 200-MW combined cycle power plant that we are currently constructing in Aboadze, in the country's Western Region. That should supply power to Ghana in 2019. We are in the process of closing a port deal in Ghana that, when complete, will provide world-class ship and oilrig repairs and maintenance facilities. It will be critical and value enhancing for ship operators, because today many vessels operating in West African waters are compelled to go to Spain or South Africa for maintenance services owing to the lack of such facilities locally.</p><h4>What geographical areas and sectors do you focus on?</h4><p>Geographically, we focus on West Africa. In terms of sectors, we have three pillars: transportation, energy, and utilities. In transportation, we are interested in everything from toll roads and bridges to airports, seaports, and railways. In energy, we have power generation assets and are also focused on processing gas-to-power. Utilities include water and wastewater treatment and management and selected parts of telecoms and data traffic. We currently have projects in all those spaces in our pipeline.</p><h4>How challenging is it to find local investors willing to invest in infrastructure?</h4><p>Infrastructure as an asset class has long been known to international investors, where the latter struggle is with the risk profile of Nigeria and other countries in the region. Conversely, while local investors are familiar with the risk profile of the country, they often struggle to understand the complexities of the infrastructure, legal, and financing aspects. This is partly owing to the environment in which we operate in Nigeria; political and regulatory risk is an issue, and roads, power, water, healthcare, and every other strand of infrastructure is currently in poor condition and insufficient for Nigerians' needs. Historically, it has been the privy of government to be the sole providers of infrastructure. Only recently, with us among the pioneers, has private investment started to come into that space. The involvement of private investors sometimes makes end users reluctant to pay. For example, if there is a belief that this would be lining private pockets or fueling corruption. But there have also been genuine concerns about whether value for money is being provided through such privately financed infrastructure projects. Without proper funding, including through people paying tax or paying directly through tariffs or tolls, the country's infrastructure is bound to remain dilapidated. Another issue with local investors is that they do not want their funds to be tied down for a 25 or 30-year concession because of the short economic cycles historically driven by high inflation, high currency volatility, and political uncertainty. People are not yet fully accustomed to taking long-term investment exposure. We need an entire cultural transformation to get people to understand it can be done. Finally, there is a lack of a maintenance culture. The entire ecosystem of someone providing, regulating, and maintaining it is essential for infrastructure to be sustainable. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the driver behind establishing the company? </h4><p>The company commenced operations in 2016. My partners and I had spent most of our working lives in international banks, and felt it was important for us to carve out a niche for ourselves. Over the years, the reality has been such that, particularly in fixed-income markets, the major players are banks, pension funds, institutional investors, and insurance companies, while the retail investing community is shouldered from the benefits of those markets. Therefore, we began a journey of financial inclusion. We wanted to set up an investment banking firm and develop our own products. Comercio Partners has three broad pillars: the trading arm, overseen by Nnamdi Nwizu; the investment arm, which I oversee; and the advisory arm overseen by Steve Osho. Under trading, we cover fixed income, equities, and derivatives markets. The Nigeria derivatives market still remains highly unpenetrated, and it is far from where developed markets are today. We started, therefore, with education of corporate treasurers—the buy-side, as hedging solutions are not readily available and tradable in Nigeria. However, due to our collective experience working in international banks, we can readily buy and sell certain derivative products, having established trading relationships with foreign banks and counterparties. We are also currently advising companies spread across more than five sectors (oil &amp; gas, manufacturing, fashion, entertainment, information technology) on debt and equity capital raising in excess of NGN10 billion (about USD27 million). In 2018, we assisted one of our clients in the oil and gas sector to close a project finance deal worth USD2.6 million, raising a bridge finance in the process. Our short-term focus is small and medium-sized companies with good and well-balanced fundamentals. </p><h4>What progress is being made in improving the availability of derivatives in Nigeria?</h4><p>We do not have an OTC market where these products could be easily traded, although I expect one to be established soon. The FMDQ OTC Securities Exchange is unveiling certain initiatives to drive this process. We have decided to localize Nigerian currency futures on an exchange, though it is not yet a standardized exchange, but rather a naira-settled OTC FX Futures with non-deliverable forwards (NDFs). The initiative was intended to address the currency crisis at the time. For any of the foreign capital flows entering the country, you can buy naira-settled futures contracts for up to one-year, which minimizes price risk, although still exposes you to liquidity risk. The Central Bank will subsidize the difference between the spot rate when the contract expires and the price at which you purchased the contract. However, it is your responsibility to source the US dollars from the market through the Investors' and Exporters' (I&amp;E) window. This has been largely successful, as it provides the level of liquidity and fluidity in the FX market for both foreign investors, sellers/buyers of US dollars and exporters, and buyers of US dollars. The creation of the I&amp;E window has indeed influenced the restoration of investors' confidence in the currency market.</p><h4>How would you split the company's three pillars into percentage terms by revenue?</h4><p>Currently, the trading arm, which is largely our bread and butter, contributes approximately 60% to the bottom line, the asset management contributes circa 30% while the advisory injects about 10%. We are still new, and therefore that is the short-term perspective. However, in the medium to long term, the company will certainly be poised to drive a balanced and well-diversified sustainable revenue stream. We have recently deployed a retail investment platform called Tradefi which is set to disrupt the retail fixed-income market. Any individual, HNIs, or the affluent can buy government securities at their convenience from the comfort of their living room. We have brought the retail investing community close to the upper market by leveraging technology to offer competitive returns, liquidity, and safety. An average Nigerian investor sees fixed income as a myth, failing to comprehend the dynamics of that market. It is important for us to address this through technology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Nova bring to Nigeria's banking sector?</h4><p>Today in Nigeria, deposit liabilities and risk assets are extremely short term in nature, and existing commercial banks have not been able to fund long-term assets for clients. We see significant opportunity in this area, despite the difficulty in planning for the long term in Nigeria due to concerns regarding macroeconomic stability. We thrive on innovation, which is also the reason for our name NOVA, which means new. We are working on new ways to serve customers in the financial space by looking at new products and solutions to provide long-term financing for our clients across various sectors of the economy. As we deal with wholesale clients, we will work with offshore partners to provide such funding in addition to participation in risk sharing arrangements. The third area is investment banking, which has not been emphasized in Nigeria because many of the investment banking transactions are still done by offshore financial institutions. We intend to partner with certain major global financial institutions with the view of collaborating with them in such a way that we execute and distribute across various jurisdictions.</p><h4>What products has the bank designed to help businesses attract FDI?</h4><p>A large portion of investment banking transactions is still conducted offshore. Local institutions are not active participants. As an investment bank, we will bring in Nigerian and African diaspora with experience in handling these transactions. We can then collaborate with the offshore financial institutions in terms of distribution due to the size of each of these tickets. Second, many Nigerians who do some form of wealth planning do so offshore. We will collaborate with certain financial institutions to originate those transactions from Nigeria and invest locally.</p><h4>What should be done to minimize the apprehension of investing in Nigeria?</h4><p>We need improved confidentiality and stable exchange rates, as the fear of a significant devaluation is a major concern for investors due to the impact on the value of their assets. Without stability and confidentiality, there is no confidence in the system. Banks like NOVA help customers to understand that the returns here are several times what they can get in Europe, the US, and elsewhere.</p><h4>How does Nova Bank contribute to alleviating the issue of long-term funding and credit?</h4><p>We approach it from two perspectives: the lending facilities that we receive from offshore institutions that will enable us to lend up to 10 years without any problems and the various entities in Nigeria that have been dependent on bank lending. We will nurture and work with them to structure their balance sheets and bring them to the capital market to raise funds in terms of both equity and debt.</p><h4>Why are merchant banks important to Nigeria's economic recovery?</h4><p>By nature, merchant banks deal with wholesale/corporate clients that have many financial needs, particularly with regard to structuring their balance sheets and the provision of advice. That is a major role that a merchant bank plays; a client might believe they require credit facilities while in fact they need a restructuring of their balance sheet by way of more vendor or supplier credit. A merchant bank sits down with clients and helps structure their books so they can achieve more in terms of balance sheet efficiency in addition to lowering their funding costs</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>2018 was our first full year of operations, and we were able to break even in 2017. There is a full range of products that we have not yet deployed that will come online in 2019. With our lean operations and efficiency focus, we aim to have the lowest cost-to-income ratio in the industry. We want to be the most efficient bank in Nigeria. 2019 will therefore be a great year as we continue to build a sustainable business with consistent growth from year to year without volatility in our earnings. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Coronation Merchant Bank's main services in Nigeria?</h4><p>Coronation Merchant Bank traded in securities for around 23 years and subsequently became a merchant bank. Today, we are strong in fixed-income and currency trading businesses. We are the third-largest bank in Nigeria by volume market shares in naira fixed-income trading, although our balance sheet is not as large as some of our competitors. We also have developed our corporate banking department and are now among the major names. Treasury and corporate banking now represent more than 85% of our revenue. As an investment bank, our goal is to grow the non-interest income revenues, such as investment banking, asset management, and equity brokerage. In the last three years, that line has increased from about 4% of our income to 12%.</p><h4>How did the bank record such positive results despite the climate?</h4><p>Coming into the market at a time when the market is tough, one learns to survive. 2015 was the peak of difficulties in Nigeria, when oil prices started to fall dramatically. We developed a strategy to survive that period; we were able to get excellent corporate clients, having established ourselves to a global standard. We do not look at transactions in forging our relationships; we look at partnerships. This method of operation has helped us, and we are confident it will contribute to the robust development of our business moving forward.</p><h4>How do merchant banks work in aiding economies?</h4><p>For Nigerian businesses, funding at times cannot be obtained through borrowing; long-term, renewable capital is required. The institutions that help raise this long-term capital are typically merchant banks. In Nigeria, commercial banks are not allowed to undertake capital markets operations. To raise funds with a longer turnaround, it is necessary to source money from the capital markets, and merchant banks in Nigeria play that role. Companies that run into trouble because of the economic situation need to be restructured, and restructuring is a highly specialized role performed by merchant banks. When Nigerian businesses need to acquire such skills, they come to merchant banks. In terms of capital markets, that is where merchant banks play the crucial role while commercial banks cannot.</p><h4>What do the macroeconomic fundamentals look like in Nigeria?</h4><p>The GDP print was 1.5% YoY for 2Q2018, though non-oil GDP rose 2.05% YoY over the same period. The IMF looks at 2.1% growth for 2018, the World Bank predicts 2.8%, and the Central Bank of Nigeria estimates somewhere around 2.4%. On the 10-year view, the economy grew around 5% per year, so the economy is not reaching its potential. The reason is not a shortage of money coming in, but sluggishness in restructuring. We expected investment to increase in cases where companies were restructured during the recession, though there have not been many instances of this. On the demand side, certain classes of consumers have not seen their fortunes improve. In an economic region like Lagos State, whose economy depends greatly on services, consumers have had a tough time over the past three years, particularly salary earners. In the countryside, certain classes of farmer have had easier times, and with the devaluation of the naira, parts of the countryside have become significantly wealthier than before. This is also because of government policy for agriculture. Agricultural GDP is growing at 3% per year and never went into recession. While the economy experienced a five-quarter recession, the agriculture sector never did. There will always be growth somewhere in the economic cycle.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>We will become closer to our customers, giving us a competitive edge. As for the macroeconomic outlook, with the election behind us, we will see money coming in that was waiting on the sidelines, and investment levels will go up. There are big fund restructurings happening, and it will be a great time to trade assets and capitalize on private equity investments in Nigeria. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about YOA and its portfolio of operations?</h4><p>YOA Insurance started in 2002 as specialist insurance brokers to the energy sector, though over the years it has expanded its scope of services, focusing on varying sectors within the economy. We are the exclusive network partners in Nigeria to JLT Specialty Limited, one of the largest international insurance broking groups. In the last five years, we have extended our expertise into the manufacturing and service sectors. Our name originates from the initials of Olayinka Omilani, our chairman, the founder of Yinka Omilani &amp; Associates, the first indigenous firm of insurance loss adjusters. The company was known for its experience in maritime and oil and gas-related risk.</p><h4>How is your client base split between corporations and individuals?</h4><p>At present, it is mainly corporations; however, we are evolving our strategy to grow both businesses simultaneously. At 0.4%, Nigeria is the least penetrated insurance market, so there is huge potential. Consequently, we decided as part of our group strategy to get involved in direct business, which is why we set up YOA Direct for the retail end of our business and managing closed insurance schemes for organizations.</p><h4>Would it be more convenient for yourself and other insurance companies to keep targeting the corporate side?</h4><p>We will continue to target the corporate side but in a different way. The existing marketplace is getting more competitive, and margins are shrinking. So, in serving corporates, we find that providing more specialized needs or focusing on emerging industry verticals is the key. Having a client base composed of individuals, too, will make the current portfolio more balanced. Therefore, we are looking at a combination of strategic options to grow the business in the most sustainable manner.</p><h4>How do you plan to penetrate the retail market and raise awareness about insurance?</h4><p>One of the main issues in the retail space is regulation. We need regulations that stimulate new product development and allow them to be quickly approved. Another option is using technology to enable insurance product sales. For example, some insurance companies have partnered with mobile network operators to allow individuals certain types of insurance. Education is also imperative, and to that end, the regulating body and insurance companies have recently collaborated to raise insurance awareness. Nevertheless, we have seen progress in the last decade, with people beginning to see the value in insuring their homes and assets.</p><h4>What role does the government have to play in educating the public and further developing the market?</h4><p>Operators have to play this role as we cannot expect the government to take concrete steps in this direction. We must do this in conjunction with our regulator and this is what is happening at the moment. It is a lot of work and is going to take time as we are dealing with many people who have limited insurance knowledge and awareness.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the company for 2019?</h4><p>In 2019, we are determined to continue growing revenue and optimizing our costs. However, 2019 can potentially be a great year across a few sectors we have identified as our area of growth focus. We also plan to launch some groundbreaking initiatives and will look to diversify our business by going into areas with higher barriers to entry, which is a key aspect of pushing the boundaries of innovation. One of the key strategies we have been pushing over the years is education; it is tremendously important to ensure that we stay up-to-date with market happenings and knowledge acquisition, because the insurance industry is dynamic. Client expectations are evolving, and the Nigerian market is opening up to new opportunities. We, in collaboration with our insurance company partners, are working to develop policies that can be marketed to an emerging clientele base. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[trading-on-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What categories of assets have been traded the most recently?</h4><p>Exchange-traded funds (ETF), for example, track various indices and commodities. The banking ETF returned 70%. This is consistent with the underlying index, which returned about 72%. A tracking error created the difference. The premium board index returned about 54%, and the gold ETF index returned a similar number. When people seek greater stability, they tend to move into gold. On the fixed-income side, the government issued a lot of debt to help finance the recovery. All in all, we have tried to create a platform that will support activity across asset classes.</p><h4>Returns on government bonds in Nigeria have been high and have crowded out investment in corporate stocks. Do you see this situation changing in the near future?</h4><p>It is a classic economic situation. There is a crowding-out effect that the government recognizes. It is one of the things that informed the pivot from the domestic debt market to the foreign debt market in order to allow firms to be able to raise money at a more reasonable price. The government has done a great job in trying to balance the ratio between the debt issued domestically versus foreign debt; it is still working toward the 60-40 ratio. At present, the government is probably closer to 30% of debt in foreign markets, enabling corporates to issue domestic debt. Importantly, the government is using its resources more efficiently and getting funds into the central bank. This has improved productivity in the economy. </p><h4>How can the perception of the Nigerian exchange be enhanced in order for investors to also trade domestic stocks?</h4><p>One of the reasons to invest in Nigerian capital markets is higher returns, and domestic investors are aware of that. Sometimes, people want to list their companies on the bigger markets, because they believe investors will gravitate there. However, they are discovering that those investors do not understand Nigerian businesses. More companies are starting to partner with us, and we have international agreements with other exchanges. We seek to work with bigger stakeholders to make sure we are servicing our issuers properly and they have the financing to achieve their business objectives. We have tightened up a number of things, such as technology, the market structure, business models, and regulations. </p><h4>Indigenous oil companies have been advised to list on the NSE to attract more capital and further scale their business. What is the NSE doing to attract them?</h4><p>Seplat's success opened the window for many oil and gas companies to walk the same path and achieve the same success. There were two critical factors: pioneer status and operatorship. Unfortunately, most of these companies did not get these two things before the 2015 political cycle and economic down turn started, so they could not enter the market. Domestic companies have a great deal to gain from listing here, from stronger corporate governance and better credibility and branding to better access to capital. A great deal of foreign capital flows to our market in search of quality companies. We provide a marketplace that is fair and just. If the macroeconomic situation is stable with growth, companies will list to finance their expansion and in so doing benefit a great deal from the Nigerian market.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>We anticipate 2019 to be another good year, with people operating in an environment that offers more certainty, with hopefully more confidence in the economy and market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the bank contributed to economic diversification in recent years?</h4><p>BOI's mandate is to provide financial assistance for large, medium, and small projects and help the expansion, diversification, and modernization of existing enterprises and the rehabilitation of failing ones. This fits in with the government's diversification drive by leveraging its competitive resources in non-oil sectors, such as agriculture, solid minerals, renewable energy, and the creative and entertainment industries. In the past year, we enhanced our lending profile to provide finances to more Nigerian businesses. This led to an intensive capital-raising drive in the past year that saw BOI raise over USD1 billion, both locally and internationally.</p><h4>How has BOI helped promote the “Made in Nigeria" brand?</h4><p>Buying locally produced goods and services has played an important role in boosting several economies around the world. The case is no different for Nigeria. BOI's efforts to promote the “Made in Nigeria" brand have been all encompassing. We have a partnership with the Dangote Foundation to disburse NGN5 billion (USD16.6 million) to support enterprises engaged in the agro-processing, manufacturing, and trading of Nigerian-made goods. The bank also collaborated with Co Creation Hub (CcHUB), Venture Garden Group, and Omidyar Network in 2016 to launch the USD1-million CcHUB Growth Capital Fund to support indigenous 'next generation infrastructure' technology builders by making early-stage venture equity investments into their businesses. BOI continues to promote “Made in Nigeria" products through schemes such as our Aba Finished Leather Goods Cluster Financing Program. The bank also creates marketplace opportunities for local producers to showcase their products at international trade fairs and events.</p><h4>BOI is among the few players providing funding to Nigeria's entertainment industry. What interest do you have in this sector?</h4><p>The local entertainment industry is projected to grow annually at an average rate of 12.1% between 2016 and 2021, making it the world's fastest-growing entertainment industry. The industry's contribution to the economy is expected to reach USD8.1 billion in 2019, creating significant jobs and FDI opportunities. Nollywood produces around 2,500 movies a year, making it the second-largest global production hub behind India. The industry also provides employment to over 1 million Nigerians. The Nigerian music industry is perhaps a greater success story. In terms of economic contribution, total music revenue in Nigeria reached about USD39 million in 2016, representing a 9% growth YoY, and the industry is projected to grow to about USD73 million by 2021. BOI has been at the forefront of financing the industry with competitive interest rates of below 10% and relatively long repayment periods. To date, the bank has disbursed over NGN13.2 billion (USD37.8 million) to 60 projects across various sub-sectors of the creative industry ecosystem, including content production, distribution and production infrastructure, hospitality and culinary, media and publishing, recreation centers and parks, exhibition arenas and merchandising, sports infrastructure, and arts and crafts. Being an emerging sector, BOI devised an innovative approach to effectively appraise projects from the sector by setting up a team of industry veterans to be part of loan request review process. Our efforts in the industry have not gone unrecognized, as BOI has received several awards both locally and internationally.</p><h4>What is your outlook for BOI in 2019?</h4><p>We closed 2018 with a balance sheet of over NGN1 trillion (USD2.735 billion), and I expect that to increase to NGN1.3 trillion (USD3.556 billion) by 2019. Our policies are aligned with the key objectives of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP). Consequently, in 2019 we expect to increase our provision of lower interest rate loans, provide innovative financing solutions, and increase business advisory services to stimulate growth of enterprises, particularly SMEs. We also want to support women and youth entrepreneurship and identify projects that can stimulate export earnings through the production of high-quality goods that can compete in the international markets. This would eventually reduce imports and support local content development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has í†LEX established its reputation as one of the country's leading law firms in a competitive environment?</h4><p>We realized from the onset it was important to employ excellent lawyers and train them. We start with a recruitment process that enables us to identify talented lawyers for employment. After employment, we have senior lawyers mentor them, and we also engage them in formal training programs. On top of this, we have a secondment program that places associates in client companies for periods of up to 18 months in industries as diverse as banking, oil and gas (upstream and downstream), and beverage manufacturing. We have not rested on our achievements of the past as we always look to improve on our strengths while taking steps to eliminate our weaknesses.</p><h4>What are your main areas of expertise?</h4><p>The firm's practice areas include taxation; dispute resolution—litigation and arbitration; corporate/commercial; mergers and acquisition; energy and power; business reorganization and insolvency; intellectual property; regulatory compliance; technology, media, and telecommunications; banking, finance, and Fintech; transportation—aviation, maritime, and rail; and infrastructure.</p><h4>In which areas do you see the biggest opportunities for the firm's growth in the future?</h4><p>Areas such as the new focus on gas, the booming of the entertainment industry, IP, and ICT are growing and will increasingly demand high-value legal services. I would also include the power, infrastructure, and agriculture sectors. In view of our population, Fintech and healthcare should also be considered growth areas, though their demand for legal services will not be as high.</p><h4>What trends do you observe in the sectors you are most involved in, such as consolidation and increased M&amp;A activity?</h4><p>I want to focus on trends in legal services. There are many trends that are technology driven, especially in banking and Fintech; however, these do not always impact the demand for legal services. On the other hand, the increasing attention being paid by governments at all levels to increased tax collection has led to a rise in tax litigation—an area in which we are renowned. Also, the use of arbitration as the preferred method of resolving commercial disputes continues to grow—that is another area in which we are strong. Our M&amp;A team continues to grow from strength to strength. It recently concluded a large acquisition on behalf of a global beverage company, amongst other deals.</p><h4>What message would you send to the international investor community about doing business in Nigeria?</h4><p>Despite being full of unique opportunities, it can be a challenging environment, though the government has made some strides in improving the ease of business in Nigeria. We are slowly but surely climbing up the rankings as seen in our improved 2019 ranking of 146 out of 190 countries in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, up from 169 in 2017. Admittedly, there is a great deal of work to be done in Nigeria with the challenges faced with doing business in-country. However, Nigeria remains determined to overcome these hurdles.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the legal landscape in Nigeria and for í†LEX in particular in 2019?</h4><p>I look forward to an interesting year, bearing in mind Brexit in the UK and the general elections in Nigeria. It will be interesting to watch how the legal landscape and investor community in Nigeria will be impacted. í†LEX is also looking to explore new opportunities; in this regard, we are expanding our practice areas to reach a wider client base. We are confident that as the economy grows, the demand for legal services will grow. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[signs-of-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision, and what areas will you focus on as the new President &amp; CEO of Transcorp?</h4><p>My vision and focus is informed and shaped first by the agenda set by our Group Chairman, Tony Elumelu, and secondly by the founding philosophy of Transcorp, which is about changing the African story by transforming lives and empowering people. In line with this, I will focus on deepening Transcorp's play in various businesses that Transcorp is currently involved in. Transcorp currently operates in the hospitality, power, and oil and gas sectors. Accordingly, under my leadership, we will pursue our mid- to long-term strategy of providing 25% of Nigeria's power consumption, extend our hospitality presence to key cities and towns starting with Lagos, and develop our oil and gas asset into commercial production. I will also pursue the expansion of existing business lines by bringing in new businesses, preferably from other sectors that Transcorp is currently not operating in. As long-term investors, we prefer sectors that are catalytic and impactful in nature. I have always envisioned Transcorp as a global reference point in terms of governance. Accordingly, I intend to strengthen governance at the management level, which is critical, while supporting the board to ensure consistent improvement in governance structures and practices. </p><h4>How challenging is it to operate in an environment where you have power tariffs?</h4><p>Electricity is a regulated utility worldwide. The challenge in our environment is that existing tariffs are not cost-reflective, thus compelling operators like us to operate under the excruciating burden of indirectly subsidizing the industry. The key impact of the current tariff regime we operate is that our power business is not as profitable as it should be. This impacts our investment capacity negatively, and we are constrained from making the required investments that will enable us  to meet our set capacity expansion targets. This is further compounded by the fact that Transcorp Power is owed huge outstanding payments by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET) for electricity generated and supplied to the national grid; however, we will intensify engagement with key stakeholders to address these issues, which also impact the entire power sector and the Nigerian economy negatively.</p><h4>What can be done to improve the tourism sector and make Nigeria a better leisure and business destination?</h4><p>Tourism is to several countries what oil is to Nigeria. It is the mainstay and biggest income generator and an industry that helps reduce unemployment because for every dollar spent on tourism, more jobs are generated than in any other sector. It is therefore a critical sector not just for the size of the economy but for the real impacts on people. Still, Nigeria has not taken full advantage of its tourism potential and needs to work on a number of factors, such as infrastructure, policy and governance, products and services, and marketing to be able to do this. One of the issues around policy and governance is the lack of standardization. It is not possible to tell if a hotel is ranked three or four stars since there is no proper standardization, and if this simple anomaly can be addressed, the spirit of competition will encourage private-sector operators to up their games to improve the overall service offering. Governments at different levels should create a more enabling environment for people to invest in tourism. Measures like tax incentives or holidays and duty waivers will encourage investments in the sector. There is also a marketing aspect to this. We need to showcase our tradition through museums, artifacts, paintings, sites, and music. Every state governor should be its chief marketing officer. Some governors are doing a great job. A great deal more destination marketing needs to be done. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[UAE Cybersecurity]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[karim-sabbagh-ceo-darkmatter]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the maturity of the cybersecurity sector in the UAE and the wider region?</h4><p>Cybersecurity is a nascent sector in the Middle East, and the discourse around it is still in the making. I would dissect the question of its maturity along three layers: framing the discussion, formulating sound strategies, and executing them effectively. When you are talking with policy-makers or industry leaders, they understand the issue's importance. At both the federal and emirate levels in the UAE, for example, the consideration of cybersecurity is starting to take root in policy and strategy development, with the first federal strategy emerging in 2010. Anchoring the discussion on cybersecurity within the most senior circles of government and business is crucial. In terms of strategy readiness, I would qualify it as a work in progress. This is not specific only to the UAE, but something we see around the world. The reason is two-fold. Cybersecurity is a developing field, but on top of that, it is a field whose technologies, practices, and implications move at a speed unseen in other sectors. Discussions about strategy need to be well-crafted, and we need to know we have a handle on the cybersecurity agenda, both in the public and private sectors; only then can sound policies be made. After that, we come to the third layer, which is the need to make sure policy is executed clearly, with the right checks and balances in place. What we are observing around the world is that in countries with a higher cybersecurity threat level, there is an incentive to take on a more advanced posture. The UAE is in this group. The country has been a formidable and progressive socioeconomic platform in a region where geopolitical tensions are prevalent. Therefore, the UAE needs to have a robust posture from a cybersecurity standpoint, to defend both the nation and its private institutions. With the right policy and execution, we can have the peace of mind that there will be business continuity. Cyber-threats try to interrupt the way we do things. Whether it is a public or private entity, if it is on the receiving end of a cyber-attack, the end users will measure the impact in terms of business continuity. Overall, the sector is a work in progress across the board. What is rewarding is to see that the issue is taking center-stage on the agenda of policy-makers, and I would say that the UAE is more advanced than other nations.</p><h4>What role should the private sector play in securing a country's attack surface area?</h4><p>As countries' economies and societies digitize, the threat landscape is going to expand exponentially. Fascinatingly, the bigger threat we see is that as we digitize work and daily life, mobility itself becomes a treat. It is one thing to digitize work tools that are on your premises, and it is another when it happens in cars or mobile devices. For every dirham we are investing in digitizing the way we work, we are not investing commensurately in securing this digitized experience. Rather, it is an afterthought. We are a cycle behind. When you analyze threat vectors, it is the 'digital individual' that is most at risk, via their mobile devices. Attacks on these devices are on the rise, they are by far the least protected, and it is through them that you can trigger other vectors, such as social networks. We need policies and regulations, but there is no one panacea. For example, there are policies in many countries saying companies must protect data from being accessed by a third party, but there has to be something that requires them to give us assurances that, at any given point in time, the management of that data is compliant, and its integrity preserved from any tinkering. Regulations should not be too constraining, but they still have to drive these outcomes. This is how we should think about it. The General Data Protection Regulation in Europe is a good case in point. It mandates that a company protect the data and privacy of the data of its organization and its clients. If it does not follow these laws it will be fined a percentage of its revenue. The private sector can further the agenda by companies and C-level executives in every sector considering cybersecurity not just a priority, but an obligation. Shareholders should expect a company to clearly articulate its cybersecurity position, and what it is doing to ensure business continuity. If they do not have this prepared, it is an accident waiting to happen. The end goal is to achieve cybersecurity resilience and dynamic adaptability. In the defense industry, a good army is one that can evolve alongside the threat landscape.</p><h4>Societies are increasingly centralizing their data. Does this make them more vulnerable from a cybersecurity perspective?</h4><p>The discipline of applied analytics tells us that the bigger the dataset, the more useful it is going to be. If, for example, I want to determine the best way to develop and drive investment to a city, or to maximize livability, I need to be able to access data related to different sectors to see where transformation is required. In the end, the most efficient way to do this is to federate the data. Whether you are a CEO or a president, your number-one responsibility is to make informed decisions. By design, or by accident, data will increasingly have to be federated and made available on platforms accessible to both the public and private sectors. The more we do this, the better our solutions to problems. The key is to ensure proper checks and balances, because the last thing you want is to make the data totally transparent and exposed to manipulation. That's the worst-case scenario, and countries have to rise to a correspondingly high standard with the help of the private sector. DarkMatter was created with the view that there is so much that the government can do from a digitalization and cybersecurity standpoint, but there has to be a contribution from the private sector. We do not see this as a one-sided effort.</p><h4>What is the most important thing to keep in mind for companies looking to enter the UAE market and stay resilient?</h4><p>Companies coming to the UAE are entering an economy that is highly digitized. They need to come in prepared to enter such an ecosystem. The bar is already high, so they cannot come in with the traditional ways of doing things. They have to have the cybersecurity checks and balances in place, and they need to connect with the relevant agencies. You need to develop an understanding of the different players in the ecosystem, and know that no one entity has the silver bullet.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[What is your IP?]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-abdulaziz-m-alswailem-ceo-saudi-authority-intellectual-property]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When SAIP was established, patents, trademarks, copyrights, and industrial design came together under one organization. Could you tell us more about the process of bringing these IP responsibilities together?</h4><p>Intellectual Property (IP) is a key factor for the future development of Saudi Arabia's economy and Vision 2030 stipulates targets that are directly enabled by IP. Therefore, Council of Minsters Resolution 410 sets forth a new governance for IP in the Kingdom which is this Authority. IP is typically government responsibility and internationally regulated by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which lead the growth of a balanced and effective international IP system that promotes innovation and creativity for the benefit of its member states. The IP system, however, differs from country to country. Saudi Arabia decided to bring all IP fields in one unified authority, which was also formulated Vision 2030, and SAIP was established which is one of the initiatives of the Trade and Investment Ecosystem to facilitate business, support the National Economy, encourage investment and to give the Kingdom a higher rank in the World Competitiveness Index. Bringing these IP responsibilities together helps us to have the whole picture. Therefore, revising and drafting laws and regulations as well as proposing amendments to these laws and regulations and setting policies. We see challenges because we bring different entities from different backgrounds and procedures, though this can be an advantage as we start to see how we can unify our processes and make things easier for investors, applicants and IP attorneys. </p><h4>What approach should companies or individuals wanting to register IP take?</h4><p>IP assets play a growing role as the importance of a knowledge-based economy rapidly develops in Saudi Arabia. Companies or individuals wanting to register their IP should first identify which type of IPs they have whether these are Patents, Industrial Designs, Plant Varieties, Integrated Circuits, Trademarks or Copyright. In this context, SAIP launched “What is your IP?" which is an electronic tool at the SAIP Website (saip.gov.sa) that will help applicants to identify the type of their IP since some applicants get confused between patents and industrial designs. In the current situation, we have an electronic platform for filing patent applications. All the processes of a patent filing are electronic; Saudi Arabia is among the first countries that started to file patents electronically. For trademarks, Saudi Arabia has a fast examination process, which only takes 75 days, where 60 days are mandatory by law to publish and wait for appeal. Our first initiative is to revise all our processes to ensure that we do not take unnecessary steps and to reduce the time involved in the projects we do. The second initiative is to translate all these processes into an IT system and have an excellent IT system that is not off the shelf. It should be something either customized or in collaboration with international partners that develop their own IP automation systems. The third initiative is to ensure we have the proper infrastructure that will help implement all these processes. The target is to do all our services and activities electronically. Currently, 75% of our services are done electronically, However, we are working hard to convert the other 25% into electronic, once the whole system is revised.</p><h4>What is your vision on raising awareness to maximize the advantages of proper IP registrations for entrepreneurs and inventors?</h4><p>One of our key mandates is an awareness program, which will help us with the four pillars that we work on. Our pillars are to focus on the core business, which is the IP operation including all laws and related processes. The next pillar is providing the IP services. Sometimes, people have questions that need to be answered, and based on this they decide where to go; we provide statistics, websites, surveys, and many other services to this community. The third pillar is to have an impact on those who create and utilize IPs. We are in the middle to ensure we have a registration and protection of IP; however, we cannot work alone and have to work with those who create and utilize the IPs to maximize the benefits. The fourth pillar is enforcement where awareness is extremely important, as we need to be sure every IP registered is protected and enforced. That is what we like to call IP respect rather than enforcement, as this is closer to our culture and understanding. We have a dedicated program of awareness to ensure the community is aware of IP and the types of IPs that we can protect; how infringement impacts our health, economy, and education, among others; and other lines of education for lawyers, companies, and stakeholders. Furthermore, SAIP will launch IP Clinic to support the acquisition of IP rights by raising awareness of the acquisition of IP, provide legal and technical advice and guidance on IP and make initial diagnosis of potential IP as well as to support the utilization of IP information, provide IP information to support the creation of IP rights, initial search of prior art and search on non-infringement of IP rights for the benefit of entrepreneurs and inventors.</p><h4>Can you walk us through your international affiliations?</h4><p>Our vision is to be a hub in the MENA region, and to do this we extended our collaboration with international affiliates. We have signed an agreement with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), National Intellectual Property Administration, PRC (CNIPA) and Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO). We have started collaborating with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore and have an agreement with the European Patent Office. Those agreements are focused on the exchange of expertise and capacity building, as this is one of the crucial issues to be an excellent IP office or authority. Second is the exchange of data, and while there is a fast track of patent offices, we seek to sign Patent Prosecution Highway agreements with those offices to exchange our examination reports, which will increase the speed of finalizing patents and reducing the backlog in our office. Third is to share our policies and guidelines with other international offices, as this needs to be aligned with international best practices. Policies vary from country to country based on how strong they are with IP; however, we want to get the right international authorities to ensure we enforce the right policies. We select the big five offices to start with and sign agreements with them and define the main area of collaboration, which is capacity building, processes, and revision of processes, policies, and bylaws.</p><h4>How could better enforcement with regard to IP be ensured?</h4><p>We believe enforcement is extremely important to assure that every intellectual property is being respected. However, we are focusing now in building respect by raising awareness of intellectual property rights and the establishment of the authority. SAIP will orchestrate the enforcement ecosystem, which starts at the customs and ends up in the court. We have a full seat of authorities and organizations involved in the enforcement line. Our target is to get a unified national committee for enforcement. We will have an enforcement agent who will work under our supervision and will implement enforcement on the ground in collaboration with our partners in governmental, and private entities to promote enforcement ecosystem in Saudi Arabia. The enforcement agent will propose national programs to ensure IP enforcement, study the impact of sanctions in deterring violators and the appropriate compensation for rights holders, prepare a guideline for enforcement procedures, receive the notices and complaints, conduct research and investigation and then follow up the execution. </p><p><br><br>What are your strategic priorities for the coming years?<br>The short-term target is to revise our national laws and policies and work toward standardization. The second target is to join the most important international treaties related to IP, with the target being to increase the number of treaties joined by Saudi Arabia from 6 to 13 in 2020. Considering that the ratification of International Treaties on IP is an essential element in the positioning within the global community. SAIP strives to be a globally respected, fully integrated IP authority that establish itself as the IP hub in the Middle East and North Africa. Besides joining treaties provide services and protection expansion for Saudi citizen's and companies going abroad. The third target is to prepare IP National Strategy and set implementation plans and timeline in coordination with related entities. The fourth target is to move on with e-services in all our activities and set a strategy for backlog applications then implement that strategy. In terms of creation and utilization, we have different initiatives, including IP services through the IP Clinic, which provides a broad range of services to SMEs and evaluates where their IPs stand. We have the IP Value Lab to evaluate each IP and provide advice about what to do with a particular IP. The third initiative is for copyright, because based on international treaties, there is no obligation of copyright registration. Still, we encourage people to register their copyright; the goal is to establish collective management offices to set best model of CMOs that fits local market and prepare specific procedures and policies. This is where we can bring IP and those who would like to utilize IP into one platform which will help exchange their business and market their IP. In addition to that SAIP will establish IP academy which is a training institute that provides IP training for individuals with the cooperation of WIPO, to promote IP education and knowledge in Saudi Arabia, through training. IP academy will offer IP library, IP distance learning, IP summer school and IP Master programs to leverage IP in Saudi Arabia. SAIP will also organize the licensing of IP attorneys to offer services to SAIP's beneficiaries. In order to foster the competitiveness of the national economy and support the development of the Intellectual Property culture in Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Looking for Land]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mauricio-suarez-director-general-ficade]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for demand for houses and apartments in Mexico City?</h4><p>There is a great demand for housing in Mexico City. The problem is the housing policies that limit the capacity of the industry to attend the demand needs; so the offerings are much lower than the demand. This means house prices are always going up, particularly in central areas. Mobility in Mexico City is extremely complicated, so housing in central areas are in high demand. The industry does not have the capacity to produce enough housing to meet demand, and this is an issue the government needs to solve. We need to reuse large plots of land so developers can develop megaprojects with many units to address this demand. Another factor that impacts the industry is that all new projects are being put on hold while the new administration reviews everything done under the previous administration. This has stopped new projects from flowing, and permits are difficult to get processed; however, the demand and need for housing means it is just a matter of time before things start to move forward. Nevertheless, we see Mexico City as a strong market with great potential to continue growing.</p><h4>Mexico City requires tens of thousands of new houses a year to meet demand, but only 15,000 are being built. Is the city realistically able to develop that number of houses?</h4><p>It is extremely difficult to develop a project, and there are not many housing projects taking place. There is land, though we do not have the right land usage rights, so in many areas we lack the housing density the city requires. For example, one might only be permitted to build four or five houses on a plot that could potentially take 15-20 units. The government needs to address this urban planning issue. Other cites globally tend to be more densely developed than Mexico City—they build higher and with smaller units. That is something that Mexico City needs to incorporate in some way. The infrastructure and utility services also need to be improved so more people can be accommodated on a single piece of land.</p><h4>What strategies does FICADE use to continue acquiring land and developing projects?</h4><p>Part of my job is to look for land. I spend about 40% of my time looking for new opportunities, and we are extremely active, with many brokers who provide land options. We have to move quickly to take advantage of these opportunities. Sometimes, we get into bidding processes for projects. We have a great business plan that I am extremely proud of, though it is a great deal of work. We may see 100 options and proceed with only five to eight of them.</p><h4>How much land does FICADE currently own in Mexico City?</h4><p>When we acquire land, we start developing it straightaway. We do not have any land in reserve. Having land reserves works well in the provinces, where things need to be organized, like bringing in infrastructure before one can develop. In Mexico City, it is difficult to have land reserves because land is so expensive, and there is no need to wait to develop it. Financially, in Mexico City it would be silly to just buy land and hold it in reserve. We do all the due diligence and start developing a project immediately.</p><h4>What projects is FICADE currently developing?</h4><p>We currently have 31 projects as a group, the main projects are; Revolución 757, where we have 168 units under construction. That development has been extremely successful because of its location amenities and green certification; we only have 35 units left and are still in the early stages of construction. The completion date is December 2020. We have been selling 15-25 units per month. We have another project called San Lorenzo 1009 with also 168 units which offers a commercial zone in the lower level and is going to have also a green certification. We have another project, Amores, with 129 units, located in Coyoacán, close to the Mitikah project in a fantastic neighborhood. In both projects Amores and San Lorenzo our brand concept called Sky Park will have many rooftop amenities, including a pet zone, jacuzzi, a playground, vegetable gardens, barbecue facilities among others. What people want most are open spaces, which are difficult to find because we do not have spare land in the central city. We are still in the permitting and licensing stage for these Sky Park projects, though we expect a great deal of interest from buyers once we get started.</p><h4>What is your target market for these developments?</h4><p>We build small, two- to three-bedroom apartments of 60-100sqm with many amenities so people can go out and enjoy the shared spaces, including a cinema. We also develop small projects with no amenities that attend other type of clients that prefer small projects. The price ranges from MXN2.5-10 million (USD130,700-522,785), which are around the central city averages.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the trend of building urban housing developments for rent and not for sale?</h4><p>Rental units have great potential. This trend is becoming more professionalized in Mexico City. Currently, we have a large secondary or informal rental housing market here, and we need to develop a more institutionalized product and mechanisms for renting, such as a legal framework. It is more common for millennials and others who want to have less debt to rent rather than buy. This is definitely a great opportunity in Mexico City and globally. However, it is more akin to being in the office space segment, where one owns and maintains the building they lease. FICADE is into the buying and selling model currently. We will enter the office and rental market in perhaps four or five years' time.</p><h4>What is your vision for FICADE for the coming years?</h4><p>I am extremely active in developing the company's culture at the moment. We are doing programs to design FICADE's culture for the wellbeing of the people within the company. Having a great culture will benefit the projects and our end clients. As our culture in the company I want to deliver projects that also have a social and environmental commitment as a result of that we will certificate all of our buildings with an EDGE certificate. We want to be the developer with that certain magic in its culture so that our clients have an excellent experience buying a house in Mexico City. Buying a house is the most important decision for a person. We see this area of opportunity for making our clients feel special, and FICADE is doing its best to make sure their experience is the best. We want to have a long-term relationship with our customers, so when they decide to move to a new or bigger apartment, we are also there for them. We do not want to be the biggest; we want to be the best in terms of quality and experience.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main accomplishments and milestones of Kenanga Investors over the past year?</h4><p>The last few years have been exciting for us, despite a rather challenging year due to events felt across the world. As a firm, we have grown in line with our objectives over the past two years. We have tried to ensure that we can serve multiple segments of the market, and have therefore built a mass retail, institutional and a high-net-worth individuals arm. We are seeing particular growth opportunity among high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. At the product level, we have moved beyond mere asset management and are now licensed to distribute multiple funds and work with over 20 partners. In early 2018, we were granted a financial planning license by the regulators and are now able to offer a full financial planning platform. We are one of the few players in Malaysia with multi-segment and multi-distributional activities. Furthermore, we are proud of our efforts to promote sustainable investment; we officially became a signatory of the Malaysian Institutional Code of Investors in 2017. We are also the first asset manager in Malaysia to be rated by a credit agency, and have worked hard to promote sustainability and transparency in our investment and risk management. Being positioned as a regional expert, we need to ensure that we have local knowledge combined with global practices, and therefore it is vital for us to focus on sustainability and transparency especially with the growing interest in ASEAN and Islamic finance. We have also worked to expand our strategic alliances through which we can leverage the expertise of other firms and vice versa. These strategic alliances are important for us; we are able to offer domestic players new foreign products and foreign partners access to Malaysian products. Together with our partners in the US and Australia, we launched Malaysia's first AI-based hedge fund, and an Australian income fund in the market, respectively. We are also currently working with the biggest ETF issuer in Taiwan, thanks to a similar retail market that we are serving. Together, we hope to launch our first leveraged and inverse (L&amp;I) ETF in Malaysia later this year. Moving forward we will continue to build cross-border partnerships, although we do not necessarily intend to expand into these geographies. Our goal is cross-border enrichment and shared expertise.</p><h4>How has FinTech impacted the asset management industry in Malaysia, and how is Kenanga Investors addressing it?</h4><p>There are two elements to look at in this area: the financial part and the tech part. In terms of technology, there have been some strong developments, and asset managers must embrace and deploy new technologies. We see utilization of technology both on the frontline and in the back office most notably for CRMs to crunch different kinds of data but it will take a few years for Malaysia to get to the same point as the most advanced nations. One way in which new technologies help us is by creating a more interactive experience for clients. In the back office, we are focused on making our processes more efficient through the application of technology. It is also helpful in terms of compliance and regulatory requirements, risk management, and facilitating better investment decisions. AI is an area that has the potential to really transform this area of operations, and we will be able to develop analyses and asset assessments much more efficiently. Asset managers have to start looking at AI and big data analytics closely. Regarding the financial side of FinTech, Malaysian regulators have been quite progressive in their efforts. Two years ago, the regulators launched a digital investment management license, called DIM (Digital Investment Management License). This allowed clients to get their investments information online. We are looking at this too, and it will be an important method for targeting the Generation Y and Millennial generations. We foresee a hybrid model becoming especially popular, with robo-advising and human advising working hand-in-hand. At the firm level, we are undergoing this transformation, and are in the midst of a two-year IT transformation plan that extends across our entire business.</p><h4>Worldwide there is a tendency towards passively managed index funds and ETFs. How do you see the relevance of active portfolio management going forward?</h4><p>Active portfolio management will remain a central component of asset management. As a fund house, we are moving to multi-boutique investment styles. We are working hard to develop our multi-asset presence. We are both active and passive managers, and I think that active management will remain important in developing markets like Malaysia. In more developed economies, passive management will continue to take on a larger presence. ETFs will continue to expand in terms of their size and relevance in the market. In Asia, especially, active management will remain vital, partly because there are so few alternatives in developing markets available. The ETF market needs to mature to a certain level, and this will occur in step with the socio-economic development of the country. In the US, for example, ETFs now account for the bulk of stock market transactions. However, people will continue to depend on active management in the Malaysian market, especially younger individuals.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the impact of the National Industry 4.0 Policy Framework on the performance of Malaysia's manufacturing industries?</h4><p>Malaysia has been an agricultural economy for much of its history, focusing on things like rubber and palm oil. We have started the transition to an industrialized economy, which is where we started to invite various kinds of manufacturing interests into the country. We are located in an industrial free-trade zone, which has allowed us to welcome many semiconductor companies into the country. Generally, what makes Malaysia attractive is that we are an English-speaking nation and have a strong labor force. However, some of our strong suits have been overlooked. Though we have lost some of our competitiveness to neighboring countries like Thailand, we are starting to really focus on Industry 4.0, and are seeing exciting developments. We cannot consider this in isolation, though, and must understand how we can maximize the entire value chain. For example, if we plan  to develop a strong car manufacturing base, we need to make sure we are developing the talent we need for this manufacturing base. There also needs to be a strong roadmap in place. Foreign investors are now looking at Malaysia, because we can be a cheaper location for manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Singapore is becoming hugely expensive, and we are an excellent alternative for some of these investors. Malaysia can be an excellent alternative for people keen to set up a manufacturing branch or other operations. The other aspect of Malaysia's attractiveness is that we are open to anyone who wants to do business fairly within the country. The new government is trying to push the idea that we are not China-centric or Japanese-centric, but rather open to everyone.</p><h4>Are you seeing growing appetite for investment in Malaysia among international investors?</h4><p>Not yet, but I believe that more and more investors will return to Malaysia. We are trading at fair valuations. Malaysia is moving toward political maturity which is a positive sign. This development is similar to the developments Thailand experienced 10 years ago. Indirectly, businesses now understand the lay of the land politically, allowing for much greater stability and continuity in this area. We are seeing great progress. There are now more checks and balances, and the people in power know that someone is watching. Over time, we will see changes that lead to more transparency and less corruption. This is part of the value chain that we are developing within Malaysia, and it promises many positive spillover effects in terms of foreign direct investments (FDI) and development. Properties and stocks are priced attractively, making Malaysia an excellent country in which to reap the opportunities. Highly attuned investors from Europe have a keen interest in Malaysia right now, and investors should recognize that this is an excellent time for a closer look. Kenanga Investors is the one-stop gateway to Malaysia, and we offer a variety of services to investors looking at the country.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Kenanga in 2019, and what are your strategic objectives to take the company further?</h4><p>We have just finished the first phase of our three-year plan and will now move into the next phase, which covers 2019-2021. Over the past three years, we have worked to build our distribution network, expand our client segments and improve on our back office processes. For the next three years, we plan to further develop what we have achieved thus far. We will increase our product range, expand our wealth management and financial planning services and join forces with more partners. At the same time, we are working hard to embrace technology, maximize online accessibility and capture Gen Y and Gen Z demographics. We need to prepare for the generational changes set to impact the marketplace.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Expanding horizons]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[hamad-al-ameri-managing-director-trojan-holding]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your current portfolio reflect recent economic trends in Abu Dhabi and what future projects do you hope to engage with?</h4><p>Overall, 2018 was a positive year for Trojan Holding. We engaged in many notable projects, including the Water's Edge project which was a waterfront infrastructure development from Aldar as well as Emaar's Sidra and Rove La Mer. These projects add significant value to the economy in a number of ways. They allowed us to also hire more employees and apply new expertise. Additionally, we have opened new branches as a developer and have now acquired land in both Sharjah and Abu Dhabi. Furthermore, we are planning to open international branches, with a hub office in Saudi Arabia also on the horizon. Our diverse competences stretch throughout many of the core building disciplines such as infrastructure, design and development.</p><h4>What was the driving force behind entering the Saudi Arabian market?</h4><p>We have started subsidiary work in Saudi Arabia already, with one project being worked on with SABIC. This is a factory for Reem Aluminum. There's also Hitech, for cement products. There is significant demand in Saudi with the need for infrastructural development, commercial, cultural and educational buildings. The government has a different vision now and this provides us with promising opportunities in areas including Jeddah and Dammam. We are in the tendering stage, which will lead us to start in one region, get involved in a project, and work in other regions to grow sustainably.</p><h4>What are the challenges and opportunities when it comes to using innovative technology and materials? How are you incorporating these in your operations?</h4><p>The UAE is an open place for people who have talent and who think creatively. The government embraces innovation by easing regulations and supporting technological development. Technology is being applied at every stage of the life cycle; design, operation, handover, and then maintenance. It is my vision to have a ready-made product that we can sell to our clients. I want to make the most efficient and flexible design that can be modified. Our clients can propose a budget and we can provide a list of options available based on premade designs. This will allow us to offer competitive prices, identify mistakes, and develop a product for our clients pre-designed stock. A database would allow us to achieve this. Robotics and drones are technologies we anticipate will have greater use across the entire industry in years to come. We already use drones to map project sites and this improves efficiency and allows us to reduce costs.</p><h4>Does price sensitivity across the local construction sector hinder the adoption of new technology and materials?</h4><p>Price is always a driver. When new technology is made available it is never priced according to the cost of the material. It is priced according to the cycle of the project. Cheaper material isn't always a good thing. We want material with a longer life span that can be adaptable for the future and will give a better result during the project life cycle. Looking at the price alone does not reflect everything, but it depends on the client and the cycle. In the current cycle there is concern about pricing, but price engineering is always a good solution in the end. We are seen as a turnkey contractor that knows everything, even the minute details. You can change tiles from porcelain to ceramic, for example. Ceramic chips more easily, but it is reasonably priced. A client can take the risk or pay more to have a higher quality product that doesn't need to be replaced as often. Overall, business cycles correct the issues in the industry itself. By slowing down, there will be both correction and a willingness to address issues relating to regulations, resources, efficiency, and productivity.</p><h4>How do you engage with sustainability across your operations and how successful has the Estidama rating system been in delivering sustainability across Built Environment?</h4><p>Estidama started a long time ago, and today we have evidence of how successful it is. We used to have the highest consumption per capita of electricity and water. Today, culturally, people have a greater awareness of sustainable practices. We are building in a better way. I believe it is a positive point in our culture, which began about 10 years ago. Moreover, this extends to include the materials that are most easily recycled, and how they can be used properly. Moreover, I believe the UAE has built an environmentally aware culture and we are in a better place than 10 years ago.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Expo 2020, and how do you expect demand for your services to evolve in the years ahead?</h4><p>We have positive expectations for Expo 2020. While it does represent only one step up the mountain we wish to climb, it is a big step. The UAE will continue hosting events that bring new ideas to the country. We have our own unique platform. As long as people want to live in this country, we are here to build. The country's growth plans always come into being, you can see evidence of this in our country's history. We can anticipate the future due to our recent experiences. From that plan, we are going to be busy for at least 40-50 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you give us a brief overview of Standard Chartered's evolution in Jordan, its commitment to the country, and the bank's current direction?</h4><p>Standard Chartered was the first bank to launch operations in Jordan through its acquisition of ANZ Grindlays Bank in 2000 and their earlier acquisition of the Ottoman Bank whose operations started in 1925. Our heritage and values are expressed in our brand promise — Here for good. With more than 86,000 employees and a presence in 60 markets, our network serves customers in close to 150 markets worldwide. We're listed on the London and Hong Kong Stock Exchanges as well as the Bombay and National Stock Exchanges in India. In Jordan, we have third-generation clients, which show how we have built trust and long-term relationships. For us, it is not just about providing clients with the normal banking service; as an international bank, we focus on building long-term relationships where we can add value for clients and share our international experience. The bank was chosen as the Best Foreign Bank and Best Foreign Investment Bank in Jordan by EMEA Finance magazine in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2018. More recently, in 2018 the bank was chosen as the Best Sub-Custodian Bank by Global Finance magazine. Over the years, Standard Chartered has built a solid relationship with the Private and the Government sectors. We believe that there is room for us to add value for our clients. The bank's sustainability agenda is designed to impact the markets where we operate through being a force that promotes sustainable lending policies, operates as a responsible company, and invests in the communities we operate in. The bank's staff supports our local communities by volunteering their time and skills. Our volunteering peaks during the holy month of Ramadan with Tikyet Um Ali to serve Iftar meals to underprivileged families. “Seeing is Believing" is our global program in which we help in eradicating avoidable blindness. Last year, we have launched a locally developed project to screen 30,000 students in Jordan. In cooperation with the National Woman's Health Care Center, we have focused on providing screening for amblyopia and colorblindness, examining referred students with amblyopia and other diseases to doctors and specialists, providing eyeglasses to students and following up on them after six months, and determining treatment for each case and transferring them to the nearest hospital if needed. GOAL is the bank's global program that uses sport and life skills to transform the lives of adolescent girls. It was launched in Jordan on January 2011. Now the program has reached more than 15,000 girls in different rural areas across Jordan and is executed in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Injaz. Last year, we have launched Goal Employability and Entrepreneurship Fund to train 200 Goal champions on how to start their own projects and to be ready for the job market. This year, Standard Chartered Group launched the Futuremakers initiative to tackle inequality and promote greater economic inclusion. Our ambition, on a Group level, is to raise USD50 million between 2019 and 2023 to empower the next generation to learn, earn, and grow so they can learn the skills and access job opportunities to build a brighter economic future for themselves, their families and their communities. Because together when we open doors we can close the inequality gap for good.</p><h4>What specific areas is Standard Chartered looking at right now to add value for Jordan?</h4><p>Today, we have two main divisions: Corporate Banking Segment and Retail Banking Segment. The Corporate Banking covers an array of business in Jordan including local large and medium size corporations, financial institutions, commercial businesses and global subsidiaries. Our aim is to provide value added lending and non-lending products to our clients. Aside from trade and lending, Standard Chartered offers M&amp;A, FM hedging, DCMs, Corporate Finance (leverage and principal financing, ECA and Project Finance) products and services. As for Retail Banking, we offer Mortgage Loans, Personal Loans, Credit Cards, and Deposits. In addition to that, we are focused on wealth management offering and are now focusing on investing in digital capabilities to bring convenience to clients in line with regional initiatives.</p><h4>How is Standard Chartered leading the digitization trend in Jordan?</h4><p>A bank has to understand the market and employ good, talented people. Equally important, a bank has to understand the cycle of a particular business and what it needs to grow further, expand, or face challenging times. At present, the traditional banking sector is facing newcomers to the market in the form of FinTechs that can change the whole banking sector. Therefore, we need to be prepared for digitization in order to address any challenges. In 2017, we have started increasing our investments in our distribution channels by introducing mobile banking and changing the online banking interface to increase convenience and reach for our clients. We also offer our clients user-friendly top-of-the-line platforms to do their businesses be it retail or corporate clients. In Africa and the Middle East, we have been leading the way in driving a strong digital innovation agenda. We launched the bank's first fully fledged digital bank in Cí´te d'Ivoire last year and have replicated that in other countries with plans to expand this business model further. </p><h4>What is the significance of Jordan in the Standard Chartered Group's portfolio?</h4><p>We at Standard Chartered Jordan have a very well diverse portfolio and products offering as mentioned earlier. It ranges from financing and servicing various sectors. Jordan is a regional front-runner in technology and innovation with a pipeline of major transformational projects that Standard Chartered is keen to be part of.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[For All Seasons]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[amr-banaja-ceo-general-entertainment-authority]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the approach of GEA advanced in 2019?</h4><p>Today, we are simply putting more focus on the entertainment sector. The entertainment offering has always been a wide one across multiple categories, and the first few years have proven that these offerings are in high demand. Under our new leadership, we have more support to expand our plans and fast track many of our initiatives. One of the most vital developments was the establishment of the Saudi Seasons, a new calendar concept, led by a new committee directly under the Crown Prince. Across the Kingdom, for all provinces, we have aligned the entertainment agenda in terms of these seasons to better align all events, taking into consideration our climate conditions and cultural agenda. This both organizes internal tourism and will attract tourists from abroad. Additionally, we will fill these seasons with cultural, entertainment, and sporting events to create a better quality of life in the Kingdom by spreading joy and creating a vibrant society.</p><h4>How does this seasonal approach call for more alignment among all the cultural authorities?</h4><p>There has always been coordination, but with anything that is new, coordination will get better over time. For example, the National Day was a well-coordinated effort across multiple authorities, and the Formula E race in Diriyah and the golf tournament were a great success as well. For Formula E, we created a festival rather than just a sporting event, thanks to the joint effort of the organizers. Now with the creation of seasons, different committees are focused on different aspects, like culture, entertainment, sporting, and tourism. This allows us a holistic approach and adds a lot of demand for creating events and activities that attract tourism, both locally and internationally. We are working now to make sure we program the seasons well in terms of location, time, and audience. We also take international occasions into consideration and aim to create events that are relevant to a global audience.</p><h4>How do you balance between megaprojects and smaller scale initiatives in the entertainment industry?</h4><p>Megaprojects and smaller scale initiatives complement each other. GEA is the regulator; it facilitates creativity, while putting in place the regulations, licensing process, quality standards, and inspection. GEA organizes and promote the seasons and supports smaller organizations and SMEs to get started. Its mandate is not to invest in megaprojects, but rather in projects that the private sector would not necessarily invest in because of longer return, larger scale, or unclear regulations. When GEA promotes the entertainment sector, it does so in the international arena. We share our standards, so we know we are issuing the right ones. When we deploy programs to develop local talent, we work hand-in-hand with them, but it is the private sector's role to come in and invest.</p><h4>Will the authority slowly phase out of its role as a funder and become a regulator?</h4><p>The funding initiative is currently housed under GEA since no other mandate exists for it. However, a new entity will take over this role in the future.  The infrastructure will be expanded to accommodate different SMEs funding models. That said, we invite banks and other financial institutions to invest in entertainment, including the entire chain of private equity and private capital. Over the recent years, we have proven there is demand, and now we have to prove that there is financial reward. We will then witness more funding vehicles that want to contribute. Subsidies are going to ease eventually, and it will become more sustainable through creating the right infrastructure. For example, we currently lack dedicated venues, and are thus relying on existing ones such as universities, public spaces, land, and so on. We are working to create a platform that includes a database of all available venues so we can match them with relevant event organizers. Furthermore, some venues need to be upgraded, and we are partnering with venue owners and international companies for management services to do that and attract further events. GEA is also subsidizing ticketing to create buzz. Within the next few years, as new venues and sponsors emerge, the sector should become sustainable and attract more investors.  </p><h4>How do you envision to have more local organizations participate in the current and future opportunities? </h4><p>Over the last three years, we have expanded the number of local companies we work with through licensing them and providing increased support. Consequently, we have seen growth in the number of companies that have held events without requiring funding from us, in addition to an increase in sustainable companies. Furthermore, there are two major vehicles in the sector, Qiddiya and PIF's Saudi Entertainment Ventures (SEVEN). Qiddiya is about to release its master plan which will outline and clarify participation opportunities. This project is 2.5 times the size of Disney with sporting facilities, an opera house, a theme park, a water park, and a safari. Moreover, opportunities are plenty, even in areas indirectly related to entertainment, such as power companies, hospitality companies, food and beverage (F&amp;B), and more. As for SEVEN, it is working to build entertainment clusters around the country. These will look like malls, but will consist of around 70% entertainment, in addition to retail and F&amp;B. They have acquired land and developed a design that will be launched soon. There are extensive opportunities for private-sector players, both local and international, to invest. For family entertainment centers, there is good local expertise, and they are open to work with international companies that want to work on sustainable and culturally relevant partnerships.</p><h4>What are your main priorities going forward?</h4><p>First and foremost, we will continue to align ourselves with other government entities to take a holistic view on developing the entertainment economy. The concept of seasons is also a priority that we are expanding. Tourism, culture, entertainment, and sport go hand-in-hand, and will all contribute their share to the improvement of the quality of life in Saudi Arabia. Developing local content and infrastructure to facilitate growth is another strategic priority. The sector needs more local talent, and we recently organized a competition to source the available talents and train them. In more practical terms, we want to streamline our licensing process, so it becomes simpler for companies to get the necessary licensing for events. We are working on setting quality standards, developing a protocol for live events, and launching theme parks. In terms of local content, we are striving to export our own IPs and to commercialize our offerings internationally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Have your expectations for the Nigerian market been met over the past year, and what services have you brought to it?</h4><p>We re-entered the market in 2017, after having taken over a practice that had been around for 12 years. Returning to Nigeria was like coming home. We came at a time when the government was launching new ideas. People were volunteering to declare their income for tax assessments, and we helped our clients find the most efficient way to manage their tax obligations. In addition to helping the wealthy address their tax issues, we are also helping them protect their remaining wealth for future generations. Many of Nigeria's wealthy families are unknown, and our main focus is to provide services to wealthy families to retain their wealth past the second generation. We attract clients because we offer best-in-class services and work for the best interests of our client. The market has been good for us, and we have tripled in size compared to our former local practice. The Andersen brand has helped us, and we were able to bring in some Andersen alumni who have been working at various positions around the world.</p><h4>Do you work with local corporations?</h4><p>We work with a few local corporations that have chosen to adopt world-class standards. We work with individuals who have companies and undertake all tax-related matters for them and their companies. About 70% of our clients are multinationals, and 30% are local. We have some local high-net worth private clients, but they do not make up a sizable part of our portfolio.</p><h4>How do you contribute to improving the tax system in the country?</h4><p>The big problem is not so much corporations, but wealthy and not-so-wealthy individuals who are not paying the appropriate taxes. Personal income tax is based on the principle of pay as you earn. So, whether one is wealthy, rich, middle class, or a farmer, they are required to pay taxes as a percentage of their earnings. The problem thus far is that the tax authorities have chosen to focus their efforts on those in regular employment and those living in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><h4>How would you assess the current level of awareness regarding income and corporate taxes?</h4><p>There are more people within the tax net now than four years ago. More business are paying taxes. People are also increasingly using ATM cards, and are therefore traceable when not paying taxes. Nationally, tax collection is rising. For example, if Lagos state was a country by itself, the average collection rate would be higher than South Africa. All the government needs to do is bring more people into the tax net. More individuals should be participating. Corporations should be more involved too, but much of this will come from individuals.</p><h4>How do you get people who have never paid taxes before to start?</h4><p>We have to be realistic. All the government has to do is make sure each state is enforcing the law. Collection in villages is difficult, but in place of bricks-and -mortar banks, mobile payments are an option simply because they require a tax ID number. Many people who are not in the tax net work in trade associations. One way to get them in the net is to go through the trade associations. It is also a good idea to show people what the government has been doing with the taxes collected and future projects that will benefit taxpayers generally.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>Building on what we have achieved in 2018, our plan is to continue to grow and make sure we are working in the interest of our clients. As well as being a catalyst for taxation in Nigeria, we also want to help our clients succeed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures and policies has LIRS implemented in recent years to improve tax collection?</h4><p>LIRS was established in March 2006, through the presentation of a bill to the Lagos State House of assembly and subsequent passage of the Lagos State Revenue Administration Law, making the then Board of Internal Revenue autonomous and self-accounting. The autonomy had a significant impact on revenue, bringing about an increase from an average of NGN600 million monthly to NGN30 billion. This was largely due to improved quality of service delivery to taxpayers, improvement in the use of IT and other modern methods of administration in tax collection, and an unprecedented campaign on tax administration and education. We also invested in training and development of staff.</p><h4>Is Lagos's e-payment system and automated processes unique to the local environment?</h4><p>Lagos really stands out in this regard. We are almost like an academic institution for some other state tax authorities in Nigeria. All payments made to Lagos State Government can be viewed real time, with payment history securely stored for future reference. This was reaffirmed by a pronouncement by the Governor of Lagos, HE Akinwunmi Ambode, mandating that from April 2018 onward, all payments in Lagos must be electronic. We were already at around 80% electronic payments, but this executive order changed the landscape completely as automation promotes transparency and has helped build trust and confidence.</p><h4>How would you explain Lagos' success in tax collection compared to the rest of the country?</h4><p>We have been blessed with excellent leadership in Lagos State. Additionally, we were forced to think outside of the box for the purpose of revenue generation. In fact, in Lagos, we say there is no box, and we are willing to implement any strategy or reform that will improve our effectiveness and efficiency. We have had governors who are passionate about turning the state into a leader in not just Nigeria but Africa. They have a vision for Lagos and a matching passion for its sustainable development, which makes life much easier. The state has a number of ongoing projects, and government is working to develop every part of Lagos. Many of these projects are only possible with the money we have been collecting in taxes. For most states, there is a ratio of 90:10 between the allocation paid to them from the federal accounts and internally generated revenue (IGR). In Lagos, however, the reverse is true, with the federal allocation being only 25% and IGR 75%.</p><h4>On a federal level, what does Nigeria need to do to improve tax revenue?</h4><p>Because of the oil price dip, budgets allocated to the states from the federal government have dropped, forcing many state governments to start thinking about developing their revenue authorities with the view to increasing their internally generated revenue. More states are starting to seek the autonomy that LIRS has had in Lagos for about 12 years. Governors have started to give heads of states' internal revenue services more freedom, which reduces bureaucracy and allows for greater strategizing and creativity. The state second to Lagos in revenue generation collects approximately NGN7-8 billion monthly, and we have many others generating less than NGN2 billion monthly.</p><h4>What do you expect for 2019?</h4><p>We want to widen the tax base and expand the tax net for high-net worth individuals and the informal sector. We are investing more in technology as well. We are developing a tax administration solution by which taxpayers will be able to interact with the platform from the ease of their offices or homes. We also plan to harness our integration with other state government agencies such as the department of motor vehicles, the Lands Bureau, Land use charge, and so on to verify incomes against vehicle and property purchasing habits. Lastly, we will move into a larger office acquired by the state. We are extremely excited about everything that 2019 has to offer. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The federal government managed to increase tax revenue by 42% in 1H2018. To what do you attribute this success?</h4><p>This success is the result of certain measures. First, we implemented changes within our staff, ensuring we had the right people in the right positions. Second, we increased our level of education for both tax administrators and taxpayers. Finally, we deployed technology that makes filing taxes more convenient and transparent for taxpayers. FIRS signed an MoU with the state revenue boards so that we are able to exchange taxpayer information. We added 800,000 new corporate taxpayers in 2016. Due to these efforts, FIRS and states had over 19 million taxpayers nationwide in 2018. We focused on technology and have made it extremely easy for any corporate organization to pay taxes, download receipts, and go through the refund process. Therefore, taxpayers are willing to pay without worrying about making a mistake, which would mean not getting their credit back. On top of that, we have effective monitoring to regulate compliance. Taxpayers realize that they will not be left alone; even if we are not knocking on their doors in six months, we will be knocking in 12 months. The tax administrations at both state and federal levels have changed, and they are starting to see this. To date, no Nigerian has ever been sent to jail for tax evasion. However, now there are consequences, and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) can question people or meet them to discuss their situation. We may have been lenient, but now we are bringing the consequences to light.</p><h4>How hard is it for you to raise awareness about the importance of paying taxes and its benefits?</h4><p>We are engaging with our primary stakeholders. For the first time, FIRS has reached out to meet all its stakeholders in hospitality, entertainment, business, and politics. Members of the House of Representatives, the parliament, are sitting with us to discuss their current year's budget and strategies to improve the revenue drive. They give us ideas based on our limitations; we are bringing every stakeholder into the picture so they can see the benefits of working together.</p><h4>Which sectors seem the most promising for increasing tax revenue?</h4><p>In terms of the number of taxpayers, we are looking to add more SMEs. They currently contribute less than 5%, and if you look at their contribution to GDP, they should be contributing nothing less than 35% of total tax revenue. We have met with them and engaged with them, while taking other measures based on information that we have to ensure that none of them are left out of the tax net, whether they run an enterprise, a small business, or a limited-liability company.</p><h4>What is your vision for achieving these goals in Nigeria?</h4><p>If we continue at the same pace, we can achieve 20% of the tax mix comprised of revenue from SMEs by 2019. The government fully supports us. Some projects may take a year or more to develop, but citizens' confidence in the tax system will grow when they see work in progress.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>Just like some of the other oil-rich countries, we never imagined taxation would be the main source of revenue. Oil is a resource whose price is determined by more developed countries, and as a result, we are disadvantaged. There is a 2026 agenda for African countries to be able to fund their budgets internally without grants or aid. It is something we can do right now. Nigeria can show the rest of the world that it can transform within a short time and fund its own budget with taxation as a primary source of revenue. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main economic policies to bring Lagos to the next level?</h4><p>We have our policy document called project THEME, an acronym for traffic management and transportation; health and the environment; education and technology; making Lagos a 21st century economy; and entertainment, tourism, and sport. It features all the major areas of interests and needs that our government will address to drive our economic policies. However, the main thrust of our policy is to make Lagos a 21st-century economy, and we will thus focus heavily on public infrastructure. There is a significant to-do list because this is a massive city with massive movements of people. The rail system also needs to be completed, as does the highway infrastructure to connect Lagos to the West African coast. This 10-lane highway needs to be actualized. Additionally, we need to invest heavily in energy, including developing different kinds of captive energy. We will figure out what we can do to bring about quick deployment of captive energy to our people. Waste disposal and waste management is another huge area of our focus. Moreover, innovation and technology are key to driving the youth population and will also need to be stimulated in a creative way, so we can have more start-ups and innovative ideas. This can assist us in catching up with developed nations. We need to leapfrog to make rapid developments in a relatively short period of time. In general, we are dedicated to creating an environment that will truly enable the economic development of the nation. The public sector only contributes around 20% to GDP; the private sector controls the remaining 80% and therefore needs the right environment to drive development and transformation. We want to maximize ease of doing business, cut red tape, and reduce inefficiencies.</p><h4>Will private-sector funding feed your envisioned development of Lagos?</h4><p>It has to. The budget of Lagos State is just about USD3 billion, which is dramatically lower than any other major city in the world. We need to develop funding sources not by increasing taxes but by widening the tax net. Another aspect to look at is our GDP-to-loan ratio, which is still low. We can look at how we can raise financing targeted at infrastructure that will bring about long-term economic growth. We need to make sure we act promptly and do not procrastinate, so that funds do not leave the country. We are serious about creating real change.</p><h4>What will you do to harness the potential of the entertainment industry and change the global perception of Lagos?</h4><p>We need to sit down with the industry and ask its practitioners what would specifically help its development. We will work with local and foreign stakeholders to facilitate the creation of a fully equipped and functional film city that will include a world-class academy to encourage training for relevant skills and expertise required to improve the creative arts industry in the state. It will also be a one-stop destination where the industry can come together and grow organically. I will have the industry nominate someone who can join my government as an advisor in this area. We intend to brand Lagos as the home of the Nigerian entertainment industry (Nollywood and Afrobeat) in order to take the full commercial benefits of the brands and to further attract destination tourism from both within and outside the country as well foreign direct investment. We will create employment for up to 1 million people over the next five years by formalizing the sector. We will strengthen collaboration with industry and federal agencies to improve the enforcement of laws to curb piracy. We also need to sit with our tourism ministry to make Lagos a tourism destination, for instance through festivals and activities that attract an international crowd. Finally, I intend to set up a special help desk in Lagos Global to serve as liaison between stakeholders in the industry and the state. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The many visits of high-level Turkish officials to Africa in  the last few years indicate the importance of the continent to Turkey's foreign relations. How would you assess bilateral ties between Turkey and Nigeria today?</h4><p>We have a “win-win" approach to Turkish-Nigerian relations. This approach to Africa is essential. Only through such an approach will the economic potential of Africa benefit the continent first and the wider world later. Our relations with the African continent have gained momentum over the last decade. We see Nigeria—a rising power in its region—as a strategic partner in Africa and we aim to develop and diversify our relations in all areas. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the Republic of Turkey, paid an official visit to Nigeria on March 1-3, 2016; just over a year later, President Muhammadu Buhari visited Turkey, on October 19, 2017. These visits demonstrated our common will to deepen our bilateral relations and move forward. Both countries are regional powers in their respective geographies. This fact presents us the opportunity to deepen our cooperation in a wide spectrum of areas. Much improved economic relations through realizing infrastructure projects and increased trade are the main areas to look into. Fighting against terrorism is also an important pillar for our collaboration. Transboundary terrorist organizations threaten every country they reach. If we do not strengthen cooperation against these threats, they will eventually damage the places where they nest. The PKK/YPG/PYD, DAESH, and FETÖ are some of the terrorist organizations that Turkey fights against. FETÖ is a cult-like global organized crime network with economic and political ambitions. Its activities should be closely monitored and ceased. We support Nigeria's fight against Boko Haram and the so-called “Islamic State-West Africa Province" (ISWAP). ISWAP, a faction of Boko Haram, claims to be related to DAESH. We fight DAESH vigorously in our region. In late 2018, Turkish Ambassador Melih Ulueren stated Ankara's willingness to diversify its business ties with Nigeria; moreover, the Turkish Exporters Assembly aims to achieve USD1 billion in trade with Nigeria by 2020.</p><h4>In which areas do you see the highest potential for more diversified trade?</h4><p>The amount of bilateral trade between Turkey and Nigeria reached USD1.25 billion (USD350 million Turkish exports to Nigeria, USD900 million imports), including petroleum and LNG exports from Nigeria to Turkey. Excluding the petroleum and LNG trade, the bilateral trade volume is approximately USD490 million. Our bilateral trade is imbalanced and heavily based on petroleum, LNG, and civil aviation. This imbalance in bilateral trade can be levelled through better economic ties. Turkish construction materials, furniture, electrical equipment, and machinery enjoy international competitiveness, with good value for money. Exports of these goods from Turkey to Nigeria should be increased. Likewise, Turkish construction companies could gain a better share of infrastructure projects in Nigeria.</p><h4>What are the most attractive investment opportunities in Turkey for Nigerian investors?</h4><p>As an emerging market, Turkey provides opportunities to foreign investors. With an 80 million-strong population, we have a large domestic market. We are also in a Customs Union with the EU. Thanks to vocational education and experience in Turkey, our labor force is qualified and competitive. Our geographical location connects Europe, Asia, and Africa. Turkey has well-developed infrastructure and a business-friendly investment climate with low taxes and strong incentives. In parallel with their investments at home, sectors that Nigerian investors could easily invest in include agriculture, mining, energy, infrastructure, finance, and real estate.</p><h4>How do you envision the future of bilateral relations between the two countries?</h4><p>Turkey's policy of opening up to Africa and its strategic partnership with the African Union, which was declared a decade ago, was buttressed by its deep relations with several countries on the continent, including Nigeria. Turkey has been diplomatically present in Nigeria since 1960. Historically, the Ottoman Empire enjoyed relations with the people of Nigeria long before that. We believe that such deep-rooted bonds give us the opportunity to develop unwavering cooperation in a wide range of areas. We value our relationship with Nigeria very much and will spare no effort to make sure it reaches its potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you compare the crisis in 2008 with the most recent crisis?</h4><p>For Nigeria, 2008 was a bump compared to this one, even though it was a global crisis. This crisis lasted much longer and was perhaps the first major one in 30 years. We took on a relatively small amount of debt as we navigated our way out of the crisis. Other countries in Europe and the US leveraged themselves to unprecedented levels. This position will allow us to come out of the crisis with a much stronger foundation.</p><h4>When will the Eko Atlantic Mall be complete?</h4><p>The mall will be the largest in sub-Saharan Africa, though the devaluation has resulted in a slight hold on plans. Retailers asked if we could wait for the mall to be completed, because they did not want to launch this project in the middle of a crisis. We agreed on this at the time, and we are now in discussions with major operators and retailers on how to come back. Considering global development trends, the most natural area of expansion for retailers is Africa. Retail is extremely underdeveloped in Africa and Nigeria, though it presents major potential. Hopefully, we can have the mall completed in less than three years.</p><h4>How is Eko Atlantic changing the perception of Nigeria abroad?</h4><p>In 2017, a major development in Indonesia discussed its ambitions by stating it wanted to become the Eko Atlantic of that region; this is exactly what we have been waiting for. We want to be recognized around the world as world-class dewvelopers. We are now even in school books in France, and a few universities are teaching us as case studies. This is a big deal for us. We are one of the most well-known international projects in the region and the world, and this brings a great deal of positive attention to Nigeria.</p><h4>What other sectors interest you in terms of development and investment in Nigeria?</h4><p>Personally, I have a huge interest in two fields: sustainable agriculture and renewable energy. While we do not currently have the time to devote ourselves to sustainable agriculture, renewable energy is exciting. I am exploring a few developments in this area, and eventually we will want to do something in this field. Right now, the Eko Atlantic project is the core focus of the group. We are also focused on hotels, restaurants, and entertainment. Infrastructure through Hitech Construction is also a vital part of our operations. We are currently exploring projects outside of Nigeria, which is a first for us. We are looking at neighboring countries in West Africa, and perhaps further down the line we will expand all across Africa. We have the know-how and the teams in place to succeed in these areas and export ourselves.</p><h4>What message would you like to send to the international investor community about Nigeria?</h4><p>The longer they wait, the more opportunities investors will miss out on. The country is growing quickly, and if they are scared about little bumps, this may not be the place for them. If, however, they seek long-term growth and success, this is the last frontier. There are always ways of correcting these issues. Solutions exist for any issue. Nigeria is business friendly, and once one learns how to navigate the hurdles, the benefits offset the challenges.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>The country is now used to operating with a more diversified business mindset. Oil can no longer be the sole foundation of the economy, and this recognition will translate into even more development across all areas of the economy. I expect to see strong continued interest from Nigerians overseas looking at investing back home. Remittances will only increase, and they will have a positive influence on the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Buhari joined the Nigerian army in 1961 and was Head of State from December 1983 to August 1985. During this time in office, his government worked to re-balance public finances and strengthen the country’s economy. Buhari gained a master’s in strategic studies from the United States Army War College (USAWC) in 1980, at the rank of Colonel, before becoming General Officer Commanding in August 1980. As the candidate for the All Progressives Party, Buhari won the 2015 election on a platform of anti-corruption and improved security, while his 2019 re-election was the result of his “4+4“ campaign, which focused on the foundation he had created in his first mandate in order to bring Nigeria to the “next level.“]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Dear compatriots,</p><p><span></span>First and foremost, I give thanks to Almighty God who has spared our lives to witness another victory for Nigerian democracy and victory for our party APC. I thank the millions of Nigerians who voted to re-elect me as your president for the next four years. I am deeply humbled and profoundly grateful to you for judging me worthy of continuing to serve you and for your peaceful conduct. Everyone can appreciate the progress the country has made since 2015. We have had our challenges: security, economic, political, and social. But we are resolved to combat and overcome them all.</p><p>Our economic policies are beginning to make the desired impact. Economic growth has resumed and is continuing to improve. Inflation is coming down steadily, there is stability in the exchange rate, and foreign exchange is readily available for genuine business. Foreign reserves are adequate and growing, capital inflows have increased, and the trade balance is positive. Moreover, I am pleased that the results of the priority we have placed on infrastructure are beginning to bear fruit. In 2016 and 2017, capital expenditure was up to NGN2.7 trillion, while over N800 million has been released under the current budget. This was complemented by the inception of the USD650-million Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund, which will focus initially on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, the Second Niger Bridge, the Abuja-Kano expressway, and the Mambilla hydropower plant. Progress has been achieved in the transportation sector, too. The Abuja-Kaduna railway is up and running. The Itakpe-Warri line is being test-run before going commercial. The completed portion of the Abuja light rail project is facilitating movement to the airport. The Lagos-Ibadan railway is nearing completion with people already taking test rides on the completed portions. We are determined to work at the same pace on the Coastal Railway Line and the line from Port Harcourt to Maiduguri.<br>Our economic fundamentals are strong and, in the next four years by the grace of God, we are determined to stay the course in terms of partnerships with the private sector, support to the real sector, helping small businesses, providing infrastructure and an enabling business environment.</p><p>The new administration will intensify its efforts in security, restructure the economy, and fight corruption. We have laid down the foundation and are committed to seeing matters to the end. We will strive to strengthen our unity and inclusiveness so that no section or group will feel left behind or left out. The hard work to deliver a better Nigeria continues, building on the foundations of peace, rule of law, and opportunities for all. We will roll up our sleeves afresh and give it our all. We have no other motive than to serve Nigeria with our hearts and might, and to build a nation that we and future generations can be proud of.<br>I am very grateful to the over 15 million citizens who voted for me, those who contributed in many ways in the running of our successful campaign, and those at home and abroad who expressed confidence in me and the APC government. I thank you all. I can assure that you will see a country moving to the next level, as we consolidate on our fundamental areas of securing the country, reviving the economy, and fighting corruption. </p><p>Let me pay tribute here to those who lost their lives either through accidents or mindless violence during the course of these elections. My heart and thoughts are with the families of the victims. May God comfort and give them the fortitude to bear the loss. We are resolved to build a country in which the resources are utilized for the benefit of the largest number, and not appropriated by a privileged few in their never ending quest to satisfy their greed. We are on this mission together, and I assure you of a firm commitment to the ideals of a safe, secure, fair, just and prosperous country.<br>I thank you for your support and may God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the current state of the sector, and what should be the strategy to gain ground in the MICE sector?</h4><p>MICE tourism requires the destination to have excellent connectivity, hotel infrastructure, and road network. The participation of strong sectors and key local players is equally important, as is a solid convention bureau that can assist international organizers in local matters. MICE tourism requires collaborative competition. The international congresses are requested through candidatures by the national association that represents the congress, so we need to have internal preparation and teamwork to show the benefits of the destination and prepare those who will represent us. MICE tourism is not new to Costa Rica, as over the years we have held presidential summits and Central American and Latin American events. However, to date, we had never brought it to its present dimension.</p><h4>What are the strengths of Costa Rica as a MICE destination?</h4><p>Costa Rica's geographic location holds the key, enabling a Latin American group to attract professionals from South, Central, and North America. There are important sectors that we can attract, similar to how the New York Convention Bureau attracts the fashion sector. With that in mind, we have analyzed strong sectors for MICE tourism in Costa Rica: medical, administration, and technological congresses.</p><h4>What was the process of establishing the National Congress Center like?</h4><p>While the number of events is multiplying, their sizes are falling as congresses become more specialized. Therefore, the size of the Costa Rica Convention Center is ideal for the country. At present, there is 5,700sqm for meeting areas, and 15,000sqm of area is under construction; however, beyond that, we are working on other strategies to make it a world-class convention center. To that end, we plan to acquire ISO 9001: 2015 certification, assuring foreign congresses that we will provide top level services. Notably, our operations manager is a certified meeting professional (CMP), which is an<br>international certification for event planners.</p><h4>How do you support the organizations responsible for making the international bids to win the events that would later be hosted at the convention center?</h4><p>Recently, we had an open house with the participation of more than 300 people, and 60% of those people represented professional associations. We brought them to see how events are held in the convention center before giving them training to showcase how we operate the center, what can be done, the operating regulations, and so on. The idea is to strengthen the center by showing people how the center works; only then we can defend it before a candidacy.</p><h4>What benefits do you gain from being a member of the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA)?</h4><p>ICCA provides a great deal of training, updates, and data regarding the MICE segment across the world. The other side of the coin is to be able to do research with all the data that ICCA gives us, allowing us to analyze congresses confirmed for Costa Rica and those that could potentially be held in Costa Rica, for example.</p><h4>Which segments do you target in the coming years?</h4><p>The local industry is strengthened when a convention center opens, allowing suppliers to do other events and multiply the effect. On an international level, medical sciences have a big role and should be developed locally; therefore, we invite boards of directors to have meetings in the convention center at no charge.</p><h4>How have you positioned yourselves in the local market so that key stakeholders know about the convention center?</h4><p>We exclusively specialize in events. The events that have taken place here have a multiplier effect on attendance. For example, assembly times at the convention center can be halved because we have the necessary logistics and infrastructure in place. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the tourist identity of Costa Rica?</h4><p>Costa Rica has an essential identity: we have enormous biodiversity in a small territory. Due to its size, biodiversity is accessible, and tourists can enjoy many different experiences from sun and beach to trees, adventure, hiking in the forests, national parks, volcanoes, and small cities with personality. Costa Rica offers a unique and different experience. We have average stays of 12 days because people want to see everything.</p><h4>What would you attribute Costa Rica's success in tourism to?</h4><p>Costa Rica is successful because the public and private sectors share a vision of development. We created a National Tourism Development Plan for the entire sector. We have 30 years of building this joint vision, though we do not always fully agree with each other. Some sectors are inclined toward certain types of mass development, while others are inclined toward smaller projects; however, we have managed to build a joint vision that allows the tourism sector to be committed to sustainable, innovative development that enables tourism to grow in different parts of the country. We do not have enclave tourism, though it allows tourists to visit different areas through the distribution of tourist value. We measure success via several elements. More than the influx of tourists and foreign exchange earnings, we are interested in tourism developing the communities. Our goal is to make Costa Ricans live better through the tourism development of their regions.</p><h4>Where are the greatest opportunities in the tourism sector?</h4><p>We seek to complement the current tourism development with wellness tourism, which has enormous potential. This sector includes spas, hot springs, yoga, and others that a sophisticated and experienced tourist looks for. Such tourists always seek new experiences. In the same way, we are forming alliances with the Ministry of Culture to include cultural and gastronomic aspects in the experience.</p><h4>What is the tourist contribution in the development of the Costa Rican orange economy?</h4><p>There are opportunities to grow with the cultural sector. When we talk about culture, we do not only talk about pre-Colombian iconic places, but also music. Costa Rica has invested heavily in the development of symphony orchestras, and we have amazing museums. San José is developing as a city with many cultural activities. The tourist experience can be much richer with experiences that are more authentic. We promote Costa Rica to European tourists because that market seeks authentic cultural experiences.</p><h4>How can the Ministry of Tourism support national institutions to streamline the processes of construction and development of tourist places like in Limón?</h4><p>We have a great responsibility because we manage all the maritime-terrestrial zones. This responsibility has generated sustainable development with tourism that creates welfare, supports entrepreneurs, and encourages employment. The general objective is to ensure tourism remains the engine of the economy. Costa Rica has achieved the goal of 6% growth, with 5.5% growth in the holiday market and 10% growth in the business and convention market, which has enormous potential.</p><h4>Why has Costa Rica been so successful in promoting itself and establishing this international reputation?</h4><p>The success of Costa Rica is because it has been consistent; there have been no radical changes of leadership, and it has built on its past. The new country brand is used in tourism, exports, and investments. The promise we have made as a country is maintained and fulfilled. Some 30% of tourists return, and more than 90% leave satisfied. Our success also rests on the fact that we have an innovative, professional, experienced private sector with the objective of satisfying tourists. There is also a technical team in the public sector composed of professionals who have a great deal of experience and who are committed, regardless of the government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the current state of the pharmaceutical sector and is there a possibility to establish Costa Rica as a regional hub to export pharmaceutical products?</h4><p>There are 300 pharmaceutical laboratories in Costa Rica, according to an international publication. After operating in the Costa Rican market for 38 years, Lisan is among the 22 largest laboratories operating in the country. Indeed, multinational companies are ahead of us, and getting to the top level means that we have to overcome the largest companies. As a result, Lisan is focused on developing pharmaceutical products from active vegetable ingredients in order to grow outside of Costa Rica. The generic segment is saturated, which is why we are seeking a different strategy to export unique products that do not compete with big pharma companies in the region.</p><h4>One of the company's initiatives is adopting the country brand. What does it mean for a company to adopt the country brand?</h4><p>Adopting the country brand is part of our strategy to export. In this industry, it is necessary to export because the operational costs in relation to the size of the market are high. So, shipping products abroad is highly important to avoid depending solely on the Costa Rican market. Thus, the challenge was how to seek opportunities in other countries because many Latin American nations have passed laws to protect their local industries. Therefore, we have invested our profits in R&amp;D to create a unique brand with innovative products for the global market. As a result, when we learned that Procomer wanted to align our products to the country brand, we found an opportunity to demonstrate we can generate products by just using vegetable ingredients for developed countries. At present, Lisan is already exporting to the US.</p><h4>How can the country as a whole invest a lot more in research and development to become a leader in innovation? </h4><p>30 years ago, there was a program to boost industry in Costa Rica. My proposal, back then, was that national laboratories should create an R&amp;D center for the entire pharmaceutical industry. Back in the day, we started to see that the development of new products from natural ingredients was taking shape. At Lisan, we started to invest in R&amp;D in 1998. Such a decision was easy for us because since Lisan is a family-owned company and in 1995 we decided not to pay dividends and use those profits for R&amp;D.</p><h4>Do you see an opportunity for Procomer to attract foreign investment?  </h4><p>At this moment, we are opening other markets and we are using a fulfillment center supported by Procomer, which is also our representative for dealing with the US government. That has helped us greatly, because having our own fulfillment center in the US is not viable.</p><h4>What are the main achievements and milestones of Lisan? </h4><p>When Lisan started, we were the 180th largest laboratory among the 200 that existed in Costa Rica. What made Lisan different was that it focused on quality from the beginning. We imported products and formed a strong quality control system to ensure those products were in compliance with the laws. Consequently, quality began to align with our brand.<br>What differentiates Lisan from other companies? <br>We create botanical-based products instead of using synthetic drugs. In the development of natural products, we fulfill all the norms and regulations. To develop our products, we extract the actives from  plants, measure the quantity that we need for therapeutic use, and ensure our pills contain the required amount of the drug; our process is standardized. We give the consumer the assurance that the product will remain consistent</p><h4>What role do certifications play in your commercial strategy?</h4><p>It is required by law to follow the good manufacturing practices code. The challenge is to make the world market understand that a country in the middle of the Americas is doing something trustworthy. Costa Rica has an extremely rich biodiversity, so if we are able to seize this biodiversity, we can offer quality products to the entire world.</p><h4>How are you planning to expand?</h4><p>The Central American market is a complex one and we have focused on this market with generics. However, this is not a profitable market. Our natural  products are unique because they are created with plants from Costa Rica, so we would like to enter into the European market in the short run through our plant-based products. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the country need to do to incentivize companies to establish their manufacturing, R&amp;D, distribution centers, and commercialization here?</h4><p>Establishment Labs is proof that companies can do all these here. Perhaps the aim for the short term is not for companies to establish headquarters here but to start doing more R&amp;D and shared services here. If they could use Costa Rica as their distribution center as well, it would be extremely positive. The cluster is already working on an initiative that includes R&amp;D projects, and those are going well. There are several success stories from the cluster, and those are positive for everyone seeking to establish themselves in Costa Rica. However, we still need to do more, because at the end of the day it is a business question. Costa Rica has proven it can do the technology part, and it is now about proving it can do R&amp;D.</p><h4>What lessons did Establishment Labs learn from its IPO launch, and what does it mean to be an ambassador of Costa Rica at Wall Street?</h4><p>There were many lessons, though in terms of business, we were successful in going to NASDAQ because we are in fact solving a problem for women worldwide. That is perhaps the single-most important thing. People clearly understood our contribution to this industry and how over the last few years we have been gaining ground as a company, and can continue to do so, with the funds they have given us. This is the first time a medical device company from Latin America has listed on NASDAQ, especially in a sector as competitive as prosthetics. The fact that we are successful speaks to the clarity of our message.</p><h4>As a public company, what is Establishment Labs doing to increase value for its shareholders?<br></h4><p>We are committed to our business model. We are clear in our purpose to improve safety and aesthetic outcomes in breast surgery. We continue to create new technologies to address those challenges, and as a result our company continues to grow. Although we have to report every quarter, we have a clear view of our path for the coming years. Part of the proceeds of the IPO go to our US clinical trial for Motiva implants. The other part is to continue growing the business. We announced in November 2018 that we will launch direct sales in the UK. We will continue with that strategy of having a closer relationship with our customers. Given those two factors, we will be able to prove that the company can scale up in a healthy fashion so our business model can continue to grow.</p><h4>What is the process for choosing a country to expand into, and what new markets does Establishment Labs want to enter in the coming years?</h4><p>We are currently selling direct in Brazil, which is the number-two market worldwide, and that has been a phenomenal success story for Establishment Labs. That speaks of our ability to work in an extremely large market and still do well. We also sell direct in France, showing we can gain market share in a complicated country. We do the same in Scandinavia and now the UK. We will continue to explore new possibilities in Europe and beyond with a data-driven approach on breast surgery statistics to define key markets.</p><h4>What is the outlook for Establishment Labs growing its market share in the US?</h4><p>We are going through the FDA clinical process and will continue to do so. We plan to complete the enrolment of our clinical trial in early 2019. When we look at our market share numbers in places like Scandinavia, Japan, Austria, and Brazil and compare them to the US, we  believe we can reach the same market share. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your take on the current state of the health sector in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Costa Rica enjoys the health indices of developed nations in terms of infant mortality, longevity, the incidence of chronic diseases versus infectious diseases, and so forth. We went in a few decades from relatively low life expectancy to high, and from high fertility rates to low, and we are seeing the consequences of that in terms of utilization of healthcare services, whether for in-patient care, out-patient care, or pharmaceutical consumption. It is a challenging time, as we have to care for an aging population, though also an exciting one as we are in the process of updating technology and expanding infrastructure throughout our system to be able to deal with this. With new technological developments in informatics, medical equipment, and scientific understanding of disease, we are in a position to have a greater impact on the health of our population.</p><h4>What should be the public and private healthcare mix in the Costa Rican system?</h4><p>Our role as a public institution is to meet the constitutional mandate in Costa Rica where every citizen has a constitutional right to health. This is a major challenge as it involves any procedure that has a clinical benefit, while drugs that have been shown to have a high efficacy should also be covered by the system. Every system has its strengths and weaknesses; our strengths are coverage as pretty much everyone is covered in terms of age, income bracket, and geography, as well as virtually against any disease that has a treatment. It also means that in a system of universal healthcare coverage with no limits on what diseases are covered and with no exclusions, demand is growing at a rapid pace as our population ages and the expectations of our citizens increase. The challenge is to care for all these patients on a timely basis, which is why we are building greater capacity from an infrastructure, technology, and human capital perspective. Sustainability is a major issue, as we need to remain efficient and be able to make the most rational decisions on what type of services and medicines will be the most cost effective in treating our population. We have a luxury system in that everything that can be clinically justified is covered. The private sector has been filling in the gaps where the public sector has not met the expectations of the population on a timely basis.</p><h4>What are the main priorities and objectives of your current agenda?</h4><p>We need to establish an innovative approach to healthcare. Demand for healthcare services is set to outpace the growth of our economy due to our aging population. We need to innovate so that we can care for these patients in a more cost-effective manner using evidence-based medicine to the greatest extent and by understanding the protocols and procedures that are most effective, which includes promoting preventive medicine. Secondly, we want to update medical technology and have state-of-the-art equipment in our hospitals, whilst also upgrading our physical infrastructure through renovations or new facilities. There are new projects such as in-vitro fertilization that we hope to offer our citizens starting in June. Another major priority with numerous components that we need to accomplish is to reduce waiting times for elective procedures, whether for elective surgeries or diagnostics, as waiting times are always a top priority among patients. We need to promote a culture of innovation, where leaders in our healthcare system are willing to re-invent how we do things. To this end, we will take full advantage of our latest tool in Caja's toolbox, our newly implemented electronic record system EDUS. For the first time since 1941, we have an electronic record system where medical records can be brought up at any of our clinics or hospitals in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why are local value-added products on the shelves more expensive than imported ones?</h4><p>We are losing competitiveness due to labor, energy, and logistics costs, adding to a lack of infrastructure. We have to find the markets where we can compete based on the premium position of our products such as pineapples, bananas, and coffee.</p><h4>What initiatives is the private sector taking to position your products in order to make them competitive?</h4><p>We make our products more competitive through niche targeting and value-added products. For example, our company Alimentos Kamuk Internacional specializes in exporting hot sauce. We take advantage of what we have here with tropical fruits nearby, a competitive glass industry, and a skilled labor force, as such a fruit sauce requires a certain level of manual labor. We have been able to market and sell a high-quality niche product to many countries around the world while our competitors still sell red hot sauce like everyone else. Five years ago, we started moving our own rice production to become pesticide free, which is an interesting case, as we are still in commodities but are differentiating our product to the rest of the world by being the first rice producer to obtain the carbon neutral certification. We also produce our own electricity with rice husk byproducts.</p><h4>How have you managed to gain the trust of end consumers?</h4><p>We have maintained our quality-based brand vision for our entire 70-year existence. Through varying challenges over time, we have invested in technology, such as electronic grain sorters, to remain at the top of market. We have also maximized the efficiency of our trade logistics with the other companies in the group and enhanced quality discipline, best practices, and certifications that are mandatory if we want to compete around the world.</p><h4>What are your current expansion plans?</h4><p>We want to get closer to our end customers and are investing in the diversification efforts of Disal, our food distribution arm. Our plan is to improve the positioning of our brands whilst reducing our economic risks by including a wider range of products from other local and international producers and commercializers. We recently built a new plant for Kamuk and are invested in making that grow, as we see a great opportunity to explore that niche.</p><h4>What CSR projects are you involved in?</h4><p>To support our carbon neutral project, we maintain a 3,000-ha forest with protection against fires or hunters. From our own 4.5-MW power plant, we send the excess to the national grid for local communities. We have a major aquaculture project within the same facility and a minority stakeholder position in that company, the main fish exporting company in Costa Rica. Since rice production is water intensive, we source our water from Lago Arena and use it first for our aquaculture activities. We then reuse this water and pass it down to sugarcane producers before diverting it down to rivers and oceans, which means we do not take water from the ground in the form of wells to irrigate our site. Socially, because our company started before there was national road access to our community, we provide housing for at least 50 families at low cost. Most of them are former workers who have a long history of working in the company. We have a unique combination of work and home atmosphere in our main production plant because many workers live in the community the founders built many years ago. The workers also enjoy a close relationship with the owners who have always led with a hands-on approach. Some of our neighbors are also rice producers who switch between rice and sugarcane when one business is doing better than the other. When they produce rice, we finance, buy, and provide technical assistance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the current state of the agribusiness sector?</h4><p>Costa Rica has done a great job in terms of adding value to its agricultural-based commodities via industrial processes and customer service. The agribusiness sectors of Latin American countries are still extremely agriculture minded, and we need move away from a product-centric model and adopt more of a customer-centric focus. There are many ways to differentiate one's product and move away from the commodities side of the business and up the value chain. Costa Rica is far ahead of other Latin American coffee growers because we do not grow that much coffee in terms of total quantity, with only about 1.5% of the world's coffee production; however, we are number three in the US in terms of customer awareness, only behind Brazil and almost on par with Colombia. We grow significantly less coffee than Brazil and Colombia but have an excellent positioning in coffee drinkers' minds. As a company, we contributed to this premium image over the long term through word of mouth, taking tourists on coffee tours and having a presence in other tourism spots in the country, as we have around 50 shops in hotels, parks, and places where tourists go.</p><h4>What lessons has Britt learnt in creating value-added products and supply chains?</h4><p>We did this not only with coffee but also chocolates. For example, we have several shops at Guayaquil Airport in Ecuador, and since Ecuador's cocoa is renowned because of its quality, we decided to promote our Ecuadorean chocolate bars in pretty much the same way we promote coffee here, and even export those chocolate bars to many other markets. There is a traditional cultural element in our countries, where we usually take the best of our land and export it, and we want to reverse that, and leave the “export reserve" in the country for local tasting and consumption, and export some of that production as well. Another example is Peru, where we buy most of the coffee that we sell in Lima from the province of Cusco. There are coffee fields 10km away from Machu Picchu. Over 1 million tourists go to Machu Picchu; yet, most tourists don't know about this. There is a great potential to highlight our agricultural production, tradition, flavors, and colors to tourists who come close to agricultural sites. There is a great deal of untapped potential in bringing visitors to wet mills and factories and showing them the process. It gets us closer to the customer, which is the secret of value creation.</p><h4>What is your plan in terms of expansion of new markets and products?</h4><p>We recently completed a separation of our two clearly defined businesses: Café Britt, a manufacturer of coffee and chocolate products, and Morpho Travel Retail, the operator of shops at airports and other traveler-locations. Both the travel retail and the coffee business complement each other; however, they are managed as different businesses. We are present in Chile in six airports, for example, and those shops do not sell much coffee because travelers in Chile are not necessarily looking for coffee products. That business could work out extremely well from a financial point of view without the coffee. Each business has its own competitive advantage and business plan. Morpho's plan has to do with increasing its footprint in each of the countries we currently operate, and also in other emerging economies where tourism is growing by double digits. We are looking for medium-sized markets with exciting long-term tourism growth outlook. In terms of the coffee side of the business, it also has its own plans and CAPEX. Again, we are expanding our presence in the main countries we are in, while at the same time we continue to look for new markets. We are also exploring new chocolate products, which have become an extremely important line of business for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can you tell us about the current state of the aviation sector in Costa Rica and the traffic coming into the country?</h4><p>Aviation will continue to grow, though the more one grows, the more difficult it is to maintain a high percentage of growth later on. Our expectation for growth in 2018 is about 6%, in comparison to our 10% growth every year for the last three years due to the substantial increase in European flights. We have a new airline based in Costa Rica for the Central American and Mexican market. This was already our largest market after the US and is an extremely important one, covering all travel between the Central American countries, Mexico, and South America. We also have the participation of LATAM Airlines flying directly to Costa Rica from Lima, which is currently the fourth-largest carrier in South America, complementing Avianca, Copa, and Volaris.</p><h4>Where do you see the biggest opportunities for growth?</h4><p>There is a huge opportunity in South America, as we have few travelers from Brazil, Chile, and Argentina. We are working on that, in particular with GOL Airline from Brazil. We have two local carriers, Volaris and Lacsa, which are not Costa Rican but companies based in Costa Rica. We currently have more Costa Ricans travelling; in 2010, our first full year in Costa Rica, only 25% out of a total of 1.5 million passengers were from Costa Rica. Now, the figure has grown to 72% of 2.5 million. The component of Costa Ricans travelling is an extremely important element of our service development. Recently, Southwest Airlines opened its first local sales office outside of the US in Costa Rica.</p><h4>On what grounds can Costa Rica increase the frequency of flights on already established routes?</h4><p>We have Air France, British Airways, KLM, and Lufthansa in addition to Iberia and Condor, which continue to fly from Frankfurt. We have a high occupancy factor on all of them. These airlines have been successful here and will therefore increase their frequencies. We facilitate the service for them with a standard tariff that is significantly low for a wide-body aircraft. The Costa Rican Tourism Board (ICT) has an incentive scheme whereby it invests 50% of the money that the airline spends in promoting Costa Rica.</p><h4>What are your strategies to make the airport more enjoyable for travelers while also creating more business revenue for you?</h4><p>We are expanding the commercial center that we developed in 2013, which was an extremely successful investment for Aeris. We are expanding it to integrate a food court and are developing a concept where travelers have to pass duty free and go through retail to get to the food and beverage outlets. We are in close conversation with the government to formulate a plan that will transform these stores to a high-class, state-of-the-art duty-free environment. We will have an extraordinary opportunity to do that soon. As part of the enlargement of the commercial center, we are considering having quality duty-free stores, which is lacking in Juan Santamarí­a Airport. We are pleased with the expression of Costa Rica's art and culture, especially with the Britt store, which is an extraordinary retail operator with a presence in many airports in many countries. It is a Costa Rican company that is extremely proud of its work. We are developing better VIP areas in addition to the current two and will have a third one soon. With food and beverage, we have a new tender early in 2019 to bring in better offers, because our market studies have identified that passengers want more casual dining offerings in our terminals. We have two challenges that we want to address in 2019: access to the airport in terms of traffic and controlling the taxi offerings when leaving the airport. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the activities of Via Célere? What is the origin of the company and how has it evolved in recent years?</h4><p>Via Célere was founded in May 2007 by Juan Antonio Gómez Pintado, the former Chairman, alongside four people with the vision of growing internationally. The first operations were in Brazil and Bulgaria, followed by Poland, from 2008 to 2010. The economic crisis hit Spain dramatically, and the real estate sector sunk, though several opportunities emerged. Some financial entities were identifying experienced operators and servicers that could develop the number of assets they were recovering from defaulting clients. In 2010 and 2011, Ví­a Célere reached an agreement with some of these financial entities, and that implied the return of our activities back to Spain. In 2011, Ví­a Célere reached an agreement with Bankia, Banco Sabadell, and Catalunya Caixa, and in 2012, a lot of opportunities were identified to start the development activities as an independent home builder. Via Célere has been, since its early days, a fully owned construction company that today executes between 30 to 40% of its projects. In 2017, different international funds approached the founder in order to acquire Spanish operations. Via Célere was evnetually sold to a group of funds led by Värde Partners. I joined the company as the CFO in November 2018 and in June 2019, I was promoted to CEO, when the chairman and founder of the company decided to leave.</p><h4>Via Célere has a strong commitment to innovation and industrialization. How do you embody this in your projects?</h4><p>We have more than ten internationally recognized innovations in our business operations. Our philosophy is to do something different from what the industry has done in the past in order to be better: from better design, more efficient construction techniques or more comfortable homes. We have many challenges ahead, but one we specially care about is the environment. Our sector has had a significant negative impact on the environment, and that is why today we have transformed all our projects in eco-friendly ones. We have been building homes almost the same way in the last 50 years, so we need significant efforts in terms of innovation and industrialization. These two factors automatically imply cheaper and better homes and therefore, better access for young people. We, as a society, need to guarantee that people between 24 and 35 years can afford homes. This must be a priority for any given country, including Spain.</p><h4>What is the commitment of Via Célere to building energy-efficient flats?</h4><p>Right now, 80% of our projects have an “A" energy efficiency rating, the highest one. We work on these environmental topics with the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM) in order to analyze and further develop the goals set by the UN for our sector. One of the most relevant ones is water consumption during the construction process. We provide data to the UAM in order to validate the efficiency of our operations. In the case of our developments, the consumption profile is of 6-7cbm per sqm. One of our commitments based on these results, is to return 20% of the water consumption we incurred. We cannot do it directly because water is not generated in our operations, but we can collaborate financially with NGOs and other institutions in order to develop new technologies to improve sanitation and irrigation, among many other projects.</p><h4>Ví­a Célere has several offices throughout Spain. Does Madrid have the potential to develop its real estate?</h4><p>Madrid is a very dynamic city and it has its own growth drivers if you compare it with other mid-size cities in Spain. It can be considered a mature market since there are very few land plots to be developed in the downtown area, but if you go outside the core of the city, new neighborhoods are emerging in an extremely dynamic and vivid way. Madrid was the first city to recover from the crisis and became a focus of attraction for all players in the sector. Of course, that implied an increase in construction costs, but also in retail prices. Going forward, one of the big problems of Madrid is the availability of fully permitted land plots.</p><h4>Has Via Célere considered entering new markets such as logistics or offices, the hottest sectors in real estate in Spain currently?</h4><p>We have been always a home developer and we will remain as such since this is our area of expertise. There are other attractive segments within the real estate arena, but they require additional know-how that we do not have. It is clear for us that the long term trends point out to a significant increase in volume and price of the e-commerce goods, and this will impact the way logistics are designed today (probably in the future it will make more sense to have huge warehouse facilities outside the cities and small storage capacity premises to reach the last mile), but clearly that is not part of our core business. We are convinced that the complexity of each niche within the real estate sector requires a specific skill set and very specialized players. By the end of 2019, we will have more than 110 developments underway throughout Spain and this will consume all of our energies. Our priority is to be able to exceed our customers' expectations every time a product or a service is delivered on behalf of Ví­a Célere.<br></p><h4>Why is Spain such an attractive country for foreign investment in real estate?</h4><p>Spain is probably one of the fundamental real estate markets in the world. We are a very privileged country in terms of weather, we have one of the best healthcare systems in the world and we live in a very safe country. Prices are very reasonable for international customers and that creates a very attractive business case for second residences. If we talk about first residences in big cities, we are now in a very sweet moment of the cycle. Spain was hit very heavily by the last crisis and that forced families, corporations and the public sector to reduce significantly. That put many of the customers in a very healthy financial situation acquire a house with savings and capacity to deal with big mortgages. Affordability of the houses is not a problem in many of the Spanish big cities and therefore, demand needs to catch up the scarcity of the offer of the last five years. Once this become more stable, we expect a long plateau for the price of the assets in the coming years. And of course, the current evolution of interest rates clearly helps to sustain a strong demand for the real estate sector.</p><h4>How has the local real estate sector and its policies evolved after the crisis?</h4><p>Crisis has hit some of the players of the real estate sector hard. First, most of the players operating before the crisis went bankrupt due to a lack of financial discipline and excessive leverage in the balance sheets. Secondly, financial institutions suffered a lot with the non-performing loans coming from the real estate sector. So, both players have learnt a lot from those days and now they are much more conservative. Banks act today as bottlenecks to access financing and home builders pay a lot of attention to their loan to value ratios.</p><h4>What are the objectives of Ví­a Célere for the rest of 2019 and 2020?</h4><p>We want to achieve the goals we fixed for ourselves in the strategic plan. We will reach the delivery of circa 1,500 units in 2019, above 2.500 units in 2020, and we will reach circa 4.000 units in 2021. If we can deliver the above mention set of figures, we will be leading the Spanish home building sector since 2019.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the current state of the sector, and where are the biggest opportunities for growth in Costa Rica?</h4><p>In terms of size, Costa Rica is large compared to the other Central American markets. It has the largest life sciences and medical devices assembly and production center in all of Central America, and it is one of the largest in Latin America. For a logistics company, this is extremely interesting, because these trade centers require a great deal of expertise in delivering spare parts and assembly parts. Additionally, we have to know how to support local manufacturers in different local logistics processes and properly handle a device as it is delivered to its final destination with the proper distribution procedures.</p><h4>How do you see the port in Moí­n changing the trade dynamics of Costa Rica and the region, particularly Panama?</h4><p>It will be a major change for several reasons. One has to do with digitalization, as we will be able to enter and engage in a more digital environment. Additionally, the facility in Moí­n has a standardized and automatic process. The terminal will increase the efficiency of the space and enable greater competiveness for exporters while supporting the import process.</p><h4>How do you see Costa Rica becoming a logistics and redistribution hub for the entire Central American and Caribbean region?</h4><p>Costa Rica has all the potential to become a larger sub-regional hub. The warehousing landscape has been growing and improving. In Costa Rica, there is excellent quality in terms of logistics infrastructure. There is interest from certain companies in investing in logistics complexes, and local companies have realized that if they have not made such investments, they need to go with an excellent provider with great service and infrastructure.</p><h4>What has been DHL's experience in the market?</h4><p>We have been in the country for 41 years. We have a consolidated brand and have more than 1,300 people in Central America. In Costa Rica alone, we have more than 600 people. We are by far the market leader in all of Central America. When it comes to international road freight, we are also a main player. In ocean freight, we can be top five depending on the country. DHL is a global company; however, we also have local companies providing different services in local markets. We have an extremely robust business model. We grow and manage our business based on our expertise in different sectors. Second, we work based on developing strong relationships with customers. Third, we invest in thinking about the long term and sustainability. We have a presence in six Central American countries with our own operational facilities, personnel, and systems. We operate our entire core business with the same or similar standards that we utilize around the globe. In Central America, we also provide end-to-end solutions, including airfreight, ocean freight, warehousing, and distribution. We are the largest customs broker in most of the countries we operate in. We are extremely strong in the transactional portion of the business, though we are most focused on providing end-to-end solutions within a highly digitized environment to long-term clients. We are one step ahead in digitalization and automation compared to our competitors.</p><h4>What does DHL's decision to tender more trade lanes mean for the company, and how are you working with partners in the region and Central America?</h4><p>Internally, we have two pillars. Our global presence, brand reputation, and well-structured procedures cater perfectly to the multinational companies with specific supply chain operations. These are medium- to long-term relationships with customers that are seeking more complex, multi-country solutions. The other pillar is promoting the trading development of SMEs. DHL works in different business environments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the state of the logistics sector, and how will it be impacted by the new container terminal?</h4><p>The logistics sector is in a process of transformation, as we have lacked the infrastructure that would permit industrial and commercial segments to grow for many years. As such, the new container terminal should provide some of these required capabilities. We still lack the proper road and transportation infrastructure to connect the port with the major cities of the country, but the current administration has certainly given us the impression that a great many new opportunities will come about in the coming years. Should it invest in infrastructure, it would allow for continuous foreign investment, and boost our regional competitiveness.</p><h4>What is the private sector's role in infrastructure development?</h4><p>The private sector and government should not be intertwined. The former should lay out the requirements of industry and commerce regarding the inflow and outflow of goods to the country. The government's responsibility is to set an agenda, allocate funds, and execute the investment.</p><h4>What potential role can Costa Rica play in regional trade dynamics?</h4><p>Let's consider this from the standpoint of being in the isthmus of Central America and being in proximity to both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. There are numerous projects that could be implemented, in which we could be highly competitive. We, as entrepreneurs and representatives of the private sector, must understand that each country has a history. Because of our established democracy, the passage of law takes a little longer than in other countries. Expectations therefore must be managed. Certain new projects over the past five years, such as the airport modernization or opening of the APM terminals, have contributed to our competitiveness, though arriving rather late in the game. The requirements of national growth are inevitably faster than infrastructure developments can keep pace with.</p><h4>Which project of urgent need represents a good opportunity for a PPP?</h4><p>We need to introduce a rail service for cargo and connect our ports to the central valley. In order of priority, this is probably easier and more advantageous than transporting containers by road.</p><h4>What is Tical's market share and brand perception?</h4><p>Stakeholders see us as a rapid innovator that is swift to anticipate consumer demand and a leading proponent of new technologies. We have grown out of Costa Rica and into the region. We are a company with an established market share in a dynamic sector. This means we understand the dynamics of supply chain and commerce, as well as all players and market variables. We are competitive, flexible, and innovative, and have leaned heavily on our brand equity. Tical has grown from being a player in a specific segment into an integrator of services and an enabler of commerce and industry far beyond traditional logistics warehousing. We have invested in the effective communication of our transformation on a global basis.</p><h4>What do you have over a major global logistics player?</h4><p>Being a regional player means that we focus strongly on the dynamics of our business in each country. We have a competitive advantage in understanding how these dynamics work and how we can transform ourselves faster and more effectively to meet customer demands. We have also become a partner of these companies and helped them better enact their strategies. Other competitors that are not based in Central America are more focused on a standardized approach to the developed world, whereas the type of opportunities and challenges presented to local companies in emerging markets tend to be better understood by local players.</p><h4>What solutions have you implemented in your operations that make you stand out to potential clients?</h4><p>The supply chain operates dynamically, and the flow of goods is constant. What we do is analyze the differentials in the chain. We want to be able to effectively control the inputs, process, and outputs. We define this as an interplay of processes, people, and technology. These three factors are our focus in terms of tapping into the supply chain. Because of the dynamics of the business, these processes require constant revision and the ability to adapt to the changing dynamics of market players. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can Costa Rica do to improve its trade and logistics sector?</h4><p>We have done a great job regarding international trade. Costa Rica has opened its borders to the world, and international trade has boomed. At the moment, we have to resolve some of our domestic issues with regard to our fiscal deficit and debt. Only then can we invest more money in highways and infrastructure and thus attract more investment in manufacturing into Costa Rica. With foreign trade, we are not doing badly, especially with the sector that covers foreign-to-foreign transactions on free trade zones and on agriculture and services.</p><h4>How can Costa Rica be a regional operational base for trade and logistics?</h4><p>We are already in eight different countries, and our strategy has been to provide consistent service to our customers through systems and the best human resources available. We use our knowledge and experience to help our customers manage their logistics processes throughout Central America and part of the Caribbean. We are also doing supply chain management for companies in the Dominican Republic that use Costa Rica as the base to manage their regional operations. We have been focusing on companies with regional headquarters in Costa Rica that manage their logistics and supply chain throughout Central America.</p><h4>How do you see the APM Terminal in Moí­n changing the trade dynamics of Costa Rica?</h4><p>APM Terminals is one of the best things to happen to the country. We are now positioning our infrastructure with a world-class operator that will provide port facilities that can handle 8,000-10,000-TEU vessels. That should reduce ocean freight costs since Costa Rican exporters will no longer have to do transshipment anywhere else. The big ships will arrive in Limón and go on to Europe and Asia. This will reduce many of the inefficiencies that had effected our exports for a long time since the original German port project was inaugurated in 1982.</p><h4>Can this success be replicated on the Pacific coast?</h4><p>Caldera has been establishing the proper conditions to dredge the terminal and receive larger vessels. A new port would have to be built. At the moment, we have a great deal of trouble with swells in Caldera; sometimes we have four, five, or six ships waiting because the bad weather does not allow us to start discharging. With improved road infrastructure, we could move some cargo from Limón to Caldera and then ship it out to the Far East if we upgrade our port capacity.</p><h4>What have been the main achievements and history of ILG Logistics?</h4><p>We have had our milestones; however, what makes ILG stand out from the others is its strong corporate governance and financial statements. We have always managed our customer supply chain from a maritime transportation point of view. That has made us successful, because other logistics companies manage the supply chain from an air transportation point of view, and we have been able to tie up our main customer supply chain and solve some of their import and export procedural problems. The future will involve expanding beyond Central America and entering Colombia. We have opened an office in Bogotá and are keen to do more business in Colombia. Some customers have also asked us to provide services in Mexico, though we do not enter a market without having a customer to support there.</p><h4>Why should investors looking to set up shop in Costa Rica work with you?</h4><p>Because we have the best people, systems, and infrastructure. We strive to excel in everything we do and focus on our work and customer relationships, which is why I am extremely proud of ILG's customer portfolio. We have several of the top Fortune 500 companies doing business with us in Central America.</p><h4>How do you ensure your share remain attractive?</h4><p>To keep our shareholders satisfied, we run the company in a competent way and ensure we are always transparent. Our quarterly financials are published on our web page, and Fitch has rated our debt bonds A. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the country's commercial dynamics change after the opening of Moí­n?</h4><p>It will change the logistical paradigm in Costa Rica. We expect it to be the most efficient terminal in Latin America. Our previous infrastructure limited us to small vessels. As a result, the logistic process was extremely complex, because goods from Costa Rica had to be sent to other ports to be shipped to their final destination. That resulted in higher logistic costs for companies. Thus, having a terminal that can receive larger vessels changes the paradigm, since we are becoming a first division port. In addition, the current port had several inefficiencies that resulted in slow service. However, with this new terminal, the competitiveness of the country and region will change. The Panama Canal expansion allows larger Asian vessels to pass through it, and we needed to have the infrastructure ready for these vessels. We can receive vessels from Asia because Moí­n is just 750km north of the two ports in Panama. That opens up an opportunity for us, and we have to demonstrate we are efficient in managing those goods through our road infrastructure and borders.</p><h4>What role should TCM play in the future of infrastructure projects in Costa Rica?</h4><p>2019 will represent the end of construction and the start of operations for the biggest infrastructure project of the decade in Costa Rica. TCM is an example of the steps that need to be taken into account when a project like this is launched. APM is a well-known player that operates 74 terminals across the world and takes that knowledge to every project it manages. The company is bringing its experience of running 74 terminals to the country. We are taking the first step, which is choosing the right ethical partner. When APM came to the country to develop the terminal, the first thing we considered was doing it with the lowest environmental impact and helping the country to meet its goals. Costa Rica is interested in not generating any electricity from coal, and we had to take that into account. The terminal has electric equipment to supply almost all its energy needs. The project is, therefore, in line with the country's goals. In this case, APM brings all the financing, construction, and expertise. The rate to be implemented will be balanced, and includes the repayment of the investment and guarantees that as a company we are not interested in creating a monopoly. We want to operate with a reasonable profit margin, which is publicly known, and that rate will not be modified unless the price of the dollar fluctuates. This will be our rate policy for the next 30 years, a stability which is extremely important for exporters. It is a transparent, environmentally sustainable, and responsible model whose results have already been demonstrated.</p><h4>What main economic activities can be developed as a result of the terminal?</h4><p>The biggest impact will be turning Moí­n into a logistics hub. There will be a free trade zone that creates infrastructure and jobs for the logistic services. At the same time, there is an opportunity to develop a cruise terminal linked to the concession contract. Nearly 7% of the gross income that the terminal collects will be spent on development funds, according to the contract. That amount, estimated at today's rates, could generate nearly USD20 million to develop projects in the Atlantic. That USD20 million will be generated in the first year, an amount that the Board of Port Administration and Economic Development of the Atlantic Coast (JAPDEVA) has not had to finance its development programs in a decade. If a cruise terminal is also developed, Limón would also reap huge benefits from providing tourist services to develop other economic areas.</p><h4>How many jobs could the terminal in Limón create?</h4><p>In the first stage, we will hire nearly 650 people to operate the terminal and nearly 900 during the second stage. However, more indirect jobs will be created, in addition to economic growth. The economy could grow by USD3 billion in the next decade, a hugely important rate from one project alone. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current state of the sector?</h4>
<p>2018 was a great year for us; our company exceeded its goals for the year. There is a great deal of uncertainty for 2019 because of the fiscal situation in the country. The government has many projects in the pipeline, and we are optimistic that 2019 will be a great year for the sector. We have many ongoing and future projects and a solid pipeline of projects.</p>
<h4>What main infrastructure projects will be developed, and where can the private sector collaborate?</h4>
<p>There are many projects in the infrastructure sector, such as roads and bridges. In our sector, there are hospitals and some other projects, and the government has to work on the situation. With the fiscal situation, the private sector is the one that is initiating projects. In the commercial sector, private companies need to be careful as well because there are many projects. There is always an opportunity in housing.</p>
<h4>What are the main priorities for today?</h4>
<p>Our biggest priority is to sustain growth and overcome the size limitations of the Costa Rican market. We have offices in Nicaragua, and the situation there is difficult currently. We have plans to look overseas and open an office in another country in two or three years; however, we are focusing on our local projects such as the airport expansion and new congress building, as well as a factory for Coca-Cola.</p>
<h4>How is EDICA positioned in terms of market share, as well as public perception?</h4>
<p>Market share is hard to say, because there is a great deal of informality in the sector. Taking everything into account, we are at 4-5%. We do not participate in every project. In terms of public perception, there is no other construction company in the country that has more experience in what we do, not including infrastructure. In 61 years, we have not delivered a project late or gone to court with a client. In a small market like Costa Rica, this is important, because everyone knows everyone. We have repeat customers with whom we negotiate directly. This is our main advantage: our name and our brand.</p>
<h4>What does it mean to be a part of every Costa Rican's life?</h4>
<p>Sometimes when we present the company, people say they did not know we built the children's hospital or all the phases of the airport. It is an ongoing effort to be everywhere and get involved. This is something for which there is a great deal of opportunity. We have a social responsibility program, and in 2018 we worked on housing projects for the poor in partnership with other companies. We also have health initiatives and a program through which we donate scholarships related to our work in the sector. We try to do a major social responsibility project and two or three smaller projects every year. In terms of our employees, we have plans and scholarships to help people develop within the company.</p>
<h4>What roles do your certifications play when presenting yourself for a possible partnership?</h4>
<p>It is extremely important because the sector is all about standards. We have 1,200 workers here, not including sub-contractors, and 25 different workstations. Certifications give us standards all over the company. It gives our customers peace of mind to know that everything we do is documented and according to standard processes and our certifications are renewed every year. It gives us not just periodic updates on what we are doing but also greater confidence. We do all of our projects the same way and follow the same procedures.</p>
<h4>What are your expansion plans?</h4>
<p>We are still defining our plans, though they include finding a local partner. In South America, projects are much bigger than what we do here. When we went to Nicaragua, we did it by ourselves with no local partner. If we decide to enter South America, our intention is to find a local partner.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the current main priorities, challenges and opportunities in this sector so connected with society?</h4><p>There is a study by the Inter-American Development Bank that analyzes the housing deficit across Latin America and the Caribbean, from which it becomes evident that Costa Rica has the lowest deficit print of approximately 13-14%. We have implemented a successful housing policy called the national financial system for housing, a public-private partnership (PPP) representing the national financial system for housing. The state, through an institution called mortgage bank housing, a second-tier bank, makes the corresponding analysis and ultimately approves or rejects projects. Of the 100% of funds that Costa Rica has to designate to housing, 60% is applied to individual bonds, namely families who individually find their own solution, while the other 40% is allocated to projects. Families with an income of over CRC400,000 (USD667) per month, while considered lower middle class, do benefit from a housing subsidy, albeit a relatively low one. We are working on ways to provide greater assistance through access to credit. It is essentially a matter of access to adequate and affordable financing.</p><h4>How can the ministry work with institutions to speed up permits and make the processes easier for the investor?</h4><p>Procedural processes in Costa Rica have three phases. Initial permits concern land use, the availability of drinking water, and others that deal with the conditions of a project prior to development. Once this is obtained we move to the design stage, where I also handle the final plans and ensure the permits of such institutions as the fire department, the Ministry of Health, the architects association, the National Institute of Housing and Urbanism (INVU), and the Water and Sanitation Institute (AyA). Once this process is completed, the final phase involves the municipalities, which award the final license. Executive Decree 36550 has tasked the Ministry of Housing with the coordination of all procedures. For the past five years, all mid-stage permits have been digitized and dispensed through a single digital window. Also, there are deadlines in place for approval, which if exceeded automatically mean project approval. Of the 82 municipalities in the country, 30 already operate on the same platform. Once permits are granted by these institutions directly, the municipality related to the prospective project is given notification of approval which it then analyzes, and any subsequent payments related to the permit can be done online. This also extends the transparency of the permit process. </p>]]></richbody0content>

How does this compare to the rate of growth in previous years?</h4><p>In the last 10 years, the construction sector in Colombia has grown at an average rate of 2.6% per year. Our projections for 2019 show the consolidated recovery process that the sector is experiencing, which is expanding at higher levels than the national economy. In fact, the Ministry estimates that the building sector will become an engine for productive activity which is expected to be 3.4% during the year. It should be emphasized that there are currently very favorable perspectives for the sector. It has experienced two consecutive quarters with strong signs of recovery. For example, the GDP of the building sector registered growth rates of 6.2% and 4.4% for the 3Q and 4Q of 2018, respectively, and the leading indicators, including employment and the willingness of consumers to buy houses, have shown positive growth rates in the first three months of the year.</p><h4>In order to improve this rate of growth, the ministry has outlined a four point plan to boost the construction sector. This includes a plan to reduce the costs and time of licensing for construction projects. What specific reforms is the ministry planning to advance, and how will they affect the growth of the construction sector?</h4><p>Our strategy to promote digitalization and technological progress needs to respond to present conditions, where the procedures for licensing not only increase costs, but also affect the transparency of the whole process. For example, evidence has shown that the time spent on the paperwork required to issue construction licenses can increase costs by up to 10%. However, the highest delay comes in obtaining the necessary certificates to apply for construction licenses, which, by law, must be issued in 45 days. The Ministry will ensure speed in this procedure through a transactional information system called Terra. This system will be the result of the application of technological tools and the improvement of inter-institutional coordination. Digitalizing the process will allow integrating the obtaining of certificates that are needed to get the licenses in a single system. However, the coordination between government entities becomes the key factor as this means to ensure that the information that lays in the System remains updated and certified. This is possible through the standardization of its contents and its inter-operability with other information systems that currently exist. The possibility of having standardized information, and a platform that allows to carry out the procedures will significantly reduce the time required to collect the necessary documentation to apply for the construction licenses. This time-saving will result in a reduction of over costs currently faced by project developers and, thus, increase productivity in the sector.</p><h4>Another core point of the plan will be initiatives to foment the digitalization and technological advancement of the sector. How will the Ministry aid the technological evolution of the sector, and what results can we expect from these initiatives?</h4><p>One of the core elements in our productivity strategy is digitalization, specifically, the application of Building Information Modelling methodology, which is currently implemented at a low rate in Colombia and with a limited number of projects at a limited. Whereas in the UK 74% of the companies of the sector implement it, in Colombia this percentage goes as low as 37%, ranking below Chile, which is a regional benchmark, with 52%, according to the IDB. The implementation of BIM translates into a reduction of times and costs in construction projects, and therefore in an increase of productivity. McKinsey Global Institute estimates that the adoption of good technological practices, including BIM, generates a cost reduction of between 4% and 6% and an increase in productivity between 14% and 15%. These gains are the result of the reduction of design risks and improvements in project planning, thanks to a flow of adequate information between the different phases of the project. Our goal is to encourage the use of BIM so that at least one third of the companies use the methodology in more than 80% of their projects. To reach that goal, the Ministry has defined two specific activities. First, to design and implement the BIM Colombia Strategy with different entities such as the Ministry of Transport, the National Planning Department and National Development Finance. This will result in the development of standards and protocols to be adopted by the companies. The second action seeks to reduce initial costs of adopting BIM in companies, through a line of credit. This line will be managed by Bancoldex, which offers specialized products for medium and small businesses.</p><h4>Colombia's Mortgage Portfolio rate is 6.5%, one of the lowest in the region. How is the Ministry working to improve access to Mortgage Credits and housing subsidies for Colombians who need them?</h4><p>The mortgage portfolio in Colombia remains below the pre-crisis levels of the late 1990s (8.8%) as well as below the Latin America average. For the next four years, we have set the ambitious goal of reducing the level of outstanding mortgage credits to 8.5% of the GDP. Given that all government programs go through the mortgage portfolio, it is crucial to reinforce the ability of the financial sector to provide easier access to mortgage credit to families demanding it. This is the reason why we have recently announced the creation of an Advisory Commission that will carry out a diagnosis of the sector and provide policy recommendations to promote mortgage credit in the country. The results of this study will be reflected in better conditions for a greater number of low-income families to access mortgage credit, which will be added to economic benefits provided by the National Government through social programs such as “Mi Casa Ya“ and “Semillero de Propietarios.“</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the current state of the sector?</h4><p>Every company in the IT sector is on the path to digital transformation, and every operator has to provide the final consumer with what they need. Telecable is focused on the end user in the residential and corporate segment. We seek to provide everything that is necessary for companies so they can avoid having to enter into significant CAPEX.</p><h4>How has the sector evolved, and where are the opportunities for economic growth?</h4><p>The telecommunications sector has evolved toward the integration of services driven by the digital transformation that companies are requesting. The opportunities for growth are in the specificity of the supply according to the needs of each industry, adaptable and in flexible business models like pay per use that allow greater efficiency in the use of resources.</p><h4>How has the Telecable growth process been, and what have been the secrets to your success?</h4><p>Telecable was established in 2005. Throughout these 13 years we have grown in both the residential and commercial markets based on a service philosophy that exceeds customer expectations and with innovative products suited to their needs at competitive rates. The secret of success is based on having a team of committed shop owners looking to do things right the first time, which differentiates us. We have received the highest rating for three years running in subscription TV services and fixed internet according to the Superintendency of Telecommunications (Sutel).</p><h4>What is Telecable's position in terms of market share?</h4><p>Four years ago, we were the fourth company but are now in the top two. Part of this is because we have made great headway in broadband. On the other hand, television is a supportive feature; though its numbers are down, this transition will still take several more years. We have a presence in four provinces, though in 2018 we ventured into two additional territories, and by 2019, we hope to cover the whole country. There are always growth opportunities in the residential segment, though the most significant business opportunities are in the corporate sector. SMEs do not currently enjoy optimal connectivity, which is why we are looking into that niche to help them grow their business.</p><h4>What are your competitive advantages that help you stand out from the other operators?</h4><p>Connectivity, both in residential and commercial use, is a commodity that directly dictates people's personal and professional dynamics. Telecable is an efficient, dynamic, and fast-moving company, and this becomes a competitive advantage highly appreciated by users and commercial partners. In a small and competitive market such as Costa Rica, brand awareness and word to mouth is vital for growth in the sector.</p><h4>What are your plans to grow Telecable?</h4><p>Telecable can go anywhere. We invest between USD12 and 14 million per year in maintaining the networks, making sure they work correctly and based on the latest in technology. We are the first company to have 100% of its networks in DOCSIS 3.0. Our vision is to guarantee the best service experience and connectivity with the world. Our strategy is to keep growing and reach all places. As a result of a tender that we won for the FONATEL project, we reach 29 cantons in remote areas. We can bring connectivity to wherever it is needed, and we can do this through our partners. A year and a half ago, we started with a wireless network at a national level. If a client in Talamanca requests connectivity, and we do not have optical fiber in that region, we can go wirelessly. The important thing is not to say no. We have also rendered service to large companies, both public and private.</p><h4>What are the main positioning strategies of Telecable?</h4><p>Telecable will become the connectivity and internet company in Costa Rica. We have no doubt we will have the best network and the best internet service in the country. When any person or company thinks of internet services, they will think of Telecable. Today, we also provide services at the regional level in Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries that are our partners. We can connect China to Costa Rica in two or three days.</p><h4>Do you have any specific focus for 2019?</h4><p>We bought an optical fiber network that reaches the border with Nicaragua, and we presented the request for authorization to Sutel to integrate with a company that we acquired called Cable Costa located in Turrialba and Jimenez. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your opinion on the current state of the telecommunications sector?</h4><p>Despite having a monopoly in the past and entering a new structure where we need to keep our clients, in the last decade the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (ICE) has been able to retain its clients through a process of adjustment and establishing new ways of marketing and retaining customers. In the first year, we had 1,600 clients, and now we have over 4 million; it has been a difficult adjustment, though as a result of our human resources and the training it has received, we have been able to maintain the level of demand and the high level of efficiency required. ICE—similar to the case of ANTEL in Uruguay—is the only state company that was able to survive in this new environment of competition.</p><h4>How is Kölbi adapting its business model to include new trends such as IoT?</h4><p>We have invested a great deal in order to be able to face this migration from old technologies to this new world of IP. All our networks, transport, and communications are now evolving based on the internet. We are able to provide certain services in terms of IoT. We have LTE Advanced, and there is high penetration with the fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) that we have been working on in previous years. In terms of IoT, we have already made some important steps, for example with services such as surveillance and security for local governments. In 2020, we expect to have the first tests using 5G technology. At the same time, we also want to start installing TDD, a service that is fixed but also mobile and uses 4.5 or 5G. Kölbi is truly adapting in order to better provide its customers with all their IoT requirements.</p><h4>What responsibility does Kölbi have, being the only state-owned enterprise in the sector?</h4><p>Originally, many predicted ICE would be a tool for the development of the country. New generations are the ones that need to be persuaded, as they do not have the attachment to the company and do not know how far we have come. ICE and Kölbi are still expected to provide services to the entire country, so we still have that responsibility because that is part of our DNA.</p><h4>What was the process of developing the Kölbi brand like?</h4><p>In 2008, when the telecommunications market was opened up, ICE was a greatly respected brand, though it had a formal identity. We felt the need to create a fresh, dynamic, and flexible brand in order to compete in this environment. In 2009, we created Kölbi, which means frog in the language of the Cabécar indigenous group. We lead the market with 60% market share and continue to make investments in our network. Recently, Open Signal rated Kölbi as having the best infrastructures or technologies in 3G and 4G, which has helped us to not only attract clients but also win clients away from other companies. We are aware that we need to continue to invest—as we have done since 2011—in order to maintain Kölbi's privileged position.</p><h4>What are your plans for the 10th anniversary of Kölbi?</h4><p>We plan to have 1 million homes connected to fiber optic. We expect to have at least half of that by 2019 in addition to platforms for over-the-top (OTT) and television in all households. We want to continue to be at the forefront of technology in Central America. Costa Rica was the first country to introduce 3G and 4G, and plans are in place to achieve the same with 4.5 and 5G in 2019. We plan to expand all our services to every corner of Costa Rica. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-seeds-of-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the current state of the IT sector in Costa Rica, and what are the main trends entering the country over the next two years?</h4><p>The first thing we have to talk about is what we aim to achieve in our public sector strategy. We need to talk about what we have and where we are going as a country. In May 2018, this government took power, and we defined our role across three sectors. Communications is highly important in terms of developing infrastructure. We must improve our efforts to open our broadband penetration and must connect the education sector and other institutions with these kinds of technologies. The private sector needs more incentives to invest in this area, and we are trying to do this in the telecommunications area. We want to develop the best way to facilitate investment and want to see more development. To achieve all that, the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Telecommunications (MICITT) is defining the roadmap for the next four years. Moreover, we need to increase the capacity of the government to develop infrastructure. Similarly, MICITT has several initiatives aimed at improving innovation activities across many different layers and including many different stakeholders. We are also trying to establish an e-government governance model for Costa Rica. We have to prop up our telecommunications efforts, improve innovation, and develop a working governance model for state of the art e-government services. We believe we have strong telecommunications skills, good penetration in mobile service, and strong SME participation. MICITT has skills in these areas, and it can be a leader in these areas in the next three years. </p><h4>How are you working with the Ministry of Education to ensure there is strong IT promotion and STEM development?</h4><p>We have to be clear that the mandate is to increase, develop, and push the entire technical sector. We want to be an advisor to every stakeholder working to achieve our common goals. We have around 2,050 community centers that have access to internet, and we are working on transforming these centers that can provide true social innovation and transformation. We want to use these as areas that can further develop STEM skills. Recently, we released a plan for bilingual development as a component of the president's efforts to develop Costa Rica's human capital and competencies. The administration's secret ingredient is its ability to articulate a road map and work together to achieve our common goals. </p><h4>In terms of e-government, what are the specific objectives of the ministry's agenda, and how are you planning to achieve them?</h4><p>We are working on the national agenda, but it is more complex than just the government. We have a lot of projects that we hope to bring online. My goal is to have an efficient government that puts citizens at the center of all its efforts. It is vital for Costa Rica to become more efficient and cut expenses. I hope that in three years, our conversation will be about how to increase broadband coverage, what new services citizens are receiving, and how we can reduce poverty using IT, for example. We want to use technology to utterly transform the lives of all Costa Ricans. </p><h4>How is the ministry supporting IT startups?</h4><p>We have a partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank, and we are investing USD21 million to improve startups. Developing these allows us to increase our capacity to employ people while raising the quality of life and further developing the country; however, to get these benefits we must first invest in startups. At present, Costa Rica is helping the world's largest firms establish operations in Costa Rica, and we are simultaneously developing our small-scale firms and startups. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Following the Chinese State Development and Investment Corporation's (SDIC) acquisition of a 28% stake in the company, what is the significance of APC's new strategic partnership?</h4><p>Having SDIC as a strategic partner in APC is of great importance. This can be demonstrated by the fact that APC sales to China, the biggest consumer of potash globally, represented 25% of APC's total sales on average in the past few years. And, with the importance of potash in the Chinese agriculture sector, SDIC's presence on APC's board of directors explains the strategic vision of the new partner for APC's operations to expand the company's production capacity and focus on protecting the continuity of its operations. Having such a partner gives a boost to complete the current expansion projects, proceeding in the expansion projects in APC's five-year future plan and supporting the efforts of looking for new investment opportunities whether in potash or in other fertilizers products. The Chinese market is considered one of the most important markets for APC due to the large consumption of potash there. APC has always worked on building a strong position in the Chinese market and maintaining a strong relationship with its customers there, as this provides APC with a solid base for its sales plan that would not be affected if markets' demand reduce to a point where they can affect the company's sales volumes and therefore its profitability.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the company's ongoing efforts to increase capacity and the latest developments from its feasibility studies?</h4><p>APC is currently exploring options to maximize and increase production by reviewing available alternatives plans and the possibility of increasing the efficiency of the existing plants and the evaporation areas. The board of directors has put in place a production expansion plan that entails three aspects. The first includes moving ahead with the expansion project in the northern region within the concession area, which is expected to increase potash production capacity by 140,000 tons per year. Secondly, we are allocating the necessary budget for the technical study of the Lisan area. In this regard, APC is following up with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources regarding the submission of the tender to the qualified companies that will conduct the study. If the study proves to be technically feasible, APC will compete to obtain the concession of potash extraction in that area according to the prevailing legislation and conditions set by the Jordanian government represented by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. Finally, APC's board of directors approved a budget allocation to conduct feasibility and technical studies in Ghor Fifa, located in the southern part of the concession area that is expected to increase production capacity by 450,000 tons.</p><h4>With increased capacity to come online at Aqaba port later in 2019, what markets is APC targeting for its exports?</h4><p>APC is developing marketing plans that enhance its presence in major international markets as well as in regional and developing markets, especially in Africa, where consumption is notably increasing. The company is also working on developing products to meet its clients' demands and requirements, which should help APC reach out to several markets around the world and consequently stabilize and increase sales volumes. APC global potash production share stood at 4% in 2018 and sales reached an all-time record of 2.44 million tons. The distribution of APC's sales does not signify any major change of direction or policy. For example, the sharp fall in tonnages to China and Indonesia, coupled with similarly big increases in shipments to Taiwan and India in 2018 were basically due to seasonal, logistical, and contractual obligations and timing. The new contracts with both Chinese and the Indian customers in terms of volume were close to traditional and long-term contractual quantities. These contracts will be shipped through June 2019. On the other hand, sales growth into local and regional markets as well as Europe and Africa point to APC's commitment to supply these areas as they grow, develop, and build more capacity for fertilizers.</p><h4>How does APC evaluate its role in Jordan's mining sector and the economy more broadly?</h4><p>Jordan's mining sector is considered the cornerstone of the economy. It plays a vital role in growth of many other important sectors in the economy and contributes to Jordan's standard of living. The mining industry in Jordan is dominated by the production of phosphate, potash, building and decoration stones, glass sand, and other non-metallic resources. Jordan was ranked the seventh-largest producer of potash in 2018. APC is considered as one of the main tributaries of the hard currencies to the economy of Jordan. The company's sales were close to USD1 billion in 2018, including its subsidiaries and affiliates. In addition, APC provided total payments of almost USD100 million to the government of Jordan through incomes taxes, mining fees, road fees, dividend distributions, handling fees, and others. APC and its subsidiaries are the main recruiters in Jordan's mining sector, with 2,116 employees working for the company and its subsidiaries as of end of 2018. In addition, the company has large capital expenditures and civil works being conducted by local Jordanian contractors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Maeen come to be founded, and what role does it play within the digital transformation of the Kingdom?</h4><p>In 1985, after the formation of GulfNet, we connected King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) to the Bitnet, the US research network at the time. In 1997, we first connected KACST to the internet, and then later the entire Kingdom. KACST was initially focused on the academic and research sectors, and the entire commercial segment was eventually outsourced to Telecom companies in 2006. Given the increase in traffic, we later connected the research segment to Internet2, which led to the formation of Maeen. Today, 27 universities, 20 government institutes, seven research centers and three hospitals are connected to Maeen. This successful achieve is a tremendous growth with an unprecedented scope to enable the digital transformation across the Kingdom's education, research, health, and industry sectors through Saudi Vision 2030.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the short-term future, and how does Maeen position itself with regards to these major industry developments?</h4><p>We hope there will be a new global technology other than the internet; there are tests currently being done between GÉANT and Internet2 for a 400-GB infrastructure. There are many applications coming through the internet, and researchers do not like the noise that social and commercial applications are generating on the Internet, which on the other side are directly affecting the volume of traffic and latency required for research applications. As such, the first role of Maeen is to create a special channel for collaboration and integration that connects all research institutes, academic and industry. Secondly, Maeen seeks to establish a portal that will integrate high-performance computing (HPC) together in the Kingdom, acting as an enabler of the services. Third, it seeks to exploit its nature as a consortium to reduce the price of Maeen's member connectivity even further from What the research and academic sector are getting. For this reason, telecom companies look into Maeen as a competitor, Which of course is not the case. Therefore, it would take effort to demonstrate that Maeen is a National initiative and telecom companies are partners in success. At the moment, we are looking to work with all telecom companies and big international vendors, including Cisco and other big names. We are looking to have success stories and case studies in which these vendors would test their new unannounced products through Maeen network.</p><h4>Can you tell us what your strategy is to work with industry?</h4><p>Maeen currently seeks to address the issues both on the applied research side and on the fundamentals one. Regarding the latter, currently, many research projects are not being developed because there is no integration between both research and academic sector from one side and the industry on the other side. This is why we are looking into developing the proper methodology and connect these research projects with corresponding industry firm to turn them into products. On the other hand, industries would be able to find the suitable research or researcher that would support implementing their future initiatives without the need of investing to build their own R&amp;D. The industry wants certain projects and seeks certain researchers of subject matter experts. This will be implemented using a national application portal that would create a communication channel researchers and national industries, which may expand later on globally.</p><h4>Does Saudi Arabia need more applied research or general research?</h4><p>We need both, because if you do not support some researchers with funding and tools, they will not continue with research. Some researchers do not want to be controlled and want to think and work on his own. We would like to play in both areas, supporting researchers financially and operationally and providing them with initial ideas from the industry to work on. What needs to be addressed properly—and we feel there is gap here—is ensuring that once the research is completed, it will lead to tangible results by linking these results to the proper industry firm.</p><h4>What is the next step for Maeen, and what is its significance?</h4><p>We are in the process of signing a memorandum of understanding agreement and establishing a peering connection with GÉANT. In addition, we are in communications of connecting industry research centers such as of Aramco and SABIC. We are also in negotiation with the Ministry of Health to connect all the hospitals with Maeen to be part of research community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the core priorities for the Ministry of Environment </h4><p>and Energy (MINAE) in the coming years?<br>The greatest challenge for Costa Rica is the current model for food, energy, and water production and the consumption of goods and services. At present, we consume natural resources faster than nature's capacity for recovery. The challenge, then, is to change the economic model, so that we ultimately have a sustainable model where we do not generate an environmental deficit, but through which we can capitalize on mechanisms and technologies that do not generate environmental damage. In that context, we have 10 issues to address, and this administration will focus on creating the institutional conditions to transition toward a green, or circular, economic model, where the good and the bad that we do with nature is reflected. Political decisions are based on the best economic information available. This change has to be incremental, and the effects will be seen in the future. Around 20-30 years ago, we had one of the highest deforestation rates per capita in the world, and now we have managed to completely halt it, while increasing reforestation rates.</p><h4>How will this administration push for more competitive energy use? </h4><p>Costa Rica is in a peculiar situation. Producing energy from fossil fuels should be more expensive than renewable energy, but currently the final price for consumers is quite high. The problem lies in the inefficiency and lack of planning throughout the years, resulting in associated costs being higher than expected. We need to accurately forecast future needs in order to plan and build accordingly to satisfy demand. We have built considerable electrical infrastructure that surpasses demand, almost doubling it.</p><h4>What should be the objective of RECOPE, or the new company that replaces it, in the decarbonization of the country?</h4><p>RECOPE has played an important role in the strategic import, refining, and distribution of fuel. In line with the decarbonization plan, commitments that Costa Rica has made to its citizens to improve air quality, and the international commitments related to the climate change convention, we have determined that RECOPE must transition to a model where fossil fuels are not part of the future. Within the decarbonization plan, we see a period of two to three decades before the complete shift toward alternative fuels.</p><h4>The current legal framework discourages consumers from buying electric cars. What further regulations could boost the purchasing of alternative vehicles?</h4><p>We have both a carbonized economy and a fiscal system. A large amount of the fiscal income depends on activities that generate carbon, such as the tax on fuels and vehicles. Therefore, we need to change the economy and the fiscal policy toward the transition. We want zero-emission vehicles that include electric and hydrogen cars. Costa Rica has a strong electrical grid and high-quality infrastructure, so it makes sense to electrify the transport sector. Another reason is that the technology is becoming cheaper and more accessible. We need to change the transport paradigm, as our economy is based on the individual use and purchase of vehicles; however, in the future, there will be options to help people choose alternative means of transport. We want cities to be more sustainable and greener.</p><h4>What environmental policy lessons could other countries learn from Costa Rica?</h4><p>We have learned that protecting nature is not a cost, but an investment that translates into many benefits. We have learned over the years that restoring degraded areas makes real economic sense. We have generated numerous economic activities from this, such as ecotourism. 40 years ago, as visionaries spoke about creating the first national parks, many argued that it made no sense, just as today some dispute decarbonization, arguing that jobs will disappear; however, in reality jobs will shift to a different economic activity that could be more lucrative. All players and political parties must be involved to achieve long-term results. We are investing in a better tomorrow for future generations. This is a complex task that needs to be tackled in order to see results within a few decades.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the past decade been for the private insurance sector in relation to the region?</h4><p>We established clear rules that opened the market from day one and leveled the playing field for all players. We learnt that it is crucial to not only push for financial inclusion and provide access to the banking and insurance systems, but also give people the tools to make decisions regarding adequate consumption and risk management. We have seen an annual growth of 9% in the insurance sector. Moreover, premiums have doubled and more importantly, claims paid to consumers have more than tripled.</p><h4>Why would an insurance company choose to invest in Costa Rica?</h4><p>The market still has a great deal of room to grow. Our market makes up 2.22% of GDP when it should be around 6% given the per capita income. In 10 years, the personal insurance market, such as health, accidents, and life, has grown seven-fold, and in those markets the participation share is much more distributed than in general insurance. Equally important, the rules are fair, and there are sanctions for all players, including the state company. These are signals that show local or foreign investors that the supervisor is impartial, and we have sufficient guarantees that the market is treated equally.</p><h4>What trends do you see in the market, and what is coming for Costa Rica in the next year?</h4><p>Within the framework of sustainability principles, the main participants signed a commitment document. The important thing is that these principles generate three working edges of government sustainability, social sustainability, and environmental sustainability. All regulatory development in recent years is in favor of seeking more robust management models. We are working on access and financial inclusion in the case of insurance. The subject of sustainability goes through the change in culture and by introducing appropriate practices to ensure fair treatment of customers. This is another aspect we will work on in 2019, forming a model of business conduct for the insurance market. Perhaps the clearest trend in the sector is that there is insufficient solvency because there is no capital that can endure bad management. Failing to meet a customer's expectations generates confidence problems for the client and market, slowing down development.</p><h4>What is SUGESE's biggest contribution to the insurance market?</h4><p>The important thing is to focus on the consumer; every action generated by SUGESE in the intervention market is with consumer at the center, ensuring the market provides added value. One of the important milestones of this road has been the issuance of a regulation that allows us to make important market corrections. These interventions have been important because it is about attending to a particular case; however, if that particular case generates a broader market issue, then SUGESE intervenes to help correct the market and ensure fair treatment for customers. Another important achievement is the risk-based supervision model, which incorporates excellent corporate governance and risk management practices for the insurance market; we must continue to give weight to these practices. Costa Rica is in the process of transitioning toward a solvency model, similar to the European one. In Latin America, Brazil and Mexico have adopted the same solvency model; Peru, Colombia, and Chile have been working toward that, and Costa Rica has been following suit. Along these lines, Costa Rica received a favorable opinion from the OECD's insurance and pension committee in 2017, because it was assessed that what the country is doing in the sector complies with OECD standards.</p><h4>What has SUGESE done to promote an insurance culture?</h4><p>We have successfully made insurance a subject of analyses and common culture when it was something completely unknown a few years back. This was done after a permanent marketing program that comprised two or three magazines a year, presence on social media, information stands, and so on. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dr-abed-al-razzaq-arabiyat-managing-director-jordan-tourism-board]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the recent main achievements for JTB?</h4><p>From the first day I was appointed as the Managing Director at the Jordan Tourism Board, I questioned why Jordan does not have the numbers that we know the destination deserves based on what we have to offer. If we compare Jordan to other countries, we have many unique selling points. These USPs include the Baptism Site of Jesus Christ, the Dead Sea—the largest natural spa in the world and lowest point in earth, Petra, Wadi Rum, and 21,000 other archaeological sites. I conducted a small-scale marketing research study to analyze the behavior of tourists and theorized that the catalyst for tourism is air connectivity. My main priority became bringing in low-cost carriers (LCCs). In 2018 over 500 million passengers used LCCs to travel and a vast majority of Europeans use LCCs. Those carriers did not operate to Jordan. In my meetings with EasyJet and Ryanair, they revealed that one of the key obstacles the faced with operating into the Kingdom was the departure tax imposed at our airports. We have excellent exposure and have invested a great deal in marketing in the past 15 years and positioned Jordan on many must-see and must visit lists. However, at the end of the day, when European tourists see air tickets to Jordan cost EUR800, they will not come. The solution was to convince the Jordanian Ministry of Finance to waive the tax. A simple cost-benefit analysis for a financial model that waives this tax would result in the loss of JOD300,000 in departure tax income per year compensated by a gain of JOD20 million in sales tax, income tax, and entrance fees. After I submitted the research, the government waived the tax for LCCs. Then, I requested funding from the government to attract Russian charters. We now have nine flights per week from Russia. Then, I started negotiations with Ryanair and easyJet, and we signed 16 destinations with them, split between Amman and Aqaba. At the same time, we implemented a perception management strategy in the past two years to convince tourists that Jordan is safe. This strategy depends heavily on user-generated content, wherein we invited hundreds of social media influencers from all over the world. They came and shared their experience for one week in Jordan, again putting the Kingdom on the tourism map. That is why the numbers are picking up, thanks to air connectivity and the perception management strategy. We also started promoting a new product: the Jordan Trail. Several journalists came and wrote about Jordan's diversity, environment, and the unique and authentic experience. We started to diversify our portfolio by adopting a new approach, moving away from the traditional way of marketing. Now, we follow a demand-driven approach rather than market based.</p><h4>As part of this demand-driven strategy, how did you identify Jordan's tourism offering?</h4><p>We identified our product and our experience, focusing on our religious product. We have hundreds of sites mentioned in the old and new testaments, so we started creating content with 34 key sites. We have a brochure with different languages online and offline, and we invited church leaders, parish priests, and specialized tour operators to visit all the Christian and Islamic sites in Jordan. For the adventure segment, we started promoting the Jordan Trail. Our designated adventure tourism unit is participating in specialized exhibitions in adventure as well as bringing in bloggers, influencers, and magazines. In 2019, the US-based Adventure Travel Trade Association (ATTA) will hold its annual Near East conference in Jordan for the third year in a row. It will bring in buyers to meet suppliers, and Jordan will become an adventure tourism hub in the entire MENA region. For history and culture, we have partnerships with Expedia, TripAdvisor, and co-ops subsidizing and supporting the big tour operators in their marketing packages dedicated for Jordan. Of course, there is also medical and wellness tourism. We now have a small unit and have approached all the markets by bringing the decision makers and insurance companies to come to Jordan because healthcare here is affordable and of high quality.</p><h4>How does the recently launched Jordan Convention Bureau contribute to this segment, and what are other key elements are needed to develop the MICE segment?</h4><p>One of our success stories was the launch of the convention bureau. The convention bureau is responsible for bidding and communicating with large associations such as ICA, and we are participating in specialized exhibitions like IBTM World and IMEX. We started promoting Jordan as a business destination for meetings, conferences, and events. We bid for 10 big conferences and won four. We have a competitive edge in that we are the only country in the world where one can arrange a gala dinner within a site like the Citadel or Petra, so this is an added value. Our Convention Bureau Ambassador Program brings in medical sector representatives who are part of international associations so they can start promoting, inviting, and bidding. Hopefully in the coming two years, we will have more conferences and conventions in Jordan. We have now become a model for others to replicate in terms of our experience in promoting and communicating our message. We are working left, right, and center to promote the country. This made us the leading sector in Jordan, witnessing growth in 2017 and 2018. Now, we will link it with job creation and investment opportunities in Jordan.</p><h4>What are the next steps to link the growth in tourism with economic opportunities?</h4><p>We have succeeded in our role to create demand, and now we are addressing the lack of certain services that are needed to support tourism such as transportation. We need more investment in tourism transportation as well as more hotels in Petra and Wadi Rum. We need more nightlife attractions, water parks, and special attractions such as Disneyland. The atmosphere and environment are ripe for investment in Jordan's tourism sector. Hopefully, that will help us create more jobs for Jordanians and depend less on government jobs, where almost 75% of our budget goes to salaries. My goal is to create local experiences across the trail so that one can experience homestays and local restaurants, and we need to start training people how to do business tourism. I want to make sure our guests receive the best and high-quality services.</p><h4>From where are you seeing investment interest in Jordanian tourism?</h4><p>There is interest from both private and public sectors. The private sector feels it needs to expand more and has started some initiatives, though the one thing I dream of is a big exhibition center in Jordan. The government started negotiations with IFEMA in Spain to install a big exhibition center here, and if we have this, Jordan will witness a transformational period in terms of economic activity and job creation. The feasibility studies and research show we have lost many potential big exhibitions because of the lack of capacity. With air connectivity, an attractive climate, and professional tourism operators, we have the right environment to attract large exhibitions in Jordan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Full Financial Inclusion]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[full-financial-inclusion]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role or responsibility of public financial institutions in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Our main role is to promote the development of the country through several pillars, most importantly financial inclusion. We believe that greater financial inclusion promotes better development. We increase financial inclusion by favoring entrepreneurship through the system of financing and education for entrepreneurs. We have a specific program for businesswomen called “Banca BN Mujer," focused on creating women entrepreneurs. This initiative helps them create and develop ideas. Our entire commercial approach is about helping entrepreneurs and construction companies as well as the tourism and energy sectors achieve sustainability goals. Similarly, the bank also promotes electric vehicles, and every other aspect that is aligned with Costa Rica's transition away from coal. That is an idea that we are promoting to bring the country to zero emissions.</p><h4>What is Banco Nacional's standing in terms of public brand perception and market share?</h4><p>I believe that the association is a bank that is always there to help people and companies. We want to be a socially responsible bank. We want to make life easier for people and our customers through digital platforms that allow easier access and financial inclusion. We expect to offer all services, such as credit-card transactions as well as local and international transfers, on mobile devices to ensure greater financial inclusion. Over the recent past, Costa Rica has advanced significantly in terms of financial attitude. For comparison, 25% of GDP was processed through banks 20 years ago and at present, that has increased to 70% and moving forward, we want to reach 100%. We want to bank the entire economically active population and increase velocity without holding up the money, helping the economy to move and become more dynamic. That is our role and aspiration for the coming years.</p><h4>How do you face the bureaucratic challenges of public banks in order to have digital services that are in competition with those of private banks?</h4><p>Fortunately, technology has evolved to the point where there are relatively inexpensive applications in the cloud that can be acquired even with the process of contracting in an economical way. For example, changing the entire core was not needed, as the current system works well. We added other capabilities or applications. Then, there are apps that are connected, which means there is no need for a great technological investment in the database. That has evolved tremendously over the years. Therefore, the bank does not see it as a barrier but rather an opportunity to have business partners. For example, we recently developed an application for the farmer community that can charge credit cards through cellphones at farmers' markets, where buying several POS devices would not have been feasible. </p><h4>How are you positioning yourselves to be the financial partner of large investment groups?</h4><p>We are upgrading our services platforms to accommodate international clients, for example, by offering our website and documents in different languages. We are also strengthening BICSA, our international bank, to offer banking services regionally, and expand into new markets.</p><h4>How are you planning to expand your corporate banking or investment banking portfolios?</h4><p>We are highly interested in certain segments, such as industry, energy, services, and construction. Our target approach is not to be the only lender for big projects but to partner up with Banco de Costa Rica and other private banks. The bank's aim is to share the risk and support the country to participate in more projects. </p><h4>Why should companies handle cash management products with Banco Nacional?</h4><p>Notably, we have a local platform that is integrated with all the services, for example “SINPE Móvil," local cash management, and electronic handling, etc. In comparison, a foreign bank that is not in the local square does not have those connections or connectivity. As a result, our cash management products can be much more useful for individuals and families. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[teresa-ribera-minister-ecological-transition-spain]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the initial challenges that the ministry had to face? </h4><p>The greatest challenge was to recover lost time. The world, Europe, and Spain are immersed in the process of an important transformation of the economic model that involves incorporating environmental and climatic variables to overcome the modernization of the economy. This transformation had been postponed, and we were nearing the deadline for an important part of the European regulations plan regarding stability, visibility, and anticipation. We were also late on issues of the structure of costs, monitoring of emissions, making decisions regarding thermal plants, and incentives for the transformation of the energy model. Our challenge was to catch up and generate confidence in investors and society regarding our capacity for transformation. This required a clear explanation of our vision in the medium term but also the activation of some specific reforms that would make socially bearable some decisions that should have been made a long time ago. Unfortunately, the term was over. We had to recover the strategic vision and the lost time in a short period of time.</p><h4>What have been the most outstanding achievements of the last months?</h4><p>We have achieved important goals. We held an honest and transparent public debate about the need to transform our economy and the way it has to be done. We underlined that it is impossible to make that transformation without the social component. We followed up with the toughest measures such as stabilizing or mitigating the evolution of the price of electricity and making it bearable for households and industrial consumers. We addressed our commitment to ending the use of coal, which had a deadline of December 2018 for mining and 2020 for the majority of thermal plants. We addressed the safety of nuclear energy material and the forecast of nuclear energy in the medium term. The forecast and evolution of the protection of the oceans were extremely important for the integration of the environmental variable, as well as an analysis on how to update the hydraulic policy. We have not had the time to elaborate an in-depth reflection on the politics of water. Water, soil, climate, and energy are fundamental for any economic activity, but these are limited resources. Spain has a highly complicated position regarding water, and in a climate-change scenario, uncertainties and threats are greater. We must manage water efficiently by eliminating beliefs such as surplus or historical rights. We must approach this issue with a different perspective of governance in addition to incorporating the values and recommendations of the European Union framework. Spain is paying fines for judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union for lack of compliance with obligations regarding sanitation and purification. Our level of development makes this data scandalous, but we can improve our water tradition. We have an infrastructure that must think beyond the transport of water to consider the efficiency and the interconnection of the desalination facilities in case of shortage. We have begun to work on these aspects, but the process has been put on hold although it has important issues for the next legislature.</p><h4>What are the objectives of the Draft Bill on Climate Change proposed by the ministry?</h4><p>We wanted to offer a transversal and broad strategic framework, and establish a vision that would integrate three parts. The draft bill defines the institutional framework for making decisions and the tools that help guarantee flexible certainty. That is, it helps us to understand how we establish objectives as well as the tools that allow us to evaluate the fulfillment of those objectives within a modulated process. We must understand how to facilitate and improve the learning of operators. This means an early integration of the G20 claims on financing and financial risks for climate issues as well as the recommendations of the European Commission working group that draws on the solutions developed in France. Investment decisions and spending will be more consistent because it will be increasingly understood what climate change is. The learning instruments and the indicators on resilience and adaptation are integrated about the impact of climate change. The signals of change in the whole energy system are extremely important. There are initial positions regarding factors that will be relevant in the coming years, such as storage, demand, and the evolution of the gas sector that should evolve into biogas and hydrogen. After these first changes in the energy system, we will end up with a fair regulation of the transition measures. First, the law will be established (institutional framework), followed by the perspective toward 2030; that is, what is the best way to maximize opportunities and minimize costs to meet the objectives that lead to decarbonization of the economy by 2050 and a significant advance by 2030. These plans are made on a robust economic analysis contrasted with external actors, academic actors, the European mobilization patterns, and the ability to analyze national, economic, and energy variables. In the third place, we have a fair transition package. This is new as it concerns the approaches of energy and climate policies in other countries. From the first moment, we honestly assume the need to accompany the regions and peoples whose centers of activity are committed to a fast transformation in a short time. We must also accompany the sectors that are called to it.</p><h4>How can the energy transition plans solve the dependence of Spain on imports of fossil fuels?</h4><p>Spain is one of the countries with greater energy dependence from abroad due to the volume of imports of fossil fuels. However, we have a great potential to replace these fossil fuels with autochthonous renewable resources. We have the value chain and the accompanying capacity to do it if the pieces are well articulated. If this is achieved, an important volume of resources will be released that can be used for innovation, industrial policy, or social redistribution, accompanying the groups that need training or incentives to have economic reactivation in transition areas. This win-win situation has a transversal appeal among all the stakeholders.</p><h4>Regarding shared self-consumption, last year there was a decree that approved this possibility with the added advantage of having less bureaucracy. What is next now?</h4><p>We need a decree that develops the technical aspects to be fully operational. In the first decree, we eliminated the first obstacles, including the self-consumption tax; however, it was necessary to arm the connectivity of the facilities, the eventual compensations for the consumption, and the evacuation of the surplus. We have reached an interesting balance, but we must differentiate between small domestic self-consumption installations against self-consumption facilities of relevant volume that are for industrial activities and can generate more dispersion in the network. There is no adequate management capacity, so a specific regulation is needed. This solution will have a positive impact on prices. We are already experiencing the effects of the first changes. The associated non-positive effect is that more water could be pumped because the energy consumption costs are lower. Water is extremely scarce, and although it costs less to pump it, we should not consume more. The parameters are changing, and one of the challenges we will face will be storage.</p><h4>What are the ministry's priorities for the coming months? What are the ministry's purposes under the new mandate?</h4><p>We have made the first draft of a larger project, but we must manage its opening. There are margins of notable improvement in aspects of great interest for economic actors and investors such as the circular economy and the use of resources. The reform of the market and the reform of the fiscal system are pending. The industrial accompaniment remains, as well as the accompaniment of infrastructure for mobility and the anticipation of the new great challenges like storage, distribution networks, transport, and digitalization. We must materialize the bets in efficiency. The position of the ministry is evolving. A transformation of these characteristics requires a firm position concerning the direction to be taken as well as enabling and generating synergies. It is fundamental that the traditional actors feel that evolution is easy although they are being pressed to evolve.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>How has the rise in popularity of private sector insurance developed the insurance market?<br>We are 100% a Costa Rican company that belongs to the private sector. There was an important resistance from the market when the first few international companies entered Costa Rica, but that has changed and those companies have grown in the last 10 years. Our challenge is that Costa Rica is a developing market where we are serving new market niches, and the recent price drop has only added to that challenge. In total, there are around 700 registered insurance products in Costa Rica, but 60% of them are identical. We are starting to turn things around as an industry by pushing intermediaries to talk more to customers to better understand customer needs.</p><h4>What are the new trends and markets being developed in Costa Rica? </h4><p>We only offer life and health insurances. Moving forward, medical insurance is an opportunity for growth because medicine in Costa Rica is extremely expensive. In the next two years, we will try to partner with the Social Security System and convince it to let us participate in the medical insurance market. At present, we are trying to create a low-budget health insurance product but we will also try to partner with the government to create a mixed medicine system. </p><h4>Why have you chosen to rebrand? </h4><p>We hired a company to conduct a market study and realized that we were not known within the education sector. Originally, we were perceived as an established non-commercial company and perhaps the first insurance company in Costa Rica before INS started in 1924. We are competing with all the companies that offer similar products and trying to defend our market share. That was not working so we decided to open up and go after the entire market. Costa Rica's current market is made up of 5 million people, and every Costa Rican can benefit from our products. To that end, we freshened up our image and tried to change the way we do business. Previously, we were only targeting teachers and professors, but we are now targeting the entire society. Moreover, we are striving to be competitive. We are aware that we need a well-developed network of service providers, including hospitals, pharmacists, clinics, and laboratories. Equally important, we have been searching for partners to outsource some services that are we are not specialized in. By doing that, we can focus on our main business, develop great products at a good price, and be extremely efficient in the claims payment.  </p><h4>Do you have corporate plans aimed at managing insurance policies for entire companies? </h4><p>Under the previous strategic plan, insurance brokers made up 3.2% of our portfolio, inhouse sales employees represented 14%, external brokers that worked exclusively for us represented 25%, and the company the rest. Insurance brokers manage over 70% of the entire market, so we are trying to reposition the company to focus on them. To achieve that, we forbid company employees to conduct business directly with customers. It is vital to have a broker or intermediary so the company can delegate certain tasks and focus on creating new products. </p><h4>Are you doing something to educate the population about insurance? </h4><p>The INS monopoly serves as an opportunity for us to target some of its underserved clients with innovative solutions. We are contacting companies and adding additional services to their life product. We are letting them know our product is not only cheaper but also has other components that can create confidence in their customer base. For example, we have two large prospective accounts that would give us the financial muscle we need to continue expanding our portfolio. We have also innovated life insurance payouts, allowing an advance while we investigate the death. Such a strategy reduces pressure on families and provides them with some funding to carry on with their lives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does technological innovation play in Numarine's line of yachts?</h4><p>Technological innovation in the yachting sector did not truly exist until we started in 2001. Everyone was building boats in the same way that they were doing in the 1960s—we were in the dark ages of production. In 2001, when I started Numarine, I felt we needed to do things differently, and our differentiator had to be lower prices than our competitors, the main European brands. At this time, vacuum infusion was something extremely high tech that only race sailing yachts were utilizing. The technology is environmentally friendly, as it emits 99% less styrene gas into the environment. I saw that the environment would be a key issue and selling point in the coming years, and the technology produces a light and strong product, so we invested heavily in developing the technology. We were the first shipyard in Europe to produce everything with vacuum infusion; by the time many other companies switched and started doing vacuum infusion, we were leading the pack. Another of our key technologies are lithium ion batteries, which we introduced two years ago. On our yachts, we use lithium ion technology to replace most of the generator. When there is a sufficient amount of charge in the battery pack, the generator does not have to work all-day long, as the battery pack is enough to supply power to most of the equipment on the yacht.</p><h4>How does your new yacht, Adonis, implement even more advanced technology?</h4><p>Adonis is our collaboration with Furrion Design, a Hong Kong-based technology company that created Angle AI and also does a great deal of work integrating AI into household appliances. Adonis mixes these two aspects of Furrion with yachting. It is wonderful—as one walks in, a smart camera recognizes them and sets the mood to their preferences, changing the music and learning their preferences. Sailors can ask about the weather in a certain location and request that the yacht navigate there. The yacht will take them there, and en route it will ask if they want to visit a restaurant and can select the best one. The temperature of water in the shower can be adjusted via voice recognition. In the future this will all be standard. However, when it comes to extremely high tech like Adonis, I am slightly cautious, as it is still extremely new and untested. If our boats sail all over the world, we need to ensure they are safe and can be serviced.</p><h4>How do changes in taste drive Numarine's technology and yacht line?</h4><p>10 years ago, speed was a selling point, though this has changed. Now, people want to be able to navigate quietly so that they are comfortable and can sleep during navigation. This is why our lithium ion batteries are popular as the technology is quieter. It is one of the reasons why our XP line has been successful, as the yachts are quieter and roomier. In Turkey, we also see demand focused around larger yachts, and this is where the expertise lies. We are moving ahead with this trend and are designing new 37- and 45-m boats. On average, we produced yachts around 28m meters in 2018. We want to push our average size to be larger rather than smaller.</p><h4>How is Numarine working to reduce its production time?</h4><p>Our production time is driven by our customer profile and the kind of yachts we produce. Our customers are fairly particular and are generally buying their second, third or fourth boats—someone from this profile is usually willing to wait a year for production. A novice buyer usually buys from the recognized main brands and expects their boat immediately. At the moment, fiberglass shells are produced in eight to nine months, which is a reasonable amount of time, though we have 32-, 37-, and 45-m yachts that are steel and composite combinations and take longer than 18 months to produce. This is a problem, as most buyers are not willing to wait two years. To resolve this issue, we are starting to produce the steel ahead of an order, which can cut delivery time to seven to eight months rather than 18. We are shifting toward produce more semi-custom yachts, where the customer can still choose the interior and furniture without having to wait two years. We want to be able to offer the market a semi-custom 37-m boat in nine or 10 months, as this will be a big advantage.</p><h4>What are the biggest operational challenges you face?</h4><p>We used to face many challenges when we were new into the market and were learning; however, it has been 18 years, and we have produced close to 150 boats, so production-wise we do not face many challenges. On the marketing side, producing in Turkey and selling worldwide still has its challenges. Turkey had a fantastic image up until five or six years ago—when I went to the GCC or Europe before, customs were extremely positive and processed us even without a stamp. However, we have lost that prestige over the last five years due to international politics. It is becoming harder to sell such an expensive product to a global customer out of Turkey.</p><h4>How are you working to expand your international market share?</h4><p>Turkey is a relatively small market, and even though we are the fourth-largest super yacht builder in the world, most of it is exported. Europe and the US account for 80% of our international sales, and the rest is scattered everywhere else. Though the US is still the largest market in the world, we seek to grow new markets. I hope India will become a bigger market for us. It is not a big player yet, though it has a nice coastline, money, and a large population. We tried the Chinese market because we saw companies like BMW and Rolls Royce having great success there. However, the Chinese are definitely car buyers but not yet boat buyers. Domestically, we are fairly well known in Turkey as the largest yacht shipyard by far in the country—we do 35% of the Turkish yacht export. We are market leaders in the country, so we do not need more recognition, as the market is as big as it gets.</p><h4>Over the next 12 months, what are your plans and objectives?</h4><p>We have a new 45-m Explorer, which is our biggest project and one of the most exciting. It will present many challenges for us, though it will also bring many rewards because once it is out there, it will be the only boat of that size with those amenities. I do not know what the global economy or politics will bring in the future; however, we are focused on our growth plans.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was DCI established, and what payment solutions have you developed?</h4><p>DCI started in 2015, when we were working with the Central Bank of Jordan on various payment initiatives. At the time, DCI was attending the Digital Transformation Committee meetings by invitation from Central bank of Jordan. We attended workshops with WTO, the Central Bank of Jordan, representatives of the German government, and other entities. The main focus was the financial inclusion for Jordan including helping the refugees in Jordan with a low-cost remittance solution. That is where DCI started, and we decided to create our own platform because financial inclusion was not our type of software, and it changes rapidly. We did not want to depend on someone else for the technology because then we lose our agility.</p><h4>How did DCI enter the Saudi market?</h4><p>DCI is the name of the Saudi company who was formed to be the vehicle to sell the Digital Solution in KSA. DCI started its activities in the Saudi market in partnership with the Alsubeaei family, the major shareholders of Albilad Bank, among many other business interests, and other banks outside the Kingdom. As bankers, they knew the challenges facing the banking industry and were convinced that digital money was the future. Thus, the partnership made sense, and we transferred our technology to Saudi Arabia and nationalized it. It was truly the biggest catalyst of our success. We signed a major agreement with Saudi Post and received two licenses from the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) with the cooperation of our partner, the Arab National Bank.</p><h4>What services do you offer under your agreement with Saudi Post?</h4><p>There are two offerings essentially. First, we empower SMEs to be part of the SADAD payment network. SMEs need to be sophisticated in term of staffing and infrastructure to integrate with SADAD, so they will never be able to be part of this system on their own. Through our technology, DCI created an aggregation cloud (AC) platform whereby we can aggregate bills from SMEs, send these to our cloud, and load them onto SADAD. SMEs can use this platform through simple tools like our portal that businesses of their size are able to handle. We inform our SME' clients through various digital means when bills have been issued for them. The National Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment System (EBPP) is a significant factor for the economy because it accelerates the payment process, allowing companies to inject there money into new business. This is even more important for SMEs because they are more cash dependent than large businesses. Our second offering is an e-wallet or digital wallet that uses pre-paid cards supplied by our partner bank. This allows customers to make payments, personal transfers, and international remittances through approved networks, such as Tele Money and MoneyGram. Using our system, we have totally eliminated the need for a network of costly physical over-the-counter money transfer offices. This means we can still have a healthy margin while lowering costs for our customers.</p><h4>What is your experience and perspective on SAMA's more open and evolving approach to licensing of financial players here?</h4><p>In our case, the licenses were actually issued to Saudi Post based on DCI's technology, though we led the issuing process, and our name was on the request for approval. SAMA is evolving, though it is strict in the anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) areas, and we understand why. SAMA has a tough mission because it wants to promote agility and digitization, but at the same time does not want to compromise on the AML and KYC rules. Digital solutions are vulnerable to hacking, and SAMA wants to make sure those solutions provided to the market are low risk to protect consumers and the market. If we look at all these elements and considerations, we can see SAMA is doing a great job. It is truly pushing for a digital market.</p><h4>How do you see this progress in a regional context?</h4><p>In our experience, Saudi is in the first group, but not number one. In Egypt and Jordan, the central banks are doing extra work in their regulations because they want and need to create more financial inclusion to their citizens. In Saudi Arabia and the GCC in general, financial inclusion is already more than 80%. Most people have bank accounts and access to financial services. At SAMA, the current focus is on digital inclusion, rather than financial inclusion because more than 80% of transactions in Saudi are still cash based.</p><h4>How does DCI plan to grow its business in the coming years?</h4><p>DCI is currently introducing a specialized marketplace just for e-commerce promotions for its regular clients. We are signing with the big merchants and retailers, who will use our digital promotion tools, and we will report back to them on the demography of their users and where they saw their advertising. It is vital information for merchants and retailers to know the conversion rate between promotions and actual sales. This marketplace will have some unique features never seen before. We are a completely cashless ecosystem from end to end. If we had not addressed all the different stakeholders in the cash system, we would not have succeeded. This is why through its platform DCI is addressing merchants, retailers, SAMA, banks, and consumers. We want to show the market that one can build many offerings on our platform, for example, a specialized marketplace, digital promotions, or connections with Uber or other third parties. And we are cooperating with banks, not competing with them, in providing these solutions. Retailers have to react to e-commerce, as do banks; Banks will not disappear, though they must address the Fintech rush.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In terms of foreign direct investment, how is the strategic position of Panama an advantage compared to the region?</h4><p>Panama is a lucky country compared to the region, and the growth of the private sector is constantly contributing to strengthening the economy. When one examines the financial sector, Panama has a strong position because it is a dollar economy. Additionally, the country has a small population, which, in my opinion, facilitates inward and outward business interactions. Also, another advantage that Panama has, when it comes to foreign investment, is that it has been a country for transit for 500 years, which has attracted both investments and human capital to be part of its development.</p><h4>How have you managed to stand out as a leader in the country?</h4><p>There are two key lessons I have learned. First, you must be willing to delegate responsibility. Second, you must be willing to take measured risk. Everyone knows about successes, but few people know about the failures. Believe me, both are a part of life.</p><h4>What have been the main strategies to increase the value of your investment portfolio?</h4><p>The secret is to find good people. I define that as people who are ethical, have a passion for what they do, and can communicate the purpose and strategy of the company.</p><h4>What is your opinion about the latest IT developments in the Panamanian economy?</h4><p>Panama has outstanding infrastructure for the development of the telecommunications sector. The development of the information storage sites and fiber optic infrastructure are strong. In fact, events like Cybertech Panama 2019 are facilitating the exchange of ideas and initiatives that invite entrepreneurs to increase direct investment. In addition, these projects are bringing new talent to Panama. They, in turn, then interact with Panamanian talent.</p><h4>What have been the recent milestones in terms of social responsibility activities?</h4><p>As president of SUMARSE, I would say the most important companies in Panama now have corporate social responsibility agendas. As I get older, I am also spending more time on non-profit activities, and I have always told people that if I regret anything it is not having done more with non-profits earlier in life. In this way, I strongly suggest everyone get involved in at least one social nonprofit activity. I think it will make you a better person, and therefore a better business executive.</p><h4>What are the goals for 2019?</h4><p>The goal is to keep growing responsibly. That has been the goal for many and many years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the current investment climate in the Costa Rican market?</h4><p>Costa Rica is the easiest country in the region to invest in because it has no restrictions for foreign investors and companies. Every municipality has its own system for local taxes and local regulations to open business. Moreover, Costa Rica's hospitality in renowned for making leisure and business visits more enjoyable. Our national registry is an asset as well because every property is properly titled. Specially, in the free zones market, all players are recording healthy growth because Costa Rica has proved itself as a good place to do business.</p><h4>What are the easiest sectors to invest in and under which condition does an investor need a local partner?</h4><p>A few businesses require a local partner. For example, according to Costa Rica's maritime law, property on the coast belongs to the municipality, and a foreigner without resident status can hold no more than 50% of a concession title. However, foreigners with legal residency in Costa Rica can receive 100% concession. Within our free zones, an investor does not need to be Costa Rican or have any particular legal situation as a resident; however, a minimum investment of CRC200,000 is needed to open operations within a free zone.</p><h4>What are your competitive advantages?</h4><p>We have a balance between experienced and young attorneys. It is a great mix to help different types of companies. The young attorneys bring more energy while the experienced ones bring years of practice and lessons.</p><h4>What are your actual actions to promote investment and grow your market share?</h4><p>We offer our clients legal advice throughout the entire process and a whole set of services to help them succeed in Costa Rica. This includes helping them with immigration, real estate, and business permits. We are a one-stop shop for legal counseling. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define the identity of Costa Rica, and how do you distinguish it from the rest of Central America?</h4><p>We have established our identity based on social dialog, a shared vision between the public and private sectors, and the goal of sustainable development. In addition to that, Costa Rica aspires to be a green laboratory, carry out climate change initiatives, and decarbonize the economy.</p><h4>What is the status of the changes in public policy that Costa Rica requires in its candidacy to join the OECD?</h4><p>We see the process of entering the OECD as a group of best public governance practices. We have worked and incorporated the OECD standards so that our institutions are up to the challenges of the current socioeconomic complexity, and so that we can be more competitive and productive as well as provide our citizens with the goods and services that they need.</p><h4>How do you plan to start promoting more human capital that can satisfy the demand of the market?</h4><p>One of the most relevant points of the Alvarado administration is the importance of education as an engine of social mobility, economy, and sustainable development. Education is also key to close gaps in human rights to generate equality in access to both goods and services, opportunities, and results of sustainable development. Moreover, we must engage young women to achieve economic expectations, and we must work articulately and incorporate cooperation into our agenda.</p><h4>What do you plan to include in the agenda to make the legalization of businesses in Costa Rica more efficient?</h4><p>One of the president's clearest mandates has been to simplify procedures and make regulatory improvements to encourage the business climate because it is one of the key points in the global competitiveness indexes. To that end, we have developed a strategy with National Environmental Technical Secretary (SETENA) to eliminate unnecessary procedures and simplify the necessary ones without subtracting quality or diminishing the environmental aspect.</p><h4>How do you see foreign investment opportunities, and which sectors offer the best opportunities for PPPs?</h4><p>FDI and public and private investment must be at the service of the vision of sustainable development. The investment must also be at the service of our commitment to sustainable, decarbonized, inclusive, and prosperous energy. In addition, there must be an intention to generate knowledge. We have signed several international commitments and local policies to identify the appropriate investments under the National Strategic Plan. It is important that FDI is respectful of the environment, focuses on generating employment, and helps to close gender gaps in specialized areas and services. We also need a reliable and comprehensive transport system that not only reduces travel times and increases competitiveness but also gives people the opportunity to conciliate their personal life with their working life. We will call for tenders to generate a public-private partnership for the high-speed railway system. Another project is the electric freight train in Limón. On the other hand, the Chorotega region offers options for foreign investment in solar energy. A development cluster can be created around the field of sustainable energies that would include hydrogen, plasma, solar, hydrothermal, and wind energy.</p><h4>What are the plans for the tourism sector?</h4><p>We recognize the potential tourism has for FDI and job creation. We want to continue encouraging tourism in all its modalities, though mainly we want to link it to SMEs. One of the successes of our tourism business model is not only the large hotel industry but also the small businesses that generate different experiences for visitors. Through projects such as the convention center, we want to promote MICE tourism and value-added tourism such as wellness and health tourism. We also want to encourage a niche of domestic tourism that makes it possible to attract and invite nationals to visit areas that require an economic boost. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of your expectations for the business environment in Costa Rica for the coming years?</h4><p>We are excited about the vision and the energy of the new administration, and it is a great sign that the Ministry of Foreign Trade, Costa Rican Investment Promotion Agency (CINDE), and PROCOMER are working on a joint agenda. We all promote openness, diversity, and inclusion. We expect exports to continue to grow around 6%, more than twice the growth of the economy. Exports represent more than 35% of GDP, and we passed the USD20-billion mark in 2018, representing 600,000 jobs across the country. Linkages continue to grow, and our strategy remains the same: to strengthen efforts to promote economic growth in rural areas, which is a priority of the new administration. We also continue to work on the diversity of our markets, which now number 150. However, we still see an uneven focus on the US, therefore, we want to expand more. For example, our performance in Chinese and other Asian markets is growing by 60-70%.</p><h4>Which markets are witnessing higher demand for Costa Rican products?</h4><p>We have signed FTAs with more than 50 countries, and 94% of our exports go to one of those countries. There is no need to proactively pursue new FTAs, since we have agreements with countries that make up two-thirds of global GDP and represent 2.5 billion people; however, we want to maintain a strategy of diversification in Asia and the Middle East. In those regions, we see double-digit growth, whereas in the rest of the world, we see healthy single-digit growth. As a result, we will target them going forward.</p><h4>How do you expect mega infrastructure projects such as the Moí­n Container Terminal Project to influence trade dynamics?</h4><p>We are excited about this USD1-billion project, which will be an inflection point for Costa Rica's trade. It is growing from a public port with limitations and challenges to a private port. In terms of the quality and modernization of our offering, we also expect the Port of Limón to become a hub. It will mean that more products can come, not just from Costa Rica, but from Nicaragua and Panama. We are also modernizing our borders through a regional plan with Central America, and soon, all of our borders will have modern infrastructure that will facilitate trade.</p><h4>How do you help SMEs comply with the standards they need?</h4><p>SMEs appreciate our 360-degree service; we do not have one specific service or solution but rather the ability to adapt our services to different needs. We have a diagnostic and assessment tool for every type and size of company. Once complete, we identify the gaps and place our efforts accordingly. For example, some companies lack soft skills, and we have a team of people focused on that. Some companies do not have enough customers, and we help them find customers abroad. Others have great products but require help with acquiring finances, for which we have a team that helps companies source financing from banks or angel investors.</p><h4>How do you promote and help companies in Costa Rica become “Esencial?"</h4><p>According to the latest study done in 2017, the “Esencial" country brand had the highest growth and has translated into a boost in tourism, trade, and investment. In 2018, the brand turned five years old, which is still young when it comes to branding. However, that trend continues to be positive. We now have over 300 companies certified as Esencial Costa Rica, and they see the benefit of the brand even without investment or subsidy from PROCOMER. We see companies of all sorts and sizes wanting to join us. We offer them our slogan and image, a network that is relevant to them, consistent knowledge through seminars or events, discounts, and so on. It is extremely important for any country's brand to build up the pride of its citizens. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges for foreign investors looking to enter Costa Rica?</h4><p>Costa Rica is a small economy located in the middle of the Americas that initially specialized in exporting a few primary products to its neighborhood. Costa Rica viewed FDI attraction as a strategic option to sustain growth, enhance exports, and create better jobs. The Costa Rican value proposition for FDI is based on a combination of strategic geographical location, a well-educated and relatively cost-competitive workforce, political stability, and an attractive tax incentives package. Human talent will continue to be the main thrust to attract more investment. As a country, we continue working on our competitiveness in areas such as business climate, infrastructure, and increasing the amount of talent pool available, among others.</p><h4>What main projects do you want to see FDI coming in for the coming years?</h4><p>The world is experiencing a technological disruption, which Costa Rica is no stranger to. Our country is transitioning into an economy that is guided by knowledge, efficiency, and innovative trends, and strengthening our participation in the information industries as well as global value chains makes Costa Rica the ideal destination for knowledge-based investment. The main emerging industries that Costa Rica is competitive in at a global level are high-tech manufacturing, life sciences, and services. These sectors are characterized by incorporating complex processes with higher added value, generating quality employment. Furthermore, over the last few years, they have grown exponentially and increased our country's presence in the overall global market place. We are still working in order to attract more investment projects in the mentioned sectors, increasing our footprint and proven track record worldwide.</p><h4>How can you better align educational institutions to prepare human capital?</h4><p>We have different initiatives; for example, we build educational programs with the participation of universities, the government, and private companies to improve the local curricula according to the new market trends. For example, we helped Texas Tech University create a whole educational program, having in mind the inputs of top performers of the industry such as IBM and Intel about careers of the future. With Cenfotec, for example, three-quarters of the courses are related to cognitive, max platforms, certifications, and so on. This is an area where we work efficiently via partnerships with both public and private universities. We expect public institutions to support our efforts to close the gap between human capital supply and private sector demand for STEM skillsets.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for the coming year?</h4><p>CINDE's 2019 plan is to continually strengthen the life sciences, advanced manufacturing, and high-value-added services sectors. But more than that, we are moving from strategic sectors structure to another one more focused on strategic processes, such as cybersecurity. This will help Costa Rica become a platform for high-end and new technologies that are already part of our lives globally. Most companies here are moving up the value chain—IBM's largest cybersecurity center in the world, Accenture's largest web development and web design center in the world, and McKinsey &amp; Company's largest single site in the world are all based here.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the T-24 project?</h4><p>San José's town hall has a strong vision to have large infrastructure for start-ups, entrepreneurs, and multinational and local companies that want to be close to those technology centers. Microsoft will be the anchor company, and a second multinational will move to that area very soon. Since the beginning of this project, we were contributing with ideas for its conceptualization. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[stability-always-wins]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What lies behind the economic success of Costa Rica?</h4><p>Costa Rica boasts certain key advantages that make it an attractive country for FDI. First, political stability is the main characteristic of Costa Rica, and since it has not had a standing army for 70 years, such stability is pretty much guaranteed. Our forefathers' legacy of democratic principles carries on, and it is something that modern governments are particularly sensitive to. Second, Costa Rica has a strong social net, with a social security system that is universal and free and has had obligatory education for girls and boys almost since the country's independence. These characteristics mean that our major investment is in human talent, which make us attractive for investment in services and knowledge-based enterprises. A third factor is our strategic location, as we have access to two oceans and are in between North and South America. In addition, we are in the same time zone as the US, which helps companies to program investments with great efficiency. In addition, we have a stable legal regime and a reputed judiciary, which affords legal certainty. Finally, we have entered into 15 FTAs, including deals with the US, Canada, Europe, China, and South Korea. This is vital in companies' planification of their operations worldwide.</p><h4>What steps is the government taking to expedite private initiatives that seek to boost the Costa Rican economy?</h4><p>President Alvarado's Administration is results-driven, and fully aware that economic development is not a matter of individual action, but of collaborative multi-stakeholder engagement and partnership. Working hand-in-hand with public and private sector groups, the government is advancing an aggressive agenda to boost the economy. One of the key items of the agenda is the Alliance for Bilingualism, a program launched to scale the mastery of English as a second language. The second point is the work undertaken to tackle the challenge of skilling for tomorrow's workplace, which stems from our historic tradition of embedding education as a core value for our inclusive, sustainable development. The third relevant agenda, under the purview of our Ministry of Science and Technology, relates to connectivity. We realize that operations in a technologically-driven world demand robust, efficient, agile, and secure networks, and we are investing heavily to ensure that they are readily available. The fourth agenda relates to administrative simplification and the implementation of a single window for investment. We need to ensure that regulations, laws, and other instruments are aiding rather than hindering the achievement of the government's objectives. The fifth aim of the agenda is to direct significant public resources to improve road infrastructure network. With an investment of close to USD5 billion until 2022, we will focus on major bottlenecks within the metropolitan area and key strategic arteries connecting our coasts and borders. The sixth point is more sector related. For example, the ministries of Foreign Trade and Agriculture, with support from the Costa Rican Export Promotion Agency, are working on a program to “discover" competitive advantages in the agricultural sector. Last but not least, under Costa Rica's accession process to the OECD, further structural reform is taking place in key strategic areas such as public governance, innovation, competition policy, and investment policy.</p><h4>Costa Rica is advancing its negotiations to join the OECD. When might it become a partner?</h4><p>President Alvarado has committed to making Costa Rica a member of the OECD by 2020. We have eight bills already in Congress, and three or four more to come. An important internal step we took, the creation of a special congressional committee handling only OECD-accession-related legislation, is allowing us to move forward on this vital agenda. Our ambitious calendar targets to conclude discussions in seven of the pending 10 committees this year, leaving three for 2020.</p><h4>In 2022, what would you like to have achieved during your time in this ministry?</h4><p>First, I want Costa Rica to become a member of the OECD. Second, understanding that services and technology are changing rapidly, I want to leave an appropriate framework of incentives. Third, I want the national council for trade facilitation to be fully consolidated. Fourth, we need to be part of the WTO's transformation. To this end, Costa Rica is prepared to engage with all members to address all pending issues. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Through trade and diplomacy, Costa Rica has historically played a leading role in Central American regional affairs. What is your opinion on the role and identity of Costa Rica in Central America?</h4><p>Costa Rica has been and remains a country that stands out for its vocation for peace and for having a strong tradition of commitment to human rights, democracy, and environmental sustainability, which is why it is considered the oldest and most stable democracy in Latin America. It is a nation that lives in peace because only then can justice be clearly imparted and the importance of what human dignity means is fully understood. In addition, Costa Rica has historically been a regional benchmark for political stability and social advancement, making it one of the main driving forces for the peoples of the Americas to join forces, especially in these difficult times, to strengthen democracies and multiculturalism, all for the common good and sustainable development around peace, equality, and respect for all.</p><h4>Why is Costa Rica chosen as a base for many international institutions?</h4><p>The solid democratic tradition that characterizes Costa Rica and its commitment to the full validity of human rights have endowed this country with a unique stability. We cannot forget that already in 1908, Costa Rica had one of the great honors in the field of law as the seat of the Central American Court of Justice, the first permanent court of international law in history. 70 years later, in 1978, Costa Rica again became the seat of another international tribunal: IACHR. Through its innumerable actions, Costa Rica has shown the unrestricted endorsement of this High Court of the Americas, in addition to its tradition and vocation for the full recognition of the institutions, procedures, and mechanisms related to the peaceful resolution of conflicts and disputes.</p><h4>Costa Rica has consistently been a promoter of ongoing instruments and proposals for human rights and sustainable development. What can other countries learn from it? </h4><p>Regarding human rights, democracy, and sustainable development, Costa Rica has been and is a reference point in the region. In addition, Costa Rica has positioned itself internationally as a firm and constant promoter of mechanisms and legal tools for improvement, both in relations between states and between states and their citizens. We must remember that Costa Rica was the first country to ratify the American Convention on Human Rights and to recognize the contentious jurisdiction of the IACHR. The above perfectly reflects the moral conscience of a country that took these significant steps at a time when human rights as a limit and guide for action by states were the fruit of intense and complex debates. When the IACHR began its journey, then-President Rodrigo Carazo Odio was able to say: “Today is a historic day for the American continent." In this way, Costa Rica became an unquestionable reference of the commitment that all states must assume the full validity of human rights in Americas, provoking the formation and convergence of thoughts that pursued this laudable goal. It should also be noted that Costa Rica became the first country in the world to sign a national pact for compliance with sustainable development goals, all in line with its strong position of defending human rights and social welfare.</p><h4>Based in Costa Rica, IACHR attracts people from across the region seeking protection against possible human rights. What is Costa Rica's influence as the seat of IACHR?</h4><p>Undoubtedly, the installation of IACHR was another testimony to the strong attachment felt by the people of America for the cause of the rights and freedoms of human beings. Specifying a little more in the history of the IACHR, I must point out that in 1969, Costa Rica hosted the extraordinary conference that saw the birth of the American Convention on Human Rights, all under the presidency of then-chancellor Fernando Lara Bustamante. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your long-term strategy for Central America, and what role does Costa Rica play in Ecuador's relationship with the region?</h4><p>Ecuador has agreements with several Central American countries, such as Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala, as well as a unilateral preferential list granted by Panama in the framework of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). These agreements were recently formed and although their value shall be assessed in the coming years, they have proven effective for promoting Ecuador's exports, particularly of products with added value. There is an ongoing negotiation with Honduras, and in order to consolidate our presence in Central America, we are currently exchanging information with the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica to further explore the possibility of expanding trade between us. </p><h4>Both Costa Rica and Ecuador share the challenge of being vulnerable to the volatility of international markets in the trade of their agro-industrial commodity products. How could the two countries increase collaboration to strengthen value-added production chains?</h4><p>Costa Rica, as much as Ecuador, does not have the territory that enables the economies of scale necessary to compete price wise, which is the case for the majority of their products. In this light, our targets are specialty markets, and in terms of agricultural products we target gourmet markets. These niches are less sensitive to volatility and therefore to price fluctuations. Combining this approach with appropriate differentiation strategies, such as denominations of origin, sectoral brands, or certification marks, will land one in a small yet highly profitable market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Costa Rica become a member of the OECD?</h4><p>This is our goal; we aim to be a modern and developed country for our citizens' wellbeing, and being a member of OECD plays a key role in achieving that goal. We are defining the terms so we do not lose our own characteristics and development style. We are working hard on this and have created a legislative committee, a group of specialized deputies with knowledge of all the projects.</p><h4>What are the priorities of this administration?</h4><p>The first priorities are financial, institutional, and legal stability. Costa Rica is a growing country, with stable inflation, many opportunities for investment, an excellent geographical location, and human talent. That is why we want to strengthen this development platform and resolve the public deficit. By doing so, we can move and work with other issues, especially education. We are investing heavily in education and aim to become a bilingual country in the medium term and connect our educational centers with broadband by 2021. Apart from that, we are also working on the decarbonization of our energy. 99% of our electrical energy is clean, and we want to bring this concept to transportation and other aspects. We also need to upgrade our infrastructure to improve our competitiveness. For the next four years, we plan to invest USD4 billion in road infrastructure and USD1.3 billion in an interurban electric train. We aim to transform our Caribbean harbors and will kick off a container terminal project in February 2019. As well, we are working on a Pacific harbor in Caldera to strengthen commerce with the Pacific and Asia. We are working hard to reduce income inequality and poverty, which is why we need to generate more jobs and work on territorial specialization.</p><h4>Regarding Costa Rica's payment capacity, fiscal reform is one of the key objectives of this administration. How would you evaluate the landscape of this reform?</h4><p>This has been our priority since the start of our administration. We have had our first debate as well as some results, despite the opposition. Also, we already have the federal budget for 2019, which has not been increased and will not affect the government's functions. By using AI, we have been able to cover emergencies, prevent droughts, and improve our infrastructure. We have achieved significant reductions without neglecting our services or announcing redundancies. This plan is currently awaiting approval from the constitutional chamber. In terms of taxes, there is a strong message of confidence. This will be reflected in economic stability and confidence, which will attract investors.</p><h4>What message are you sending to the private sector, and how keen is the administration to work with PPPs?</h4><p>In our first budget, we reinforced the National Concessions Council with more than CRC5 billion (USD8.33 million). There are also USD15 million in opportunities for PPPs. We are interested in economic growth and understand that such partnerships are a tool that will take us in that direction. These include projects such as airports, the interurban electric train, and a freight train line.</p><h4>How can the government boost the educational agenda to adjust to Costa Rica's private sector's present and future needs?</h4><p>We have the human talent, and education is a priority; however, we need to create more opportunities, which is why we are working on English training to have more people speak the language of business, knowledge, and communication around the world. The aspects we are working on are dual training and improving regional higher education offerings. We need to find a balance between what universities offer, what the private sector needs, and where the country wants to go. We also want to work on reducing inequality, since the majority of development in Costa Rica is in the central region. By distributing opportunities across the country, we will break down economic, gender, and age inequality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define Costa Rican identity?</h4><p>Beyond legal security and favorable environments for investors, Costa Rica is the only country that has a historical democratic foundation, which is fundamental to secure the long-term stability of its economic outlook. </p><h4>What are the plans to promote and continue with the Central American Integration System (SICA) agenda?</h4><p>Celebrating 200 years of our republic during our administration, we are extremely committed to advancing the agenda of SICA with the necessary reforms. We need to align the objectives of certain SICA institutions to serve the development needs of our countries and the region. We need to adapt the organization to understand the specific situation of countries that promote more advanced agendas. For example, while there are countries that live with 50% or 60% poverty rates, ours is around 20%, and we still want to advance the sustainable development agenda. We also understand the need to strengthen our regional market, as our neighbors should be our main trading partners, and we should be theirs. The strengthening of the Central American institution will allow Costa Rica to have greater economic opportunities in closer markets and more open-access channels for SMEs that have difficulty accessing geographically farther markets.</p><h4>What is the new administration's perspective and position in terms of access to organizations like the OECD?</h4><p>The most important challenge in Costa Rica is to make the most out of the commercial agreements it has already signed with different partners, rather than intensively spending diplomatic capital on new ones. We were the first country in the region to establish economic and political relations with China, for example. We could do more things with the US, which is our most important business partner. We are making an important institutional effort to achieve accession to the OECD with all the advantages that it implies.</p><h4>What are the main priorities on the agenda of the new administration?</h4><p>One of the most important tasks of this administration will be decarbonization. This project brings together specific government actions, the first of which is public transportation. When we decided to change the country's energy matrix to do away with fossil fuels, it required the absolute transformation of the means of transportation. High-speed railways are some of the most important projects in the urban sector that also require a large number of long-term private investments. We need financing that is attractive for the country and investors. On the other hand, the freight train on the northern border with APM Terminals is another great and necessary project that we must consolidate in the short term. There are some important investments in the infrastructure sector that we have pending. One of them is public infrastructure. We have to significantly advance the construction of certain hospitals that are not yet fully funded, such as the Hospital of Limón and the geriatric hospital. We have to accelerate investment in telecommunications to generate all the necessary conditions for another kind of investments. We want to guarantee universal access to the internet, which can also jumpstart development in most impoverished areas of the country. Costa Rica plans to become a global green lab where the best experiments on environmental sustainability and climate change are conducted. This space is a great investment scenario linked to our decarbonization plans and the use of renewable energies nationwide.</p><h4>What message would you like to send to the investment community in terms of the structural changes in the free zone or the promotion of systems of public and private sector concessions?</h4><p>Free zone regimes will be maintained. The democratic system works, and the investment attraction models that have produced important results cannot be changed on a whim. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the historical significance of Devon House for Jamaica?</h4><p>The background of Devon House is the story of a man who worked his way up in life and built a home for himself. George Stiebel was Jamaica's first black millionaire and made his fortune from gold in Venezuela after surviving a shipwreck. This story of ambition and success is extremely important for a country that is still haunted by the legacies of slavery and colonialism. In 1965, Devon House was set to be demolished to build an apartment complex; however, the Hon. Edward Seaga put a stop to it, and the government acquired the house. It then became the home of the National Gallery until 1982. In 1982, he reopened Devon House, which was when all the structural work was done. The house was restored to its former glory, but its budget was barely paying salaries. When I joined in 2006, the government was providing JMD40 million (USD310,700) a year in subsidies. Since then, we have undertaken significant changes and improvements to increase the number of visitors and reduce our dependence on the government.</p><h4>How do you intend to become self-sufficient in terms of funding?</h4><p>Since we updated the furnishings, many people now choose to hold events here, to the point where we have to turn away people. On weekends, we have over 3,000 people coming through here. Our location is fantastic; we are the only green space as such in Kingston, which is extremely central. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[where-local-is-global]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some highlights for PIER 1 in the last year?</h4><p>In 2017, we exceeded our growth targets by 30%. We beat our numbers and emerged from the state of emergency fairly unscathed without seeing any negative effects on our business. Indeed, Montego Bay has boomed under the state of emergency. We are currently expanding, adding 2,500sqft of deck space and a fine dining restaurant. The same is happening with our gift shop, with items from around the world in our retail space and a new café. In the last year, we have been doing more planning, and much of this work should come to fruition by YE2018. It was a busy and successful year. </p><h4>What makes PIER 1 unique in the city?</h4><p>PIER 1 gets a fairly even mix of tourists and locals, and that interaction is great for both. Tourists want to come to the island and feel like they are surrounded by culture, which mostly involves interacting with locals in their natural environment. In turn, locals like to see new faces and hear stories from people from all over the world. It is common for people sailing around the world to dock and come to PIER 1, so there is also that interaction on a daily basis. This constant flow makes the place feel dynamic and vibrant.</p><h4>How is PIER 1 focused on contributing to the Montego Bay economy and creating the potential for more tourism and cultural exchange?</h4><p>If tourists leave their hotel property and come to PIER 1 and eat one of our red snappers, meet the owner, and interact with someone playing dominoes, they are more likely to come back to Jamaica and not stay at a resort. They might stay at a villa the next time or at someone's home. For me, the return business is crucial for Jamaica to be relevant in the next decade or two, and likewise for PIER 1. When people visit, the first thing they want to do is find somewhere to get delicious food and interact with our culture and music. People want a drink and to relax while they are on vacation, and we give them that. PIER 1 is extremely important for the Montego Bay landscape because we give visitors that touch of Jamaica.</p><h4>Do you have any projects in the pipeline to make PIER 1 the top nightspot in the country?</h4><p>Our restaurant is truly our core, and the deck we are adding at the moment is along those lines. We are falling short in terms of the amount of space we have. We have had nights where people comment that it is just too packed, which is a great problem to have. This expansion will almost double our floor space. We are not that heavy on our lights, special effects, and club features, but more focused on having an open-air experience. For us, less is more, even to the point of not having walls so that customers get a 360-degree boat-type feel at PIER 1.</p><h4>What are your plans to open another location in Jamaica or franchise overseas?</h4><p>We purchased a 92-room hotel called Deja Resort on Doctor's Cave Beach and have expanded within the hospitality field. After doing some research, ironically, everything we looked at led us back to Montego Bay. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Caribbean and is a hot destination. There is a line of people waiting to invest in Montego Bay. In 2018, we will have five new restaurants opening in this five-mile strip. There is no reason for us to move to a new location that will barely break even; many other destinations have not seen any growth at all in recent times. We decided to stay in Montego Bay and invest more. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has 2018 been for the group?</h4><p>2018 was a tremendous year for the group with many new and exciting developments. A key accomplishment was the rollout of Starbucks in Jamaica, as part of a joint venture with Adam Stewart of Sandals. We won the franchise in late 2016 and started the rollout in 2017. It has been extremely gratifying because Starbucks is a great brand in its own right, but most importantly we are able to use its brand power as a vehicle to boost Jamaica's Blue Mountain coffee. Another exciting venture for the group has been the opening of Coral Cliff Gaming &amp; Entertainment in Montego Bay. The 55,000sqft venue provides a family-focused arcade, live entertainment, full restaurant, and state-of-the-art casino floor. We opened in mid-July and host 3,000-4,000 customers every day. Developments in the country have encouraged us to continue to invest. Over the last three and a half years, we have invested approximately USD35 million in various programs and opportunities. I am confident we are in the right place, and heading in the right direction.</p><h4>How has your plan to expand your portfolio of customers and potential partners in Jamaica evolved?</h4><p>We are actively busy with projects both in Jamaica and regionally and always open to new opportunities. In addition to Jamaica we operate in St. Thomas, USVI, the Cayman Islands, Turks and Caicos, and the Dominican Republic. The latter of the three are currently undergoing business expansions and development. However, we believe the biggest opportunities are right here in our own country. The all-inclusive expansion in tourism has resulted in a significant increase in tourists to Jamaica, and there is a massive opportunity to encourage guests to experience Jamaica outside of their resort. There are a number of investment opportunities underway to achieve this, and the government also has a responsibility to create the right environment in the public space to entice people to come out of their hotels.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the reopening of Coral Cliff as the only one of its kind in Montego Bay?</h4><p>Coral Cliff is an integral part of Montego Bay's entertainment landscape. It offers visitors and Jamaicans alike a chance to experience world-class entertainment. Also, tourists will have authentic interactions with locals outside of the resort environment and can experience the beauty of Jamaica's music, food, culture, and people all within a single, family-friendly venue.</p><h4>What have been the main highlights in terms of operations and partners?</h4><p>The Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Commission has been an integral part of establishing our gaming operations, and we are also grateful for the support we received from the Jamaica Tourist Board (JTB). Coral Cliff's core clientele is predominantly Jamaican, though our vision is to create a facility that brings Jamaicans and tourists together in a one-of-a-kind experience not available in resorts. This integrated concept is the start of something exciting for the tourism product. Most importantly, the heart of Coral Cliff is our team; we could not have brought this product to market without them.</p><h4>How Coral Cliff is contributing to the renewal of the Hip Strip in Montego Bay?</h4><p>Coral Cliff brings a new energy and vibrancy to Montego Bay's most iconic street. The venue is world class; it is the only place in the city where guests can experience live music every night in a safe, state-of-the-art facility. Montego Bay was in need of a venue that families could enjoy together, and Zeppelin's Fun Factory, our street level, family arcade has seen tremendous support since our August opening. Coral Cliff, which will begin 24-hour operations in February, expands the nightlife offerings. Another important aspect is the addition of casino gaming on Hip Strip. We have given people more reasons to come out of their resorts and experience the real Jamaica.</p><h4>What is the company's commitment to developing the industry and the overall economy?</h4><p>We are a company that is nationalistic in its approach; we are extremely proud of Jamaica and what we stand for. Our objective is to be responsible corporate community citizens. We believe we have a responsibility to support the communities in which we operate, push for the development of Jamaica's infrastructure and contribute in various forms using our abilities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some recent highlights for Pulse Investments? </h4><p>Pulse Investments is extremely pleased to have completed the first of its accommodations projects in 2018. We built a 22-room mini-hotel on Trafalgar Road in New Kingston at The Pulse Center and have started welcoming guests. It is great to have facilities for both business and pleasure travelers which give them options in terms of pricing and services. What is special about this particular hospitality offering is that we are located in the same premises as the Peter Tosh Museum. Furthermore, the Bob Marley Museum is just up the road and Devon House across the street. This means we can expand the real Jamaican cultural creative experience for our guests. The Sensi Medical Cannabis Dispensary is also located at the Pulse Center. Our Pulse Rooms at Trafalgar, as we call it, therefore brings a slightly different product to other hospitality offerings in New Kingston. The first phase of our new 65-suite hotel project in Stony Hill is now nearing completion, and we should be receiving guests by summer 2019. We are also thrilled by the success of our modeling agency business in 2018. Alicia Burke, who is currently one of the top models in the world, is now in the top 50 highest earners in global modeling. Additionally, there is a slew of up-and-coming stars in the international space, as well as top established talent, such as Jeneil Williams and Oraine Barrett.  This is important to us because expanded model searches, which unearth new faces, will allow us to also expand our international footprint. Accordingly, we are increasing our presence in the wider Caribbean and launching new searches across Africa and other international territories.</p><h4>How do you manage your investments?</h4><p>The key is to ensure that everything we do is sustainable. We are in an age of great innovation and change, where everything that used to be done in a traditional way is now being done in another way using the internet as a base. Second, we look at growth. We are listed on the Jamaican Stock Exchange, which provides us with access to capital to finance growth. Once a company has the finance and can sustain its business, it is just a matter of systematic logical expansion. Additionally, we have key management personnel who have been part of this process for many years. We have a great deal of institutional capacity within our organization.</p><h4>Do you plan to expand your businesses?</h4><p>Always. In terms of marketing, there are synergies between all the things we do in our different business lines. Our creative business includes events, the museum, fashion, television shows, and so on. We can see guests coming to our hotel to take part in this whole creative experience. At Villa Ronai, in Stony Hill, we plan to have a spa, including treatments that involve cannabis-infused oils and the like. Again, this is about getting into that whole lifestyle experience while guests enjoy the lushness and quality of this beautiful place. Villa Ronai also houses The Majestic Sushi and Grill, perhaps the top Japanese restaurant in the Caribbean. This is all part of our lifestyle village idea, which will be expanded by having these new suites, the spa, and things of that nature. Innovation and working with technology, including social media platforms, are all part of this. Our business is organized in such a way that, with standard effort, we can see significant growth. By definition, these synergies create a result that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p><h4>What are your goals at Pulse Investments for 2019?</h4><p>We want to see the first phase of the Villa Ronai property up and running and all aspects of our business realizing increased success. This is especially so in the areas we are giving a new focus, such as Pulse Leisure (our accommodations business), Pulse TV, and our regional and international model searches, as well as a Pulse Festival in the summer. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[capital-prospects]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is TEF's role in attracting foreign direct investment into the country?</h4><p>We have a general mandate of ensuring that tourism in Jamaica is constantly being improved, hence our name. The funds we receive traditionally came from the fees that we charge every passenger who enters the country, whether by airline or cruise. We collect and transfer the money to the government, who then gives us funding. Our mandate remains the same; we have to invest in projects that increase and improve our tourism offering, whether it is infrastructural projects such as ports, street lights, or sidewalks needed to provide the quality of service that our tourists expect. We also invest in human capital and do a great deal of investments in training and providing low-interest loans for our tourism entrepreneurs to gain access to capital to further develop and expand their products and offerings in the sector. We also look at facilitating wide areas of partnerships to increase and improve our offerings. We finance, for example, what we call the Shovel Ready program, where we look at properties with a high investment potential for tourism investments. TEF finances many of these initiatives to develop the link between our manufacturers, farmers, and producers to supply hotels.</p><h4>How do you boost the number of visitors entering Jamaica and the infrastructure to support them?</h4><p>One of our strategies is to create partnerships between private sector experts and public sector personnel in the Ministry of Tourism to develop policies that will create the link and fill the gaps to meet the sector's demands. For example, we have found a fairly large gap between what the agricultural sector was doing versus what the hotel sector requires.</p><h4>How important are your partnerships with the government, private sector, and civil society in promoting the long-term development of the economy?</h4><p>As an island, we are fairly mature when it comes to our environmental partnerships and representatives. Our tourism appeals to a market that also looks favorably on environmental sustainability. We are also focused on sustainable development, since most of our clientele wants to be on the coastline. The great thing is that we have a mature system of environmental protection, and our mandate stipulates that we only support sustainable programs. So in all the infrastructural programs that we fund, there has to be that sustainability component. On top of that, we also fund direct environmental protection programs. For instance, we fund a recycling program in schools in Negril and Trelawny, in addition to an international coastal cleanup campaign and the Jamaican Environmental Trust's (JET) clean coast program. We also fund the Jamaican Conservation Development Trust (JCDT), which is responsible for the Blue and John Crow Mountains, a UNESCO heritage site.</p><h4>What are your main goals and targets for 2019?</h4><p>We are operating based on targets set by the minister to grow Jamaica's arrivals to 5 million per year in 2020. We were at 4.3 million in 2017 and are on target. We also target earnings of USD5 billion, up from USD3 billion today. We have many programs geared toward not just increasing the number of arrivals, but also the average amount spent per visitor. It is about creating new markets, more room stock and ports, and expanding the existing ports to accommodate larger vessels and cruise ships, not to mention facilitating the expansion of the airport. We are building out the streetscapes, repaving the roads, putting in sidewalks and cobblestone crosswalks, and so on. We invest a great deal in human capital development, training, and certifying people to create hospitality professionals. In any kind of service or hospitality setting, it truly comes down to the guest being happy and excited about their experience, thus driving word-of-mouth advertising and repeat customers. Our job is to ensure the country is developed, equipped, and resourced to provide an exceptional experience. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-5-million-mark]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some recent major highlights for the board? </h4><p>The market is obviously growing, and we have had a good year with an increasing number of visitors from the US. Moreover, we have some new markets, including Russia, reentering the market, and the new direct flight service out of Moscow starting in November is something we are looking forward to on a year-round basis. Similarly, there has been a lot of action in Eastern Europe, including an extra service out of Germany. Based on all these factors, the market is doing extremely well.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the increase in direct flights to France and South America?</h4><p>At present, our main partner in South America is Copa, which operates direct Panama-Jamaica flights from its hub in Panama. Copa is currently operating 11 flights a week, connecting South and Latin America. The airport in Panama is one of the most efficient hubs in the world, and we are working closely with Copa to use it. They have already committed to a service from Lima, so we are targeting to serve the LATAM market in early 2019. This will prove to be a game changer; a lot of business depends on American Airlines' route through Miami, which a lot of people do not want to use because of high visa costs and overcrowding. On the other hand, France is another work in progress, and we are talking to some people for a direct non-stop flight. The two countries signed an agreement that will make it a lot easier to operate between France and Jamaica. The French market has been doing extremely well through transit routes, but will do even better once the direct service between Paris and Montego goes live by the winter of 2020. </p><h4>How has Grupo Aeroportuario del Pací­fico done managing the airport at Kingston?</h4><p>It has done an excellent job at Montego Bay, which keeps improving. Having the private sector manage the airport is a big advantage as it attracts private investment and improve the overall service. Moving forward, the Kingston airport can service Ocho Rios. Other than that, the new highway built in Port Antonio has new possibilities for massive development. There are some unexplored beaches there, which means it can be the next frontier. </p><h4>How will you strengthen the Jamaican brand in the Caribbean and wider Americas?</h4><p>You have to be in the face of the consumer the entire time; part of Jamaica's tourist board strategy is advertising, and travel agents are still a key ingredient of our marketing strategy. We make sure that travel agents have up-to-date information so that customers know what Jamaica has to offer. In that regard, new forms of media are doing a remarkable job in showcasing the country's many wonders.</p><h4>How important are PPPs in developing the tourist sector in Jamaica?</h4><p>They are essential to the point that any country's tourist sector would sink without them. In that sense, we work closely with the Hotel Association, which is the main voice of the private sector. In fact, we recently finished the Jamaica Product Exchange at the convention center, where buyers from all the markets in Latin America had a large attendance; almost 30 buyers have direct contracts with the hotels. Moreover, in January 2019 we are planning to hold the Caribbean Marketplace at the convention center.</p><h4>What are your targets and goals for 2019?</h4><p>We want to grow between 5-8% every year and are planning to record USD5 billion in earnings on the back of 5 million visitors in 2020. Our revenue is growing faster than the number of visitors, which means tourists are spending more. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[tech-driven-solutions]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the vision behind HailX.App?</h4><p>The idea came from one of my associates, David Gormley, who had developed an Uber-style platform for taxis in England and Ireland and suggested we do something similar in Jamaica. David and I decided to form HailX for the Caribbean region, with Jamaica being our charter market. We soon realized our venture could play a role in a larger vision led by the Minister of Tourism, the Hon. Edmund Bartlett, MP, to enable visitors to see the real Jamaica outside of the resorts and engage with its people and culture. This led us to also create two additional tech-driven solutions for HailX: an e-commerce platform for all taxis in Jamaica and a public safety platform to provide greater safety and security within the transportation framework throughout Jamaica. </p><h4>At what stage does HailX find itself today?</h4><p>Since early 2017, we have been performing market research and developing the technical aspect of HailX with our programmers. We formed an exclusive partnership for the tourism market with the Jamaica Co-operative Automobile and Limousine Tours, Ltd. (JCAL), the second-largest transportation organization here, with almost 1,000 certified drivers. At the end of 2018, we moved on to the test phase that involved orientation and training for JCAL and its driver members in addition to initial real-time simulator testing of our equipment infrastructure. In early 2019, starting with JCAL's drivers, we will install vehicle equipment systems, such a 7-inch tablet with a windshield/dashboard bracket for the driver application, including a hand-free speaker/microphone device for safety purposes along with a power adaptor; a 4G Wi-Fi mobile hotspot unit; and a 10-inch high-quality tablet for the rear of the vehicle to allow people to directly engage with attractions and merchants. We will also provide an e-commerce system that will enable every taxi in Jamaica to accept credit card payments. I am excited about the launch of our public safety and security platform involving the installation of 2G GPS tracking devices, available for all vehicles, which can interface with national security, 119, and other Emergency Response outlets. The complete roll-out for HailX is scheduled for mid-2019. </p><h4>How do you plan to market HailX to visitors to Jamaica?</h4><p>Initially, we will have a strong presence with airport and cruise ship arrivals targeting incoming tourists, but we do not plan on massive brand creation. Rather, it will be organic, viral marketing.  Drivers, attractions, and merchants will promote HailX because they have a vested interest in its success as our partners. Passengers will promote it because they will receive usage and referral incentives via a robust loyalty program not only with rewards and redemption opportunities while in Jamaica, but benefits for when they also return home, including travel and vacation discounts to return back to Jamaica. </p><h4>Can marketing alone help you compete with Uber and Lyft?</h4><p>We've discussed this with our shareholders and advisory board and are confident it will work. First, our team has vast expertise with this type of model; second, there is a proprietary functionality being designed for HailX that will ensure the effectiveness of our marketing strategy. This entails building out our own wireless network with phase one's footprint, encompassing coverage for the areas surrounding the airports, cruise ship terminals, the large tourism attractions, and most of the North Highway from Montego Bay to Ocho Rios. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did your expectations developed in 2018? </h4><p>The NCU administration formed several new partnerships in support of the growth and development of the university. For example, we are currently developing an MoU with Inova Pharmaceutical, a major pharmaceutical in the US, for a project on medicinal plants in Jamaica. This kind of collaboration is vital, as it allows us to combine Jamaican raw materials with Inova's technology. It will assist us in isolating active ingredients from the raw materials so that the finished products can go quickly to the market. We also are partnering with a company from Texas to bring business process outsourcing (BPO) to NCU. Equally important, we have formed local partnerships with some of the companies that handle water harvesting, as well as with the government, to assist in increased agricultural production.</p><h4>What makes the university stand out from the competition?</h4><p>We are a Christ-centered, value-based educational community underpinned by a strong work ethic, an emphasis on service, and a culture of innovation. Thus, the people who make up the university, and the core values to which we subscribe, are of utmost importance. The emphasis on values and giving back to the region also helps make us unique. NCU has been in operation for 111 years, and when people look at the history of the Jamaican landscape, they find NCU graduates who chose to help build Jamaica. The same applies regionally, as while visiting Haiti for the first time in 2017, I found that many of the workers at the Adventist University of Haiti had received their training from NCU. Overall, our commitment to excellence makes us stand out.</p><h4>What role will your relationships in the US play for your overall growth strategy?</h4><p>In the 21st century, universities and other businesses work together on many initiatives, as it is difficult to accomplish greatness in isolation. For example, Loma Linda University in the US is a sister institution well known for its accomplishments in health sciences and medicine. And we are interested in collaborating with them to establish a medical school at NCU in the near future. We also took a similar path with dental hygiene, as Loma Linda University agreed to assist in the upgrading of the facilities in that department. We are also seeking similar arrangements with Howard University. Meanwhile, the University of Texas has also agreed to collaborate with NCU on several initiatives.</p><h4>What other relationships are you establishing with international universities?</h4><p>We continue to pursue our relationship with Andrews University in Michigan and are building links to expand our academic programs. In addition, some of our researchers were recently engaged in an important collaborative research project involving nanotechnology at the State University of New York.</p><h4>How would you describe the added value that NCU provides its students? </h4><p>We take students and nurture them to become world champions; the commitment to excellence that we stand for challenges students to constantly give their best. Our professors are committed to the development of young people, and the mission of the university is to transform students into worthwhile citizens and champions. The National Business Model competition is a crowning achievement in this regard, and we have won it every year since its inauguration; the top four positions in last year's competition were won by teams from NCU. After claiming third place nationally, team Pneulyfe went on to win the National Science and Technology competition.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>We are excited about the future and want to develop centers of excellence at Northern Caribbean University. We want to increase our enrolment and have a three-pronged strategy that involves building new student housing, securing authorization from the United States Department of Housing to allow US residents to use their financial aid to attend NCU, and achieve institutional accreditation from the University Council of Jamaica. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some highlights of the school's 30 years of existence?</h4><p>The mission of the school is “to advance learning, create knowledge and foster innovation for the positive transformation of Caribbean enterprises through the development of world-class business professionals and research-based solutions." Our main focus is teaching and learning, which includes offering degree programs, research, and executive education. We also offer consulting services to companies in a range of functional areas, including corporate transformation, business intelligence, and strategic planning. There are four pillars on which we stand proud: our world-class faculty, the partnerships we have established, our outstanding graduates, and our cutting-edge programs, including the internationally accredited MBA program. The school was further recognized by the Association of MBAs (AMBA) in February 2018, receiving the Business School Innovation Award for its Financial Markets Lab. Moreover, MSBM is the only business school in the English-speaking Caribbean to house a finance lab with a Bloomberg terminals Markets Lab.</p><h4>What is your positioning in the Caribbean and wider world?</h4><p>The University of the West Indies (UWI) is the best university in the Caribbean and was recently ranked in the top 3% in Latin America and in the top 5% in the world, according to the 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings. MSBM is also ranked among the top 1,000 business schools in the world. Our MBA program is internationally accredited by AMBA, which represents the highest standard of achievement in postgraduate business education. Several of our graduate programs are also ranked in the top 20 in Latin America by Eduniversal. Being located in Jamaica allows us to capitalize on the country's globally renowned brand and expand its reach to include scholarships and higher education. </p><h4>How is the school aligned with the mission of retaining human capital in Jamaica?</h4><p>Retaining human capital is a challenge given our proximity to North America, and brain drain is a real issue. We can only encourage and help provide opportunities. To do so, we have to create opportunities and hope. For example, the stock market is not based on current values, but what people think the company will do in the future. Our role, therefore, is to make sure we stay ahead of the curve to provide skilled personnel who see working at home in Jamaica as a good choice. </p><h4>How do you assess the operations of the university through Barbados and Trinidad? Are there any other expansion strategies?</h4><p>UWI operates as a regional university, so there are natural synergies and cooperation among the campuses, which belong to the single university. The “One UWI" concept speaks to the strength of our unity, while recognizing and celebrating our diversity. In terms of expansion, we have great opportunities. It is important for us to always emphasize the global application of what we do; we need to continuously benchmark ourselves to international standards. Most of our graduate programs are ranked in the top 10 for Latin America. We also have online courses for those outside of Montego Bay. Besides our traditional MBA programs, we have also introduced new masters programs, such as the MSC in corporate finance, marketing, and data analytics, as well as logistics and supply chain management, which respond to market needs and engage with stakeholders. </p><h4>What events do you organize with global partners?</h4><p>The World Economic Forum is one of our flagship partners. We have held events to launch the global competitiveness report, which includes analysis and research from our faculty and is attended by corporate partners, international institutions, academics, trade associations, and businesses. One of our top events is our CEO Roundtable breakfast at the annual MSBM Business and Management Conference, in addition to a number of other public forums we hold to facilitate dialog on topical business issues.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some highlights for CMU in 2018? </h4><p>There have been so many significant developments over the last year that it is hard to choose only a few, though three stand out. First, the launch of the Festo Authorized and Certified Training (FACT) Centre, the largest and most sophisticated facility of its kind in the world with the greatest ability to transform lives. It consists of laboratories with modernized equipment that are driving the integrated way we train current and future engineers. Locals no longer have to travel overseas for training, and overseas trainees can now receive international certification right here in Jamaica. CMU's work has been recognized globally with the 2018 Marine Environment. A second highlight was when CMU won the North American Marine Environment Protection Association (NAMEPA) award, the Protection Education Award, following a long line of distinguished institutions that have demonstrated leadership in their efforts to “save our seas." Third, we have signed a number of important partnership agreements with like-minded universities across the world, namely in Israel, the US, Nigeria, and Taiwan. These partnerships are geared toward joint research, student and faculty exchange, and capacity development.</p><h4>What programs, courses or initiatives captained by CMU are you particularly proud of?</h4><p>I am particularly proud of the impact that CMU is having on the country through the Caribbean Cadet Marine Corp, an initiative executed by the CMU in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Information to develop a maritime conscience among high school students and a sense of discipline among the youth. We now have over 1,000 students involved in the program and are looking to increase that in 2019. </p><h4>What are CMU's main strengths, and how does it retain its leading position in the Caribbean? </h4><p>CMU is a university like no other. It is known for its flexibility, adaptability, and responsiveness to global issues such as aviation security, counter terrorism, digital forensics, industrial automation, mechatronics, marine biotechnology, AI, international shipping, and naval architecture, all of which are areas of training offered by CMU. In addition to this, we have established centers of excellence relevant to today's global needs. These include the Maritime Training Center, which offers courses compliant to Standards in Training, Certification, and Watch Keeping of Seafarers (STCW); a Centre for Security, Counterterrorism and Non-Proliferation that offers training in security at all levels; the Center for Sustainable Supply Chains, which offers consultancy to improve operational efficiency of industry partners; the Center for Blue Economy and Innovation, which advances the university's mandate to reduce waste and boost environmentally conscious practices; the Festo Authorized and Training Centre; and the Dr. Andrew Wheatley Centre for Digital Innovation and Advanced Manufacturing, which hosts the largest suite of 3D printers in the Caribbean. </p><h4>How can CMU prevent brain drain? </h4><p>We do not think of the movement of people and skills from Jamaica to the rest of the world as a brain drain, because we do not consider the traditional concept of brain drain to be our reality. When people leave to share their knowledge and skills with the rest of the world, we train more people. With the capacity of CMU, we can now train not just for Jamaica, but for the world. That is one of our greatest assets as a university, to train to international standards. </p><h4>What is CMU doing in terms of improving access to education for Jamaicans?</h4><p>CMU is driven by the need to increase access to all. We are actively doing this through our online distance learning platform, which provides students with the opportunity to access pre-university courses, application resources, class material, and a host of other electronic educational resources. We are opening up access to higher learning, especially in postgraduate studies and through our micro masters, a better fit than a traditional masters for many students. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-point-of-reference]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some highlights of 2018? </h4><p>We'll maintain the same lines of action we have been working on to date. Our goal is to offer excellent quality comprehensive health services by strengthening our medical specialties and expanding our portfolio of services.</p><h4>What does being internationally certified by the ISO represent?</h4><p>For us, the commitment to quality and the environment is very important, and this must be transmitted to all the staff. Achieving these certifications has a direct impact on the wellbeing of our patients, the guarantee of services, the motivation of our employees, and our economic efficiency. In 2017, the Hospiten Group also obtained the EFQM 500+ seal for European Excellence, issued by AENOR and awarded by the European Quality Management Foundation.</p><h4>How do you maximize the awareness of the services provided?</h4><p>The basis of our success is the excellent work of our collaborators and professionals and the way we treat our patients. We are aware that the results are not immediate, but they are constant and withstand the test of time.</p><h4>How are you involved with the hospitality sector in Montego Bay?</h4><p>For a tourist destination to be successful, it is essential that those who visit us feel safe. Should there be a health problem during their vacation, we offer them a quality, personalized solution. This is where Hospiten comes in. Our job is to offer every tourist that safety we are talking about, to meet their demands and give them whatever they need in terms of health care. Jamaica is becoming an attractive destination. The increase in the number of visitors will bring about an improvement in the different sectors of the economy, including the health sector.</p><h4>How are you addressing the current gaps in healthcare services?</h4><p>At present, we provide a health service that meets the demands of our patients. We are aware that with the passage of time this demand will change as the needs of our patients change. Adapting to change is our reason for being.</p><h4>How is Hospiten committed to the development of the sector and Jamaican society?</h4><p>Hospiten opened its doors for the first time in Jamaica nine years ago. For the group, it is very important to be in contact with the society around our centers and to develop activities reflecting corporate social responsibility that benefit our society in a direct manner through the development of social awareness campaigns, prevention campaigns, wellbeing, healthy lifestyles, or through actions with different groups in the community. For example, we are part of the Spanish Jamaica foundation, which aims to strengthen partnerships between Spain and Jamaica through educational, environmental, cultural, and health-based initiatives toward community development.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your operations and expansion model in the Caribbean and Central America?</h4><p>The Hospiten group began its international expansion in 2000 in the Dominican Republic, specifically Punta Cana, and since then we have continued to grow steadily and now have 10 medical-hospital centers in Mexico, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, in addition to the 10 centers we have in Spain, making a total of 20. Recently, we opened Hospiten Cabo San Lucas in Mexico. Our goal is to become a global leader in healthcare management in the markets in which we are currently present, to seek continuous improvement in the quality of patient care, and to continue growing steadily and surely.</p><h4>What targets or expectations do you have for 2019?</h4><p>By 2019, the aim of the Hospiten Group is to consolidate our presence in the markets we are already present in and continue meeting the demands of our patients, strengthening medical specialties, and improving the services we offer. Of course, we also want to continue being the hospital of reference in Montego Bay by responding to the healthcare needs of our patients. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A World  to Conquer]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-world-to-conquer]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Jamaica's vision to become an international leader in medical cannabis?</h4><p>We have to ensure that we adhere to international standards and conventions in producing a quality medical product. At the root, we need a product that is safe and reliable and can stand up to quality testing, as is the case in any other part of the world. We also have to adhere to our international obligations, because there are repercussions for Jamaica if we do not. To do this, we ensure that our policies and regulations keep us within the confines of what we are lawfully allowed to do. Adhering to these rules earns us the respect of the international community and reassures them that we are not operating a free-for-all, but in a measured way, taking into consideration all the necessary standards and rules around the world. </p><h4>How is CLA committed to increasing the industry's contribution to GDP?</h4><p>Our driving force is ensuring that we have policies, regulations, and processes that adhere to international standards. If we do that, then the contribution to GDP will automatically flow. There has been an enormous amount of interest in the sector. Currently, we have 490 licenses being processed, 169 conditional licenses granted, and 24 final licenses that have been issued. When processing that amount of interest in a sector, our rules require that all participants in the space pass what is called “Fit and Proper," which means the individual passes the necessary scrutiny in order to be able to engage in said space. The contribution to GDP will come by virtue of having this much interest in it. Our focus, however, has to be on ensuring that those who enter the space have the ability to adhere to the standards.</p><h4>What is the difference in legal approaches to pharmaceutical and recreational cannabis?</h4><p>The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs specifically prohibits recreational use, and Jamaica is a signatory of that treaty. Recreational cannabis is not legal in the country, and the CLA has nothing to do with recreational cannabis. We deal exclusively with the scientific, medical, and therapeutic use of cannabis. </p><h4>How does CLA enable research and innovation in the sector?</h4><p>We have a license that deals specifically with Research and Development (R&amp;D), which has two subcategories: analytical and experimental. There are many people who have applied for such licenses, and three R&amp;D licenses have been granted to date. For anyone else who wishes to get into the sector, we listen to their concerns and determine if we can accommodate them. </p><h4>What countries can help Jamaica develop its sector?</h4><p>We have been visiting various markets, including various states in the US and Canada, to look at what they have done. We can learn something from every market, even though not everything can be applied. Some countries have taken measures, which we can replicate; there is no use in reinventing the wheel. Canada, in terms of its medicinal space, operates extremely well, and Health Canada is an excellent organization when it comes to the administration of cannabis. In the future, there should be more research with Israel, whose excellence is renowned. I have had many discussions with researchers there who said Jamaica is sitting on a gold mine of information as Jamaica has people who have been using this plant medicinally for centuries</p><h4>What is your overview of the development of the sector at this point?</h4><p>I am extremely positive about it. There is a great deal of interest, and the continuous influx of applications demonstrates that the Jamaican industry is poised to continue growing and developing. The amount of FDI also shows that there is a tremendous opportunity for the nation. We need to ensure that whoever gets through the door does not negatively affect the market for everyone else. Otherwise, our role is to listen to our stakeholders and see what needs to be done to facilitate the industry from a policy and regulatory perspective. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would describe the company's main achievements so far?</h4><p>Our entrepreneurial journey, which commenced in 2005 in an unpredictable and a small economy, has been a rollercoaster ride. Yet, our calculated risk-taking strategic approach in a challenging economy made us survive and emerge as a market winner. Today, we are a force to be reckoned with due to our diversified approach that caters to patients across Jamaica with a product line spanning 27 therapeutic segments. Our presence on the stock exchange and the demand that it is creating on the exchange speaks volumes about our achievements. </p><h4>How are you ensuring investor confidence?</h4><p>Our core product line and business model has led to an aggressive brand equity development along with creating a new market for our niche product line. A market that is created and owned by us gives our investors' confidence, which is further strengthened by our guaranteed delivery of stable and positive results, unless there is a radical phenomenon that is due to reasons beyond our control. </p><h4>How is Indies Pharma developing the healthcare sector, and what can be done to improve it?</h4><p>Since its formation, Indies Pharma has played a pivotal role in subsidizing the cost of drugs for peple suffering from chronic illnesses by partnering with the National Health Fund. In addition to that, almost a decade ago, our strategies implemented in the past have spread awareness regarding the availability of certain drugs in high demand. Moreover, the patent issues associated with them have also been positively impacted, allowing the National Health Fund's budget to save in excess of JMD300 million per annum. The long-term benefits of the above-mentioned initiatives for patients has turned out to be priceless. Moving forward, the country needs serious health care reforms that can boost the healthcare sector's strength and make it self-sustainable on a long-term basis. </p><h4>How do you asses Jamaica's vision for becoming a regional leader in the health and wellness sector, and what is Indies Pharma's role in fulfilling this?</h4><p>Jamaica needs serious health care reform to become a regional leader. Most importantly, unless the country passes an attractive legislation to invite medical tourism opportunities and upgrade its public health centers and hospitals, it will not bear fruit. To this end, in 2008, Indies Pharma volunteered to make recommendations and reforms that should be implemented to achieve set targets, but we were disappointed that there have been no takers to date. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What caught your interest in medical cannabis, and what potential do you see for the industry in Jamaica?</h4><p>My interest was sparked at CanEx Jamaica 2017, where the tremendous health benefits as well as the positive impact medicinal cannabis can have on both the health sector and economy were highlighted. With so many companies discussing raw products such as flower and oil, I was drawn to the opportunities that finished products could offer. This industry offers transformative opportunities for the people and country of Jamaica. Given our long history and association with the plant, Jamaica should be the regional leader in this industry, and I look forward to seeing our industry evolve to rightfully establish itself in that position.</p><h4>What have been the main highlights and achievements for Zimmer &amp; Co. in Jamaica?</h4><p>I am extremely proud of the ground we have covered in such a short time. We are building our business on the backbone of compliance and adherence to international standards and assembling a team capable of meeting our global ambitions. Since it started active sales in August, Zimmer &amp; Co. has expanded its footprint across the island, and its products are now available in over 200 pharmacies, across all 14 parishes. We have a team that is demonstrating resilience, application, and learning every single day as we chart a path in this industry. Providing a platform for that ambition to shine and which represents the best of Jamaican talent and potential is extremely rewarding. We look to build a great working environment and pursue our business objectives. The greatest achievements are the positive stories we hear every day from people benefitting from our products. It is extraordinarily rewarding to see our medicine in the hands of people who need it the most, helping them to enjoy a better quality of life with products that are safe, effective, and produced in line with the highest global standards. This drew me to the industry and inspires me to face its challenges. It is my calling.</p><h4>How does Zimmer &amp; Co. stand out in the field of medical cannabis?</h4><p>We focus on finished products such as cosmetics, topicals, sublingual drops, tablets, and suppositories. We have also been active in pursuing activities aimed at educating the market, from customers to healthcare professionals. It has not been easy, but I am proud of the work our team has done in this regard. In under four months, we have done over 100 in-store promotions and educated over 700 medical professionals. There is a great deal of work still to be done, but we are convinced our efforts will pay off as more people learn about the products and get comfortable with using and prescribing our products. We also view compliance and working with the respective agencies as a key aspect of our company's development, including the Pharmacy Council of Jamaica, Ministry of Health, and CLA. We look forward to seeing the production capacity in Jamaica come on stream in 2019. </p><h4>Does the sudden attractiveness of the medical cannabis venture represent a risk for small farmers?</h4><p>On the contrary, it provides a great opportunity for small farmers. The market demand for cannabis will continue to expand, and with Jamaica's special “brand" there is ample opportunity to participate at many different levels in the industry. That said, a common concern is lack of access to capital and the ability to develop adequate economies of scale. Through well-structured partnerships and co-operatives, farmers can benefit from both local sales and export opportunities. There is tremendous opportunity in the industry, though there is no step more important than the first; for Jamaica and Jamaicans to truly benefit we each need to take that first step. The real challenges start when one is actually open for business—the time they also find the greatest reward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has 2018 been for Medicanja?</h4><p>2018 was interesting because many new deals, contracts, products, and possibilities have entered the market. We have also formed international partnerships, such as with Harvard University, not to mention some of our international drug developments. The year has been excellent for us, and we are looking forward to solidifying a number of new partnerships and developments across the industry. We are now leaders in terms of moving from herb-based products to isolates and pharmaceuticals, and have now clearly established ourselves as leaders in secondary and tertiary cannabis products.</p><h4>How have you progressed in your intention to list the company? </h4><p>We conducted a survey and found that 80% of Jamaicans believed in medical cannabis and were supportive of Medicanja. We felt it was reasonable to publically list the company so that all Jamaicans could participate in and support the business. We made the decision to give Jamaican investors 20% of the shares in the company. Having made this decision, we tried to move forward. However, various banking issues came up and thwarted these efforts. Banking issues have been a major source of concern for the entire industry across the world, even in countries like the US. These issues keep us from going to market because banks are such an integral part of this process. Nevertheless, we are in the process of finding a way around this obstacle and are confident that these issues will be behind us in 2019. At the same time, we are exploring relationships with other companies focused on the growing side of the business, whereas, historically, we have been involved in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical end of the business.</p><h4>How and where do you expect to export your products in the region?</h4><p>We feel that Jamaica must be our first area of focus, so we have our products in a number of pharmacies here; however, even getting a manufacturer to engage in creating commercial quantities is another challenge. So for now our energies are focused on solving these domestic issues. Nevertheless, we are also looking at a new product line: cosmeceuticals. This includes a number of new products, including perfumes derived from cannabis, which we expect to be a global product. On the international arena, we are planning to push into the Caribbean, Latin America, and Canada, as well as license our projects in the US and Europe. However, all of these plans require investment, which is why we are interested in forming partnerships with the right investors or raising capital from the market place. We are actively pursuing both of these strategies, and once we acquire the resources we are looking for, we are going to have a major push toward commercialization. </p><h4>How important is research and development at Medicanja, and what new products and technologies are you working on?</h4><p>In 2017, we expanded our line from six pain management products to 12, and we hope to have 19 by the end of 2018. A product for epilepsy just received approval from the FDA and from GW Pharmaceuticals in the UK. We have an even more effective product here, but we have been constrained by banking issues and funding problems. There are products for epilepsy and MS, and the latter was the first major cannabis-based product. GW Pharmaceuticals has placed this product in 64 markets across the world, and we can place our product in similar markets and compete effectively at a much lower price and comparable quality. We were one of the first countries to discover that cannabis could be effective in managing glaucoma, and we have created a product designed to help with this disease. In fact, we created the first cannabis-based product designed to alleviate this disease right here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What potential does the medical cannabis industry in Jamaica?</h4><p>It has tremendous potential and the opportunity to unlock substantive economic growth and productivity within the nation's work force. When you look at some the statistics coming out of places like Colorado, which have seen welcomed bumps to their tax income, even more impressive is the economic stimulation throughout the industry's entire ecosystem; the small businesses and job creation that help people buy new cars, eat out more often in restaurants, spend more at the supermarket, take classes, and so forth. The economic boost is significant, particularly when you look at our population of 2.9 million people; you realize the great potential on a per capita basis. The potential economic impact is quite significant and makes it that much more urgent for the proverbial powers that be to streamline some of the red tape and bureaucracy that has been an impediment to the growth and expansion in the industry in Jamaica.</p><h4>What is your greater vision, and how has it unfolded? </h4><p>CanEx aimed from inception to be a platform that brings together like-minded individuals and industry leaders from across the globe to advance the industry. Jamaica is the cultural and symbolic epicenter of cannabis and ganja, so it's quite an appropriate location to bring people from around the world to discuss the evolution of the industry. Additionally, CanEx strives to play a globally significant role, which is why we have always had such an international array of speakers and participants. Thus, we will continue to build the conference and push especially in the Caribbean and LATAM to establish ourselves as a global platform to bring stakeholders together to exchange ideas, build relationships and pursue ideas that will advance the industry.</p><h4>How does Jamaica's cannabis industry measure in comparison to the wider region, and how can it compete with larger producers?</h4><p>At present, Jamaica is a leader in the Caribbean and, in some respects, even in Latin and South America when it comes to the evolution of its market. The 'Jamaica' brand, along with a competitive cost structure, represent tremendous assets that can be leveraged via flower and oil, finished products, and the many ancillary opportunities from medical and lifestyle tourism to research, education, and nutraceuticals.  </p><h4>Amidst all the hype, is there still room for new players in the sector?</h4><p>Many players are emerging in the industry across a range of different verticals. However, there is still tremendous room for growth and participation. It is certainly a competitive landscape, and you must be prepared to compete in a global marketplace that's moving at warp speed. So, in many instances, even while you are still tweaking your plan, you have to be prepared to pull the trigger and move forward. Jamaica has tremendous potential within this space, but the industry must move much faster to take advantage of its innate strengths to fully benefit.</p><h4>Does the sudden attractiveness of medical marijuana represent a risk for small farmers?</h4><p>For small farmers, like everyone else, the legal medical industry holds exceptional opportunity. The reality is that the legal cannabis industry is highly regulated and accordingly, there are a number of factors that play a key role in driving success. These go way beyond an innate passion or experience in growing in the more traditional sense. The new landscape requires enhanced skills and resources to succeed, and additional considerations must be taken into account to be successful growing a plant that is subject to all the different SOPs, regulations, and parameters that define acceptable and marketable use in a global market place. </p><h4>What are your goals and strategy for the coming year?  </h4><p>We expect to drive more global participation through our exhibitors and attendees. In 2018, we had attendees from 23 countries and expect that number to increase, particularly given our efforts and partnerships in the Caribbean and LATAM markets. We have also taken steps to expand our footprint globally. Our goal remains to create a high-value global conference that takes place in Jamaica so that we can bring the best and brightest of the industry together, from business leadership to medicine, science, legal, and regulatory expertise. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[market-to-the-world]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights for the company?</h4><p>We are the largest seafood player in the Caribbean headquartered in Jamaica. Vertically integrated with vessels, farms, and processing plants in Jamaica, the Bahamas, and Belize, with over 730 team members we are a dominant force in our industry in the region. Our largest facility is a three-acre processing plant and distribution center in Kingston capable of sophisticated food processing as well as value-added manufacturing including breading, battering, marinating, smoking, and cooking. Here, we manage the production of burgers for international fast food chains, including Burger King and Wendy's, as well as homegrown quick serve-chains like Juici, Tastee, and Island Grill. We source raw material from around the world, and with our local ingredients, team members, and technology, we add value right here. Our most recent achievement is building the largest free-standing freezer in the English Caribbean at our Montego Bay facility, which effectively doubles our island-wide storage capacity and allows us to create an operationally effective and strategic logistics hub for both our imports and exports. Moreover, we can better serve our growing hotel industry and operate as a central hub for supplying the other 15 Caribbean islands to which we currently export. In Jamaica, we have 30 retail stores and four restaurants. This model works well for us across the Caribbean.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your sustainable environmental practices? </h4><p>Sustainable fishing practices are important to us. In lobster harvesting, for example, we only use traps on our industrial vessels in Jamaica and snare sticks in Belize, as scuba-assisted diving often involves hooking and killing the animal before the fisher has the ability to verify whether or not it is pregnant or of legal size. In the Bahamas, the lobster fishery has achieved MSC Certification, a testament to the sustainability of the resource. We have a stone crab vessel producing stone crab claws, a high-demand, niche product. It is a unique, sustainable fishery that involves breaking only one of the two crab claws and returning the animal back to the ocean, and this species of crab can grow a new claw in one season. Unlike mega farms with intensive farming practices, the entire Belize aquaculture sector is a small and closely managed industry with seven low-environmental impact shrimp farms. Our farm and processing plant are both ASC and EU certified. </p><h4>What are the main outcomes with the Rainforest organic farms?</h4><p>Rainforest Farms is a boutique 80-acre property where we grow niche products that Jamaica is famous for, such as cocoa and turmeric. It is a beautiful property in Trelawny with a river running though it, providing us with a reliable year-round water supply. We just begun our export thrust and recently built an export-packing house that is certified by RADA and endorsed by JAMPRO to assist in that process. Our plans are more medium- to long-term plays, with a focus on niche products that we believe in. Eventually, we hope to be able to meet the demands of the local market as well as the diaspora markets in the UK, Canada, and the US.</p><h4>How is your logistic model expanding?</h4><p>We fly live lobster from Jamaica and Belize to lucrative Asian markets. We are blessed with the Port of Kingston, which is among the top five deepwater harbors in the region and provides wonderful access to the global market. We import products and raw materials from South and Central America, Australia, and Asia and then export to 15 Caribbean islands, Europe, and Asia. </p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>For starters, we seek to build out a larger distribution center in St Lucia, strengthen our operations in the Bahamas, expand our shrimp farm and processing plant in southern Belize, and break ground on one or two more comprehensive seafood processing plants in the Caribbean. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Nestlé developed its main brands in Jamaica?</h4><p>Nestlé continues to be agile with trends in the fast moving consumer goods market, having evolved from a small milk company over 78 years ago to an expansive portfolio including infant nutrition, culinary products, confectionery, and coffee, to name a few. Milk is no longer the company's core and represents less than 5% of the business. Our brands demonstrate our understanding of the local marketplace; we listen to the feedback from our customers and consumers and respond with products that meet and often exceed their needs. Additionally, we have been proactive in introducing products that are relevant to the market.  </p><h4>How was 2018 for the company?</h4><p>2018 met our expectations at every level of the business, and we are in line to deliver double-digit growth for the third year in a row as we continue to evolve, enter new channels, and expand our portfolio. We are challenging ourselves to innovate and remain relevant in this dynamic market. Today, our dominant millennial population has altered the way we reach our targets. Coupled with the reality of a digital landscape, we have had to change the way we market, as social media is more relevant than it was a few years back. How we communicate and connect is important now because our client base has varied habits. As a result, we hinge our growth strategy on innovation and renovation while remaining agile to the changing needs of our customers and consumers.</p><h4>What is your strategy to ensure you increase your market share?</h4><p>Market share is how we measure our success. We market to ensure that the consumer will purchase our product, and if they purchase our product, we gain market share. In fact, we use market share as a key indicator of the health of our business and how well we connect and stay relevant. Innovation and upgrading have been two of the key components while adapting to trends, lifestyles, ever-changing consumers, and taste profiles.</p><h4>Which channels do you use to reach more people on social media?</h4><p>Social media helps us stay connected to consumers and customers and creates new relationships and leads. It is a way of making one's brand known. In terms of social media for Nestlé, it helps us to remain firm in our purpose, values, and the difference we want to make in society. As a global company, we are on all platforms, including LinkedIn, though on a local level we are more focused on meeting mass consumers on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. These social media sites are forms of 'real-time' communication where we get to interact with thousands of people on a daily basis. Twitter and Facebook have redefined the communication landscape, especially for businesses such as Nestlé. What drives us is being a health and wellness company, so we put our resources and focus into activities that demonstrate that commitment. One of our main focuses is our nutrition, health, and wellness program in public schools. As trends emerge and governments focus on fighting obesity and other non-communicable diseases, we react through educational messages on our platforms. One has to connect with consumers early on to change and drive behaviours and choices, and this is something we try to do on a daily basis via our respective platforms.</p><h4>What is your main strategy to achieving your targets?</h4><p>Nestlé's growth strategy hinges on a get-it-done culture.

		<url><![CDATA[reaching-markets]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights of 2018?</h4><p>2018 saw growth, and we are pleased to have reached markets such as China. As local manufacturers, we have to learn to compete against countries with significant mass and identify ways to add value and then export them. There are three things in particular that would move the needle significantly. One is factory space for SMEs, and we have been working on a project with the government and the Factories Corporation of Jamaica to identify purpose-built factory space for small businesses at concessionary rates to start moving them out of the informal sector. The second thing the industry needs is low-cost financing. In fact, the tourism and BPO sectors have both been able to receive financing as low as 4% from the Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ) and the National Export-Import Bank of Jamaica (EXIM Bank), though SME manufacturers still operate with financing as high as 18-20%. The third factor that would help build scale in medium-sized manufacturing companies is a change in the country's procurement policy. If these three steps are taken, manufacturing will continue to grow at a faster pace and contribute more to GDP. Peer-tested studies conducted by the University of the West Indies by Dr. William Lawrence have shown that every percentage point of movement in manufacturing GDP has a 40% correlation to national GDP.</p><h4>What does the merger of the Jamaica Manufacturers' Association and Jamaica Exporters' Association signify? </h4><p>The two associations were lobbying for many of the same things to the same people. We had two different voices but wanted to reach the same place. Now, the merged Jamaica Manufacturers and Exporters Association has come together with one voice and platform. This is beneficial to our members, as they only have to pay one set of dues. Furthermore, we do not need to duplicate our accounting, marketing, and administrative efforts. We give our members better value for money and will achieve more. Now we are looking at new markets where we can help people enter. We hope the days of exporting raw produce, such as bauxite, bananas, and sugar, are over; we seek to add as much value as possible here and develop niche markets around the world for our high-quality products.</p><h4>Which markets in particular do you seek to expand into?</h4><p>We take our cues from our membership and see where they want to go. For example, I attended the inaugural China International Import Exhibition with two ministers and a delegation from Jamaica where we displayed our coffees, rums, sauces, and various other products. We see a great opportunity to enter markets like China. In fact, we have started to export frozen lobsters to China and are working closely with the embassy on the possibility of exporting live ones. In addition, we had meetings there with companies that want to purchase our coffee. We currently have members that export as far as Africa, and there are certain markets we want to break into, such as Cuba and other neighbors.</p><h4>How will Jamaica's Logistics Hub Master Plan allow businesses to fully exploit the country's strategic location?</h4><p>Jamaica has never truly utilized its best asset: its location in the Americas. We have 650 million people on our doorstep to the south and 450 million to the north who want products from around the world. It would be easy for a company in, say China, to send thousands of containers to Jamaica for storage and value addition, and we can easily send these products on to the US by ship or plane in the space of two hours. Our infrastructure is exceptionally here; we have excellent telecommunications, storage, technology, and air transport links, speak English, and have a first-world economy. We have all the factors to have an economy centered around logistics, and if we do not do so, it is at our own peril. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[he-jovenel-moise-president-republic-of-haiti]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities for growth do you see in Latam and the Caribbean?</h4><p>I think that Latin America and the Caribbean nowadays have a lot of opportunities when we talk about economic growth, and most of the countries are expanding within the region. As a consequence, people from the Caribbean must continue focusing, for example, on areas such a technology, innovation, and industrial agriculture, and we must identify other opportunities further down the road. That is something that must become a state policy, which, as a matter of fact, I  mentioned during my electoral campaign, along with the political stability that this can generate.</p><h4>What are the synergies between Haiti and Dubai that business can leverage?</h4><p>Countries located in the Gulf, and especially in the UAE, have great experience when it comes to oil production and how to diversify the economy and that brings opportunities to countries such as Haiti. For example, we signed an agreement 19 years ago in order to export wool to the US without any taxes. This includes 5,000 different products. This represents a chance for Emirati firms to invest today in order gain even more access to the North and South American markets. Hence, this is a chance for the investment located in the UAE to come to Haiti and afterward to the US, especially in electronics, technology, agriculture, and cruise ships tourism. In fact, in Haiti, we receive 800 cruise ships each year with the Royal Caribbean brand, because there are a lot of attractions and we have five islands that are popular with tourists. Thus, this is something that we would like to improve. We'd like to attract investment from the UAE so we can work together to develop these islands, including by reclaiming land, as seen in Singapore, bringing financial ventures and developing cities for the future.</p><h4>How do forums like GBF2019 facilitate business partnerships?</h4><p>It is an opportunity for Haiti and that is the reason why I attended this event. In fact, we have the opportunity and the possibility to create new ties between Dubai and Haiti, and Dubai and the Caribbean. The importance of participating at such events is to network and take advantage of a platform of entrepreneurs. The event is important for their businesses and of course to boost businesses in Latin America and the Caribbean. This is an opportunity for the Emirates to invest, and to invest in Haiti. In fact, I personally encourage this kind of event and even more in the Caribbean, and why not Haiti for the next GBF in 2020?</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[USD4.2 Billion FDI in 2018]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[roberto-russildi-secretary-economy-employment-government-nuevo-leon]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2018 Nuevo León's economy grew at a higher pace than the Mexican economy, and Nuevo León became the top recipient of foreign investment. What factors have contributed to these results?</h4><p>That is correct. Nuevo León maintains its position as Mexico's strongest and most solid economy, and the most attractive for national and international investments.  The Secretary of Economy and Labor (SEDET) of Nuevo León, reported solid economic growth during 2018 of around 3%, a record high in FDI, as well as a surge in the manufacturing and construction industries. One of the indicators that reflect the strength of the state's economy is that exports amounted to around USD40 billion in 2018 and the automotive sector registered the highest participation in that total, with 34.9% of that amount. Among the contributing factors there is the availability of a highly skilled labor force, a privileged geographic location close to the US; the Colombia border cross in Anahuac, Nuevo León is the point of entry of many Mexican exports and the most important for cattle export to the US market. Another advantage is that we have internationally acclaimed universities in the state, such as ITESM and UANL. You can also find the cluster system in the state, globally competitive companies, solid infrastructure, modern industrial parks, two international airports, research centers, and advanced training programs.</p><h4>There has been an increase of 127% in FDI. What sectors or projects have received this investment?</h4><p>According to The Secretary of Economy, the state received USD4.2 billion in FDI in 2018, representing a 127% increase compared to the previous year. The state had 13% of the total FDI in Mexico in the last year.  During 2018, companies like WeWork, LS Automotive, Renishaw, Conduent, Digital On Us invested in Nuevo León, generating new and better jobs. Economic growth is also due to reinvestments of companies already based in Nuevo León, which is still attractive, and has seen inflows of FDI from 515 companies. Most of the investment comes from the US, which represents around 56% of the FDI, followed by Argentina, with 16%, Spain with 8%, and the Netherlands with 6%. The main sectors participating in FDI are advanced manufacturing, the automotive industry, commerce, and services. The transport equipment manufacturing industry represented 40% with USD1.7 billion. Other sub sectors, such as the metal basic industry, which represents 15.6%, the beverage industry, with 8.8%, and electric generation with 8.4%.</p><h4>This Secretary is in charge of labor. How is the positive economic development translating into the labor sector?</h4><p>In 2018, 55,000 new formal jobs were created in Nuevo León according to the IMSS. Unemployment closed at 3.6% for the year, one of the lowest in the last few years. This is due to increased job generation and labor dynamics strategies implemented by the administration of governor Jaime Rodrí­guez Calderón such as job fairs, trainings and work scholarships. Nuevo Leon represented 8.3% of new jobs registered in the country in 2018, and contributes with 8% of total workers registered at the IMSS.  The manufacturing sector is still the main generator of jobs in Nuevo León. </p><h4>In 2017 Business Nuevo León was launched as a way to promote the internationalization of the state's economy. How have the first few years being for the initiative?</h4><p>The administration lead by governor Jaime Rodrí­guez Calderón, established as a policy in the state's development plan to generate opportunities for growth, employment, and the reduction of poverty. Attracting new national and international investments is key, and the plan aims to promote Nuevo León as a competitive and attractive destination for investments. Business Nuevo León is a brand that identifies as the promoting agency for investment and has different government agencies involved in its objective.</p><h4>The pillars of the economy of the state are industry and exports. What is being done to reduce the dependence on the US and to diversify markets? What countries are a priority to establish new trade deals?</h4><p>Nuevo Leon was the first destination for investments from the US, with USD2.7 billion in 2018. It is the highest number recorded since 1999.  One of our priorities is to keep promoting the state abroad not only in the US and Canada, our trade partners, but also in Asia and Europe. After the start of operations of Kia in 2016, the interest from Asian companies has increased. In 2017, the Hofusan industrial park was built by a partnership between a local businessman and Asian business people, where around 100 Asian companies can operate with an estimated investment of USD1.5-2 billion in a decade. In 2018, we had more than 25 delegations from China. In 2019 we have sent commercial missions to promote the state in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia.  In March 2018, Hangzhou XZB Tech Co from China, started operations in its first plant on Mexico, which produces autoparts.</p><h4>The model to attract FDI to Nuevo León is based in creating an optimal climate to do business. How are you working to strengthen this model?</h4><p>For many years we have being creating a working culture, a DNA to be an industrial capital. <br>We are proud of the triple helix model, in which we created the 13 clusters to boost growth in the strategic economic sectors for the state such as automotive, appliances, aerospatial, energy, nanotechnology, information technologies, interactive media, housing and health. Nuevo León also has the largest network of industrial parks, with around 130.The entrepreneurial muscle, qualified labor, infrastructure, business climate, cluster systems, universities and geographic location are strengths that attract business.</p><h4>What are the priorities for 2019-2020 for the Secretary of Economy and Labor of Nuevo León?</h4><p>Maintain the state's leadership status, as the most competitive in the country with an intelligent economy, good growth, and employment for its five million inhabitants. We will continue promoting Nuevo León abroad as a state with solid infrastructure, social peace, and safety to attract more investments, continue to bet on strategic sectors, support the development of SMEs, and position the state as a leader for Industry 4.0 in North America.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dr-moataz-bin-ali-vp-middle-east-north-africa-trend-micro]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the current major challenges in the field of cybersecurity, and what solutions does Trend Micro provide?</h4><p>Globally, Trend Micro has been a leading cybersecurity firm for the past 30 years. Being a Japanese company by nature comes with a deep culture of innovation, discipline and concentration. That is one of the reasons why Trend Micro has focused on cybersecurity globally since its inception. Within that space, the company has evolved and dramatically diversified its portfolio. Trend Micro currently stands as the largest cybersecurity company in the world in terms of technology portfolio, and we cover the industry from almost every aspect. Our portfolio addresses the most targeted and threat-intensive domains in the industry: endpoint security, data and information security, server and data center security, cloud defense, network defense, custom systems defense, industry specific security, IOT, OT and embedded security, managed detection and response (MDR), virtual patching and security analytics. All these together form a powerful strategy that we call the connected threat defense, which is a major trend in cyber protection. Connected Threat Defense can be considered as the digital transformation for the cyber security domain connecting all cybersecurity solutions together to provide an organization with consolidation, automation and 360 degrees' insight. Often, organizations have different solutions for different departments, for example, an Oracle database, SAP applications, Dell servers, Cisco network, HP workstations, Microsoft Windows OS and IBM middleware. Every piece of technology has its own security solution, so there is no one-stop shop security solution that fits all. Unfortunately, this also means that no IT security team has the ability to fully automate security and have full insight over their entire IT environment. This always tends to create blind areas in an organization's security allowing hackers to access the organization through these blind and weekly secured areas. This is also one of the biggest reasons why industrial security is so fragile, because hackers can slip through the most fragilely protected parts in factories, which are usually outdated machinery infrastructure, into the entire organization. With the connected threat defense approach, Trend Micro has revolutionized that, allowing the organization to connect all security solutions into one automated control system providing end-to-end automation, a 360 view into all security needs, while also consolidating financially and resource wise.</p><h4>Cloud services are on a global increase including in the Kingdom. What are the major challenges and threats here, and what solutions do you provide?</h4><p>We have end-to-end hybrid cloud protection solutions, as most of our customers in this field still have local data centers in addition to using managed or public cloud services, such as Amazon Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or others. We need to support the entire breadth and depth of whatever cloud strategy any of our customers provide us with. Customers change their cloud strategies all the time, and being able to support this full cloud service ecosystem makes us unique in the market whether the customer's strategy revolves around a combination of physical and virtual, public or private cloud, container, serverless or otherwise we can fully support it and protect it.</p><h4>What are your current engagements with the Saudi government regarding digital transformation?</h4><p>Trend Micro is uniquely positioned in Saudi Arabia, having its head office for the MENA region in Riyadh, rather than Dubai, where most cybersecurity firms have their headquarters. The office was set up in the beginning of 2018, and by the end of 2019 we will have established our full regional head office operations here. The upper management that were recruited are Saudis as well, and in one year we have grown our Saudi operations from six to 70 team members, with a majority proportion of Saudis. We invested considerably in the ecosystem at large by building capacity for our partners and bringing technology transfer and training and development for cybersecurity professionals. As part of that, we have invested in the Start Safe program, a Trend Micro program planned to support 1000 Saudi start-ups with a funded cybersecurity platform to help them focus on their core business, grow with our protection, and build the right community around them. With our commitment to the country and the whole region, we have assumed a broader mandate in the region rather than just a normal cyber security vendor, we are actively working to diversify the country's revenue streams and play a critical role in the development of the digital economy and IT ecosystem of Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How do technology companies perform within the start-up ecosystem?</h4><p>There is a great deal of progress in the start-up ecosystem for technology companies, and the momentum of Saudi entrepreneurs interested in cybersecurity careers is growing. At a recent cyber defense summit, we organized a 'Capture-the-Flag' hackathon, whose objective was to find local talent, train it, create a competitive ecosystem around it, and then expose it to the market. In terms of building talent, we are committed to having them compete internationally, meet with their peers, and unlock their full potential. We have another program called the Saudi Academy for Cyber Security Graduates where we recruit Saudi graduates with technology backgrounds and train and develop them in cybersecurity and help to provide them with employment opportunities either with Trend Micro directly or with our partners and customers. After launching this globally in Africa, the US, Latin America, and Asia, we opened it to the Saudi market and immediately received 2,800 applications in less than a week. We employed the first batch of graduates ourselves. The intention is for future batches to join our customers and partners to spread the expertise, and we can tailor our programs to their future requirements. To further support our customers and partners, we created an Arabic technical support center for cybersecurity in the region, and we are the only global cybersecurity company to offer that. We are also working to create a center of excellence for cybersecurity innovation and support, where we help guide our customers develop their cybersecurity strategy at no cost and support them in the event they are under an emergency attack.</p><h4>What are the strategic priorities and ambitions for Trend Micro in Saudi Arabia in the coming year?</h4><p>Our ultimate vision here is to become the sole trusted partner to the Saudi government and private sector in anything related to cybersecurity. To support this vision, we are building our capacity, bringing in the global expertise within Trend Micro and localizing it for the Saudi market. Our strategy in Saudi revolves around three elements: commitment, connectivity, and completion.

		<title><![CDATA[More than 82 Million Tourists in 2018]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[isabel-oliver-secretary-state-tourism-president-turespana]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With more than 82 million tourists, Spain broke its own record in 2018. What are the main challenges that this organization has gone through?</h4><p>The results are excellent. 2018 was a very good year, and we see that some of our competitors have started to recover in 2019, so we have to continue working to consolidate our sustained growth. Some of the challenges we face are to reinitiate the conversations between town halls, autonomous communities, and the central government to coordinate all the efforts from the public sector. We have held several meetings to materialize these efforts. We restarted the National Tourism Council after years of no activity; it is an entity that assesses the Tourism Ministry with representatives from both the private and public sectors. We have appointed some new members to create a new vision for this council. We have also held a meeting for Turespaña's management board, which also had not met in several years, and included the private sector into it. And within the Secretariat of State, we have held several meetings to address challenges and find solutions that the industry faces.</p><h4>The marketing strategic plan for 2018-19 has the goal of reaching high-quality tourists. What are the measures included in the plan?</h4><p>The plan is still being developed. We are launching some campaigns to boost tourism online. We want to consolidate Spain's traditional markets such as the UK, Germany, and France, and also seek tourists from markets who have not traditionally come to Spain. These are high-end consumers who are more interested in culture and traditions and tend not to travel in the high season. We also seek these tourists in emerging markets, as well as in Asia Pacific countries and the US. All tourists are welcome in Spain, but we want to use our well-known brand in the markets in which we are already known, while we focus on these new markets.</p><h4>Luxury tourism in Madrid has been somewhat behind other European cities. What are you doing to attract these tourists?</h4><p>We think that the most important thing is to have a strong product and promote it, and at present, we are working on different products. In the shopping tourism segment, Spain is ranked fourth just behind France, the UK, and Italy, and Spain still has a lot of space in this area to continue growing. This is a kind of tourist who has a high net worth and is complementary to other segments, because they might be interested in culture, culinary experiences, or visiting. They might come to watch a La Liga game, and then go to a wine cellar. We think this is an interesting product for Asia Pacific and one thing we are trying to do is make visa requirements easier.</p><h4>Spain received more than 5 million business tourists in 2018. What measures are you planning to implement to boost MICE tourism?</h4><p>In Turespaña, we have a specific group working jointly to boost this area. In Madrid and Barcelona, we have two important cities for this kind of tourism, but we also want to promote other areas. We are planning to develop a study for the public and private sectors to see what needs to be done in order to improve our strategies in this area.</p><h4>What makes Spain attractive for MICE tourism?</h4><p>It is a country with good infrastructure and facilities. Spain also has good connections with Europe and the rest of the world. The country has good professionals in this sector, as well as good landscapes and gastronomy. Having these ingredients, we can just improve further. We are in a phase of working cautiously to enhance this segment as it has immense potential.</p><h4>What markets are particularly interesting for Spain within Latin America?  </h4><p>We have few tourists from Latin America, but those who visit us have a strong purchasing power. Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela are some of those markets.</p><h4>What's the future of Paradores?</h4><p>We think that Paradores are going to continue being government-owned. In 2018 the company made EUR15 million in profits, and it has improved the working conditions for its employees. We think it is well positioned and we are going to seek these new clients who do not know Paradores so that they can enjoy the experience we offer. We are using Paradores to demonstrate the varied gastronomy of Spain. We want to improve our facilities and open two new Paradores in 2019. This is a network that could be also interesting for MICE tourists, like the Paradores in Alcala de Henares or La Granja de San Ildefonso that offer business facilities.</p><h4>What are your priorities the year ahead?</h4><p>We have started to work on the tourism strategy 2030. We do not have a long-term plan because the latter expired in 2015 and we need a new plan to establish certain goals. We want to focus on five areas: collaborative governance, sustainable growth, competitive transformation, product, and tourism intelligence, which are concepts that have to be incorporated in the entire strategy. Of course, this strategy is being coordinated with the sustainable development goals that impregnate the whole mandate.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mevlut-cavusoglu-minister-of-foreign-affairs-republic-of-turkey]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The many visits to Africa of high-level Turkish officials over the last few years indicate the importance of the continent to Turkey's foreign relations. How would you assess bilateral ties between Turkey and Nigeria today?</h4><p>We have a “win-win“ approach to Turkish-Nigerian relations. This approach to Africa is essential. Only through such an approach will the economic potential of Africa benefit the continent first and the wider world later. Our relations with the African continent have gained momentum over the last decade. We see Nigeria—a rising power in its region—as a strategic partner in Africa and we aim to develop and diversify our relations in all areas. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the Republic of Turkey, paid an official visit to Nigeria on March 1-3, 2016; just over a year later, President Muhammadu Buhari visited Turkey, on October 19, 2017. These visits demonstrated our common will to deepen our bilateral relations and move forward. Both countries are regional powers in their respective geographies. This fact presents us the opportunity to deepen our cooperation in a wide spectrum of areas. Much improved economic relations through realizing infrastructure projects and increased trade are the main areas to look into. Fighting against terrorism is also an important pillar for our collaboration. Transboundary terrorist organizations threaten every country they reach. If we do not strengthen cooperation against these threats, they will eventually damage the places where they nest. The PKK/YPG/PYD, DEASH, and FETÖ are some of the terrorist organizations that Turkey fights against. FETÖ is a cult-like global organized crime network with economic and political ambitions. Its activities should be closely monitored and ceased. We support Nigeria's fight against Boko Haram and the so-called “Islamic State-West Africa Province“ (ISWAP). ISWAP, a faction of Boko Haram, claims to be related to DEASH. We fight DEASH vigorously in our region. In late 2018, the Turkish Ambassador, Melih Ulueren, stated Turkey's willingness to diversify its business ties with Nigeria; moreover, the Turkish Exporters Assembly aims to achieve USD1 billion in trade with Nigeria by 2020.</p><h4>In which areas do you see the highest potential for more diversified trade?</h4><p>The amount of bilateral trade between Turkey and Nigeria reached USD1.25 billion (USD350 million Turkish exports to Nigeria, USD900 million imports), including petroleum and LNG exports from Nigeria to Turkey. Excluding the petroleum and LNG trade, the bilateral trade volume is approximately USD490 million. Our bilateral trade is imbalanced and heavily based on petroleum, LNG, and civil aviation. This imbalance in bilateral trade can be levelled through better economic ties. Turkish construction materials, furniture, electrical equipment, and machinery enjoy international competitiveness, with good value for money. Exports of these goods from Turkey to Nigeria should be increased. Likewise, Turkish construction companies could gain a better share of infrastructure projects in Nigeria.</p><h4>What are the most attractive investment opportunities in Turkey for Nigerian investors?</h4><p>As an emerging market, Turkey provides opportunities to foreign investors. With an 80 million-strong population, we have a large domestic market. We are also in a customs union with the EU. Thanks to vocational education and experience in Turkey, our labor force is qualified and competitive. Our geographical location connects Europe, Asia, and Africa. Turkey has well-developed infrastructure and a business-friendly investment climate with low taxes and strong incentives. In parallel with their investments at home, sectors that Nigerian investors could easily invest in include agriculture, mining, energy, infrastructure, finance, and real estate.</p><h4>How do you envision the future of bilateral relations between the two countries?</h4><p>Turkey's policy of opening up to Africa and its strategic partnership with the African Union, which was declared a decade ago, was buttressed by its deep relations with several countries on the continent, including Nigeria. Turkey has been diplomatically present in Nigeria since 1960. Historically, the Ottoman Empire enjoyed relations with the people of Nigeria long before that. We believe that such deep-rooted bonds give us the opportunity to develop unwavering cooperation in a wide range of areas. We value our relationship with Nigeria very much and will spare no effort to make sure it reaches its potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[chenna-reddy-general-manager-budget-rent-a-car]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>BRAC has a huge set up in the UAE. How do you balance the need to think strategically with the challenges of running such a logistically complex business?</h4><p>Many believe that as a General Manager, one shouldn't get too involved in the day-to-day business operations. On the contrary, I must get 'too involved' in the business because we must set strategies and if I don't understand the business, then I cannot do my duties as the leader. It is critical that leaders spend good amount of time where the actual work gets done, i.e. along with line managers. It's important to get into the guts of the business and understand the challenges. Further down the chain you go, the easier it becomes to come up with a strategy that serves your intended objectives. In this way, you always walk away with a new insight or a new opportunity. I strongly believe in monitoring instead of micro managing.</p><h4>As you suggested, having the right strategies in place is crucial. What about the competitive environment?</h4><p>The business that we are experiencing today is more volatile than ever. Technology and social media have completely changed the concept of competitive advantage. For a long time, companies could test and experiment; they could pilot a new concept or product, but they could keep it confidential. Now, whatever you do and say is almost instantly transferable to your competitors. Pricing strategies, marketing strategies, and anything you pilot immediately gets into your competitors' hands. Every company, especially in the Middle East, must be digitally sound and continuously advance toward adopting technologies because that's the only and best way to be prominent. Apart from its esteemed reputation, BRAC has many digital initiatives in the pipeline to stand out from the rest of the competition.</p><h4>How has technology changed your industry in the UAE as a whole?</h4><p>I am personally inclined to focus on the digital transformation of the business. Technology is making pricing much more transparent. Online intermediaries are all selling car rentals. Essentially, all they do is use a piece of software that makes it convenient for the consumer to shop and compare, but a substantial percentage of revenue is generated through these types of travel intermediaries. They are getting better by the hour at comparing what different car-rental companies offer. UAE Car rental industry is highly competitive, which means each company must always be on top of its game. Just relying on the company's reputation is not enough; there is a need to move forward and improve at all times. BRAC has always been customer focused, and, at present, only technology can make difference a real difference in customer service. Differentiation gets delivered faster.</p><h4>How do you feel about the company's method of leadership?</h4><p>A leadership model works well when its applied not only to one's specific talents and gifts but also areas for improvement. Important positions are held by many, but the model of leadership is not always same because it differs from person to person. In my own experience as a leader, I sought out experienced leaders who I could study in terms of the specific types of leadership methods they used to shape their own success. Along the way, I have tried many leadership methods and combined those that worked well for me to generate a combination of various styles. Since the start up stage, I have been refining my leadership method according to different situations. Anyone who aspires to be a leader must be charismatic, pacesetter, innovative, situational, and affiliative. The greatest lesson I have learned in life is that I still have a lot to learn.</p><h4>How do managers stay in touch with the rest of the organization?</h4><p>BRAC has 10 managers. Managers need to lead with an honest mindset; pride shouldn't get in the way of performance. I try to work on the attitude of an individual. Eventually, every shred of work that gets done reflects the passion and attitude of a person. If that is in track, everything falls into place. We conduct monthly “Coffee with GM" sessions with all employees, starting form cleaners and drivers to supervisors. The reporting managers of these staff members are not allowed to be present during the session. Listening to our employees not only gives us an insight of the various challenges we may have, but also opens doors to new suggestions and opportunities which we may not think of at the higher management level. The leadership of BRAC is dynamic and passionate. At the management level, we understand that if we take care of our employees, they will take care of our customers. A leader is someone who does right things and a manager is someone who does things right. So, both roles are important.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Predicted IMF Growth of 2.9%]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ayman-al-awadhi-group-managing-director-the-corporate-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess business prosperity in 2018?</h4><p>The IMF's predicted GDP growth rate for the UAE at the start of 2018 was 2.3% and toward the end of 2018, it was revised to 2.9%, showing that the market is picking up, albeit slowly. There are more prospects on the way, and Expo 2020 should add another boost to 2019. The Expo's infrastructure will attract several industries and SMEs to participate building country pavilions and museum projects in the region. 2019 will be a year of engagement in these projects, specifically supply chain projects. The oil price has been picking up, which is another positive sign. There is still, however, some fear of another drop with the recent OPEC meetings and other speculations. Nonetheless, we will see confidence returning to the market with the recent price stabilization. We are attached to the global market, and there is little to nothing that we can do to control it. We can only understand what is going on and adapt to certain trends and policies to boost our economic state and potential, but we mainly remain positive.</p><h4>Which sectors are currently exhibiting the most growth and potential?</h4><p>Looking at the nature of the FDI that we have brought in 2018, there have been many inquiries and initial set ups regarding IoT and AI. I am just returning from South Korea, where there was numerous discussions among startups in the area of AI solutions, IoT, and smart cities. Most of the companies see the need for such discussions. They keep a close eye on the GCC and more specifically the UAE, looking for the right moment to penetrate the market and establish their footprints. We are helping them to bridge the gap to bring those solutions for key players and startups seeking to expand in the global market. The UAE, like Tokyo, is a testing ground for simulations of AI and other intelligent robotic solutions.</p><h4>How is increasing AI and digitalization effecting business operations in Dubai? </h4><p>Such developments will be subject to the development of regulations. Many current business activities need to further unpack these technologies and the possible approval processes. We will be more engaged in the future as we bring more of these businesses and new technologies to the region; more governance is definitely required. The country is new to this, so I can see the culture and life cycle. With my recent visit to South Korea, I witnessed the lifestyle and engagement with AI, IoT, and smart things. This is because of their adaptation, which has undergone certain regulatory conditions over the years. Similarly, regulations need to be introduced in the UAE so that these new digital practices can become a part of everyday life, be it personal or in business engagement. Recently, I made another similar trip to Slush in Helsinki, organized by the Ministry of Economy of the UAE where 40 delegate members, including inventors, startups, and other groups from the public and private sectors gathered to discuss future technologies. One highlight from that trip was Finland, which is highly advanced in terms of technology and the startup ecosystem. We even visited Marina 01, an inspiring project that converted a 200-year-old hospital into a total ecosystem to provide assistance and support to startups. Globally, The Corporate Group is linking with the most advanced countries to build classrooms for startups as part of an entire ecosystem. We want to attract such parties to come to the UAE to see how we can incubate them, allowing for commercial growth in the UAE.</p><h4>What are The Corporate Group's main objectives for 2019?</h4><p>We are going to invest in our resources, infrastructure, and capabilities to deliver a real ecosystem and platform to further support startups. We recently did a JV with a UK-based company, Evolution CBS. The objective of the JV is to conduct business valuation, mentoring, coaching, and exit services. This gives us an end-to-end platform from businesses incubating all the way to an exit strategy and selling their company. We are now in full control of the equation and journey of a startup or commercial entity with a key approach on adding value. In the future, the company needs to pursue more JVs with commercial entities that will add value to our platform. One of our goals is to develop a one-stop shop environment to serve both commercial entities and the growing startup community that we are attracting. We will continue to team up with startup mentors and coaches who possess the know-how of how to further run and develop startups.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements and milestones for Barwa Bank in the past year?</h4><p>Barwa Bank has been in the market for more than a decade, having developed from a start-up phase into a mature organization that has consistently gained market share while increasing its asset base, client portfolio, and product offerings. In the last financial year ending December 31, 2018, we are proud to have realized a net profit of QAR765 million and our total assets exceed QAR44 billion mark. The Government is Barwa Bank's largest shareholder, and, in line with the nation's ambitious economic diversification plans, we are focused on meeting requirements of the local economy, namely assisting Government-related entities, Corporates, SMEs, Private and Retail banking clients, with their ever evolving banking needs.</p><h4>How is Barwa Bank innovating through its digital services?</h4><p>As a young, innovative, and flexible financial institution, it is natural for us to be tech savvy. The Group's positive financial results come in line with its commitment to improve the products and services provided to customers and to benefit from the rapid development of technologies that provide the greatest flexibility and ease of transactions, while aiming to deliver distinguished Shari'ah compliant services equivalent to international standards. Our corporate internet banking enables secure access anywhere in the world. Its features include sophisticated access controls to restrict viewing of accounts and/or making and approving transactions, storing beneficiary details for future use and to save re-keying, making local and international payments, as well as applying for documentary credits and a full range of contractors' bonds. On another front, our SMS Banking is designed to keep customers up-to-date with their finances with instant alerts to their mobile phones. In addition, we have launched our all-new mobile banking application in the 1st quarter of this year that aims to simplify their banking transactions without any need to visit the branches. Customers can directly do account/card transactions, transfers, quick payment of bills  and much more. The future of banking lies in mobile and online banking and providing our customers with such accessibility comes in line with our efforts to deliver a seamless banking experience through a range of secure and convenient channels.</p><h4>Barwa Bank aspires to be one of world's leading Islamic financial services groups, and the most recommended Islamic bank in Qatar. What sets it apart as an Islamic bank?</h4><p>Islamic finance has been growing at a tremendous pace over the past few years, and this trend is likely to continue. The understanding of Islamic finance is increasing rapidly, as does its link with innovation. Barwa Bank is driven by a dedicated pursuit of excellence and innovation in our product development and services offering, founded on a grand design that challenges traditional models and bridges Shari'ah compliant principles with modern standards of conventional banking. Our creative efforts have translated into an unmatched customer-centric experience for our clients and solid financial results for our shareholders, reaffirming Barwa Bank's status in Islamic banking services in Qatar and the region. Barwa Bank brings a wide range of market-leading solutions to banking clients in Qatar built on forward-thinking strategies. Earning our reputation as the country's most progressive Shari'ah compliant service provider, we offer a diverse spectrum of banking products, such as the Faseel High Profit savings account, which offers monthly profit, and the Thara'a savings account, which offers account holders the chance to benefit from monthly cash rewards. A first for Islamic banks in Qatar, the Thara'a savings account offers customers the opportunity to win several monthly cash prizes and a chance to win a grand prize of QAR1 million biannually as well.</p><h4>How do you assess the impact of the blockade on Qatar's economy?</h4><p>The blockade was unfortunate and unexpected; however, in the day-to-day lives of people, there has been an negligible impact only. A positive outcome of the blockade can be seen in the new sectors that have emerged up, covering food security, warehousing, ports and logistics. The blockade has enabled local SMEs to claim a larger role in agribusiness, F&amp;B, basic commodities, light industries, and the medical sectors. Qatar has demonstrated to the world that it does not politicize trade, which has been a catalyst for FDI, tourism, foreign ownership, and the equity markets. Essentially, it has moved the wheel faster in terms of Qatar's strategy to diversify away from the hydrocarbon sector. On the financial side, the results speak for themselves. Qatar's banking system remained healthy with ample liquidity, high asset quality and strong capitalization, although external pressure prevails. Barwa Bank in particular had a solid financial performance in both 2017 and 2018. Today, we are very much prepared to support the public and private sector diversification initiatives, backed by Qatar's robust and dynamic economy. We continue to provide support to foreign companies based in Qatar and entities looking to do business in Qatar.</p><h4>What are the most interesting investment opportunities in Qatar for international investors in the coming year?</h4><p>First, the equity market is solid, with many state-owned and state-backed companies that are liquid and valued competitively. The Qatar stock market is among the highest yielding in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Moreover, hydrocarbons have fueled the development of Qatar and will continue to do so in the future. In addition, the contracting sector will benefit from the major infrastructure expenditure taking place in Qatar. Another sector that is poised for growth is services. These sectors can all benefit from the expertise of foreign partners, who will be warmly received and will have a successful venture in Qatar.</p><h4>What value will Barwa Bank and ibq merger bring to Qatar's banking sector?</h4><p>Our board of directors and shareholders have approved the merger between Barwa Bank and ibq. This is a positive sign for the Qatari market, where intense competition has affected profitability of the banks. The merger will rebalance the Qatari banking sector, as it will create a leading Shari'ah compliant financial institution with a solid financial position and robust liquidity. The combined assets of both banks are around QAR 80 billion, with shareholders' equity of about QAR 12 billion based on 31 December 2018 financial results. The merger will result in a large entity that will have a 6% share of Qatar's overall banking market and makes Barwa Bank and ibq more competitive to tap into big-ticket projects. Furthermore, the new entity will have a diverse financing and depositor's profile, diversifying risk and strengthening the business proposition of the combined entity, given the individual segmental strengths of Barwa Bank and ibq.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see Qnbn's role in the realization of Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>Qnbn successfully deliver on its mandate and vision by providing a nationwide shareable network. Qnbn has enabled Qatar with a highly secure and unlimited bandwidth telecom infrastructure. Qnbn has increased the affordability of FTTh networks in the country and has also shortened the time to market in government preparation to offer smart services. Today, we cover 93 geographic zones in Qatar. Our network covers all major government and commercial buildings in the country. In addition, Qnbn's network is designed to help telecom service providers access all major Doha areas so that the country as a whole could benefit by having choice of service providers. As part of the strategy, Qnbn has been working closely with the government to identify an umbrella program called the Unified Government Network (UGN), which provides the infrastructure and fiber optics for all government departments to avoid any duplication of networks. We provide high-speed connectivity that allows users to run any application needed for smart government services and solutions. In addition, we can provide the entire infrastructure for special events, such as the 2022 FIFA World Cup. We are working with the government to fulfill all necessary requirement s to make Doha a smart city and Qatar, a smart nation. The fundamentals of all smart concepts today starts with the infrastructure. If we have fiber optics and high-speed infrastructure, it is easy to deploy and adopt smart solutions. That is why, Qnbn has focused on infrastructure deployment in Doha to provide smart solutions to all its citizens and for all the services including the World Cup 2022.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the competitiveness of Qatar when it comes to its broadband infrastructure?</h4><p>There are two networks in Qatar today. One belongs to Ooredoo, which provides all its services based on that network. Qnbn provides the other network for all other operators to create a great environment for competition to meet the needs of the government and avoid any duplication from overlapping networks. Qnbn has led the country in saving significant amounts of capex by avoiding the duplication of infrastructure and civil engineering works.</p><h4>What benefits will the next generation fiber optics network bring to businesses and people of Qatar?</h4><p>After installing the next generation fiber-optic infrastructure, we hope to have the ability to deliver to our customers the smart solutions and applications that may arise in the future. Qnbn's investment in the infrastructure today will enable the country to leverage smart solutions and applications that can help diversify Qatar's economy. These infrastructure improvements currently contribute 3.5-4% to our GDP, and our goal is for this figure to grow to 5-6% in the future.</p><h4>How do you see Qnbn's role in creating a level playing field for operators in Qatar?</h4><p>We do not compete with operators, but provide them with the infrastructure, which is the passive layer in this ICT equation. We want operators to compete based on their solutions and services. We proactively design our network to avoid duplication of network for all our customers. Given Qnbn's existing infrastructure, a new operator and/or an ISP can shorten time to market and focus on smart and customer-centric services, rather than investing time in developing their own network. This has helped the country in developing a “plug and play“ telecom model. The best way for operators to compete is via quality and services, and not by forcing prices down.</p><h4>How do you assess the progress that has been made with Qatar's digitization agenda?</h4><p>The achievements to date have been great. Qnbn is monitoring the usage of digitization between government ministries and in private sector companies and SMEs, and subsequently tries to give the necessary support. We support smaller companies to shift to smarter solutions and to use digital technology in general. There are some smart services application packages available, and there are programs coming from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to help SMEs. Qnbn provides whatever is needed in terms of the infrastructure. The percentage of SMEs in Qatar's economy is growing steadily.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the blockade on Qatar's ICT sector?</h4><p>As a company, we did not feel the effects because within the first 48 hours we secured all the raw materials and spare parts we needed for our network. We continued without any delay in our projects. Our projects today are performing even better than before because our teams have excellent external channels that allow us to continue our work without a break. There were certain ICT commitments within the GCC that were affected by the blockade on some occasions, though there were no major ICT projects going on within the GCC. We have numerous projects for smart solutions going on in Qatar now and have set a high benchmark to implement the smart city concept in Qatar.</p><h4>The blockade has been a support to the idea that Qatar should be more self-sufficient. How do you see your own role in this regard?</h4><p>Our first focus in this regard is to provide a secure network for the public sector. This will truly help the country with its vision for greater self-sufficiency. We have been well-organized in this task and have been integrating more ministries under the same secure network with high standards of cybersecurity and stability. This makes Qatar more confident in its ability to deal with any attacks because we are ready with the infrastructure and the systems.</p><h4>What are your outlook and main objectives for 2019?</h4><p>Through providing smart city concepts for the country and smart solutions and systems for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and Vision 2030, our role in Qatar in the coming year is critical. We are ready for any events coming up in the future and are able to provide the level of protection needed to ensure the public sector's ICT security. We are also working to improve the services we provide to upcoming government projects and systems. Our goal is to provide a secure and stable ICT environment in Qatar that is able to host all kinds of business and events. Although the World Cup is only on for a short time, we are looking at the businesses that might emerge for Qatar subsequently. We will ensure the continuity of business after the World Cup and see how we can engage more with international players who want to make investments and do business in Qatar. We want to use our current situation to our advantage as a country and provide the best environment for business so that international companies can use Qatar as a hub.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current state of the sector?</h4><p>2018 was a great year for us. Our company exceed the goals for the year. There is a great deal of uncertainty for 2019 because of the fiscal situation in the country. The government has many projects in the pipeline, and we are optimistic that 2019 will be a great year for the sector. We have many ongoing and future projects and a solid pipeline of projects.</p><h4>What main infrastructure projects will be developed, and where can the private sector collaborate?</h4><p>There are many projects in the infrastructure sector, such as roads and bridges. In our sector, there are hospitals and some other projects, and the government has to work on the situation. With the fiscal situation, the private sector is the one that is initiating projects. In the commercial sector, private companies need to be careful as well because there are many projects. There is always an opportunity in housing.</p><h4>What are the main priorities for today?</h4><p>Our biggest priority is to sustain growth and overcome the size limitations of the Costa Rican market. We have offices in Nicaragua, and the situation there is difficult currently. We have plans to look overseas and open an office in another country in two or three years; however, we are focusing on our local projects such as the airport expansion and new congress building, as well as a factory for Coca-Cola.</p><h4>How is EDICA positioned in terms of market share, as well as public perception?</h4><p>Market share is hard to say, because there is a great deal of informality in the sector. Taking into account everything, we are at 4-5%. We do not participate in every project. In terms of public perception, there is no other construction company in the country that has more years of experience in what we do, not including infrastructure. In 61 years, we have not deliver a project late or gone to court with a client. In a small market like Costa Rica, this is important, because everyone knows everyone. We have repeat customers with whom we negotiate directly. This is our main advantage: our name and our brand.</p><h4>What does it mean to be a part of every Costa Rican's life?</h4><p>Sometimes when we present the company, people say they did not know we built the children's hospital or all the phases of the airport. It is an ongoing effort to be everywhere and get involved. This is something for which there is a great deal of opportunity. We have a social responsibility program, and in 2018 we worked on housing projects for the poor in partnership with other companies. We also have health initiatives and a program where we donate scholarships related to our work in the sector. We try to do a major social responsibility project and two or three smaller projects every year. In terms of our employees, we have plans and scholarships to help people develop within the company.</p><h4>What roles do your certifications play when presenting yourself for a possible partnership?</h4><p>It is extremely important because the sector is all about standards. We have 1,200 workers here, not including sub-contractors, and 25 different workstations. Certifications give us standards all over the company. It gives our customers peace of mind to know that everything we do is documented and according to standard processes and our certifications are renewed every year. It gives us not just periodic updates on what we are doing but also greater confidence. We do all of our projects the same way and follow the same procedures.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans?</h4><p>We are still defining our plans, though our plans include finding a local partner. In South America, projects are much bigger than what we do here. When we went to Nicaragua, we did it by ourselves with no local partner. If we decide to enter South America, our intention is to find a local partner.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[2018: Year of Change]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-abdelmajid-a-al-rahamneh-chairman-jordan-free-development-zones-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key achievements of JFDZ over the last year?</h4><p>2018 was the year of a change in enhancing Jordan's free and development zones with a future-oriented outlook. One of our main achievements was the completion of the infrastructure work of the new Airport Free Zone in preparation for its official launch in early 2019. JFDZ won a global bid to host the Middle East Regional Office for World Free Zones Organisation with a view of promoting the pioneering experience and the well-recognized role of the Jordanian free zones in the region promoting world free zones best practices. Looking at development zones, we finalized the necessary infrastructure to launch the Dead Sea Corniche also in early 2019. The Dead Sea Corniche is a dynamic mixed-use neighborhood of hotels, residences, shops, restaurants, and public open spaces at the northern Dead Sea shore. The Ajloun Teleferik bid was launched in 2018 to be implemented in 2019. Both the Dead Sea Corniche and Ajloun Teleferik are expected to enhance the tourism experience, attract local and foreign visitors and investors, as well as provide job opportunities for the local communities. In terms of performance, the occupancy rate of public free zones—Zarqa, Sahab, Mowaqa, Airport, Kerak, and Karamah—registered an average of 84%. In 2017, public free zone imports totaled JOD2.5 billion (USD3.52 billion), while exports registered JOD2.8 billion (USD3.94 billion) for total trade volume of JOD5.3 billion (USD7.47 billion). The total amount of investment in the 37 registered private free zones reached JOD693 million (USD977 million), of which JOD325 million, or nearly 47%, was Jordanian investments, while the total trade of private free zones registered JOD1.3 billion. As for the development zones, JFDZ attracts a wide spectrum of Jordanian, regional, and international investors. The value of investments based on the signed development agreements for developing the Dead Sea Development Zone reached JOD1 billion, providing around 6,000 hotel rooms and no less than 7,500 direct job opportunities in the coming five years.</p><h4>What is the strategic importance of the new free zone at Queen Alia International Airport for Jordan?</h4><p>The establishment of the new Airport Free Zone ties into the government's plans to enhance the investment climate in Jordan with the objective of providing a full package of logistics and re-export facilities. The newly established free zone covers 1 million sqm of developed lands, offering world-class infrastructure and a lucrative business environment with administrative and logistics support services. The Airport Free Zone enjoys a vital location, given Jordan's strategic positioning in the heart of the Middle East and the zone's direct access to air cargo services and easy access to major road connections. We are introducing a new model of free zones in Jordan and the Middle East based on competitive advantages and attracting quality investments. The competitive advantage of Queen Alia International Airport Free Zone lies in being a logistics hub for import and re-exports through offering streamlined business operating environment for investors and business owners, as well as providing fiscal and financial incentives, electronic services for transactions, and top-notch free zone facilities and infrastructure networks. Additionally, the zone will provide an unparalleled access to regional and international markets.</p><h4>What are the targeted investment activities and sectors for the new Airport Free Zone?</h4><p>The targeted economic activities for the new Airport Free Zone include logistic storage, refrigerated storage, medicines and medical supplies, consumables, precious materials, and heavy goods (timber and spare parts and plastic products) for the commercial sector. As such, the targeted industrial investments will include chemical industries, food, beverage and tobacco, wood industry, machinery and electrical equipment industry, and precious materials industry. In terms of markets, the current investment interests are diversified from the Middle East and GCC countries as well as global investors from the US, Europe, India, and China.</p><h4>What are JFDZ's investment opportunities at Free and Development Zones?</h4><p>In order to upgrade Jordan's capabilities as a regional center of re-export, JFDZ is responsible for the development and management of public free zones to develop unique export processing zones and provide more opportunities for both local and foreign investors. The new Airport Free Zone is a great example of our strategy to expand our free zone investment opportunities. This zone represents a new concept of modern free zones providing commercial, industrial and logistic spaces, and introducing smart solutions in a business-friendly environment. JFDZ offers a set of lucrative investment opportunities at the free zones with more diversified investment units at the new Airport Free Zone based on a one stop base services. These investment units include multiple options such as developed investment and commercial units for lease or rent, hangars ready for lease, hangars ready for sale on leased land, and logistic services offices. Additionally, the newly established Airport Free Zone will offer a business park aiming to attract global companies' regional offices, offshore offices, and management offices as well as services for software export, financial consulting, engineering consulting, and training. At the development zones, different and vital investment opportunities are recently launched at the Dead Sea Development Zone ranging from large scale developments to medium and small size tourism projects development. The current prime investment opportunities for the Dead Sea Development Zone are located within the eastern shore and the Corniche. The Dead Sea Development Zone investment opportunities include four- and five-star hotels, resorts, and spas; three-star hotels and boutique hotels; retail and mixed-use developments; and eco-lodges, medical rehabilitation centers, conference centers, and other attractions. Ajloun Development Zone's Sawan site seeks to boost touristic development in Ajloun as the first and largest of its type with much appeal on the local and regional level. The project aims at initiating development with a wide range of activities that include a convention center, hotels, restaurants, cafes, and activities serving the wide range of tourists attracted to the area's natural, cultural, and historical offerings.</p><h4>What are the main challenges and opportunities for JFDZ?</h4><p>The major challenge facing Jordan remains to refresh the economy and address the high unemployment rate in the context of a challenging external environment. Regional developments, most especially the Syria and Iraq crises, have resulted in the unprecedented refugee influx, disrupted trade routes, and lower investments and tourism inflows. Continued regional uncertainty and reduced external assistance will continue to put pressure on Jordan. Despite these challenges, Jordan has remained peaceful and maintained continuous security and modernization. Investor confidence in our economy, political stability, excellent international relations, and cost-competitiveness has produced a solid ground for investment. All these efforts have contributed to a momentum of growth and development. The role of JFDZ is to support the government in transforming these challenges into opportunities moving forward. In order to achieve accelerated, export-led growth, Jordan needs to improve its primary infrastructure and the efficiency and effectiveness of public- and private-sector investments. More progress is essential so that reforms aimed at enhancing the investment climate and ease of doing business can lead to tangible outcomes. The introduction of further economic, financial, and legal reforms, and streamlined business practices across every sector to attract innovation and capital is needed. It is critical to continue implementation of key growth-enhancing reforms to reduce the sensitivity to external shocks and help revive the economy. It is important, as well, to create conditions for increased private investment and improved competitiveness to stimulate job-creating growth. As for the free and development zones, our strategy aims to support the national economy through increasing the total investment volume and revenues, while enabling free and development zones as an optimal choice for investment and creating regional investment destinations. We aim to upgrade the level of infrastructure services and operational efficiency of free zones and strengthen security and inventory control. Lifting up the level of the institutional performance and quality of provided services are priorities for JFDZ, thus increasing the level of satisfaction of our clients and investors. JFDZ will continue promoting Jordan's free and development zones as global investment destinations through diverse promotion channels targeting world-class investors as well as tourism and property developers and operators of unique services that will enhance the zones' appeal and long-term development potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[AED350 million in Subsidies for SMEs]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[abdul-baset-al-janahi-ceo-dubai-sme]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the milestones of Dubai SME?</h4><p>One milestone was being able to bring our agenda of support and assistance to the SME sector to the highest level, meaning increasing the salience of SMEs across the vision and strategies guiding development in Dubai and the UAE. Having the support from the top allowed us to create an effective ecosystem to work in. Establishing a high-level macro policy for SME development has also been a great achievement for us. After the establishment of Dubai SME, every other Emirate has emulated our actions with their own terms and needs. The direct injection of AED350 million (USD95.37million) in subsidies to SMEs that we support is a remarkable figure that also represents our success as an organization. Pre-2002, Emirati graduates largely opted for employment and support, or guidance, for entrepreneurs and start-ups was inadequate. Since 2002, the option to create one's own job and business has emerged. There were major gaps in the market when we started, and we had to create access to start-up finance, incubators, government projects, and subsidies as well as full legal support.</p><h4>How do you support Emirati SMEs in expanding their businesses globally?</h4><p>Internationalization requires different steps. We support businesses, from home start-ups up to businesses valued AED250 million (USD68.12million). If they have domestic products, they will focus on the UAE market. The more ambitious entrepreneurs build their idea globally from the onset. The best place for such people is Dubai because of our connectivity. Dubai facilitates global connectivity in a myriad of ways, such as direct flights to all over the world. Within the ecosystem of the Department of Economic Development and Dubai SME, we also have Dubai Exports. We train businesses to a certain level and competency where they are able to export effectively. We then link them to Dubai Exports, which brings them to international markets.</p><h4>What types of SMEs in Dubai are currently exhibiting the most growth?</h4><p>Currently, the technology and services sectors show the most growth and potential for the near future. However, Dubai is a melting pot and the most vibrant city in the region. The best talent across all sectors come here for their start-ups and use Dubai as a base to develop into other markets. When it comes to women, we have a strong base of female entrepreneurs who have successfully established themselves; however, the system we have created is not gender specific. We offer the exact same support and opportunities. Women are often more committed, especially when it comes to finance and payments. Today, 35% of our portfolio is women, and this is expected to grow.</p><h4>What are the challenges in the market?</h4><p>The biggest challenge is the structural change in the economy. VAT has completely changed the way people operate in 2018. Adjusting to the change is challenging for SMEs, the government, workers, and all other institutions, and companies. It is a painful period of structural economic change, in addition to the geopolitical environment. Access to finance is not always easy for certain business sizes because of the banking sector's reluctance to give loans. Banks need to scale up their operations, training, and knowledge of SME finance. This is why we encourage businesses to use SME-related fintech to locate funds. The Mohammed Bin Rashid Fund (MBRF) under Dubai SME has also expanded its partnership with peer-to-peer lending platform Beehive to facilitate funding for our member SMEs. There is huge potential here, and we should not shy away from future opportunities. SMEs constitute 99.2% of the registered businesses in Dubai and employ 52.4% of Dubai's workforce. Within these challenges lie great opportunities. The market is truly suited to sellers, and now is the best time for the entrepreneurs in Dubai to set the tone.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[70% Carbon Reduction by 2030]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[miguel-bolinaga-president-aes-panama]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about the results that the five power generation plants have had in Panama?</h4><p>We have seven power plants in Panama. In 2018, we had 777MW installed in Panama, with 705MW based on hydroelectricity. Five of the hydro plants are in Bayano, La Estrella, Los Valles, Esti, and Changuinola, additionally we have a bunker-based barge. In 2015, we won a tender with the distributors to deliver, starting in September 2018, of the first natural gas-based power plant in Panama and Central America. Another 381MW plant was ready on time. From then until now, that plant has generated at maximum capacity, generating power 24/7 over the summer. This is good because hydroelectric plants don't produce much energy in the summer. With more diverse energy sources, you can have a much more flexible energy market for Panamanians. This new plant allows you to fill the capacity gaps in the national grid.</p><h4>What are the strategies to reinforce the fact that you're producing more than 24% of energy for the country? </h4><p>The plant we made generates 381MW, and this is treated in turn with another plant from us, with a terminal that is based on liquefied natural gas and has the capacity to receive ships up to 160,000 cubic meters and a storage tank of 180,000 cubic meters, this tank only uses 25% for this plant and the remaining 75% we see it positively so that it enters into other development issues within the country. Additionally, we see that natural gas will contribute to sectors such as transport. In the industry today, all that work with boiler-based, refrigeration-based, diesel fuels, all can be switched to natural gas, this makes the industry much more efficient. Our plant that does not only work with generation for electrical energy but also will touch these elements that are important. Regarding bunkering, we're there at the door of the Panama Canal and the terminal has the capacity to receive and deliver from 3,000 to 160,000 cubic meters. In fact, we also see everything that has to do with transport, trucks and tanks; it can be done with natural gas. Gas pipelines or barges that can take liquified natural gas (LNG) not only to the country but also to other ports in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica can also be made later.</p><h4>How are you planning to achieve your medium- and long-term vision?</h4><p>We are developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project with Bahia Investment Group. In this project, we put around 37% equity of both companies, over 200 million for each one. The goal is to have the financial muscle for the other 67%. To do this, we have different multilaterals such as the IFC, the BCIE and local banking such as Bancolombia and Banco General. Finally, the different institutions and agencies of the state must also be aligned so that they can support the project to be developed in the time needed by the country. The main stakeholders of this project are the banks, the partners, the state and the communities surrounding the project. The community is an important factor, which is why we started about 10 different social projects. We wanted the community to grow through education and training, while providing funds for so the microenterprise could work and grow.</p><h4>Could you talk about the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 2030? </h4><p>By 2030, there is a clear goal of reducing carbon emissions by up to 70%. That's not easy, especially when you have a company like AES that has been working in other countries with coal plants. But the decision was made at the corporate level that we would be leaving these coal plants to replace them through renewable, batteries technology, distributed generation and natural gas, depending on what can be applied in each country. In Panama, we chose gas because we saw that it was making the force to have a much more mature energy matrix. However, that does not mean that we are not going to grow here with other renewable energies. We are seeing several projects for 2019 and 2020, around 50 and 70MW of solar energy.</p><h4>What are the latest initiatives that are affecting the social development of the country?</h4><p>We have programs around the communities where we're working, for example in Changuinola we have given more than USD89 million in social action in the form of construction of aqueducts, schools, construction of four medical dispensaries, four houses of prayer and training for the people of the community over the course of 12 years. Also, we have a hydro-biological center where we are reproducing fish that can be placed in the reservoirs behind dams. They can be part of the economy of the community. We're always aware of the communities where we operate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[3rd Largest Desalination Plant in Saudi Arabia]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jesus-sancho-managing-director-middle-east-acciona]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ACCIONA Agua, leading a consortium with partners Marubeni Corporation, Abdul Latif Jameel-CDC and Rawafid Alhadarah, recently won the project to build the new Shuqaiq 3 desalination plant on the Red Sea. Could you tell us more about this project and your involvement?</h4><p>ACCIONA Agua is delighted to be awarded with this relevant desalination plant by the Saudi Water Partnership Company (SWPC) and along with our top-tier co-developers. This is a key project for Saudi Arabia as part of the Vision 2030 program. The project is a very large (450MLD or 100MIGD) seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination facility launched by the SWPC as an Independent Water Project (IWP) to develop, design, build, operate, and maintain the plant for a period of 25 years. The marine works, the SWRO plant, a 380Kv electrical substation, a high voltage overhead transmission line, the product water tanks and the connection with a nearby pumping station comprise it. The goal is to provide potable water to the city of Abha. ACCIONA Agua is very committed to best serve the country in its quest for the National Transformation Program and we are proud to be part of the second largest SWRO plant under a PPP scheme and the third largest single facility of its kind in Saudi Arabia. Our Company is already mobilizing on the site and starting the works to reach our target.</p><h4>ACCIONA Industrial and ACCIONA Ingenierí­a also have permanent facilities in the Kingdom, while ACCIONA Energí­a has agreements with local investment funds for renewable energy projects and with additional presence of ACCIONA Construcción. Could you tell us more about your current set-up in Saudi Arabia, and your primary expertise?</h4><p>ACCIONA has several permanent establishments here in the last five years. We have offices in Riyadh and Jeddah from where we are attending the Saudi market. ACCIONA is a worldwide developer of infrastructure, be it transportation, water treatment, renewable and conventional power, or hydraulic energy. We are also experts in those public services that can improve the quality of life of those countries and cities where we operate. We aim to replicate the success achieved in more than 30 countries in the KSA and in as many verticals as possible. This is the reason why we have decided to have a permanent a long-lasting presence in the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia is the largest market in the GCC and we are eager to participate in any exciting projects such as NEOM, Qiddiyah, Red Sea Project. and the other main ones envisioned by the Saudi leaders. Our expertise is in the development of complex infrastructure and to participate in the whole value-chain from A to Z. We strive to improve through value-engineering and optimization in the design at any project that we work on based on our more than 75 years of experience in this field and highly qualified team of professionals.</p><h4>What do you anticipate to be the potential of renewable energy in the Kingdom, what options do you consider most feasible, and how can ACCIONA support the Vision 2030 objectives to bring more renewables into the energy mix?</h4><p>ACCIONA sees great potential for our Company concerning renewable energy projects in Saudi Arabia The Renewable Energy Project Development Office (REPDO) within the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources (MEIM) was established to deliver on the goals of the National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) in line with Vision 2030. REPDO and MEIM have recently launched Expressions of Interest (EOIs) for seven solar PV projects with a combined generation capacity of 1.51GW during the launch of the National Industrial Development and Industrials Program (NIDLP). The announcement represents the next phase in Saudi Arabia's ambitious renewable energy plans, which seek to achieve over 25GW of wind and solar power generation in the next five years, and close to 60GW over the next decade; of which 40GW will be generated from solar energy, with a further 16GW of onshore wind. The Kingdom aims to create over the next decade a global hub of renewable energy capability upwards of 200GW, spanning the entire value chain from local manufacturing to project development, domestically and abroad. These impressive figures are the reason why ACCIONA is definitively going to be a key player here.</p><h4>Given the sheer size, output and reserves, the petroleum industry is still the bread-and- butter of the Saudi economy. From your perspective, how can this raw material wealth be utilized to drive the economic diversification in the Kingdom?</h4><p>An oil price boom from 2003 to 2013 fueled rising prosperity in Saudi Arabia, which became the world's 19th-largest economy. However, the Kingdom should no longer grow based only on oil revenue and public spending. The present ever changing global energy market and a demographic transition will lead to a bulge in the number of working-age Saudis by 2030. A deep transformation of the economy based on higher productivity could enable Saudi Arabia to again double its GDP and create as many as six million new Saudi jobs by 2030. Eight sectors are envisioned under the National Transformation Program (NTP) to have the potential to generate more than 60% of this growth opportunity: mining and metals, petrochemicals, manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, tourism and hospitality, healthcare, finance, and construction. All stakeholders, including the private sector, foreign investors, including ACCIONA, and households, will need to be involved in this transformation to make it a success.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and ambitions for the coming year?</h4><p>ACCIONA seeks a continuously growing business in the GCC for 2019 and 2020. We are primarily focusing in the KSA and the UAE but we will also dedicate special attention and resources to the rest of the GCC countries and Jordan. We are eyeing upcoming opportunities announced in the railway network across the GCC as well as some specialized utility projects such as Waste-To-Energy (W2E) or Pumped Storage Projects (PSP) or “water lifting" where we believe that can add great value to the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Our key mechanisms are events, marketing, roundtables and our Community of Interest (COI) programs. CBC events include informative business seminars, the Ambassador's receptions for Canadian business delegations, community galas and socials. More recently, member organizations have turned to CBC for business advice, advocacy, digital marketing across borders, and access to exclusive roundtables with visiting Canadian organizations. For example, we recently hosted a roundtable for a leading Canadian organization to meet with UAE-based experts to discuss healthcare, youth and education. We also significantly expanded our marketing outreach through a combination of improved online presence, social media, newsletters, email lists, and strategic partnerships. For instance, we entered into strategic partnerships with the organizers of leading conferences such as Global Aerospace Summit, Global Space Congress, and Abu Dhabi International Exhibition &amp; Conference (ADIPEC). Such exposure has benefited our corporate members, which include iconic Canadian brands such as Bank of Montreal (BMO), SNC-Lavalin, Bombardier, PAL Aerospace, and Air Canada, and UAE brands with Canadian interests such as UE Medical, Al Amal Business Services, Apparel Group, Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) and Concorde Corodex. Our business connections and expertise, coupled with our impeccable reputation in the UAE and Canada, have enabled us to successfully use our mechanisms to promote bilateral trade and investment.</p><h4>Where do you see the greatest potential for increased trade?</h4><p>The greatest potential is in technologies and innovations where Canada has long been a world-class leader, given the UAE's continued vision to develop and adopt innovations and digital trends. Potential sectors include aerospace, energy, healthcare, clean technology, space, information technology, and artificial intelligence (AI). For example, the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UAE have recognized AI as fundamental to the fourth industrial revolution. We witness many sectors eager to explore AI and its benefits. Canada has an AI legacy with world-leading hubs in cities such as Montreal and Toronto, which attracted investment from many reputable Silicon Valley organizations such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Other significant areas include healthcare as evident through UE Medical's partnership with Canada's SickKids Hospital, energy as evident through the province of Alberta's decision to expand its trade presence in the UAE and Mubadala's multi-billion dollar investments in the Canadian energy sector, and space as evident through the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Canadian Space Agency and the UAE Space Agency. This increased bilateral relationship and trade growth is a sign of innovative Canadian technologies and capabilities, and it reflects the Canadian private sector confidence in the UAE's legal system, business practices, and stability. We project trade to further increase given such opportunities, common sectors of interest, and suitable business environment.</p><h4>How will the shared values of both Canada and the UAE serve to deepen the bilateral relationship?</h4><p>There are evident similarities between the UAE's and Canada's values, for example on tolerance and women empowerment. Canada has long been globally recognized as a leader in tolerance, with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom at its core. This is evident through examples such as its progressive immigration system, acceptance of refugees, protection of indigenous rights and the maintenance of a gender balanced cabinet with 50% women. Tolerance is also one of the UAE's core values, which has a Ministry of Tolerance and administers a National Tolerance Program. With about 200 nationalities that are resident here, the UAE themed 2019 as the Year of Tolerance with key milestones such as a Papal visit and mandating that 50% of Federal National Council (FNC) members be women. The implications of such shared values are strengthened people-to-people relationships. This makes it more attractive for Canadians to feel accepted and call the UAE home, move their families here, and make long term investments such as buying properties. Similarly, Emiratis are able to integrate within the Canadian society to study, train, and work. They then bring back knowledge and contribute towards enriching the UAE and developing its knowledge-based society.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Standard Procedure]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[fernando-vives-executive-president-garrigues]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the main activities of the firm evolved over the years?</h4><p>Our office has always been dedicated to business law, and we have always had a strong international presence. Garrigues was the first Spanish firm in the 1960s that had an office in New York. We have departments for tax, commercial, labor, procedural, and public law all focused on the market. This is evidenced by the fact that we are the leading labor and tax law firm in Spain. On the other hand, as part of our international strategy, we have always had our own offices in the countries where we operate so that we can tell our clients that when they need services in Colombia, the service they will receive will be exactly the same as in Barcelona, Bilbao, and Lima. All of these elements led us to become the largest non-English-run European law firm, with an increasingly important presence outside Spain.</p><h4>Is it your people what differentiates Garrigues from other offices?</h4><p>This office has the best people, the best teams. What distinguishes us is that we are able to approach without difficulty any operation of any industrial sector with a group of people who have wide-ranging knowledge.</p><h4>What is your expansion strategy, and the main challenges of internationalization?</h4><p>When I proposed a change of strategy, until then we had always worked on the basis of agreements with local law firms, such as strong partnerships with offices in Latin America. But if I need the “Garrigues standards" anywhere in the world, that requires the standardization of quality, service, and response to the client. There are many offices that say they have a presence in 30 countries, but in reality what they have is a franchise. The difference for us is that our offices operate exactly the same in Lima as it does in Barcelona.</p><h4>You send lawyers trained in Spain to your other offices?</h4><p>I cannot litigate before a Colombian court, so what we have done during the last five years is recruit firms or individual lawyers from other countries, the best lawyers we could find. Right now, we have 28 partners and more than 100 professionals in Latin America, specifically in five countries. Hence, they have the fundamentals of Garrigues and they have been adapting to local conditions.</p><h4>How does Garrigues stay at the forefront of technological innovations?</h4><p>It starts with having the best people to be at the forefront of technological developments at all times; this will allow a law firm to adapt to the changes that are taking place. For me, the important thing is not artificial intelligence but human intelligence. So, as long as we have the best professionals, we will be at the forefront of change. The subject of digitalization has two aspects. The first is to be able to join our clients in their digitalization processes, to know how these impact our clients' businesses. Then there is the digitalization of the law firm, how you modernize the service you provide. We are increasing training for all our people in regard to the industries and in the disruptive factors of digitalization. We have staff dedicated to startups, assuming the restrictions that exist in terms of fees, and service provision, for example. We are also on the path of the digital transformation of our traditional customers. You have to optimize productivity, because that will allow a better service to the client and that allows you to retain that client and attract new ones.</p><h4>Do you think the legal industry tends towards the in-house legal team?</h4><p>The in-house legal team will always exist. It is necessary. They do a good job, but saying that external offices will not exist is as if saying that there will not be external consultants.</p><h4>What are the main challenges and opportunities for the legal sector here in Spain for the coming years?</h4><p>The legal sector in Spain has very solid foundations, and the quality of law firms and lawyers is remarkable, if we compare it with other countries. The Brexit issue is, for example, a great challenge for the European legal sector. If Brexit takes place many things will have to be adjusted accordingly.</p><h4>What are the objectives of the office for 2019 and 2020?</h4><p>All our objectives are related to the two pivots of this office: our clients and our people. This includes promoting the interests of our customers, increasing our clientele, achieving profitable development and efficient service provision. Everything else is second to these priorities, digitalization, growth, international development. Our ultimate goal is to optimize the service we offer our clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[claudio-gonzalez-president-kimberly-clark-mexico]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the change in vision in the administration impact doing business in Mexico?</h4><p>There is no question this government will be different from any of Mexico's previous governments. We have had other transitions such as at the end of the 1990s, when the government changed parties for the first time in 70 years. The government has gone back and forth between these two parties (PRI and PAN) since then, though this election is different. It is starting to become fairly evident that the emphasis on social aspects will be significantly stronger in the new administration. That is in fact beneficial in many ways, and we are excited to see how this new program to help young people works out. We are extremely involved in it and are excited to help make it work and offer something that will contribute to creating more employment in the country; however, it is still too early to see how things will go. Also the emphasis on improving security and eliminating corruption are very big in the new government.</p><h4>In what ways will the renegotiation of NAFTA affect the economy</h4><p>We are currently concerned about how willing this new administration will be in continuing to strengthen the openness of the Mexican economy. However, the fact that the new President had the opportunity to state that he was not in favor of a new free trade agreement during the NAFTA renegotiations but did not is extremely positive and encouraging. It would be hard to imagine a growing economy that can achieve its full potential without being open, especially in the 21st century. North America is without a doubt the most competitive region in the world; it has positive demographic trends, many of the centers of technology, geography, energy, institutions, capital, water, food, and all the factors required to be successful in the 21st century. The new generation of Mexican businessmen are extremely competitive and involved. They are driving investment not only in Mexico but also in the US, Canada, and other parts of the world. There is no question this generation is significantly more competitive and attuned to what is going on in the world and what the future will be.</p><h4>What global trends is the company foreseeing to change demands for products?</h4><p>Adult care products will be the product of the future because many economies in the world are rapidly aging. Japan is the first country in the world today that sells more adult diapers than baby diapers. Advances in medicine and technology help extend people's lives from early 1980s to 1990s and even 2000s. People are also more environmentally aware and active than before, and we are helping our clients such as McDonalds reduce their carbon footprint and meet consumer needs by offering non-bleached napkins. It also no longer uses straws in its restaurants. If you do not innovate, you can't succeed. In this globalized, highly technology-oriented environment, it is not only new and better products that are required, but also different social norms and needs.</p><h4>What is your future vision for the company and expansion goals for the next year?</h4><p>We will focus on growth, growth, and growth. We still have opportunities in the markets we cover and will continue to innovate our current portfolio while actively looking for opportunities to expand it. In the last three years, Kimberly-Clark Mexico has done well in the soaps segments, which is something that no other Kimberly-Clark company has achieved in the world. We are the leader in liquid soaps in Mexico, and this sector is growing the most. Despite the challenges before us, we are very upbeat because Mexico continues to be one of the most exciting opportunities in the world. It has a large and growing middle class that participates more every day, and people are very ready to continue growing and find ways of making our country better. We have major challenges and, at the same time, major opportunities and the ability to find solutions to our problems and take advantage of these opportunities. We are multi-channel and multi-sector and offer products to both the consumer sector as well as the professional sector, namely hotels, offices, and the McDonalds of the world. We have to be in all these areas, and each one is a business opportunity. Walmart is our biggest customer by far; it is relatively bigger in Mexico than it is in the US as it has a higher proportion of the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your thoughts on the Global Business Forum Latin America — Panama 2019 and the role of this forum in connecting Dubai with Panama and the Latin America region?</h4><p>We are very pleased to be here, and we were honored to be received by the President of Panama. He has personally attended and actively participated in the event. During his visit to the Global Business Forum (GBF) on Latin America in Dubai last year, he expressed his desire to hold the next one in Panama, and here we are achieving his dream. It [GBF Latin America] has played a big role in increasing awareness and connecting our people together, creating a platform for companies to grow and do business with each other. The two cities, Panama City and Dubai, we share one common thing: we are trading hubs in our respective regions. These two key trading hubs must talk to each other. Dubai connects the Middle East with Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe and China. Panama, through the Panama Canal and Panama City, connects North and South America, including Latin America and the Caribbean, with each other and with the rest of the world. With its infrastructure and logistics, they play a similar role as Dubai. Now, the two must talk to each other to leverage our strengths and reap a greater benefit.</p><h4>Dubai and Panama City are established hubs for their respective regions. How and where can the two cities strengthen their collaboration? </h4><p>The trade between Dubai and Panama has been less than its potential. In general, Latin American countries have not been in our top 30 or 40 trade partners. How can we improve our trade with the region? Latin America has so much to give the world, but so far much of it remains untapped by Dubai. And by this I do not mean just for the Dubai market, but also in terms of connectivity through Dubai to the rest of the world, to markets in Africa, Asia, etc. We can leverage our strengths and help our respective companies to talk with each other. Dubai has excelled in the service industry. Take DP World for example. Now DP World is in Peru, Brazil, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, soon in Chile and hopefully in Panama and other Latin American countries. As a port operator, it is a region of huge untapped markets. We can do more business together.</p><h4>What role do you see technology playing in increasing trade with Latin America? How would you assess the current level of digital transformation in the logistics sector?</h4><p>Now we are in the era of technology and digital transformation. Imagine if a simple export transaction in Panama can be regarded as an import transaction in Dubai. Imagine if between the exporter in Panama and the importer in Dubai, they have access to the real time operations, what documents are flowing and at what time, etc. It's possible with technologies like block chain and artificial intelligence. On the ground, with robotics and AI and all of the benefits that technology can bring, we can create more visibility and responsiveness in our transactions. These technologies are already being adopted, but of course there is still much more room. The millennial generation will dictate the adoption of this technology. They don't want to wait and will expect instant transactions.</p><h4>What are DP World's goals or objectives in Latin America? </h4><p>We at DP World have designed a systems integration product for the port or logistics community. It is a digital platform for the stakeholders involved in the movement of cargo. All of the steps of the process, including document submission, registration, inspection, payment, and reporting, can be done digitally and via mobile devices. That is the solution that we are currently implementing in the Dominican Republic and we want to implement it in other Latin American countries, whether in Spanish or Portuguese or any language they prefer. As the growth opportunities here are huge, this region is one of our strategic priorities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your various business and social ventures developed and what has been the driver of this?</h4><p>For as long as I remember, I've held the belief that businesses have an intrinsic obligation to give back to society, in one form or another. Maybe this comes from my early influences growing up, my first choice of career as journalist, and my subsequent work in Thuraya satellite telecom company where our mandate was to bridge communities. When I helped to establish BrandMoxie in 2004, I soon began to mentor entrepreneurs because there was a need and not many resources for SMEs. I came across a significant number of Emiratis and expatriates who already had, or were interested in starting, a business, but lacked knowledge of the fundamentals. I realized that they often failed because of little things that were easy to do, or to avoid doing, but there wasn't enough awareness. I gave pro bono advice on everything from setting up a business, conducting research, identifying market opportunities, funding, designing product or service, optimizing branding and marketing, and running an operation. Very soon I was inundated by entrepreneurs who wanted time more time than I had. So, I decided to create a knowledge sharing platform that others could also contribute towards. I reached out to my friends — university professors, consultants, even competitors — to join me in delivering a monthly platform that provides advice and guidance to SMEs. In June of 2009 I set up Tamakkan, which in Arabic translates to “Empower Yourself“ to focus on three pillars: entrepreneurship, innovation and leadership, with the specific aim of providing continuity so entrepreneurs could meet, bring their questions to experts and peers, and explore ways of collaboration. Zayed University generously provided me with space to hold the monthly seminars and then I later moved the seminars to Mamoura for several years and also rotated the sessions among universities as well as my own innovation spaces at Nahyan Camp, and later at twofour54. My hope was that other entities come together into the picture to create a larger startup ecosystem that integrates training, acceleration, incubation, funding, market access and coaching. The space I rented in twofour54 was perfect, all windows, lots of light and open space. I chose modular furniture that allowed us to host diverse functions, including seminars, art exhibitions, incubation, theatre, film screenings, hackathons and challenges, music performances and more. I worked with universities, schools, business groups, the twofour54 community and other community and creative groups. In 2009 I also launched Tempo magazine to support the growth of the creative community and to inspire and engage innovators and change agents. I wanted Tempo to help spread the word on what we were trying to achieve greater social impact.</p><h4>How has the support eco-system for young entrepreneurs developed, and how do you work with universities?</h4><p>The support ecosystem for young entrepreneurs has been growing, and now there's somewhat more, but still not enough, focus at school level. However, what's really encouraging is the launch of ambitious programmes at youth and start up level. This includes StartAD at New York University and other initiatives at Zayed University, Khalifa University, Masdar with entities like Kryptolab and Catalyst, Abu Dhabi Global Market, Sandooq al Watan in addition to the recently launched Abu Dhabi Investment Office. The big news more recently is Hub71, a Mubadala, initiative, which aims to attract global caliber startups to Abu Dhabi through a robust and well-funded incubation and acceleration platform. Corporates as well as government entities like ADNOC and the UAE Space Agency are also jumping into the innovation space. I am excited about my role as innovation consultant for Abu Dhabi Municipality where I helped launch a new initiative called Innovation Nation that is intended to act as a catalyst for partners to explore and participate in Nextgen Abu Dhabi growth areas like smart cities, sustainability, community, and happiness. There's definitely a lot of great ideas and tremendous excitement from all the stakeholders. However, the challenge now is to put all the pieces together so that we are not competing with each other, but rather complementing and leveraging off each other to achieve rapid and focused results. What's promising is that all the players are now starting to seek each other out to collaborate to create greater value. I launched another community platform, the Smovies short film competition challenge, in 2014, through a strategic partnership with VOX Cinemas, to help nurture emerging filmmakers and provide a platform to recognize new talent. We've already run seven competitions and are now launching a challenge on Climate Change that is focused on creating a multi-language repository of one-minute films on solutions and ideas to fight climate change. The idea is to create grass-roots content to activate community action on this side of the planet as it seems considerably less informed of the looming environmental changes which will affect our whole world. Across all three platforms, I have always worked closely with Zayed University, New York University, the Higher Colleges of Technology, Sorbonne University, Abu Dhabi University, Emirates College of Technology, and in the past also organized seminars with the University of Wollongong, Boston University, INSEAD, IMT, Franklin Covey and others. I occasionally give seminars and workshops at universities, schools and corporate events on entrepreneurship, innovation, women's empowerment and creating social impact through grass roots initiatives.</p><h4>In what ways can entrepreneurship serve as a vehicle for empowerment and social cohesion? </h4><p>We are witnessing rapid changes that are transforming our world. I'm happy to see growing recognition in the UAE and the region, of the importance of nurturing startups and creating environments that are conducive to the growth of SMEs. We know that SMEs are the backbone of strong and vibrant economies that can substantially contribute to national development because small businesses and startups take much needed risks to innovate and introduce new products and services to the market. We also know that there are sweeping changes globally in the way services are being delivered and the way they are being satisfied by the growing gig economy. I believe it is important that young Emiratis are prepared for this radical shift in the global business climate, and that they are adequately upskilled to be able to work as freelancers and independent contractors. They need to be prepared to operate in a competitive, highly dynamic environment of cross-border entrepreneurs and globalized online markets. We are already seeing that the rise of artificial intelligence is facilitating the growth of the gig economy and that this steep paradigm shift will see the most prepared of us survive and thrive in the new economy. Institutionally businesses can become more innovative; integrating “intrapreneurship“ in the way they work by adopting a more entrepreneurial mindset that is typically associated with SMEs. Yet, unfortunately, many public and private institutions are too overgrown and unwieldy, and not equipped to change. It is these entities that will suffer most in the new economy. What is becoming fashionable these days is for institutions to set up gleaming “innovation spaces“ as a way to become more innovative. But they will find that the mere existence of space is not enough and that what they need is systematic initiatives that include co-working, co-sharing, co-learning, incubation, acceleration, challenges, hackathons and more. This will ensure that new ideas are born, tested, launched, and allowed to flourish. In the Arab world we should also accept that failure is part of the learning journey, and that we must not punish those SMEs that don't succeed. We need to apply future foresight tools to predict what the UAE will need in order to thrive in the future. We also need to develop optimized Nextgen spaces that will be the innovation hubs of the future. When I look at the new work space concepts being created in the New York I am encouraged that there are successful models breaking through. These creative communities are dynamic, creative and fun, and manage to bring people together to work, learn and collaborate. What I think we'll see more of in the future is that spaces will start to skew towards specific themes and industries such as fintech, fashion, hospitality clusters. With millennials' changing lifestyles, I believe these spaces will increasingly also begin to integrate more livability options such as retail, accommodation, health activities and entertainment. Most interesting about this new urban phenomenon is that these multi-use spaces are being defined not by traditional urban planners but by the way startups and freelancers work.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the current state of the sector?</h4><p>All companies in the IT sector are on the path to digital transformation. Every operator has to provide the final consumer with what they need. Telecable is focused on the end user in the residential and corporate segment. We seek to provide everything that is necessary for companies so they can avoid having to enter into significant CAPEX.</p><h4>How has the sector evolved, and where are the opportunities for economic growth?</h4><p>The telecommunications sector has evolved towards the integration of services driven by the digital transformation that companies are requesting. The opportunities for growth are in the specificity of the supply according to the needs of each industry, adaptable and in flexible business models like pay per use that allow greater efficiency in the use of resources.</p><h4>How has the Telecable growth process been, and what have been the secrets to your success?</h4><p>Telecable was established in 2005 and throughout these 13 years we have grown, both in the residential and commercial markets, based on a service philosophy that exceeds customer expectations, with innovative products suited to their needs and at competitive rates. The secret of success is based on having a team of committed shop owners looking to do things right the first time.  This service differentiates us. We have received the highest rating for three years running in subscription TV services and fixed internet according to the Superintendency of Telecommunications (Sutel).</p><h4>What is Telecable's position in the market in terms of market share?</h4><p>Four years ago, we were the fourth company, and now we are in the top two. We have made great headway in broadband. Television is a supportive feature, because currently many people are not watching TV, though there will still be some years of transition. We have a presence in four provinces, though in 2018 we ventured into two additional territories, and by 2019, we hope to cover the whole country. There are always growth opportunities in the residential segment, though the most significant business opportunities are in the corporate sector. SMEs do not enjoy optimal connectivity currently, and we are looking at that niche to help them grow their business.</p><h4>What are your competitive advantages that help you stand out from the other operators?</h4><p>Connectivity, both in residential and commercial use, is a commodity that directly dictates people's personal and professional dynamics. Telecable is an efficient, dynamic and fast-moving company, and this becomes a competitive advantage highly appreciated by users and commercial partners. In a small and competitive market such as Costa Rica, brand awareness and word to mouth is vital for growth in the sector.</p><h4>What are your plans to grow Telecable?</h4><p>maintaining the networks working correctly and according to the latest in technology. We are the first company to have 100% of its networks in DOCSIS 3.0. Our vision is to guarantee the best service experience and connectivity with the world. Our strategy is to keep growing and reach all places. As a result of a tender that we won for the FONATEL project, we are reaching 29 cantons in remote areas. We can bring connectivity to wherever it is needed, and we can do this through allies. A year and a half ago, we started with a wireless network at a national level. If a client in Talamanca requests for connectivity, and we do not have optical fiber in that region, we can go wirelessly. The important thing is not to say no. We have also rendered service to large companies, public, and private.</p><h4>What are the main positioning strategies of Telecable?</h4><p>Telecable will become the connectivity and internet company in Costa Rica. We have no doubt we will have the best network and the best internet service in the country. When any person or company thinks of internet services, they will think of Telecable. Today, we also provide services at the regional level in Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries that are our partners. We can connect China to Costa Rica in two or three days.</p><h4>Do you have any specific focus for 2019?</h4><p>We bought an optical fiber network that reaches the border with Nicaragua, and we presented the request for authorization to Sutel to integrate with a company that we acquired called Cable Costa located in Turrialba and Jimenez.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Colombia and the Netherlands have had a long relationship, though your visit in late 2018 was the first time a Dutch prime minister visited Colombia. Why was this the right time to visit Colombia?</h4><p>Colombia is a neighbor of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and is an important and reliable partner. We enjoy a comprehensive bilateral relationship both politically and economically. My visit to Colombia, together with a trade mission of more than 100 companies from the Netherlands, Aruba, and Curaçao, gave us the opportunity to strengthen our ties even further. The signing of the peace agreement with FARC has encouraged many countries, including European ones, to look for business and investment opportunities in Colombia. The stability of the country and region is extremely important for the Kingdom of the Netherlands. During my meeting with President Iván Duque, I confirmed the Netherlands remains committed to supporting the implementation of the peace agreement with FARC.</p><h4>Why is Colombia now becoming an attractive destination for investment from all over the world, and EU countries like the Netherlands specifically?</h4><p>Economic and trade relations between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Colombia are strong and growing. We have seen an increasing interest in doing business in Colombia from the Netherlands. The extremely dynamic bilateral Chamber of Commerce, Holland House, has been growing to 200 members in five years' time, while the Netherlands is in the top five of foreign investors in Colombia. Six Dutch sectors, as we call them 'top sectors,' have identified Colombia as a priority country where they want to explore business opportunities: agrifood, horticulture, water, logistics, life sciences and health, and the creative industries. The peace agreement has been contributing to increased stability and security and therefore in trust in investing in Colombia. Also solid macroeconomic policies, the trade agreement between Colombia and the EU, and the green light for membership of the OECD have been helpful in this respect.</p><h4>How has the Netherlands' support and experience helped design a better model to achieve Colombia's goals for land titling and formalization?</h4><p>During my visit to Colombia I had the opportunity to visit Apartadó, a region highly affected by the armed conflict. Together with the Colombian Minister of Agriculture Andrés Valencia, we handed out land titles to 25 families of the 'vereda' Los Mandarinos in Urabá. These titles were the result of a pilot project executed jointly by the Agencia Nacional de Tierras and the Dutch Cadastre. The pilot aims to demonstrate that it is possible to register land and provide land titles, faster, cheaper and in a fully participatory way. I spoke to the farmers that have obtained a land title and was extremely impressed to hear their stories of resilience and hope for the future. For farmers, it is important to have a land title. It gives them legal security and enables them to access credits and invest in their land. We hope this initiative can be replicated elsewhere and motivates the Colombian government to streamline land registration procedures, adopting the fit-for-purpose methodology. Only then can the Colombian government achieve its ambitious goal of registering all land by 2026, as was agreed in the Peace Agreement.</p><h4>How does Colombia compare to other Latin American countries in terms of investment potential?</h4><p>Economic growth in Colombia has been convincing over many years. Its stable and liberal macroeconomic policies are important for investors and companies from different countries. Colombia is also strategically located, which offers possibilities, for example, in port development. Also in agribusiness, there is an enormous potential in Colombia. The comparative advantages of Colombia can also be related to its human capital. Dutch companies that invest in Colombia often praise the academic level and quality of the human resources and talent.</p><h4>What work or improvements still need to be done in Colombia to increase its competitiveness in terms of attracting investment?</h4><p>An important challenge for Colombia is the need to diversify its economy. The Colombian government is aware of this and has formulated policies in this regard. The country relies to a large extent on the exports of natural resources; coal is one of the most important export products. Another challenge the government needs to tackle is to improve transport and logistics, sectors that the Netherlands has developed to near perfection. How else could we become the world's second-largest exporter of agricultural products with a country the size of the department of Casanare? Additionally, to further stimulate Dutch investment in Colombia, President Duque and I agreed to sign a double taxation agreement with Colombia in the foreseeable future.</p><h4>Netherlands and Colombia have become pioneers in the electronic exchange of certificates for agricultural products. How can such innovation in certification mean for Colombia's export economy?</h4><p>The Netherlands, together with the Colombian Agriculture Institute (ICA), has implemented an electronic certification system that will speed-up the procedures to import and export of plant and veterinary products and enhance the ease of doing business with, but not exclusively, the EU. At the same time, it will reduce the risk of fraud in issuing the certificates, making the certification process more secure and transparent. The cooperation was extended to the exchange of certificates with the Colombian National Institute for the Surveillance of Food and Medicines (INVIMA). The Netherlands and Colombia are pioneers in this regard. In the second half of the year, we expect to become the first countries in the world to exchange digital, paperless, certificates.</p>]]></richbody0content>

How do you describe the strategy behind this outcome?</h4><p>When I started the company, the regulations were evolving, and the intentions were clear; certain jurisdictions would end prohibition. We created a culture where there would be no shortcuts, no cheating. We hired brilliant people, specifically those who had the potential to collaborate. Canopy Growth Corporation seeks to get extremely bright people together.</p><h4>How do you assess the medical cannabis industry in Jamaica?</h4><p>The industry started off early and then became fairly quiet for a year or two. We now see a great deal of acceleration again. When I was working with all of the facilities, I saw 80% of alignment with the way the sector is regulated in Canada.</p><h4>How do Jamaicans contribute to the expansion of the corporation?</h4><p>We have an entity here that we have invested in. As a result, our Jamaica connection is that many people get the opportunity to work on medical research. There is cohort of people in Jamaica that is significantly more receptive to the idea that there could be geriatric remedies that will simply look at improving appetites and reducing anxiety as people age. We have done medical studies here, and this can be a great place for us to continue our operations.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>Canopy Growth Corporation is wrapping up the year, though it has to get recreational products across Canada. There are certain countries that are participating in the market, and there are 12 other countries that are federally turning it on, from Colombia to Denmark. There will be many projects wrapping up in Canada that need to be done. As well, we will have to look at developments in the US and the EU in 2019. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the highlights of JAS?</h4><p>JAS is 124 years old. From its establishment, it has been the strongest lobbying and advocacy group for farmers of all categories in Jamaica. It is also involved with the promotion of agriculture through shows and festivals to facilitate networking in agriculture. Recently, we re-integrated the coffee and cocoa sectors back together, since they were dismantled after the creation of the Jamaica Agricultural Community Regulatory Authority (JACRA). We also work on developing markets for our farmers and advocate for government expenditures not to bypass rural areas, to ensure domestic water supply and electricity provision there. We also protect tropical breeds of cattle, which are considered the best adapted cattle breeds in the world. Another group of farmers I recently met with is the cannabis group. As small farmers are interested in growing cannabis for medical purposes, we hope to build a cannabis park in St. Ann. We are part of the Tourism Linkage Hub, which brings all sectors together to benefit and deliver the “Jamaican product," whatever it may be, into hotels and restaurants. For Jamaican farmers, it is a large market. The 4.3 million tourist entering Jamaica each year consume three times the amount of food Jamaicans do, and 43% of the “hotel product" is actually food. Currently, Jamaican farmers provide about 10% of this food; if we could double our share to 20-25%, it will pump millions of dollars to rural communities. We are currently transitioning from being a quasi-government entity to a full non-political NGO. This will allow us to speak freely and defend the farmers of this country against government oppression, if it happens. We hope to work with various international bodies to get grants that will lead to getting our farm stores back in operation and do the core purchasing of foodstuffs and spices for redistribution and sale across Jamaica. That is our mission over the next 18 months.</p><h4>What is the strongest agricultural commodity in terms of exports?</h4><p>In the past, it was sugarcane and banana, though those have been failing. Today, Blue Mountain coffee is making tremendous progress as a 300-year-old brand. Over the past 12 months we have experienced trouble maintaining our markets due to foreign competition. We are not doing enough from the government side to protect the Blue Mountain brand. Also, among the six finest rums around the world, two are from Jamaica. Those are White Overproof Rum and Appleton Special, both of which are made from sugarcane. We also want to rebuild the mango industry. If we do irradiation, which is a chemical type of operation that kills the fruit flies we are afraid of, our mangoes will be readily accessed by the US market. Now the market is opening up for cannabis, and it has great export potential.</p><h4>How can Jamaican products compete with imports from abroad?</h4><p>There is competition from abroad because our farms are not fully mechanized. Mechanizations must be followed by technological advancement. Also, some of our farms are too small, and it is not economical to advance them or drive them with technology. We want to open up larger land areas of more than 50 acres so we could then pay a manager to maintain farm vehicles and computer programs for laying out irrigation systems, and pay for the technology for them. Our smaller farmers could join groups such as co-ops to produce together. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your operations evolved since 2017?</h4><p>We increased our retail footprint island wide from 75 to 135 drop points and with retail being a significant part of our 2020 growth strategy, we surpassed our expectations and grew revenue by 19% and shipment volumes by 33% YoY. We also learnt through an independent market intelligence study that we are the market leaders with 66% market share and the largest international express door-to-door logistics company in Jamaica. Continued investment in our people, equipment, and retail facilities to meet the continued demands of our customers have been key contributors to our success. As DHL Jamaica adopts a “people first" culture, it continues to ensure that its staff remains motivated and engaged. We are pleased to learn that we were accredited by the international Top Employer Institute as Top Employer 2018 for the third consecutive year.</p><h4>How will DHL take advantage of free trade zones?</h4><p>With the explosion of retail and e-commerce globally and growing customer demands, there will be several opportunities for warehousing/fulfillment centers and shipping companies, and economic zones will be ideal for this. This will offer many benefits to DHL, enabling it to establish a presence in these zones and be closer to its clients; the retail and e-commerce segments are main strategic drivers of our 2020 growth initiative. In this space, we will offer aggressive e-commerce pricing, strong retail presence, better aviation capabilities, and state-of-the-art logistics services. </p><h4>What are your strategies for innovation and digitalization?</h4><p>DHL has always been strong in terms of innovation, and it is currently doing what is known as clearance in the air (CIA), where we provide all the invoices and shipping manifest before the plane arrives in the country. This means customs will already have started processing everything before the plane lands, leading to faster clearances and on-time deliveries for our customers. Our scanners have allowed us to eliminate paperwork and allow for information storage, GPS capabilities, and call capabilities. Customers can pick up a package anywhere and not go through a third party. As well, we offer on-demand delivery (ODD), which allows our customers to receive a text asking where they would like the package to be left just prior to the delivery. We are also expanding our online presence with our web platform, called My DHL +, which has transitioned our website from just being a standard website to integrating many different tools. Moving forward, we will continue listening to our customers and innovate new ways to meet their demands and exceed their expectations.</p><h4>How is DHL working to increase its market share?</h4><p>We look to continue expanding our retail footprint to get closer to our customers, form more partnerships with government agencies to assist them in serving their customers more efficiently, and continue helping SMEs that want to enter the international market. In October, we started a series of workshops that we held in collaboration with the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce (JCC), called Growing Beyond Borders, aimed at spreading knowledge about expanding businesses globally.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>Performance management will be the key for us. At DHL, we believe in first motivating our staff, who if engaged will take care of the customers, the customers in turn will take care of us, and as a result, revenue, profits, and market share will grow. We also seek to continue growing our retail business, which will remain dominant in 2019. The key here is not just growth, but growth with quality, opening up new points that make sense in the right locations, with the right partners. We also want to grow our SMEs and work with initiatives such as Growing Beyond Borders, as well as more strategic pricing. Thus, we will work on social media, where a great deal of e-commerce is based. As well, we want to approach different kinds of sectors and show them how we can be of value. Finally, we also want to continue to be the top employer. Globally, DHL is the only logistics company to be on the list of top employers and is ranked sixth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights for Ibex in 2018, with specific regard to operations in Jamaica and the Caribbean?</h4><p>First was a meeting with our Board of Directors in Kingston in January and an event with top BPO industry analysts. That was followed by the grand opening ceremony at the IBEX Waterfront center, attended by local government officials and the business community. In August 2018, we hosted 150 top performers from all our Jamaican and Nicaraguan sites at a resort in Montego Bay as a reward for their great work. As part of the event, we visited a local orphanage and brought food and other supplies to them as part of our Ibex Gives Back program. In October, we opened our newest center in Kingston, Ibex Courtleigh, and welcomed a new client to the center. As a result, we have been able to offer over 2,500 new jobs with opportunities to advance with us.</p><h4>What factors triggered your interest to invest in Jamaica?</h4><p>On my numerous trips to the island prior to Ibex entering Jamaica, I saw a skilled, motivated, and committed workforce. It was not only their work ethic but their ability to do so with a smile on their faces and a welcoming demeanor. These were the kinds of people we wanted to attract because they mirror the personality and culture we have created at Ibex. Jamaica also offers a committed pro-business government that is supportive of the BPO industry. For example, there are organizations such as JAMPRO that encourage and promote business in Jamaica. The common myth in the US was that Jamaica was a great vacation destination but not a place to operate a business. This misperception continues to provide an amazing opportunity for Ibex because we know and understand the real Jamaica.</p><h4>Given the recent establishment of the regional headquarters in Kingston, can you tell us more about the strategic partnerships involved in the process?</h4><p>There are many strategic partnerships that have encouraged us and allowed us to grow within Jamaica. Digicel has become an important partner for us and allowed us to grow within Kingston. We have found great partnerships with the local investment and financial community who now understand, believe in, and see the benefits of the BPO industry's growth in Jamaica. Equally important, economic development companies and the local media have been supportive and welcoming. For instance, the Heart Trust is an important partner because it provides education about our industry and helps a potential employee prepare to join Ibex. The result of all of our partnerships is our explosive growth and expansion in the region.</p><h4>What benefits can the expansion of the BPO sector bring to Jamaica?</h4><p>The expansion of the BPO industry brings opportunity for the people of Jamaica because of the indirect benefits of its growth. It is reflected in the amount of money we spend visiting different parts of the country, which improves the entire economy. Moreover, Ibex uses local printing companies, photographers, caterers, and other services. For example, Ibex has worked with Intcomex, a local company, for its IT needs and has spent over USD8 million on related facilities. Our partnerships with the Development Bank of Jamaica and First Global Bank in the financial community improves their operations. The benefits are far reaching, and as the BPO industry grows and thrives, so does all of Jamaica.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2019?</h4><p>Our goal is to exceed what many people thought was a lofty goal: hiring over 5,000 within three years. We will continue to look aggressively for further expansion in Jamaica, including a strategic move into the Montego Bay market. We have become the unquestionable leader among all the BPO companies in Jamaica. In 2019, we will continue to work to extend our reputation as the employer of choice. Ibex will continue to give back to the community and be a catalyst for continued growth and prosperity in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[safe-and-sound-expansion]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main highlights for itelBPO in 2018?</h4><p>We launched a few new accounts early in the year and just moved into new offices in Montego Bay and Kingston. We also closed an acquisition of Granada Corporation, a US-based firm that provides services to US-based clients through agents that work at home. That acquisition also came with a facility in Monterrey, Mexico. That expanded our footprint into North and Central America and diversified our services and offerings, as well as how we deliver our services. In our nearshore operations, our workforce is completely office based, though in our Americas division people work from home. itelBPO has taken on several new clients and continued growing its facilities in the Bahamas, Jamaica, and the US. We broke ground on our second and third buildings in Montego Bay. Additionally, we closed the year with just over 2,000 employees, are redeveloping our entire CRM platform, and have embarked on an AI/robotics process automation project.</p><h4>What is itelBPO's main strategy to maximize awareness of its services?</h4><p>We spend a great deal of time on public relations to ensure the local and international markets know what we are doing and the services we provide. We go to shows, mostly in North America, to meet specific people and for brand development. As big as we are in Jamaica, itelBPO is small globally, so we need to continue to push the brand. We have a business development team constantly out in the market to set up conference calls with prospective clients, sell our services, bring people to Jamaica to see what we can offer, and close deals. We partner with the Jamaica Promotions Corporation (JAMPRO) and international agencies that bring prospective clients and business to us. We also do an annual summit where we target potential clients and influencers who can help us. </p><h4>What is the importance of being a Google-certified partner?</h4><p>Google is about going up the value chain in BPO, and we have our software development side and an online marketing agency. At present, there are about eight clients working with our digital agency to develop marketing campaigns for our clients. Our team design, developments, and execute advertisements are published on Google, and we monitor the return on investment from those advertisements to determine what work bests and gives clients the greatest value. Being a partner of Google is also beneficial because it conducts beta tests with us, so our clients get to trial innovations and then potentially have first dibs on using that product going forward, which gives them an edge in the market.</p><h4>What benefits can the expansion of the BPO sector bring to Jamaica?</h4><p>I see the BPO industry continuing to grow and impact Jamaica in terms of reducing the unemployment rate further. By continuing to provide jobs, the BPO industry spreads wealth that goes back into the economy and the government's funds, enabling the state to reinvest in infrastructure, housing, and other key sectors. The sector's expansion has also benefitted other industries; for example, we buy furniture and computers for our facilities and provide transportation and F&amp;B services for our staff. Many restaurants have opened up because we subsidize lunch for our staff. Moreover, during the construction stage, we employ contractors, electricians, fiber optic engineers, and others. Therefore, the knock-on effects and benefits for other businesses from the BPO sector are tremendous. There are 36,000 people in the BPO sector in Jamaica, though another 30,000 people benefit indirectly from its activities here.</p><h4>Is itelBPO targeting any new countries to expand into?</h4><p>We will continue to scale. We are looking at other countries, though a great deal depends on demand. We are focused on growing our presence in the countries we operate in, though we constantly look at new opportunities. Saint Lucia is a great opportunity, similar to Grenada and Barbados, and moving forward, we will continue to grow our facility in the Bahamas. There are other English-speaking islands that could potentially be a stop for us along the way, though their scale is not as big as Jamaica. Jamaica will always be itelBPO's biggest site in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[standing-out]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you maintain such a diversified portfolio of industries?</h4><p>We use different models of ownership, such as ownership based on a geographic region, vertical ownership based on the type of business, and horizontal ownership according to the necessary support. For example, the retail vertical has subject matter experts responsible for all of Sutherland's retail. They know what is going on in the industry, can recommend solutions, and make predictive analysis to identify opportunities to move forward. The retail business in Jamaica, meanwhile, has a separate structure, which we call the geography, and that focuses on the employees who fall under that retail client's portfolio, the profitability, day-to-day operations, and client relationships in horizontal or vertical partnerships. This structure is not uncommon across companies of this size, allowing us to effectively manage multiple sectors.</p><h4>How would you describe the main strategy behind your customer approach?</h4><p>The strategy starts with our people, who are our most important resource. To me, there are three stakeholders in the BPO business: the people, who are the most important; clients; and profitability, whether it is for a shareholder in a public company or equity partners in a private company. If a company's employees are committed, happy, and engaged, they will deliver consistent high-end performance, which is what clients seek.</p><h4>What are the reasons behind the company's success in Jamaica?</h4><p>We have grown because our employees have been able to consistently deliver against expectations. Moreover, the economic environment and legal framework make Jamaica attractive for FDI, and the island's close proximity to North America allows us to serve clients at lower costs. Our success truly boils down to the quality of service that our employees have been delivering consistently, which enables us to retain our client base. Moreover, since Jamaica is the third-largest English speaking country in the region, we stand out from a language perspective.</p><h4>How is Sutherland aligned with the government's plans to develop Jamaica as a main logistics hub?</h4><p>The minute we heard logistics hub, one of our executives got excited and wanted to assist the government in making it a reality. We have invested in learning and training experts to develop a curriculum for a first degree in logistics. In fact, we are currently working with local universities to offer this degree because based on where we see the business going from a BPO perspective, logistics, fulfilment centers, and assembly centers are the next natural step for Jamaica.</p><h4>What do you expect with your relationships with Portmore College and University of West Indies?</h4><p>We are still in the process of working with universities to finalize some of the programs; however, they are extremely receptive. It will be a challenge for this industry if we do not get ahead of it in a proactive manner; in the coming years, there will be people interested in working in outsourcing who will need to have outsourcing qualifications. Furthermore, we have to differentiate ourselves by taking the lead; this pertains to preparing talent and making sure the industry is attractive enough to interest that talent. This will prevent us from getting to a point where business is booming without being able to fulfil the demand or supply of the talent, not only at an entry level but also at a leadership level.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>For 2019, we are still focused on growing, and while our headcount growth will not be the same, considering our focus on higher tiered work, we expect continuous revenue growth. The second focus will be meeting our employee's expectations; we plan to invest in our professionals so that they can see improvement in their professional careers as well as their personal lives. We want to help reduce unemployment, and my mission has always been to create a better Jamaica. From a client perspective, we would like all our clients to become promoters of our business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of GeoTechVision so far?</h4><p>GeoTechVision was one of the smallest companies that entered Jamaica's e-learning tablets in schools' project in 2014. Our core business in geospatial technologies is far from tablets and e-learning, though we realized we had to make education exciting for kids. Children are digital natives and need to use such technology in schools to make the transition to the workplace. We were tasked with delivering 5,500 tablets that we designed to schools across Jamaica. We also partnered with a company out of Israel and created a classroom management solution. We exceeded expectations in this project. Following this, in 2018, GeoTechVision was awarded its largest contract portion of USD16 million for the full implementation of the tablets in schools' project.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about GeoTechVision's operations, strategies, and partnerships?</h4><p>When it comes to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), we are the premier geospatial technologies company in the Caribbean. GIS allows us to model the real world in a computer environment to better understand interactions and find unique solutions to some of the problems we face. GeoTechVision is a solution-based company; all its engagements with a user-requirements analysis geared at providing the best customized solution for a particular customer. Over the last 10 years, we have grown organically and have customers in 15 different Caribbean territories. GeoTechVision's comparative advantage is that it offers not just the technology, but also an understanding of the local environment and culture.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about GeoTechVision's Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives?</h4><p>We focus on education; we have given a number of scholarships to students at the University of Technology. Moreover, we facilitate summer programs and GIS camps with children every year to get them enthusiastic about GIS. We also participate in GIS events and have been encouraging governments across the region to implement GIS education in schools. At present, we are the only company in the Caribbean that is a founding member of the UN's Geospatial Information Management Private Sector Network, and I chair that group for the Americas. We are also a founding member of the World Geospatial Industry Council launched at the UN in August 2018. This industry has a great deal of room to grow in the Caribbean and beyond. With that in mind, we recently hosted our third annual GeoExpo.</p><h4>What needs to be done to maximize the use of geo-spatial technologies?</h4><p>We need to take small steps, and this includes building awareness. We have follow-up meetings planned to look at ways, such as seminars and podcast, to raise exposure to geospatial technologies. One of the other things the company is doing in its new venture at Marlie Technology Park is partnering with We Robotics to set up a drone lab and program. We will teach people how to use drones to create sustainable businesses. Notably, high-profile international players spoke at our Expo in 2018, which is another way of raising awareness. Likewise, we participate in Geography Awareness Week every November and in the annual GIS Day across the Caribbean.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations at GeoTechVision for 2019?</h4><p>2019 will be an exciting year. We are implementing our tablets in schools project, doing proof of concept for blockchain, and focusing more on enterprise development. Moreover, we are creating more management dashboards and working on our drone show services. We are definitely looking to expand into other markets, including becoming more deeply involved in the Latin American market. Cuba and Canada are other places we have our sights set on in our five-year strategy. We recently expanded in the African market and moving forward, we intend to expand into more African markers. Other than that, we have completed our first piece of engagement in the Pacific, in Fiji, and our engagements in the US are also on the rise.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-right-approach]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why do 80% of the companies in Montego Bay choose Red Key Solutions? </h4><p>The primary reason is our quality of service, second only to our speedy service; the majority of our clients get their matters resolved within 24 hours as compared to days or weeks. This is vital for some clients that cannot afford downtime at all because of how their operations run. Their security is so crucial to their operation that you have to respond quickly to the client center. </p><h4>Do you have any priorities in terms of expansion? </h4><p>We are focused on the north coast because there are several players all across the south coast near Kingston. There is enough business for everybody and I am satisfied with what we have achieved by operating in the north coast. Quality is extremely important for us and as a result, keeping things under control ensures clients remain happy.</p><h4>Are you looking for potential partnerships in order to maintain your market share? </h4><p>Partnerships are always good, especially in the technology world. Signing more partnerships means more trainings, which at the end provides us with all the additional edge needed. We have quite a few partners that we work with and that benefits us as we are able to offer the warranties that our partner companies offer. This is another factor that allows us to provide speedy service.</p><h4>What are your expectations in terms of an expansion through Caricom? </h4><p>It is a definite given. The goal is to be present in at least two countries within the Caribbean by the end of 2019. This is why we are so focused on the BPO industry, as we realize that there are not many companies that can offer both sides of technology. We offer both the IT side that is extremely in depth and the electronic security side. If I can bring that to a country that does not have the ability or talent, it will benefit Red Key immensely. The idea is to expand to other markets and show clients what they have been missing. There are huge opportunities available in other markets, which is why expansion is our ultimate goal at the moment. </p><h4>How would you describe the relationship you have in the US and Latin America in order to reach more markets? </h4><p>We mainly deal with companies in the US because most of the call centers and partners are based there. We found that a lot of our US-based clients want to fly our technicians to their operations around the world to help them set up. Similarly, we recently started working with a Mexican company and it is also interested in using our technicians for consultation purposes because the build out rules are different for every country. Once we send a technician to consult and lay out the client's new office and call center, local talent can be used to build out the space. Once that is achieved, we know that our consultations produced the desired results. </p><h4>What are your main goals for 2019? </h4><p>First, I would love to have a full hybrid fleet for our technicians. The second goal for 2019 is to have such a technology hub at Red Key that we attract only the best talent. The future is interesting and we are looking for that raw talent that makes technology exciting. </p><h4>What are the top two benefits and challenges of doing business in Jamaica?</h4><p>Two key benefits of doing business in Jamaica are the island's geographical location and its local talent pool. On the other hand, bureaucracy and the unstable dollar form two of the biggest challenges in the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main benefits of being a member of the Montego Bay Chamber of Commerce?</h4><p>We lead around 200 registered members, galvanizing around similar objectives and needs to provide advocacy on their behalf in ensuring that the climate for business is buoyant and allows for all the necessary requisites for a successful business operation. Thus, we ensure that the infrastructure is there and the policies are in place to allow for job creation, growth, economic activity, and vibrancy. We are pretty much the center of it all, advocating the interests of the business community. As well, we facilitate lobbying for issues that may affect members generally or individually.</p><h4>How would you describe the main outcomes of your events, workshops, and seminars?</h4><p>It is important that we speak not only frequently but with some amount of strength in voice and presence to highlight the concerns and regularly keep them within the public domain so that they receive the necessary attention. It is again a part of advocacy, which is what we are about. Advocacy also places an obligation on us to not only deal with issues in general for the business community, but also to promote our local industry to encourage more investment from the private and public sectors to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place. In fact, we have awards coming up at the convention center in the near future and the chamber was instrumental in lobbying to make sure the center was built. We've lobbied for the popular Montego Bay bypass, also known as the Perimeter Road. It is a three-year project, the contract has been signed, and we expect that some work will commence in 2019. Moreover, we have pushed for several other initiatives, such as promoting our Hip Strip tourist product. We have witnessed encouraging interest and it is attracting additional private-sector investments. Plus, a major state-of-the-art-park is being built just outside of the Hip Strip, which will add significant value to Montego Bay.</p><h4>What can be done to attract more investment to Montego Bay?</h4><p>We just need to look at our two strongest industries, tourism and BPO, analyze how to link other industries with them, and strategize how we can make those industries stronger. We will deal with it through Invest MoBay, which for instance links the tourism and manufacturing industries. Additionally, the agriculture, fishing, food, and entertainment sectors can grow stronger on the back of the tourism sector. With that in mind, we have an obligation as a chamber to ensure that we can promote the key features of the Jamaican and our local economy to help build it.</p><h4>How do you expect the Jamaican Logistics Hub Initiative to change the dynamic of the economy in the medium and long term?</h4><p>Montego Bay is a resort town and it is a town that I regard as the home of hospitality. The Jamaican Logistics Hub Initiative will greatly help the country in general and especially Montego Bay to build other industries, such as manufacturing. Moving forward, Montego Bay will act as a resort town that will facilitate the growth of other industries.</p><h4>What are your main priorities for 2019?</h4><p>There are three; the first one is related to what we call member centricity, maintaining the primacy of the Montego Bay Chamber of Commerce as a membership organization; the second is about modernizing the organization and its processes; and the third one is the issue of advocacy. So, under those three umbrellas, we have formed a 10-point plan. For the first goal, we have designed a comprehensive member-to-member discount program for the direct benefit of our individual and business members. One of the modernization issues has to do with upgrading our website. In that sense, we want to be more like TBY in terms of its global reach and modern way of doing business. </p>]]></richbody0content>
