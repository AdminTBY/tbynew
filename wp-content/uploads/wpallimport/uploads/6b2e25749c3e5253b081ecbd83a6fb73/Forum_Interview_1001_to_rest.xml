		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>INTEGRAL COMPONENT</h4><p>Participation banks are not an alternative, but an integral component of the Turkish banking system. They have brought the idle funds of interest-sensitive clients into the system, and these banks have provided alternative financial opportunities to manufacturers and businessmen.</p><h4>MARKET LEADER</h4><p>Bank Asya is the leading participation bank in Turkey with an asset size of TL17 billion, 200 branches, 4,500 employees, and 3.5 million domestic clients. By the end of 2011, almost 53% of its shares were traded on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (İMKB).</p><h4>PARALLEL GROWTH</h4><p>It is possible to identify an increase in investments made by participation banks in line with the economic growth of Turkey. Bank Asya, for example, is in the process of establishing a new private pension and life insurance company that will manage its funds in compliance with Islamic principles.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SUITS THE MARKET</h4><p>In the participation banking arena there are many products that suit the needs of the Turkish market. We now need to develop these products. Furthermore, developing qualified personnel is a challenge.</p><h4>UNIQUE &amp; POSITIVE</h4><p>There were some gold products traded on the Stock Exchange but ours, called Gold Plus, is the first one that operates without interest products. It has had a positive reception since its launch. We hope to increase the quotation and we have plans to replicate this with products similar to gold in the near future.</p><h4>ADDING VALUE</h4><p>We have succeeded in attracting long-term financing for the first time in the history of participation banking. We can now finance investors and entrepreneurs that are going to invest in factories and generate jobs, adding to the production of the economy.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>OUR ALLIES</h4><p>The Participation Banks Association of Turkey (TKBB) is a banking union working with its members, although we have the same regulations as the Banks Association of Turkey (TBB), with which we have good relations. We also work closely with the banking authority, the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA).</p><h4>ISSUING SUKUKS</h4><p>We have a very strong and unique system. The government and the banking authority regulate this kind of banking in Turkey; that is why we will be successful. We are trying to attract funds and finance participation banks through the issue of sukuks, which is a practice becoming more common in the Gulf region.</p><h4>TIME TO GROW</h4><p>There is a lot of competition between the participation banks and conventional banks. We think the participation banking system will be more successful here, even though this is a new model in Turkey and needs time to grow.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>BIG MARKETS</h4><p>Our big markets include the UK, Germany, and the US, although the biggest market is still the Turkish market itself. All the international brands are represented in Turkey and they organize major events here. Weddings are also a big deal here, with hundreds invited.</p><h4>SUMMER &amp; WINTER</h4><p>Our restaurant has a large capacity and a lot of opportunities because it is 50% outside and 50% inside, and the attached walled garden can be used in winter or be opened up and folded away for the summer.</p><h4>BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS</h4><p>Apart from the restaurant, we have a rooftop bar with a spectacular view of the city and the Bosphorus, and in the evenings it will attract a lot of people. We have a beautiful 1,500-sqm spa area, and eight treatment rooms that are gorgeous and beautifully designed.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>OVERHAUL</h4><p>We have completed the first phase of renovation at the hotel in Taksim. The entrance, lobby, restaurant, bar, chocolate shop, and grand ballroom have been completed. We are now continuing with the spa and fitness areas. The final phase will include all rooms.</p><h4>A LANDMARK</h4><p>Our Taksim location is a landmark­—it's right in the center of the city and we work with various different nationalities. We try to keep a balance of 60% corporate and 40% leisure business. We have a total of 19 meeting rooms together with our grand ballroom and another 450-sqm ballroom.</p><h4>PRIMARY SOURCE</h4><p>Our primary source is still Turkey. However, our most promising markets are Germany followed by the US and UK—plus, we receive a lot of business from the Far East. In 2012 it has already increased by 35% compared to 2011.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS</h4><p>I'm very happy with the image we have built in just a year, not only nationally, but also internationally. The level of success we have achieved with the restoration of the hotel has absolutely exceeded our expectations.</p><h4>OLD, BUT NOT FORGOTTEN</h4><p>Our mission was to restore the hotel to its former glory. For so many years Pera Palace Hotel was not looked after and allowed to fall into disrepair. The building was taken for granted because it had been here for 120 years.</p><h4>HISTORY &amp; CULTURE</h4><p>The connection between our guests from all segments of the market is a love of history and culture. We have guests of many different ages, but they all enjoy the nightlife, people, peacefulness, and history of Pera.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>GET SETTLED</h4><p>What sets us apart from the other hotel chains is that we see ourselves as a family. We have lots of different concepts, and the main one is “Yes, I Can“ service, where we allow our employees to correct every problem on the front line—they don't need to come to me to sort it out.</p><h4>COMPETITIVE FOR MICE</h4><p>When we look at Turkey in general, the country is close to Europe, and there are many first-class airline company options. Moreover, there is good infrastructure and many tourist attractions with competitive rates for the MICE industry.</p><h4>SET TO CONTINUE</h4><p>With its strategic location, focus on tourism, stable economy, strong transportation systems, and easy connection to other central locations worldwide via airways and trade connections, Turkey shows signs that growth will continue in the future.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>FIRST AND ONLY</h4><p>Swissí´tel was the first and still is the only hotel to operate boats on the Bosphorus. We operate daily cruises and also private hire, so you can have a ballroom on the Bosphorus. We were also the first to offer a private limousine service in town.</p><h4>REJUVENATED</h4><p>We are in the middle of a major investment. Any building that is 20 years old eventually needs to go through an overhaul, so we have rejuvenated some parts of the hotel. We revamped the two restaurants, a number of meeting rooms, and the spa, which is one of the largest in Turkey.</p><h4>GET IT RIGHT</h4><p>With an international conference you need to work with professionals in the field; there is no room for error when hosting the World Economic Forum, for example. The latest technology in this sense is outsourced.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>When the authorities began moving toward a knowledge-based economy, we decided to increase the number of R&amp;D centers in Monterrey. Our specific target was to launch at least 100 public and private R&amp;D centers. We built magnificent innovative areas near the airport, and in total we now have 30 centers, one-third of which are partnered with Mexican and US universities. A variety of foreign universities are interested in joining this initiative. Another one-third of these centers are public research centers geared toward different areas. The remaining centers are operated by international and local private companies. This initiative represented a global investment of $350 million, and was built over a period of six years. It was inaugurated recently on a very aggressive schedule. Our goal is to hire a range of 6,000 scientists, researchers, and technicians by 2015. We also have four high-tech incubators designed to connect research with the marketplace directly. These high-tech incubators are in the areas of nanotechnology, biotechnology, sustainable and renewable energy, intelligent housing solutions, IT, and software, creating an ecosystem for innovation. This system is composed of three main ingredients: the presence of public, private, and academic researchers.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Praxair is a leading industrial gas provider, operating in Mexico as a global company with local efficiency and world-class capabilities. We currently have more than 300 production, distribution and customer service sites, a reliable logistics network with nationwide coverage, and 2,500 associates in order to directly supply more than 35,000 customers.

Praxair products, services, and technology bring productivity and environmental benefits to a wide variety of industries in more than 25 industry sectors, including manufacturing, chemicals, petrochemicals, aerospace, food and beverage, electronics, metals, mining, energy, and healthcare. Our primary products are: atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and helium) and process gases (carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and acetylene). We are the leading and largest industrial gas company in North and South America and one of the largest worldwide. We have been growing at double-digit rates in Mexico and we will continue to invest to sustain our market leadership position. We aim to serve our customers with the most reliable industrial and medical gases logistics network, the most innovative production and application technology, and the best developed and most committed talent.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We boast a strong penetration rate in Mexico's consumer healthcare products sector—our products have a 24% share of the market and we are ranked second. To achieve this result we have always put a strong focus on our human resources. We always try to hire the best candidates and invest in training and making our employees happy and motivated. The second element of Grupo PI Mabe's business model is its strong and continuous investment in innovation and technology. In this field we have registered a total of 199 patents in Mexico and internationally. In addition, we consistently re-invest to improve the quality of our operations and our products. We have registered a good export performance in Central America and in the Caribbean. We are strongly focusing our attention on those markets, and over the last year we have been directing a sound amount of our re-investment budget toward adjusting our products to be more competitive in the international markets, creating value-added. We have to make a small differentiation between the segments—baby diapers and adult diapers. In the baby diaper sector, absorption quality and softness is important, whereas in the adult diaper segment the first factor is price.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>MOVING FORWARD</h4><p>I feel that Mexico is moving fast in terms of infrastructure development. There are still a lot of opportunities, and different private companies as well as the government are playing a key role. Overall, I think that we are moving forward.</p><h4>VARIOUS WAYS</h4><p>We have over 2,500 partners in Mexico of many different types. And through them, and through our solutions, we provide elements that cover our five priorities in different forms and ways.</p><h4>VITAL ROLE</h4><p>If you look at it from the perspective of the amount of goods that we manufacture in Mexico, which is an extremely high number, we probably manufacture over $6 billion worth of products and services that are then exported to foreign markets. Generally, our operations in Mexico are an important part of Cisco's worldwide business.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>JOIN THE CLOUD</h4><p>More efficient and cost-effective, cloud computing stores massive amounts of information through just zeroes and ones. There is no reason why it shouldn't be accessible from anywhere, and the technology also prevents people from losing data just because your hardware is lost or damaged.</p><h4>UNIVERSAL ACCESS</h4><p>Making books available on the web is right up our alley, as part of our mission is to make all of the world's information universally accessible and useable. How the field develops will depend on several factors, including hardware innovations.</p><h4>FIRST IMPULSE</h4><p>You have to be present online. Businesses also need to consider the role of internet advertising in inspiring the consumer's first impulse to buy a product or service.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>THE LATEST</h4><p>We are working and forming partnerships to provide services and integration with our suppliers and customers, seeking to supply everyone with the latest technology sourced by Huawei.</p><h4>MORE GREEN</h4><p>We see a very hopeful future. In Mexico, there are many natural resources, such as sun, wind, and water. Every company should take responsibility to shift to greener energy resources, and we are doing our part to improve efficiency and make green energy possible.</p><h4>HUGE MARKET</h4><p>More than 100 million people live in the country, and the demand for telecommunications services is huge. Everyone wants to communicate via broadband and smartphones; Mexico's market is large and very important for Huawei.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>BEST IN CLASS</h4><p>The main driver for the adoption of SAP technology is closely related to productivity increases. Private sector customers seek to be more competitive and efficient, and demand technology that applies the best practices from all over the world. When clients choose SAP technology, they are using the best processes.</p><h4>EARLY BIRDS</h4><p>Mexico is a market that tends to have the latest technology available; adoption happens much earlier than in other regions. I believe that this is the case because Mexico is more integrated with the US and Europe, and many businesses must meet standard international practices.</p><h4>LARGER &amp; STRONGER</h4><p>Given that we are not looking at one specific market, we are convinced that we can sustain strong growth for years to come. We are seeing an SAP in Mexico that is even larger and stronger than the competition, offering tremendous value to our customers.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>EMOTIONAL RECEPTION</h4><p>The main competitive advantage is the unique design of the car, which has been very well received. Car sales depend on customers' emotions to a large degree. People buy the cars that they fall in love with. A second competitive advantage is the car's high performance; the Mastretta is fun to drive.</p><h4>MAIN MARKETS</h4><p>There are sports car fans throughout Europe, but countries such as the UK, Italy, France, Spain, and Germany are our main markets. We have already secured two distributors that are representing and working for us in Europe, and we look forward to open more offices in the future.</p><h4>FULL THROTTLE</h4><p>Many large manufacturers are not coming to Mexico to exclusively assemble cars. Instead, they are beginning to design the models here. Companies will be manufacturing more cars and conducting more and more R&amp;D in Mexico, developing technology and innovations. This shift will allow Mexico to develop a more sophisticated car industry in the future.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>RIGHT CAR, RIGHT TIME</h4><p>We have been in Mexico for almost 50 years. We started with the classic Beetle; it was the right car at the right time for the country and the Mexican customer, and allowed us to build a strong presence locally as a market participant and a manufacturer. Over time we added other models for the Mexican and export markets.</p><h4>FREE TRADE</h4><p>Mexico has a major advantage over other countries. We can export duty free to South America, North America, Europe, and Japan. The Mexican free trade network makes this possible; it represents a competitive edge for Mexico, and has driven the growth of the auto industry.</p><h4>PRODUCTION CENTER</h4><p>One trend in the Mexican automotive industry over the past few years has been that the country is becoming the production center for compact and sub-compact cars for the US market; cars that were not even being offered in the US market before are now assembled in Mexico.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>GROUP WORK</h4><p>The success of the automotive cluster in Nuevo León is an example of something that has worked well in Monterrey, where 20 different companies work together to exchange practices in a very open way. It offsets even the most expensive labor costs we have in the city.</p><h4>STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS</h4><p>In Mexico, about 3,400 people are working for us to complete 40% of global Metalsa operations, which is the manufacturing of structural components for commercial vehicles, mostly pickup trucks. We supply 100% of the chassis frames for Dodge Ram, Toyota, and Ford trucks in the US.</p><h4>NEW MATERIAL</h4><p>The most contentious issue in the industry now is fuel efficiency. There are only two solutions: to improve engines or to manufacture lighter trucks. Every structure has various functions, such as towing, loading, and absorbing energy in an accident. Our R&amp;D team is working on testing new material and new processes to meet the increasing demand for fuel-efficient structures.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SUPPLY CHAIN</h4><p>We are mostly a specialized medical product wholesaler with a strong supply chain presence across the country, enabling us to easily reach a majority of the population. In addition, we provide diverse logistical services for the transportation of specialized medical products.</p><h4>CORNERSTONES</h4><p>Innovation, quality of service, and ethics management are the cornerstones of MAYPO, allowing us to compete in the market and always provide high-quality and expert services to our customers.</p><h4>MORE TARGETED</h4><p>The pharmaceutical industry is becoming more and more specialized every day—in terms of technology—and this will allow the circulation of high-quality products in an efficient distribution system as well as more targeted service customers.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>SECRET TO SUCCESS</h4><p>In 2011 the Bayer group celebrated 90 years in Mexico. I think that the secret to our success is our long-standing presence in the market and our own production facilities here in Mexico.</p><h4>BUSINESS LINES</h4><p>Our business here is about 55% healthcare, 33% material science—mostly polymers and polycarbonates—and more than 10% crop science, which includes the business units of crop protection, bioscience, and environmental science.</p><h4>FAST TRACK</h4><p>Bayer generally introduces products to all of its markets as quickly as possible; we don't have an approach of first launching products in Europe, and then only years later bringing them to other markets.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>TWO REASONS</h4><p>Mexico is not a means to an end, but it is a gateway. There are two reasons for this: the size of the market, and the influence Mexico has on many countries across Latin America. We are usually an early adopter and a trendsetter in terms of treatment options and clinical research.</p><h4>IN-DEPTH BIOTECH</h4><p>We study diseases in-depth in order to understand their pathways. We identify where to stop the disease or how to delay its progress. Once we decide which pathway to interfere in, then we decide the best modality approach.</p><h4>ASPIRATIONS</h4><p>My aspiration is for Amgen to become the number one biopharmaceutical firm in Mexico. My commitment to achieve this is defined by being able to give as many patients as possible access to our medicines.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>MOVING AHEAD</h4><p>We are moving ahead by providing the traditional wholesale service of delivering pharmaceutical goods and health and beauty aid products not only to drugstores, but also to hospitals and medical centers.</p><h4>FRESH START</h4><p>We are experiencing strong performance based on the development of new products and services and innovative approaches to our client needs, which is positioning us very favorably in the eyes of both manufacturers and retailers.</p><h4>STRENGTHENING DEMAND</h4><p>The government has been focused on developing infrastructure and services to create a strong demand for generics, a market that is growing fast with a very strong base. Mexico is late in coming into this segment, and the generic market is still relatively small compared to other places such as the US, Canada, and Europe.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>NUMBER ONE</h4><p>We are the number one company in bringing in new products to the market worldwide and also to Mexico, and this is thanks to the new compounds and medicines we are introducing.</p><h4>MORE THAN BEFORE</h4><p>Science is moving toward biotech products more than just the traditional chemical compounds. It is a big part of the pipeline for all companies, including Novartis.</p><h4>NEW PRODUCTS</h4><p>We are seeing very good signs from the government to again put resources into new products. We believe that we will see growth happening in the next five to eight years in Mexico, and Novartis will be very successful.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>I think we have a very important responsibility, because a lot of other universities constantly observe what is happening at Tecnológico de Monterrey, and we pioneer many programs. We have a responsibility to constantly improve our academic quality and technology because we have the opportunity to influence and impact other universities in Mexico. It is important to expand public universities in Mexico, because many students do not have the opportunity to attend private universities. For this same reason, Tecnológico de Monterrey developed its TecMilenio University, which allows people to access high-quality education at lower prices. We hope to promote higher quality throughout Mexico's higher education system by the example of what we do every day. A lot of private universities have opened up in recent years with their only goal being to make money, which is sad. And what is even sadder is that their quality is often very poor. We are a non-profit institution; all of our revenues are reinvested in education and research. I think the government needs to regulate the quality of academic institutions more stringently, and establish uniform accreditation requirements. Mexico also needs a better system for student financial aid. In my opinion, it is also important for this country to invest in applied research; this country does not have enough money to fund theoretical research. Our focus needs to be on development.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are heavily focused on high academic quality. Our teachers are committed to education, and are well prepared and well trained. We are also concerned with integrating our students into society and preparing them to develop professionalism. Our students should be socially responsible before being successful entrepreneurs. I think that our approach to education makes La Salle one of the most accredited universities in Mexico. We run mandatory professional training directly in-company. Normally, our students have to spend at least the last semester putting into practice what they have learned during their studies. We provide the opportunity for students to work for the companies, institutions, and organizations we partner with. This is a fundamental part of our educational model. During this training the students receive important knowledge that they will need during their lives. At the end of the training, the students are also evaluated according to their performance over the period. The current government has ensured universal access to primary education since 2008. Although access to quality and well-recognized higher education institutions is still low, Mexico has achieved incredible results in its higher education system over the past few years.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>One of the greatest challenges Mexican institutions of higher education face is how to link higher education with the country's development needs and industries. We are doing our best to make our programs more pertinent and to respond to the real needs not only of the market, but of the country, in terms of development. Our university is not serving the market; it's serving the country. The program for which we see the highest demand is media and communications. The Universidad Iberoamericana was the first university in Latin America to offer such a program, and almost 1,300 of our students are studying media and communications. The second-most popular program is architecture; we have the most prestigious architecture program in the country. Third is law, followed by industrial engineering and psychology. These are the five largest programs that are directly responding to the country's needs, but at the university we have 35 undergraduate programs and 33 post-graduate programs. We believe it is socially responsible to be an active agent in social transformation, especially working with indigenous, suburban, and migrant people. We are also focused on defending human rights and the environment. This is part of the transversal educational vision we have at our university; these values must be present in all of the university's activities. This is one of the reasons why the university exists.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>CAPABILITIES</h4><p>Kobrex has the capacity to handle 60,000 tons of copper per year. We sell between 15% and 20% of our copper rod, and put the rest into wire and cable. We are operating at 80% capacity in our aluminum production facilities. We are a family-owned business and operate four manufacturing facilities in our group.</p><h4>IN THE BEGINNING</h4><p>In the beginning, we were only manufacturing copper conductors, so we started to produce aluminum conductors as well. More recently, we have made a number of important investments in medium- and high-voltage conductors. Our primary customer is the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE).</p><h4>PRICING</h4><p>If an important country's economy is in crisis, copper and aluminum prices fluctuate. Currently, the prices have been a little bit higher than the last quarter of 2011. I believe that prices should start falling again in 2012.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>PEMEX &amp; MORE</h4><p>At present we are an official supplier to PEMEX, and the energy sector accounts for 25% of our sales. Nevertheless, we have a strong presence in the chemical and petrochemicals industries, food supply chains, mining, pharmaceuticals, and agribusiness.</p><h4>EXPORT DESTINATIONS</h4><p>We principally export valves to the US and Canada, where we have an extended distribution network, as well as in Europe, where we have a distribution center in the Netherlands. We also sell to several Latin American countries, such as Brazil and Argentina, where we have distribution centers as well.</p><h4>AFTER THE SALE</h4><p>We have 42 official distributors in Mexico. They deal directly with a representative of the company according to their locations in order to fully meet the needs of our final customers. Every sale is fully managed by our accounts, and we offer a fully client-oriented service and provide after-sales services, as well as orientate our customers to the best solutions for their specific applications.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>ONE &amp; ONLY</h4><p>We produce special valves in terms of size and utilities and we are the only American valve manufacturer producing different types of special valves for a large number of energy and industrial applications.</p><h4>INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE</h4><p>We are working to increase our participation in the international market and we focus on the US in North America, Central and South America, the Middle East, and Africa. It is important to mention that today our brand is widely recognized on those continents.</p><h4>RISING TO THE CHALLENGE</h4><p>The energy sector is our core business and it has evolved strongly over the last decade. New trends have risen as well as new needs. For example, deepwater exploration operations need special kinds of valves and applications, and we have developed many new solutions over time in order to meet the needs of this sector.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>MAJOR PLAYER</h4><p>Our 20th anniversary in Mexico was in September 2011, and at that time we introduced what we call “new logistics,“ which is simply the ability to take advantage of UPS' global infrastructure to make companies in Mexico more competitive.</p><h4>CUSTOMIZED SOLUTIONS</h4><p>Manufacturing is a high-growth area for us, but especially the automotive industry. We have many successful customized solutions for major car manufacturers around the world, and that sector is growing in Mexico.</p><h4>EAGER TO PLEASE</h4><p>To us, every client is significant, and every package is important. We have a very high level of confidence in our systems and we truly welcome all customers. We have reinvented ourselves many times throughout our history, and have a willingness to adapt to the changing market.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SOMETHING DIFFERENT</h4><p>We had always wanted to create something different from the main market players. We realized that in order to increase our value-added to the market, we had to apply an analytical methodology and a mathematical model of operational research appropriate for existing logistics services.</p><h4>A WIDE SPECTRUM</h4><p>To offer integrated services, we require partners in analysis software and alliances with transportation companies that reduce the cost of our client operations. We have a number of partnerships with several national and international companies in order to be able to offer our customers a wide spectrum of solutions.</p><h4>ALL HERE</h4><p>Mexico could be considered a hub for logistics. Many domestic and international manufacturers choose Mexico as a manufacturing base for exports. Every US and European car manufacturer is present in Mexico, and they export a myriad of products to the US and South America.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SMOOTH TRANSITIONS</h4><p>In the past, we covered almost the whole industry because we were involved in the container trade, but now we have moved into the oil industry. We are more focused, and much of our activity is centered on petrochemical transport by sea, as well as ports and logistics.</p><h4>PORTS AND MORE</h4><p>The benefits Mexico will receive from the development of its port infrastructure will result in it being more competitive and more efficient, and the decision to increase the number of terminals is key to the development of the logistics network in Mexico.</p><h4>TRANSFER POINT</h4><p>Mexico is a very strategic location in terms of moving goods from North to South and East to West. Much of the cargo comes from Asia, lands in Mexico, and is transported to the US. When US ports are busy, our ports can readily accept the cargo. This is an aspect that is working well, and we feel there is huge potential.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are an autonomous institution in which the corporate governance includes equal representation from all stakeholders, as well as the labor, employer, and federal government sectors. We call ourselves a social mortgage lender, as we lend to acquire, build, or remodel houses, offering lower interest rates than the main market. We are the largest mortgage institution in Mexico, and workers who receive the lowest incomes are our main clients. At present, we have 14 million affiliates and 5 million active credits; we approve 500,000 financed credits per year—approximately 10,000 credits per week—through a highly automated process. Today, 22% of Mexicans live in a dwelling financed by Infonavit. I believe that the housing industry in Mexico has been very successful, and we have changed the landscape of the sector and revolutionized how Mexicans live. Toward the end of the 1990s, Mexico had a lack of large dwellings and a services shortfall. Nowadays, the housing industry faces two main challenges. The first challenge is to improve the quality of life. Following 2007, Infonavit began to focus on welfare in order to promote initiatives to improve standards of living. Secondly, we face the challenge of attending to sectors of the population that are not already affiliated with Infonavit or the Housing Fund of the Social Security and Services Institute for State Workers (FOVISSSTE).</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Demand has been driven by the historical trend of overpopulated houses or people who can't afford to buy homes. There are around 2 million households in this situation, and this is one area of demand that we aim to address. The other is the demographic factor—even though Mexican birth rates have gone down, we still have a large young population that demands homes. According to government estimates, we will need 9 million new houses by 2020. In 2005 there was a legal reform of the national housing law, and CONAVI was born. Before the reform, CONAVI was more of a promoter rather than a public policy coordinator. In 2007 we began to offer up-front subsidies. Now, with the federal administration under President Calderón, we have issued almost 900,000 subsidies from our program, or about $2 billion. It's important to understand what the sector was like 10 years ago and where we are today. Between 2000 and 2010, national public policy in housing was mainly aimed at developing a strong and robust financial platform to serve low-income groups of the population. We have already achieved that; CONAVI has made housing accessible to very low-income segments of the population. The problem in most Latin American countries is that the private banks are very selective, focusing mainly on the medium- to high-income groups.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 2007, there was a minor crisis in the housing market, and the sector was slightly restructured through consolidation. We are now distributing construction loans effectively, and we expect to double construction loans in 2011 over 2010. For the three kinds of housing mortgages we offer, we haven't seen the same level of success as before; these projects are riskier and the outcome of the portfolios could have been better. Therefore, we changed the structure of our microloans and related products. We looked abroad for inspiration and received assistance from the World Bank. We used to give loans on an individual basis, which is not possible for microloans, so we now perform portfolio guarantees. For long-term mortgage loans we have introduced a new product that distributes risk among all participants in the most efficient manner. We have also designed a public policy with other governmental agencies aimed at promoting quality over quantity in the evolution of the sector. There are currently 1 million housing transactions per year in Mexico, and supply has generally been enough to cover it. Of this number, around 250,000 are microloans for housing improvements. The population is growing at a steady, positive rate, but there is still a large housing deficit that needs to be overcome via innovative financial solutions. We still have good opportunities to grow.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>GOT IT COVERED</h4><p>Our team has personal knowledge and experience to provide high-level service. We take care of everything for travel agencies with the highest quality service and technology, providing training and a variety of travel products and services.</p><h4>MORE THAN BEACHES</h4><p>According to the tourism board, the sector has grown by 13%, and the number of South Americans visiting the country has also increased. We have very good hotels, services, and restaurants. Our history, museums, culture, handicrafts, and cuisine make Mexico more than just beaches.</p><h4>HEADED SOUTH</h4><p>The most popular places to visit are our neighboring countries, the US, and Europe. Two years ago, we started selling packages to South America. Accordingly, airlines in South America have launched a variety of good promotions, creating a movement for more traffic to their destinations.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>LIVE &amp; LEARN</h4><p>We want to offer the experience of being a traveller, not a tourist. Most of the traditional agencies and online services offer the usual tourist packages, with hotels and cars. We are working to offer different ways of travelling. One of these methods is called “Live and Learn,“ where customers can study or work outside of Mexico for an extended period of time.</p><h4>TANGIBLE PROFITS</h4><p>Although we have been investing very heavily in our web page, we still believe in our physical outlets. This company has been growing by 30% annually for the past five years. In 2011, profits grew over 40%, and our offices are selling more and more products.</p><h4>TOURING &amp; TRAVELING</h4><p>Our customers fall into two categories: tourists and travellers. The first kind can book a flight and a hotel on our website. The second kind of traveller may be going to Europe for two months, and prefers to see someone who can give advice. One of the most valuable things we offer at our shops is professional advice at zero cost.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>TERMS OF NEGOTIATION<br></h4><p>Our core business is to connect different suppliers such as airlines and hotels, cars and cruises in one system, and then negotiate with travel agencies that can offer everything they need through this one system.</p><h4>RAISING AWARENESS</h4><p>One of our roles is to educate the market. The travel industry feels that Sabre is its global partner with a global vision; we can educate it about the next steps and new technology in the travel industry.</p><h4>COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES</h4><p>We have many business units as well as the opportunity and capability to see the travel industry from many points of view. We have relationships with agencies and understand customer needs. We understand the airlines' needs, opportunities, and challenges.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>LOYAL CUSTOMERS</h4><p>Unlike chain hotels and international brands, our guests are more than just numbers; we are focused very much on service. It is our main target. For this reason we have a lot of frequent clients because we have developed loyalty.</p><h4>THAT'S BUSINESS</h4><p>We're able to accommodate anything from small meetings to gala dinners and even conventions and banquets. We have eight meeting rooms as well as a special department that is in charge of planning any type of business event.</p><h4>UP &amp; UP</h4><p>The industry is clearly on an upward swing. We have had up and down moments, but the overall growth is very positive. It is good that Mexico has diversified and promotes itself overseas.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>OPEN UP</h4><p>Creating new products is the prevailing trend. That is what we are aiming for, and new regions are opening up. We now believe that people should be seeing the interior parts of Mexico, including places such as Huaca, Chiapas, or even Querétaro.</p><h4>HOME GAME</h4><p>Approximately 80% of tourism income comes from the internal market. Around 15% of the remainder comes from the US market, and around 5% from Europe and Central America. Domestic tourism, therefore, is the most significant.</p><h4>ENDLESS POSSIBILITES</h4><p>Everything is possible in Mexico. It is possible to make a profit from all kinds of tourism. Ecological tourism is big business now, especially in places such as Bijas in Tampico. Cultural tourism is also huge. Culinary tourism has big potential and many nice restaurants are being developed that are certified as high quality.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>MARKET LED</h4><p>Boutique hotels are popular, but there are just a few in our city—only eight. The problem is that in Mexico we lack official categorization. You can find a five-star hotel in Mexico City, but there are no regulations for it—the quality is determined by the market.</p><h4>ABOVE AVERAGE</h4><p>The yearly occupancy average in Mexico is around 69% or 70%. Fortunately, for us, our best month was November 2011, with a 73% rate. February is also one of our best months—and we are forecasting perhaps 79% or 80% in 2012.</p><h4>LOCAL FLAVOR</h4><p>We explore the five senses of the human being. Food and cuisine are very important in boutique hotels. The mix of artistic design and history is a very important aspect of boutique hotels. The music is also important. Everything you find here, the art, the design, the artwork, and the furniture are all Mexican pieces.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>BEST PRACTICE</h4><p>The Marquis Reforma is a member of the Leading Hotels of the World, and in order to maintain our membership we have to meet a lot of standards. We continuously train our staff and keep in constant contact with the marketing and promotion teams. We bring people or schools from outside the hotel to train them. It is our aim to learn about the best practices of other leading hotels.</p><h4>WALKING DISTANCE</h4><p>Our corporate clients are 90% of our total customers because we are in the best location in Mexico City. The most important museums are all within walking distance. This beautiful avenue is becoming a landmark of the city. We're aiming at attracting more people to stay as part of a special weekend package.</p><h4>ON THE RISE</h4><p>Four new, important, 50-story buildings are rising in the area. The hotel is ready to receive more people, and rooms are being renovated as well as new restaurants being opened. More than 20,000 businessmen are expected to come to this area over the next two years.</p>]]></sections31>

As part of our core activities we organize an average of 30 events per year, featuring the most important leaders of the different economic sectors of the Mexican business scene as well as important government and political, national, and UK figures.</p><h4>THE MEMBERSHIP</h4><p>We have 320 members. We focus our activities through 10 Business Sector Groups that represent a large percentage of the UK business community in Mexico as well as Mexican companies with business interests in the UK.</p><h4>BENEFITS TO INVESTMENT</h4><p>There exist a lot of benefits for British investors here in Mexico, as well as for other international investors. Procedures to establish a new business in Mexico are constantly being simplified.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>THE SME GAME</h4><p>ICEX has a wide range of activities in Mexico. We're always looking out for new opportunities and new sectors. Our main focus is on SMEs; 70% of our work is in promoting trade flows and investment for smaller businesses.</p><h4>SPANISH PRESENCE</h4><p>Spanish companies are horizontally present in almost all sectors. The biggest presence is in the service sector and utilities. The financial, energy, tourism, infrastructure, and industrial sectors all feature major Spanish companies. In industry, there are Spanish companies in both the automotive and aeronautical sectors.</p><h4>FDI</h4><p>Spain is the second highest provider of FDI in Mexico, accounting for over 15% of total FDI, or around $40 billion over the past decade. The US is obviously the biggest source of FDI, at over 50%.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>OLD &amp; WISE</h4><p>The Mexican Chamber of Commerce is the oldest commercial institution in the country, and one of the oldest worldwide. Actually, it was founded in 1874 and we have strong experience in business practices thanks to our long history.</p><h4>AREAS OF EXPERTISE</h4><p>The chamber is principally specialized in three sectors of the economy: commerce, services, and tourism. The commercial sector is the most extensive one, especially in the consumer goods domain. The service sector is mostly composed of legal and accountancy advisories. In the tourism sector we principally represent hotels, tourist services in general, and schools and universities related to the tourism field.</p><h4>AREAS FOR INVESTMENT</h4><p>There are large opportunities in many sectors here in Mexico. I think that energy is the most promising one, as well as the automotive sector or the electrical appliances industry.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>MAIN INITIATIVE</h4><p>We provide services to all members of our chamber. We regularly meet with the Mexican and US governments to address important issues. I am proud to say that we are part of the solutions, which are in the best interests of the members of our chamber.</p><h4>PROMISING FUTURE</h4><p>The automobile industry is growing fast, as is the retail industry. Services are also growing. There's a lot of opportunity in Mexico now, not just for the US. I have to clarify that although we are an American chamber of commerce, we have companies from other countries on our books.</p><h4>THE BEST YEAR</h4><p>The fact is that Mexico is a country that is growing and working. There are a lot of opportunities. In 2011, AmCham had the best year ever—and we really believe that we are doing good business. That's proof that investing in Mexico is really worth it. The numbers are good, and it's attractive for foreign investment.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Unilever Mexico is among the 15 largest Unilever operations in the world. If you take into consideration the fact that Unilever draws more than 50% of its global turnover from developing and emerging economies, then Mexico is extremely relevant for our business. Mexico has a lot of potential to grow. If you look at the Mexican consumer and where Mexico is located, we have all the preconditions to grow very fast. That is the current thinking we have within Unilever. We have a very strong presence in the deodorants market, as well as in the food products market—soups, bouillon cubes, and ice cream. We run a very important operation in the shampoo segment, and occupy a good position in soy beverages as well. We are present in several categories and we never stop investing. We represent around 20 brands in total. There are four plants in Mexico. A new plant was opened very recently, and it is going to supply Mexico, Latin America, Europe, and the US.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Mexico is within the top 10 countries for the company's operations. Henkel has begun to focus on emerging markets, which represent 43% of the company's total global sales. Emerging markets are important in terms of potential market size, future opportunities, and investments for the company. The year 2011 marked large investment in every segment. For example, in the laundry and home care segment, we introduced Persil, the flagship brand of the company in Germany. In cosmetics and personal care, we introduced hair coloration Palette under the Schwarzkopf Professional brand. In adhesives technology, we launched initiatives in industrial areas and introduced a new extension of Resistol called Resistol 911. Business doubled in 2011, and all three segments contributed to that growth. The company began operations in Mexico 53 years ago. With experience in the country, we knew that both the company and the Mexican market were ready for new initiatives.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are a consumer products company and strongly depend on innovation. The main reason behind our good performance in 2010 was our robust innovation strategy. We have improved and streamlined the basic components of our disposable diapers, making them thinner and adjustable while not losing any functionality. We applied this practice to many of our different product lines. Also, Mexico performed well economically as a nation, and has bounced back from the difficulties it faced in 2009. We believe we can grow at a rate close to the one we saw in 2010—6% in net sales. In the first half of 2011 the rate was a bit lower, but we believe that in the second half it will be stronger. We are also up against some strong comparisons to 2010 in the second half of 2011. We principally focus our attention on R&amp;D. We have a large R&amp;D section that works on local initiatives and on coordinating and cooperating with Kimberly-Clark worldwide in order to bring the best ideas from markets all over the globe.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The company has strongly positioned itself within the market, focusing its efforts on Mexico City. This has enabled us to be a very strong company. OfficeMax registered high growth rates in 2007 and 2008, when the company adopted a new business strategy to tackle the global financial crisis. We revised product assortments, price lists, and suppliers. OfficeMax also closed a number of stores. Such measures were taken in order to adapt to the changing business climate and enable the company to grow in the future. At the same time, we launched synergy initiatives with our offices in the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. Moreover, we carried out important business activities to develop new products and brands. Our new strategy resulted in the creation of more than 1,000 products, the renegotiation of important contracts, and the establishment of a key partnership; our company is now an official Apple distributor.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>THE MODEL</h4><p>We have created a successful model and developed an attractive commercial package in our stores in order to best take advantage of the opportunities in the popular retail segment. We double our sales revenues every four years, and we are experiencing an annual growth rate averaging 20% per year.</p><h4>DOMESTIC DEMAND</h4><p>Domestic demand is one the engines of Mexico's economy and, considering the rapid population growth, it will continue to be a driving factor. More consumers need a greater number of products in terms of quantity, and more specialized consumers with new needs will need more targeted products and services.</p><h4>FOREIGN INVESTMENT</h4><p>In addition to the skilled labor force and the strategic position of the country, the legal framework in terms of investment is an attractive component of the Mexican economy.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>THE FAMILY</h4><p>The retail business was started in 1970, with my father founding the first supermarket in Jalapa, Veracruz. We went public in 2010, but retain that family-owned feel. We ended 2011 with 218 stores: 182 in Mexico and 36 in the US; in California, Nevada, and Arizona.</p><h4>OPPORTUNITIES</h4><p>The opportunity for the formal retailer to grow is really big. Also, the types of consumers are developing in terms of credit; they are beginning to receive credit opportunities that they probably didn't have in the past, and so we believe that it is going to be a growing market in the next few years.</p><h4>INVESTMENT IDEAS</h4><p>We will be investing in stores and technology. We usually invest close to 7% of our sales revenues. That is capital expenditure for us. Out of that 7%, five points of the seven goes to new stores and two points go into technology and store remodeling. That happens every year.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>MARKET LEADER</h4><p>I think that the most important component necessary to be able to expand internationally is the executive team. Also, the robustness of our organization in Mexico and the fact that we are the market leader has allowed us to start exploring markets outside of the country.</p><h4>THE INDUSTRY</h4><p>The Mexican film industry has been growing in recent years. As a nation, we have been producing between 60 and 70 feature films every year. That is already a good number.</p><h4>INCENTIVES</h4><p>There have been some Mexican fiscal incentives to invest in films that have helped the rebirth of the Mexican film industry. Some years ago it was almost dying, producing just five or six films a year. We are now back to 70. Now that we have a lot of production, we should focus on how to raise the quality of those productions.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>TOURISM POTENTIAL</h4><p>Regarding tourism, Mexico has a very large market. We are next door to one of the largest consumer countries in the world, the US. We have a vast border with the US and a privileged geographical location with natural resources that provide a competitive advantage.</p><h4>IN THE PRESS</h4><p>Excélsior is a historical newspaper established 95 years ago. It is our social responsibility to preserve, improve, and direct the paper. In the communications sector, changes are happening at a rapid pace.</p><h4>COMING YEARS</h4><p>In the next decade, we intend to consolidate the sectors in which we participate. In the next five years, we will gain new access to the domestic market and develop routes for international expansion. There are a number of mature sectors that are ready for expansion, such as tourism and health.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>BIG ENTRANCE</h4><p>We've been in Mexico since 2001, and we entered the market through the acquisition of Bital, a Mexican bank that was up for sale. HSBC already has a big presence in Mexico. In fact, one-third of all HSBC ATMs worldwide are located in Mexico, as well as 12% of all branches. If you consider that HSBC is the second largest bank in the world in terms of retail branches, you'll appreciate that these are huge numbers.</p><h4>EFFICIENCY GAINS</h4><p>Our branch network has decreased by 300 branches, from 1,400 to 1,100. We now have more sales, deposits, credit lines, and better efficiency. We closed some closet branches and opened larger branches instead.</p><h4>DEMOGRAPHICS</h4><p>The banking sector has a very bright future indeed. First of all, Mexico's demographics are very good, because we have a very young population. Around 65% of Mexicans are under the age of 35. This provides a solid growth base with about a million marriages every year for the next 15 or 20 years.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SOLID AS A ROCK</h4><p>I think the Mexican financial system is one of the most solid in the world, and it proved itself during the last financial crisis. The average capitalization rate for Mexican banks is above 16%.</p><h4>MARKET SIGNIFICANCE</h4><p>Mexico is one of the most important markets we have. We have not carried out an acquisition, as we haven't found the right strategic partner we need at the right price. We have, however, continued to invest organically and we have grown in Mexico in a very important way.</p><h4>E-BANKING</h4><p>We have doubled our number of internet customers, but it is still a very small number. The actual number of internet customers is around 250,000. There is a lot of room to grow. People prefer to go to bank branches, believing them to be more secure.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>DOUBLE DIGITS</h4><p>We had double-digit growth in 2011. The main reason for this was that we focused on the brand itself. It is a great brand for internet security and customer service, and typically this is our main strength.</p><h4>ACCEPTING PLASTIC</h4><p>In Mexico, there is always an opportunity to increase coverage because it is a growing market. Today, there are a lot of opportunities to convert an informal economy into a formal economy, and accepting credit cards is part of this valuable process.</p><h4>HIGH-TECH</h4><p>Our customers are changing their behavior and carrying our more transactions online. For us, this also means seeing what our customers' needs are, and what they will be in the future, in order to meet them. The second front is to acquire new prospects in the new age.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>STRONG PARTNERSHIP</h4><p>We have been working with Generali for the last 15 years, and the bank owns 49% of Banorte-Generali. The agreement renewal confirms our successful partnership and demonstrates our desire to continue working together for the next 25 years.</p><h4>CONSOLIDATION</h4><p>The new regulations may lead to consolidation in the market, and some companies may not survive. Conceptually, I believe it will benefit the sector.</p><h4>MOTOR INSURANCE</h4><p>I believe insurance will be compulsory at the federal level in the future. Out of the 20 countries with the largest economies, we are the only country that doesn't require motor insurance. Among all the member countries of the OECD, Mexico is the only one without compulsory motor insurance.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>THE ACQUISITION</h4><p>AXA Seguros acquired ING Seguros three years ago when it was experiencing significant financial difficulties. Despite the financial crisis, we are currently on track with our planned acquisition process. Taking that into account, we are on track in terms of market growth and profits.</p><h4>SHARES</h4><p>If we look at our product lines, we are number one in non-life insurance. We are number two in both motor and health insurance, with market shares of 18% and 19%, respectively. We are number one in property insurance with a 12% market share, and we have 6% of the life insurance market. Over half of our business—55%—is in the corporate segment, principally with SMEs.</p><h4>OPPORTUNITY</h4><p>I think Mexico represents a great opportunity for companies like AXA—the population of the country currently stands at more than 100 million and is growing. GDP per capita is one of the highest in South America, and it is the 13th largest economy in the world.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>STRONG FOUNDATIONS</h4><p>In Mexico the regulations are a little bit more demanding than in the rest of Latin America. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) qualifies and compares the different countries, and Mexico is one of those with a higher standard of regulatory structure.</p><h4>LIFE &amp; NON-LIFE</h4><p>Life now accounts for 44.84% of the premiums in the total market. Non-life is getting a lot of business because of the auto business; auto represents almost 20% of the total market. Even though the insurance industry contributes only a small amount to overall GDP in Mexico—only 1.9%—the industry is growing.</p><h4>CROSSING THE BORDER</h4><p>Our main alternative channel is telemarketing; we have internet sales and relationships with businesses to sell very specific policies. For example, in the north of the country, auto insurance is available for crossing the border.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are a major supplier of products and technology services and systems to the oil and gas industry, including products and services for the drilling, formation, evaluation, completion, and production of oil and natural gas wells. We have been in Azerbaijan for many years now. We came along with a major international oil and gas company when it entered into the Azerbaijani market. In recent years, we have expanded our business to work much more with local companies. It has been very positive and we aim to extend our ties with local companies, establishing technology sharing, common training, and common working relationships, not just on a supplier basis. We see this as a significant opportunity for the important players in Azerbaijan. As one of the world's oilfield service leaders, we work with our partners to lower costs, reduce health, safety, and economic risks, improve productivity, and increase ultimate recovery rates in the oil and gas industry. In terms of our activities in Azerbaijan, we are currently working on several projects in the country, and are developing a plan for the years ahead. We are planning cementing and completion work on the very high-profile wells that are being developed on a very challenging project that will help establish the right relationships.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Ekol Engineering Services was established in 2006 according to an agreement signed with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), which owns 51% of the company, and foreign investor Lancer Services, which owns 49%. The main purpose of the company is to carry out environmental protection services by applying modern technology to the treatment of industrial and human waste, ground water, and oil sludge, and generally overcoming the impact of man-made pollution on the environment through ecological monitoring activities, preparing ecological technical documentation, and other ecological services. Over this period of time we have worked closely with the state authorities of Azerbaijan in order to provide the best environmental and engineering solutions both in oil and gas industrial fields and the country as a whole, successfully improving the ecological position of Azerbaijan. Ekol has contributed to improving and developing ecological, safe, and quality systems, minimizing all factors that might affect human safety, health, and the environment, and minimizing accidents and the use of energy and water according to international standards such as the ISO 18001, ISO 14011, and ISO 9001 certificates, which our company proudly holds.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 2008 we acquired a company called CSM, and when we initially acquired that company it had a contract with BP. That contract was renewed with ASCO for a period of 10 years in July 2009. Over the years, we saw a robust volume of activity until 2010, and then a certain slowdown of activities during 2011. However, we have seen positive indications that 2012 will bring important growth to the sector. We expect activities in 2012 to return to the levels of 2010. ASCO has BP as a sole client in Azerbaijan, and we control all of its in-country logistics and manage the infrastructure that BP has built over the last few years. ASCO has not identified any areas where it sees itself expanding outside the oil and gas sector. In fact, if you look at ASCO's global operations, 95% of them are related to logistics and the oil and gas industry. ASCO is providing integrated logistics solutions to BP in Azerbaijan; we control its pipe yards, warehousing, diesel tanks, transportation in the country, and all the associated quayside operations. If you look at our operations around the globe, it is the same kind of approach; everything is related to these fields. In some cases we perform the execution of the work ourselves, and in other cases we outsource the work via our sub-contractors. I do not believe we have a competitor in the country that can handle all aspects of the logistics that we do.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our company, a legal successor of EUPEC Pipecoatings Azerbaijan LLC, was founded in Azerbaijan in 2002. We are a unique enterprise specializing in pipe insulation and coating in the Caspian region. Early in our operations, we were awarded the contract for Phase I of the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) project. Shortly thereafter, CPC was awarded a contract for the anti-corrosion and concrete coating of pipes under the request of BP/AIOC for the Shah Deniz gas field, followed by Phases II and III of the ACG project. Since its establishment, CPC has been involved in a number of regional projects under the orders of SOCAR, BP, and EUPEC, and we have produced coatings for pipelines of various diameters with a combined length of 2,300 kilometers. Today, CPC is the regional leader in the application of internal and external anti-corrosion coatings, internal pipe blasting, concrete weight coating, anode installation, handling operations, and logistics. CPC has successfully participated in 15 projects important to the region. We have provided anti-corrosion and concrete weight coating services for pipes of various diameters in the ACG and Shah Deniz fields, as well as supported a variety of projects within the framework of our production sharing agreement. At present CPC is performing anti-corrosion and concrete coating for pipes for the Chirag Oil Project at the request of BP/AIOC.</p>]]></sections31>

The name is already well known, because we are a worldwide brand.</p><h4>TIME FOR BUSINESS</h4><p>We are strongly developing the business segment of our operations, because we want to become a leading company in the sector. We have 20 meeting rooms, and we are one of the only hotels in the country with a large amphitheater with the capacity for more than 500 people.</p><h4>FULL HOUSE</h4><p>Kempinski Hotel Badamdar will be full during Eurovision 2012, a very important event for the whole country. We have developed a reasonable and competitive price policy during events like the song competition.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>GLOBAL ICON</h4><p>Sheraton has a very strong reputation with more than 400 properties in 75 countries. Sheraton is one of the largest, most global, and iconic hotel brands in the world. Sheraton stands for a warm welcome and creates a sense of community among travellers who want to stay connected while on the road.</p><h4>FIRST IMPRESSIONS</h4><p>At the Sheraton Baku Airport Hotel, we focus on our key strategic location at the Heydar Aliyev International Airport. Every new arrival first sees the Sheraton hotel, and thus we will help to shape their very initial impressions of the country.</p><h4>NEVER BEFORE</h4><p>The Eurovision Song Contest, the world's largest non-sporting television event, typically attracts more than 100 million viewers and represents an extraordinary opportunity to showcase this beautiful country under the kind of spotlight that it has never experienced before.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>FRESH FACED</h4><p>We did a large refreshing for the whole hotel and its facilities last year. In addition, we invested a lot in the development of our standards to be more international and achieve further success.</p><h4>THIS IS THE YEAR</h4><p>The tourism sector in Azerbaijan has rapidly developed in the last few years, and naming 2011 as the “Year of Tourism“ importantly boosted such development, when the government successfully started implementing large projects; some of them already completed.</p><h4>MORE THAN THAT</h4><p>The Eurovision Song Contest itself will certainly attract a lot of additional tourists to Azerbaijan. Visitors will see that the country has more to show than just its oil and gas industry.</p>]]></sections21>

At the same time, we want to grow in non-cash payment activities, which are being promoted by the government as well.</p><h4>GLOBAL INTEGRATION</h4><p>As the country's economy continues to develop, we need to learn fast to integrate into global business. International cooperation and partnerships are a very useful way to learn.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>GOOD BALANCE</h4><p>Our bank's ratio of interest-bearing assets relative to total assets is one of the highest among all Azerbaijani banks, meaning that NBC bank has done a marvelous job in terms of efficiently balancing its asset allocation.</p><h4>TARGETS</h4><p>We plan to extend the volume of our loan portfolio in the agribusiness, consumer credit, SME, and mortgage segments.</p><h4>FUTURE PRIORITIES</h4><p>Opening correspondent accounts with foreign banks, conducting interbank activities, attracting FDI, and using the rich experience foreign banks can offer should be the priorities for our sector in the future.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>NO FEAR</h4><p>When AFB Bank was established, there were 45 banks operating in Azerbaijan. Joining such an active field with that many competitors may seem a bit surprising. However, we took the initiative relying on our potential to become an innovative bank.</p><h4>CRUCIAL SPECIALIZATION</h4><p>AFB Bank is specialized in corporate, private, and internet banking. We carry out our corporate banking services by financing SMEs as well as projects that are crucial to the development of the country's economy</p><h4>INTO THE FRAY</h4><p>Apart from Baku, we are planning to increase our presence in the regions of Azerbaijan, opening new offices in the main urban centers. Currently, we have three branches outside Baku, and we will open two additional branches and one division in 2012.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>FULLY PRIVATE</h4><p>Azernegliyyatbank, the old name of the bank, was established in 1989 as a commercial bank by various institutions belonging to the Ministry of Transport. Since then the ownership structure of the bank has changed significantly, resulting in the full privatization of the bank by 2005.</p><h4>THE NUMBERS</h4><p>The bank has boosted its credit portfolio by AZN35 million, reaching AZN81 million as of end-2011. Net profits for the year exceeded AZN11 million, up from AZN6.3 million in 2010.</p><h4>SEEING THE POTENTIAL</h4><p>Expressbank sees major potential in this segment, but one that will always be linked to the retail side of our operations. The development of both retail banking and plastic cards will go hand in hand in the future. During 2012 our institution will develop important plans in this regard, such as the creation of our own processing center.</p>]]></sections31>

However, it did not affect it severely, and we can consider those years as a time for readjustment. We went through what many other big banking players did. However, Unibank came out of this period in a stronger position.</p><h4>THE RIGHT TOOLS</h4><p>We have always tried to explore the market for new financial tools and products; innovation has been a key characteristic of our bank.

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4><span></span>MIXING IT UP<br></h4><p>Our facilities are only for construction-related products. Construction chemicals can be divided into two: admixtures, i.e. what is put into concrete to make it flow and ensure durability, and powder products, such as adhesives, concrete repair products, and water proofing. BASF Caspian is the leader in the admixture market.</p><h4>PERSONAL TOUCH</h4><p>BASF Global is not a company in touch with end users. It is only in the construction chemicals division that such a chance is presented. In that respect, we are in touch with end users directly. We have a close relationship with the main construction companies.</p><h4>HOPES FOR EXPORT<br></h4><p>For the moment, our products are intended only to meet local demand. In the future we will export to neighboring countries, like Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Georgia as well.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>AGRICULTURE AWAY!</h4><p>Regarding Azerbaijan, there are no alternatives to agriculture in the post-oil outlook for the country, and the sector should be developed based on high-tech SME agribusiness development. Irrigation is also needed.</p><h4>ENVIRONMENTALLY AWARE<br></h4><p>Environmental impact assessments of infrastructure projects are one of our major areas of activity. In 2009 we completed an environmental monitoring project for Hovsan Wastewater Treatment Plant, where based on strong site investigations, we identified some very important indicators that were then used for the hydraulic modeling of the marine pollution process.</p><h4>GOING ABROAD<br></h4><p>Over the last 10 years ASPI has conducted projects in Georgia, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and Sudan. For instance, there was an Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded agricultural project in Tajikistan, a USAID-funded hydropower project in Georgia, and EU-funded energy and water projects in Central Asia.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4></h4><h4><br></h4><h4>A TRADITION TO UPHOLD</h4><p>Bauer is a huge, 200-year old company that employs over 8,000 people. As for its foundation rigs, they are of the highest quality. Of course, we have competitors such as Casagrande, yet we are a leader in the sector. We currently have 24 rigs in Azerbaijan, and we have some big customers such as the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), Gilan Holding, Azerkorpu, and Avesa Teknika.</p><h4>CRISIS &amp; BACK<br></h4><p>The crisis began in 2008/09, and affected some of our client companies. To a certain extent, the effects could still be felt up until the end of 2010. However, I think that the forecast for 2011 is looking much better, and we will see increasing levels of demand.</p><h4>STATE OF PLAY<br></h4><p>The Azerbaijani construction sector is now in better health than in other countries in the region. There are new buildings being erected all over the country, and the latest heavy machinery is being utilized. However, some countries such as Kazakhstan have larger construction sectors, so there is still a long way to go in Azerbaijan.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The consumption of glass is very much related to the dynamism of the construction sector as a whole. In the local market we are under pressure from competition. The inflation rate in Iran sometimes reaches 20% annually, and as a result the finished cost of our products is going up. Sometimes we have to sell our products at no profit. This is one of the difficulties we face. But currently we can say that the inflation rate is going down a little bit. We were expecting 25%, though now we are expecting 17-18%, or even less.</p><p>The government actually started to build some homes for lower income families. This form of construction activity is going on for these people, but these apartments are very limited in size, and so the consumption of glass will also be very limited. We do not expect the consumption of glass to increase in the real estate market very soon.</p><p>As Kaveh Glass Group, we are increasing our production capacity and there are also other companies that are increasing their production capacities. In the absence of increased demand in the local market, 50% of the glass produced in Iran will be surplus after meeting local demand. As a result, we have to make more efforts to export our products. We are lucky to have neighboring countries in which reconstruction activities are going on. As the largest producer of glass in the Middle East, exporting more is our current target.</p><p>Unfortunately, the cost of energy is going to be increased by 10 to 12 times very soon. It will be a gradual increase, but the present trend suggests that we have to pay 12 times more than what we are paying today for energy, and thus it will be difficult to compete. The cost of energy will probably reach European levels, and so we have to try to minimize our costs in order to stay competitive. Regarding tableware, we export 25% of our production to different countries, and these kinds of products need to be regularly updated. We have to change the designs so that they stay fashionable in the market. By investing more in design, we aim to expand in the tableware market.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have a motto every year in our country that shows the main strategy to be followed by everyone. Last year the motto was to save energy, and this was very good for our activities. This year it is to practice and work harder towards achieving further energy savings. In our business, to ensure the widespread and proper use of insulation material we need the support of the government. According to research, if you spent 3 to 5% extra on any kind of building on insulation and similar materials, the money you save on energy costs will be returned within several months, and over the life of the building you will save a lot of energy. This is a real win-win situation.</p><p>Energy in Iran used to be very cheap and it didn't seem very important. The people and the government did not respect it very much. But these days we are finding that the cost of energy is getting higher, and it is becoming a more valuable product. In the future the government and the people will be paying more attention to saving energy and respecting energy much more.</p><p>At the moment we don't have problems in our market—we still have customers. The problem is that our customers are asking for substandard products. Our manufacturing and production lines are working at full capacity. But if the customer asked for a higher standard product, that would be better for us and our profit margins. It is also good for the customer and the government because the benefit they get will be higher as this is the proper mechanism for insulation. We recently started a lobbying project to motivate the government and the Ministry of Construction to make them put more emphasis on obeying insulation standards.</p><p>We are following projects on making new building panels, which are a mixture of glass wool, plasters, and other materials that are quite low in weight, good at reducing noise, and provide excellent heat insulation. We are looking to diversify our product range according to the needs of the country.<br></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Every one and a half or two years, we have a recession in the building market. This one is related to government efforts to provide low-cost housing, which leads to a price freeze. According to the information that the government provides, every year we need 1.2 million to 1.5 million residential units. If you cannot supply this in one year, for the next year you have another 1.2 million added to demand. For the past two or three years the government has started to construct these types of buildings.</p><p>The state has been giving land to developers, but after the developers finish construction over two or three years they cannot sell the houses for prices higher than the government dictates. So, the contractors are building at a loss. Moreover, the places where these low-cost houses are built are far from the city center and the residents need to have a car or some other kind of transportation in order to get to work. This also decreases the demand for this type of housing. Another constraint is that construction in Tehran is currently limited to four stories in height, which renders it unprofitable. We have some kind of a dilemma between the private construction industry and the government's price regulations, and this is inhibiting healthy growth.</p><p>In addition to constructors, people who want to renew their homes and those who still have steel or wooden windows are our target audience. PVC is not usable in Iran because of the weather and geographical conditions. Aluminum is much more durable. It's more expensive to have aluminum, but it lasts longer and is renewable. You can powder coat it or decorate it or change the accessories, and it becomes like new.</p><p>Most of the new projects being built belong to the government, and the constructors on these sites are facing bureaucratic delays. As the producers of construction materials, we also have to take this situation into account.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>After the Revolution, the Ministry of Health sought to produce all our medicine inside the country, and everybody was looking to achieve self-sufficiency. We invested a lot of money in machinery for the production of pharmaceuticals, and after that we generated a scheme that was very unique internationally. The government tried to support us and after that we had very good, high-quality technology and very high-quality products. Currently, around 94% of the units we consume we produce locally. By value it is a different story, because the products we import from outside are very expensive and rare. We spend a lot of money to obtain the 6% we need from exports. By value, 75% we produce locally, while 25% by value is imported.</p><p>In our company, around 80% of our products go to the market by brand name rather than under a generic name. We have promotional activities, have a marketing department, and visit Iranian doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies to promote our products. Doing so is the only way to be in the market, because there is a lot of competition in the local market. We have to go to the market with a brand name, and the brand name is not only the brand of the product. The brand of the company is also very important.</p><p>Frankly speaking, Iranian pharmaceutical companies are not known to multinationals. Just like many celebrities, companies tend to think that they're the best and never see the others. If they knew about our company, the next morning they would buy our shares and discuss under-license production with us. Iran is a vast country with a population of 75 million. All multinationals in the future will be eager to discuss the possibility of making products under-license with us, but they are as yet unfamiliar with the country.</p><p>At the present time Jaber Ebne Hayyan exports to neighboring countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Tajikistan, and Ukraine. We also export our products to Africa, and gradually the number of markets is going to increase. The competition in other countries is very intense as our company has to compete with others. Our quality will prove who we are gradually in the future, and it takes time to be a great rival in the world market.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span></span>The government introduced a population control strategy in the 1980s, and so we have seen lower population growth in recent years. On the other hand, the number of pharmaceutical manufacturers has increased over the past 30 years enormously. A professionally educated workforce has increased, because a lot of universities have been established. And the concentration of the pharmaceutical industry in the production of new formulations has increased. All of this has resulted in an increase in the number of pharmaceutical products on the market, which leads to closer competition between the companies, and this has had an effect on our group. The government's new policy has resulted in companies trying to improve their standards and quality in order to compete with each other in the market. Sobhan Darou has emerged as one of the best-known companies in terms of quality because we worked hard to upgrade our facilities and products.</p><p>We have full documentation in the pharmaceutical industry right now. We decided to import knowledge from outside to our factories and obtain improved documentation procedures and better production processes. Based on this work, we can think of exporting to other regions when the day comes. For international pharmaceutical companies, the advantage is that the finished products are priced lower here in Iran than in other countries, and because of the strict regulations and supervision of the government over the industry and our comparatively high quality. Compared with neighboring countries, Iran has greater potential to absorb investment in the industry. The production process is cheaper here in Iran because we have a lot of facilities and human capital here, so it will be cheaper than other countries, especially compared to our neighbors. When the finished production price is lower, the company will be more competitive.</p><p>Our government is already requiring importers to produce pharmaceutical products domestically after a few months of imports. That is a good choice because it increases the eagerness of companies to produce under license. A population of 70 million plus is a big market for the region. When international companies are not capable of exporting, they finally decide to produce these products locally, and so they search for a good company to work with.</p><p>We have a development project that will be ready in the next two years. It has a lot of good standards, and follows WHO guidelines. So, we foresee that 20 to 30% of our estimated turnover will be from exports.</p>]]></sections11>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>IKCO, generally speaking, recruits and hires the best engineers from Iranian universities. In addition to that, we have also many Iranian employees having degrees from international universities with high rankings. At IKCO we cultivate expertise in different fields through different subsidies in each area. For instance, we have a department called new product development. In this department we have different experts for the design of passenger cars, and for styling and engineering. We further develop such expertise through training in this department. We have another major company called SAPCO that is responsible for the management of our supply chain. It supervises the 500 or so suppliers who work for IKCO and provides us with the components required for production. Around 5 million parts per day should be fed into this production system. In order to be able to do the logistics function required for such a big system, we need expert and qualified engineers, which we prefer to cultivate internally.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I think the secret behind the success of my company is its management model, which also includes human resources management. We have a high retention rate when it comes to personnel. We put an effort into cultivating expertise and then keeping it. Behran is very attractive to young employees, and we are able to keep talented people in  the company for a long time. Most of our employees are university graduates, and there is a lot of camaraderie in our company, a lot of friendship. We offer job security, respect and good career prospects. We also offer an attractive package of salary and allowances. This is how we keep talented experts in our company.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The skill level of employees in the pharmaceutical sector is very good, but we need more education in the managerial aspect of the industry. Hopefully, the holding company and also Exir have started to enroll some employees in MBA courses. This has helped them become educated in different aspects of the industry; not just pharmaceuticals but also marketing and finance, and strategic aspects. Also, some other fields, for example pharmacoeconomics, pharmcoepidemiology, and regulatory sciences. These are what we need more than just knowledge specific to pharmaceuticals.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Training is the key and one of our core focuses. That is why we only recruit university graduates, the brightest coming from the University of Tehran, Sharif, Allameh, and Shahid Beheshti. We place a great care on the continuous professional development of our employees. In fact we grouped with a number of high caliber academics to form and found the Iranian Business School, which is going to be established in Iran. Thus, we will provide MBA-style, executive training for our management. We did a lot of staff training abroad, sending them to Dubai and Istanbul. As I said, we value our employees a lot and having a low staff turnover is key to our operational consistency.<br></p><p>We also put special emphasis on employing more women, mainly as a result of the changing trend in Iran over the last 10 years. There are more women going to universities than boys and they do very well at our entrance exam, much better than the men I must admit. Men have to do two years of military service; that's why there is a lag between them, and when they come out they want to work for themselves, they do not want to work for someone else. The demand for working for a bank is greater among women and it is treated as a prestigious, more secure and safer job for them, and that is why they apply.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>I am not satisfied with the position of women in business in Iran, but it is better than before. We believe that the main point for the woman in our culture, as Muslims, is that a woman has to protect her family. On the other hand, as the government, when you are going to spend money on their education and during these last years more than 65% of university entrants are women, they have to pay this debt back to society. We sometimes see that women lose their enthusiasm about their job after they get married. We have to change this mentality. What we need is more entrepreneurship by women, therefore I am teaching a course on female entrepreneurship.</p><p>To create entrepreneurs we have to let women run their businesses by themselves. Maybe they need some capital, of course, but they can do it together with three, four, or five people. Maybe one person has the idea and another person has the capital. They have to come together. As the Women in Business Initiative under the Tehran Chamber of Commerce we have some advisory meetings here to inform them when they want to start a corporation together.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>GLOBAL NETWORK</h4><p>UPS is obviously a global company and we go where our customers ask us to go. We've seen more and more of our customers moving operations here, and making investments in Turkey. We began to see that Turkey was a “must have“—one of the main markets.</p><h4>AT THE CROSSROADS</h4><p>It is clichéd to say, but Turkey really is a crossroads. The EU is on our doorstep. There is great access to Africa and the CIS region. There is great physical connectivity as well as cultural connectivity throughout the region.</p><h4>TALENT</h4><p>I think Turkey could be an important global source of talent. Employees here are educated and highly motivated. They are the kind of people we can use not only in Turkey but anywhere else in the world.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>LEADING THE WAY</h4><p>When DHL came to Turkey in 1981 it opened Turkey up to the rest of the world, and the rest of the world to Turkey. We are now the leading express company and we have about a 50% market share in inbound and outbound documents and shipments, and we offer services to many destinations.</p><h4>AFTER THE CRISIS</h4><p>There has been a different shift in the last few years—the crisis saw traditional European and US markets shrink or stop growing, and Turkish entrepreneurs started looking to new markets such as Africa, the Middle East, and the Far East.</p><h4>CHALLENGES</h4><p>The main challenges are those faced by exporters and importers. The importers are doing well because the Turkish currency is strong, and therefore it encourages an inflow of goods. The Turkish population is hungry to buy anything. However, the challenge to exporters is that the Turkish currency's strength makes Turkish goods uncompetitive.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>DEMOGRAPHICS</h4><p>Due to the demographics of Turkey, with families distributed across the country in rural and urban areas, there is a big need for C2C shipment handling. Our branches distribute packages and we have close to 800 around the country. Given the number of branches, we have the biggest distribution network in Turkey after PTT, the national post.</p><h4>REGIONAL OPPORTUNITY</h4><p>I think Turkey logistically is situated as a commercial hub for the Balkans, Eastern Europe, the CIS, and the Middle East. Manufacturing quality and Turkish entrepreneurial skills allowed Turkish companies to establish good relations in the neighborhood. This growth trend is something that we aim to be a part of.</p><h4>TARGETS</h4><p>We will work on our visual identity and improve our efficiency by including more automation into our methods. We now have state-of-the-art handheld terminals and we are always looking at new technology to streamline our business.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>GUIDING HAND</h4><p>The association came into operation to introduce industry to the importance of freight forwarding and logistics. The Turkish transport industry was previously dominated by trucking companies due to the nature of foreign trade that Turkey had at that time—between Europe and the Middle East. We decided that the market shouldn't be controlled solely by truckers, but by freight forwarders also.</p><h4>MULTIMODAL</h4><p>Turkey has a huge potential to be a multimodal hub between Europe and the Middle East, but we need a strong rail network to make this a reality. The air industry is strong with major airfreight activities having developed over the last five years.</p><h4>THREE WISHES</h4><p>Firstly, we would like to see the quality of the services our members offer increase. This is directly linked to their profitability. Secondly, we would like to see better customs regulations that enable Turkey to become a logistics hub in the region. Finally, we would like to see more logistics-orientated investments such as centers linked into the railway network throughout the country.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>A MIRACLE</h4><p>Turkey's economic growth in 1Q 2011 will be second only to China. With an increasingly prosperous middle class and a young, dynamic population this country is very promising. The tourism sector alone has undergone huge development, as has retail,  which has opened up many opportunities for foreign investments.</p><h4>IN HOT DEMAND</h4><p>Over the crisis period, the management of Istanbul's prime Yapı Kredi Plaza experienced difficulties in renting office space for $14 per square meter. The rent has doubled since. After the crisis we have seen many developments, yet due to the continuing lack of space office prices have skyrocketed. Istanbul is number 17 in the table of occupancy cost worldwide.</p><h4>REGIONAL SIGNIFICANCE</h4><p>Our nearest competitor is 50% below us in terms of revenue. We have been involved in many large deals recently. We give strategic advice as a one-stop shop for real estate to large multinationals. Our operations here are very important for the company as a whole, and that is because of the huge potential of the country.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>FOREIGN CAPITAL FLOW</h4><p>Commercial real estate took off in the second half of the 1980s, beginning in Istanbul. It was financed by local capital up until 2004-2005. When Turkey's membership application to the EU was announced, a lot of foreign investment began to flow into Turkey and real estate.</p><h4>BOUNCING BACK</h4><p>During the crisis, office rental prices dropped around 20-25% overall. Some districts in Istanbul saw decreases of 40%. Existing building stock is also very old in Turkey. So, companies need new buildings in terms of infrastructure, security, and the earthquake issue. The regeneration of old buildings is now necessary, and companies have begun to allocate budgets to this. In that sense, the office market looks prominent.</p><h4>GROWTH SECTORS</h4><p>There are sectors that are bound to grow. Hotels are one of them. The hotel industry is undersupplied in Turkey's cities. Resort hotels, however, are oversupplied. The city hotel market is going to see major development. We saw this in the office market when we first began business in Turkey.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>ISTANBUL BLOOMING</h4><p>Istanbul is one of the region's most important cities, and its location creates a uniqueness unseen elsewhere. For the last five years we have seen huge growth in the number of residential projects across the city. In the near future, we are anticipating large transport projects across Istanbul. This will lead to an expansion of type A and type A+ office developments.</p><h4>A HARD BARGAIN</h4><p>Sale prices in Turkey are generally considered higher than in other countries, and the balance between yield and sale price is slightly skewed. However, when you consider the strength of the sector in terms of risk, this picture changes considerably. The last two years of the crisis proved to foreign investors that Turkey is resilient.</p><h4>FRANCHISE IS THE WORD</h4><p>A nationwide franchise network means we see first hand the investment opportunities present, and evaluate them using local know-how. This then benefits our clients. Reha Medin has franchise offices across Turkey, as well as in the US and Germany, allowing us the best access to information from America and Europe.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>THE DESTINATION</h4><p>Tourism is booming here. The economy is also growing rapidly, and Istanbul is firmly on the map. The government is heavily promoting the destination. There is even an advertisement for Turkey as a tourist destination in Times Square, and this really displays the commitment the government is putting into this venture.</p><h4>THE RIGHT PEOPLE</h4><p>Our focus is on training and hiring the right people. We operate beautiful hotels, such as the hotel I manage here on the shores of the Bosphorus, with excellent facilities such as pools and spas. The emphasis we put on staff is really what distinguishes us.</p><h4>MICE &amp; MORE</h4><p>The potential for Istanbul is great in every segment, not just for MICE tourism. This is a very dynamic hotel. There are people speaking many different languages here in the lobby. We have been able to capture all segments of the market, including the corporate segment, which is booming.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>INCREDIBLE POPULARITY</h4><p>Istanbul is an incredibly popular destination now. It's very trendy to come here. I have a house in New York where I stay twice a year for up to two months. Everybody there is crazy about Istanbul as well.</p><h4>PERSONAL TOUCH</h4><p>The fact that I, as the owner, was so involved in the process of the hotel's development every step of the way has delivered a unique quality to the hotel. I get personally involved with the guests, and treat them as if they were guests in my own home.</p><h4>CELEBRITY FACTOR</h4><p>We have had a huge range of celebrities stay with us, and I have found them to be very charming and no one was capricious or difficult. Kevin Costner felt terrible that he didn't have a gift for me, and ended up giving me his glasses! Paris Hilton also stayed with us, and was just one of many celebrities who have felt at home here.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>SECRET TO SUCCESS</h4><p>The magic of our success comes from our high occupancy rate, which is approximately 80% on average. This is a result of our focus on customer satisfaction. After we rent the rooms, we focus on service. We know that the biggest advertisement is a customer who leaves the hotel happy.</p><h4>UNSINKABLE</h4><p>The Titanic brand first started with the iconic Titanic Deluxe Beach &amp; Resort in Antalya. It was designed to look like a cruise ship, so both the design and the name is recognizable. Right after we established this hotel, the brand began to establish a reputation both domestically and locally for its high quality of service.</p><h4>FULL STEAM AHEAD</h4><p>In concert with the ITB tourism fair in Berlin, we are going to open our new hotel, Titanic Berlin, with 226 rooms. This will be our first hotel in the international arena. Our international investments will continue. We are planning to reach 10 hotels in the near future.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>ROOM TO IMPROVE</h4><p>The tourism business seems like it's growing very fast, but we need to have a higher capacity. We should and we can do more. If we provide good service for guests, they'll come back year after year.</p><h4>DESTINATION ANTALYA</h4><p>There are really good hotels in Antalya the like of which you cannot find anywhere else in Europe. We have the sea, historical places, and nature, yet other places do too. The difference can only be the service. Turkish people are hospitable— it's part of our culture.</p><h4>INSTANTLY RECOGNIZABLE</h4><p>When people see a hotel, house, or shopping mall project, we want to have a style that people recognize as Utopia's. This has been the case for the construction we've carried out over the last decade, including the hotel.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SUPPLY &amp; DEMAND</h4><p>Over the last 30 years Turkey has been tackling the issue of demand versus supply. At the time when universities were originally set up, they were mostly for the elite. Now we've realized that we need universities to appeal to the middle classes as well.</p><h4>GETTING THERE</h4><p>I think we will eventually catch up with the West in the next 30 years. More [Turkish] universities will get into the top 200 universities in the world within the next 10 years, and hopefully the top 100 in 30 years.</p><h4>THE NEXT STEP</h4><p>First we were a local social science university, and now we're a comprehensive Istanbul university. The next step is to be a comprehensive national university, and after that we aim to become a comprehensive regional university.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>FREEDOM OF CHOICE</h4><p>We believe that if you can choose what you want to study, you will be happier and more productive in what you study. Sabancı was the first university to start such a program in a serious way, and we upheld this point of view alone for many years.</p><h4>FREEDOM OF SPEECH</h4><p>We believe freedom is the most important factor in education, especially higher education. You cannot be innovative if you can say one thing but not another. If you are afraid to say something, to follow a certain path, or to make a certain assertion, then you will be forever stifled.</p><h4>INTERNATIONALIZING</h4><p>We are putting a lot of effort into the internationalization of our university. We want the level of foreign students to reach 15%, but for now it's only in the single digits. We're doing well on the Erasmus exchange programs, with 160 of our students going to Europe and 170 European students coming to study here yearly.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>COMPETITIVE SYSTEM</h4><p>In 2010 over 1.5 million young people applied to enter institutions of higher education. Out of these, only about 35% were able to enter university or vocational school. Young people are motivated and want higher education, but are unable to enter the system.</p><h4>REWARDING BUSINESS</h4><p>The excitement of being part of the process of building an institution of higher education is great. To be able to contribute to the needs of higher education in Turkey is a very rewarding and challenging endeavor.</p><h4>CENTER OF EXCELLENCE</h4><p>The university has the mission of establishing a higher education research center of excellence focusing on health sciences and medicine. In addition to curative medicine and related health science disciplines, we value the holistic approach that draws in the contribution, perspectives, and strengths of other disciplines into human health and well being.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SUSTAINABLE AMBITION</h4><p>We've expanded our storage and supply business throughout the Middle East, Black Sea, and Caspian regions, handling railways, ships, and trucks. We've now begun investing in biodiesel as well. We put together an accredited biodiesel processing plant where we're looking to produce cleaner energy and reduce emissions.</p><h4>GULF OF EXPERIENCE</h4><p>Gulf is one of the newer projects that the group has undertaken, starting in 2004. The Gulf brand is present in more than a hundred countries. Now we're bringing that giant into the global market through the exclusive arrangements that we have, and then servicing the inland market of the country.</p><h4>THE CEYHAN HUB</h4><p>There are many natural hubs around the world: Houston, Rotterdam, Singapore, and so on. Ceyhan is also on the way to becoming a global energy hub, and the government has been working hard to promote that since the early 2000s. There are pipelines and also an industrial zoning project taking place, with power plants and refineries, all aimed at transforming Ceyhan into a hub that provides for the trading of oil.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>RESPONSIBILITY</h4><p>Starpet aims to apply effective environmental policy and reflects environmental awareness throughout the company. Our market share is expanding in the fuel distribution sector—with 450 dealerships—and we are looking to give back more through social responsibility projects for the good of the country.</p><h4>WIDE RANGING</h4><p>We want to combine our domestic know-how with a more international reach. We are proud of our expansion into logistics, mineral oil production, and the development of Stargas, enabling us to meet the LPG needs of our customers. Within its own structure, this company is now able to produce and present a wide range of products.</p><h4>THE TAX ISSUE</h4><p>Despite the 3.9% decrease in total oil consumption in 2010, the amount of indirect taxes gained through total oil sales increased by 20% to TL35 billion due to rises in excise tax and VAT. Turkey has the most expensive rates for petrol among all EU member states, at around ‚¬1.90 per liter.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>MIRACLE GROWTH</h4><p>In Turkey, there are more than 53 distribution companies, and we are in the top 10. We have 410 branches around different regions in Turkey. This can be regarded as a miracle to grow with this kind of success in four or five years.</p><h4>NO BOUNDARIES</h4><p>Our goal is to be in every part of Turkey. Additionally, we recently opened a distribution branch in Iraq. We have three stations there that were all opened in 2011. So another goal is to have stations throughout Iraq. We are the only foreign retailer in that market, and each of our three stations is the number one in its region.</p><h4>POTENTIAL IN THE MED</h4><p>For the next 10 years, I believe that the Mediterranean region, especially Mersin and Ceyhan, will become petroleum hubs in Turkey. I believe the reason is Turkey's geographical location, which is important because of its role as a connector between the Middle East and Europe. I believe that new pipelines will be established soon.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>REGIONAL SIGNIFICANCE</h4><p>The powder coating industry is significant in Turkey as well as in Europe. Turkey's powder coating sector is ranked third in Europe because we have a strong household appliance industry, automotive industry, and metal industry, and there's a shift from Europe to Turkey in a lot of these areas, be it in metal fixtures, metal furniture, or automotive parts.</p><h4>DIFFERENTIATION</h4><p>At Jotun we have an international identity with different R&amp;D centers around the world, and so we're very good in innovation. Jotun is also known for its consistent high levels of quality. This is especially important in powder painting, which is more difficult and complicated than liquid paint, and so quality issues are very important.</p><h4>PLANS FOR THE FUTURE</h4><p>We're positive and optimistic about Turkey's economic growth and stability. That will keep getting better and stronger, provided we stay clear of any global or regional crises. And we have to grow because we have to keep providing jobs for a young population.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>BRAND TURKEY</h4><p>With our brand we decided to aim for Azerbaijan first. In those markets we saw that a Turkish brand name was more trusted than a Chinese brand name. This allowed us to sell our products to markets where Chinese products were seen as untrustworthy.</p><h4>STRONG LOCAL PRODUCERS</h4><p>The top five companies in the sector have around 80% of the total market; 30% are domestic products and 70% imported products. Turkey is one of the few countries producing UPS systems in Europe, as the local producers are strong here. We position our self as third in these top five companies.</p><h4>POTENTIAL</h4><p>Turkey has great potential, as you know. While foreign companies are entering the Turkish market and forming partnerships, we cannot withdraw from our domestic commitments. We are increasing our sales to SMEs in Turkey.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>CREATING ADVANTAGES</h4><p>As the domestic market grew so did we, and year-by-year our sales gradually increased. We were a family-owned company until 2003, when Schott decided to buy in. So now we are Schott-Orim. We have the biggest capacity in Schott Global, holding 40% of the Turkish market and 25% of the European market.</p><h4>THE RATIO</h4><p>Previously the ratio stood at 75% for exports and 25% for domestic consumption. Now 60% of our product is for export and 40% is for domestic consumption. Turkish customers are doing very well because Western European producers are moving their production either to Poland or Turkey, making Turkey a more important country for business.</p><h4>GROWING DEMAND</h4><p>All the big players are trying to come to the country. For example, Whirlpool partnered with Vestel, and others keep investing in Turkey. Arçelik is a big Turkish player, and the sector is strong from that perspective too. Every year there are 500,000 marriages with a demand for new houses, and that means the domestic market is growing.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>MILESTONES</h4><p>We have been ranked as one of the fastest growing technology companies by Deloitte both in Turkey and the region. GittiGidiyor has three founders, and some other shareholders. eBay became a minority shareholder in 2007, and this can be mentioned as a milestone.</p><h4>BIG SELLERS</h4><p>If you look from a quantity point of view, video games are traded a lot on the site. From a volume perspective in terms of the overall value of sales, then electronic goods, clothing and accessories, and cosmetics are the biggest movers.</p><h4>VISIONS</h4><p>Our vision is to make people believe that e-commerce is part of their daily life. In December 2010 we had 10 million unique visitors to the site, who made a total of 20 million visits. This equates to over 200 million visits yearly. The department chain store Boyner experiences around 35 million walk-ins over a year. This gives you an idea of the traffic we have. We do not define our business as “online“ or “offline“—we simply want to be the busiest shopping point.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>TRUST BUILDING</h4><p>In addition to classifieds, we have a platform that brings together buyers and sellers, where buyers can purchase goods with their credit cards. I believe our success comes primarily from the user experience and the trust built over years in our brand. Our platform allows buyers to find what they are looking for, and sellers to post their products easily.</p><h4>THE MIX</h4><p>Our site is mostly known and used for real estate, either renting or buying, and also for cars. We are also number one in several other categories. In industry and heavy equipment we have close to 40,000 listings for factory equipment, engines, excavators, construction vehicles, and so on. We also have a large retail segment.</p><h4>THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT</h4><p>Right now, the overall number of internet users is around 28 million. With 50% of the population below 29 years of age the penetration rate is expected to increase. Around 3 million people use e-commerce platforms to purchase goods online, so by our estimates we could expect growth of between 8 and 10 times.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>TIPPING THE BALANCE</h4><p>About 75% of our customers are female. This is unique because most Turkish e-commerce was dominated by male buyers before Groupon. We have proved that women can embrace online shopping, although we do also have a considerable number of male shoppers.</p><h4>HAND AND FOOT</h4><p>In Turkey, a lot of emphasis is put on customer service generally, and when you walk into a store it is normal to be followed and waited on. We must then transfer this expectation into the online shopping world.</p><h4>SWITCHING STRATEGIES</h4><p>US Groupon sells a voucher for $40 worth of anything for $20. When we tried that here it did not sell as well as when you define what that $40 can buy for you. The customer here was suspicious of that deal. We therefore switched our strategy to make what our customers were buying more obvious and restrictive.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>NICHES</h4><p>The development of the technology we produce came as a result of the lack of technology in the marine industry at that time. We now provide airtime for more than 2,000 vessels worldwide. We have developed close ties with clients and are distributing safety and sailing equipment for our partners in the UK and Norway.</p><h4>OUT OF THIS WORLD</h4><p>We are the local partner of Inmarsat in Turkey. Inmarsat launches satellites that provide coverage for the entire world via digital technology. It is the only company that launches these kinds of satellites. Other satellites have provided communication only to landmasses.</p><h4>A WIRELESS FUTURE</h4><p>Everything will be wireless. We will even be able to charge telephones and other electrical devices without wires, and this will revolutionize the way we work. My sons will begin to take care of technological developments and I will focus on the establishment of companies to deal with new projects.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>WIDE SPREAD</h4><p>Telpa is a worldwide award winning GSM distributor and has the most widespread dealership network in Turkey. We sell Samsung mobiles, high-quality original accessories, and Avea operator products to 3,600 dealers and 6,200 shops directly every month.</p><h4>CONSUMER HABITS</h4><p>Turkish consumers appreciate added value in advanced and complex products. They are open to trying new things, new features, new applications, and replacing their phones frequently. This consumer behavior is shaping how technology develops.</p><h4>BLUE SKY</h4><p>My [R&amp;D] strategy is to divide up the budget, for example, if I sign over $1 million, I ask for a 20 times return on $700,000, with the other $300,000 earmarked for blue-sky projects. I don't mind how that money is spent, and I don't ask for a schedule—buy a car if you need to, I don't mind, but I want a return on the $700,000.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>HIGH-SPEED GROWTH</h4><p>Turkey, as a bridge between large markets, has become one of the fastest growing economies in the world. SAP Turkey was the only branch of the global firm that was able to grow in double digits in 2009 and 2010, as well as in the first quarter of 2011 year-on-year.</p><h4>CHANGING FACES</h4><p>The software industry in Turkey will experience a similar transformation as seen in Japan, Germany, and the US in terms of a software over hardware-focused IT sector. The rise of the software sector is significant for us, and we expect our market share to increase.</p><h4>THE WAITING GAME</h4><p>Turks do not act impatiently when implementing new technologies, and first prefer to wait and observe the experiences of other countries. For SAP products and software technology, the same products that are demanded in Germany and other Western countries are not demanded here. Turkey is watching though.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>“If one had but a single glance to give the world, one should gaze on Istanbul.“ Adopting Alphonse de Lamartine's phrase to our topic would be a great injustice to both the great poet and the great city. Nevertheless, I will give it a try. Healthy financial markets, solid growth prospects, and a unique geographical location present Istanbul with the potential to be a global financial hub. The progress that Turkey achieved in recent years on macroeconomic stability, especially financial stability, is quite remarkable. Moreover, a young and skilled labor force, a dynamic economy, a lower cost of doing business, and an alluring lifestyle are key qualities that make Istanbul an attractive location. On the way to providing the necessary elements to launch Istanbul as a financial center, the ongoing structural problems of Turkey have to be addressed and resolved. Any progress made on this front would spill over to other sectors and result in higher productivity and an enhanced growth potential. Once the aftershocks of the global crisis ease, major financial actors will find Istanbul quite attractive in order to expand their operations at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. With its vibrant economy, Istanbul emerges as a leading candidate to assume the role of an international financial center, provided that the initial conditions are put in place effectively and sustained permanently.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I think the potential is definitely there, but in my opinion being a financial center is more than just having all the sector companies with their offices in tall buildings in and around Istanbul. The regulations and the fiscal framework should be arranged in such a way that the financial center attracts foreign and domestic investors as market participants. The integration of our markets and fund platforms with other global and/or regional centers is, in my opinion, critically important. In short, our  stock market, our derivatives market, exchanges, and mutual fund platforms all need to be integrated with the domiciles of potential global investors. There is a lot to be done in terms of the integration of our custody system, settlements, regulatory framework, and fiscal framework. Equally important is the ability to attract and create high-quality human capital in the finance sector. I believe Istanbul has a strong advantage in this area.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Istanbul has a huge unfulfilled potential. It was a massive metropolitan city long before many current global centers even existed. It is one of the top five most important centers in the world, surrounded by huge resource rich markets on every side, from Russia, to the Middle East, the GCC, Iran, North Africa, and Europe. Istanbul truly has the potential to become a financial center, and we shouldn't disregard the city's “excitement factor“ when considering its potential. I believe Istanbul's realization of its potential will come about naturally, yet a lot of work is required to make the transition smooth. Work needs to be done on laws and regulations, as well as in relation to education, especially in the English language.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Istanbul is a very good location for business and it has always been like that throughout its history. You can fly to Tokyo in 10 hours, and to New York and Johannesburg also in 10 hours. You can have a business meeting with someone in Tokyo in the morning and with someone from New York in the evening. It's just right in the middle of those time zones. Istanbul has a European character and a Middle Eastern/Asian character as well. It's a real city with a great wealth of culture and history. It has a good quality of life, it's sophisticated, and the infrastructure is always improving. It has a great climate. In addition, people are much more educated than they used to be in the past. Many more people can speak English and other languages. It's a young and dynamic population. There is a highly advanced health sector in Turkey and quality international schools and universities. That being said, it's important to have a target such as being a financial center, and I think that target should enable to create an industrial center in Anatolia, not just remain as a financial center like Ireland or Iceland. If that target is accepted, then I'm sure the growth of Turkey will be incredible.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Istanbul has a very large potential. The government is now taking certain steps and the city will now begin to be identified more internationally as a place with great potential to become a financial center. Istanbul has a strong, innovative banking system, and technologically it is strong and innovative. The equity market is one of the largest in the area from Eastern Europe to Singapore. With the developed equity and fixed income markets that we have, derivatives will also take off quickly. We have a well-educated workforce in the financial sector, and the geographic position of the country can also not be overlooked. It is a hugely diversified nation. Many Turkish companies are becoming international, and strong infrastructure together with good standards of living will contribute to making Istanbul a strong financial center.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Starting from April 1, 2011 Coface Turkey became the headquarters for countries in the East Mediterranean and Middle East. Another platform covers Russia and the CIS countries, and there is also an African platform. Turkey was chosen as it has a diverse and capable workforce, and logistically speaking it is in a great place. There are lots of multinational countries that choose Turkey as a hub for the same reason. In general, Turkey has good relations with its neighbors, and this also makes life easier for us to conduct business in those places too. Coface has been in Turkey since the end of 1997, and since the end of 2006 Coface Insurance or “Sigorta“ has been operating in the country. Coface is proud to be a part of Turkey's entrance into credit insurance because before that only Turkish ExIm Bank was dealing with credit insurance for exporters. Coface has helped a lot to establish a credit insurance industry in Turkey, together with Garanti Sigorta, which is now called Eureko. We have in fact, along with the Turkish directorate of insurance, helped to shape the industry.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Turkey belongs to a sub-region called META: Middle East, Turkey, and Africa. It is under the bigger EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) region. Under EMEA there are three sub-regions, one of them is Europe, the second one is Russia and the CIS, and the third one is META. For some others companies it is classified as MENA, but we have the “T“ for Turkey. Also, most of the management for the META region, including the META director, are based in Istanbul. It is our regional headquarters. For Intel, Turkey means lots of things. We think Turkey has some very unique characteristics that make it a big growth country for the IT sector. The first characteristic is its young population. As you know, nearly 60% or 65% of the population is under 32 years of age. We have 18 million to 19 million people within student age, from kindergarten to high school. Secondly, when you look at the economic indicators, all of the analysts are forecasting that Turkey will have the strongest growth among the 12 main emerging countries. This combination signals strong potential. Turkish people like to use cutting-edge technology.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Turkey presents numerous opportunities. It has a dynamic business environment, good quality of talent, a young population, and a growing economy. One of our four Coca-Cola international headquarters is in Istanbul. More than 90 companies are managed from here. Around 15 years ago Turkey ranked 80th among the 206 countries that Coca-Cola operates in. Now it is 13th. There has been huge growth for Coca-Cola in the past 10 years, more than doubling its business in Turkey. Our bottling partner, Coca-Cola İçecek (CCI), is publicly traded on the Istanbul Stock Exchange and is the sixth biggest bottling operation globally in the Coca-Cola system. CCI manages nine other countries other than Turkey, in the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Middle East, and Pakistan. Coca-Cola Turkey is one of the most talent-exporting countries in the Coca-Cola system. We have 46 mid- to senior-level executives outside the country working for the system. We have best practices in a few of areas, including marketing, sales, supply chain, and sustainability.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>UPPING THE VOLUME</h4><p>Travel volume is increasing in double-digit terms every year. Kazakhstan's air travel market was hit very hard during the recession, though we are now reaching pre-crisis levels again. We have seen a massive jump in 2010 compared to previous years.</p><h4>SEASONALITY</h4><p>There is seasonality in the Kazakhstani air travel market. The winter months see less travel, while the main travel period is between May and October. We focus on business/corporate travelers, but of course we are trying to develop other leisure and educational traffic volumes as well.</p><h4>E-GROWTH</h4><p>We solely use e-tickets. Technically, Kazakhstan is already a very advanced nation. Internet usage is flourishing, yet there is still room to grow when you compare the figures from here to those in Europe.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>NEW PASTURES</h4><p>When I first took this position, the majority of passengers were flying out of Almaty. However, now the oil and gas segments are developing, there is an influx of passengers from west Kazakhstan.</p><h4>A TYPICAL PROFILE</h4><p>We see a high level of small entrepreneurs and SME owners travelling on our flights. For example, many travel to Europe to purchase anything from automobiles, to wine, and other products.</p><h4>MOVING UP</h4><p>E-sales will only grow. I find it remarkable how e-commerce is developing in this country, Russia, and the rest of the CIS. Next year it is expected that 41% of the population will be using the internet.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>THE LAUNCH</h4><p>Etihad Airways launched services between Abu Dhabi and Almaty in December 2008. Since then, commercial ties between the UAE and Kazakhstan have been significantly strengthened, with several major investment projects being announced in that period.</p><h4>COMPETETIVE MARKET</h4><p>It's a competitive market out there, but we're aiming to strengthen our cargo operations.  We'll do this by optimizing cargo capacity on our Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft, which currently operate the routes to and from Kazakhstan.</p><h4>FINAL DESTINATION</h4><p>Currently, 59% of our passengers from Kazakhstan connect onward through Abu Dhabi.  Those top five final destinations are Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Bangkok, Jeddah, and Johannesburg.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>IN COMPARISON</h4><p>Compared to other former-Soviet states, Kazakhstan has performed well in regard to upgrading its fleets and infrastructure thanks to the President's policies and the establishment of the national air carrier.</p><h4>THE COST</h4><p>Almaty Airport is a private, joint-stock company. We are devoted to the operation of this facility. In terms of its financing, its yearly budget is KZT40 billion, whereas Astana's is KZT10 billion, Atyrau's is KZT2.5 billion, and Aktobe's is KZT1 billion.</p><h4>BUILDING UP</h4><p>The airport is now investing in its transportation fleet and special equipment. More buses are being purchased to increase the fluidity of the facility. We also plan to bring back to life the Aviation Technical Center… [and] upgrade our freight and cargo terminal, and integrate each facility in order to make a comfortable, aesthetic airport.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>TURKISH BOND</h4><p>Kazakhstan and Turkey have close ties and relations historically. Of course, commercially Astana and Almaty are among our top destinations in the network.</p><h4>THE AGENTS</h4><p>In our network in Kazakhstan, we have more than 70 IATA travel agencies and also their branch offices all around the country. Agencies are so merged with airlines and aviation business, there is no way to continue this business without them. We are always in cooperation with them and support each other to be able to move aviation in Kazakhstan forward. </p><h4>THE FUTURE</h4><p>Kazakhstan is the shining star of the world economy and business. And aviation is not an exception. Parallel to the country's growing economy, Turkish Airlines aims to fly more and more to be able to give a better service to the Kazakhstani nation.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>LOCALIZATION</h4><p>One of the things we are focusing on here is being a local company. The introduction of the Customs Union with Russia and Belarus made us local in the sense that we work with our partners here. We have localized our product for Kazakhstan, in the Kazakh language.</p><h4>TECH-SAVVY</h4><p>Locally there is no difference between Kazakhstani, European, or US consumers. The demand for novelties, services, and new products is very much the same. From the perspective of new trends, Kazakhstani consumers are very savvy.</p><h4>AMAZING TOOL</h4><p>Kazakhstan is the size of Western Europe. What I see in our industry, for communications, is that the mobile phone has brought amazing opportunities. You don't have to be tied to a particular location. It's a tool for you no matter what your culture or heritage.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>MAKING A DIFFERENCE</h4><p>The most interesting thing that I have noticed is that Kazakhstan is a country where Microsoft can make a fundamental difference. It is paying off personally, and for our employees because they are contributing to the development of their country.</p><h4>WHAT ABOUT SMES?</h4><p>The IT market can easily triple in size, though it will require large companies to develop their infrastructure from basic to standard models. There is also no coverage for SMEs, meaning they lack the appropriate IT standards needed to compete on the world stage; these companies alone represent a potential $600 million to $1 billion market opportunity.</p><h4>FUELLING IT ALL</h4><p>We conduct our business through local partners. For each dollar Microsoft earns, its local partners earn eight. The overall global IT industry is fueled 40% by Microsoft. By building a local partner ecosystem here we are creating jobs and qualification opportunities.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>GROWING ALL THE TIME<br></h4><p>Cisco began its operations in Kazakhstan in 2002. Almost nine years have passed since that time, and there have been a lot of changes and developments. We now have offices in Almaty and Astana, and have built up an ecosystem of more than 170 local partners.</p><h4>BIG PROJECTS</h4><p>One major project we worked on was for Kazakhtelecom. We helped build its core network and increase its capacity 10 fold. Another large project that we worked on was Cisco TelePresence technology, which offers video-conferencing in high definition and with the ease of use of a phone call.</p><h4>TARGET ICT</h4><p>ICT is a key factor in increasing competitiveness in the overall economy. In the EU, for example, ICT represents 5% of total GDP, but it is estimated that it contributes to 50% of productivity growth. In that respect, the government is definitely looking to increase productivity and competitiveness through ICT in Kazakhstan.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>GROUP BENEFITS</h4><p>We are a part of Al Baraka Group. We are a 100% takaful insurance company born in Lebanon in 2001. This company is a pioneer and the solo Islamic insurance company in the market. We are enjoying this concept as we believe the concept is trustworthy and honest. This market is saturated by conventional insurers, and what we offer really sets us apart.</p><h4>THE CONCEPT</h4><p>The concept of takaful is very important for the market. People have to save their money and are looking for satisfactory and reasonable products with better returns. Our service has the same terms and conditions, yet the customer can get a better return.</p><h4>THE RIGHT TIME</h4><p>It was the right time for takaful. Many companies are looking to establish similar institutions. I believe that it is the right time to invest in Lebanon. We have 0.5% of the market, and by the end of 2015 we will have claimed 15%.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>MAKING THE DIFFERENCE</h4><p>Lebanon is not an oil-producing economy, but rather a service-based economy. If you compare it to neighboring countries and exclude the oil-rich Gulf countries, what has made the difference here is life insurance.</p><h4>INTERNET</h4><p>Internet sales are definitely a growth area for the future. Chartis has already begun e-marketing in areas such as the Gulf, and we see potential here especially due to the computer proficiency the younger generation boasts.</p><h4>LINES</h4><p>We offer corporate insurance products and are after a niche market. We look at financial lines where we provide insurance for commercial and financial institutions; banks, private equities, for their management liability, for their professional liability, for embezzlement, and so on.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>COMPETETIVE MARKET</h4><p>More than 50 insurance companies are currently operating in the Lebanese market including bancassurers, multinationals, and family-owned businesses. Each company has its market share, but it's difficult to acquire more business and grow in such a small market with so many players.</p><h4>BACK TO BUSINESS</h4><p>Overall, results achieved in 2010 were better than the ones achieved in 2009 and 2008. We have noticed that the insurance business is back on track, especially after the events that occurred following 9/11, and the global financial crisis.</p><h4>LOCATIONS</h4><p>We have over 70 agencies and branches throughout Lebanon, mostly banks. When you work with a bank every branch of the bank is a point of sale, which makes things easier. Arope standalone branches provide customer service and claims assistance. We have customer service branches in all the major cities. The rest are all points of sale.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>GRAY MARKET</h4><p>Toyota came to Kazakhstan officially in January 2009, though on the road there are a lot of Toyota and Lexus cars. The majority of these vehicles are “gray“ imports from the UAE, Japan, and the US.</p><h4>CATCH UP</h4><p>Kazakhstan is an importer, and there is no provision of cheap cars. We do, however, expect the Kazakhstani market to catch up quickly.</p><h4>HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU</h4><p>In 2010, car manufacturer focus was centered on Russia, China, India, and Brazil, and factories were established in these areas. I expect manufacturers to next begin looking at Kazakhstan, and Toyota is one of these manufacturers.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>THE DEALER</h4><p>Prior to us there was only one dealer, and that was in Almaty. Now we have a network of six dealers that offers a full range of products and services. Our mother company is Ukrainian and it has more than 15 years of experience distributing Daimler brands in Ukraine.</p><h4>STRONG BRAND</h4><p>The brand is strong. Over the crisis period we did not experience a decrease in our sales volume in Kazakhstan, nor did the luxury sector see a decline in general. This is the strength of the brand.</p><h4>THE EDGE</h4><p>In the premium segment all the brands offer more or less the same services. Our biggest competitive edge is our products. Our service and level of customer satisfaction is higher than our competitors'.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>STANDARDS</h4><p>Renault has very strict service standards, and this was one of the reasons why it entered the market later than others. We teach our partners Renault standards, and we send our personnel to be trained in Moscow by French instructors.</p><h4>PRESENTING...</h4><p>In the second half of 2011 we will bring the Renault Fluence and Megane to the market, and in 2012 we will present the Duster—a 4x4 full drive vehicle. During this time our priority is to increase sales and the quality of our service.</p><h4>WINNING RECOGNITION</h4><p>Thanks to a successful combination of price and quality, Renault vehicles have won the recognition of consumers, both in Russia and in Kazakhstan. Large companies such as Metro, JTI, Pfizer, and DHL have become our clients.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>GETTING A SENSE</h4><p>The company has been here for 11 or 12 years, although initially we were exporting to Kazakhstan. The model of development for Danone is first, from a realistic point of view for geographical content, to import some brands, distribute the brands around the country, invest in our brands, and then gain the first sense on the opportunity side in terms of consumer attraction, technology, and reward.</p><h4>A GOOD MIX</h4><p>The strategy of Danone is to be able to continue to bring a very strong mix with functional and premium benefits. Nevertheless, our concern is to be able to also cover the bottom of the pyramid, bringing in a mix of products, which is part of our social responsibility.</p><h4>RIGHT DIRECTION</h4><p>A cow in Kazakhstan produces around 2,500 liters of milk per year, while a European or French cow, for example, produces about 5,500 to 6,000 liters per year. Our aim is to help with veterinary support, and assist the farmers in understanding that cows need to be fed grass. This is key for us.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>MAIN LINES</h4><p>We have a distribution center in Almaty that supplies our distributors with products in Kazakhstan, as well as Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Our main product lines are coffee, chocolate, baby food, pet food, ice cream, and cereal.</p><h4>THE BIG PICTURE</h4><p>If you take a step back and look at the total trade landscape, local and international chains are gaining larger shares of the market. This is in line with the development of more organized trade. Like any channel of business, we need to make sure that we work well with all players, be they large or small.</p><h4>COFFEE DAYS</h4><p>One unique strategy we implement here is “coffee days,“ since this is still a tea-drinking market. We give people a chance to try the product, and explain how it is made. The coffee consumption rate per capita has increased drastically of late, yet is still at lower levels than in Western Europe or the US.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>GROWTH ENGINES</h4><p>Cities drive economic growth and higher disposable incomes more than their rural counterparts. Kazakhstan is currently around 47% urbanized, and this ratio keeps on growing every year. All these drivers are like the wind in the sails of the packaging industry, as they tend to be the most influential leverages in our business.</p><h4>QUICK TO ADAPT</h4><p>In Kazakhstan we are still mainly working with local customers. I believe that this is good for business as they are very often quick to implement new standards. There are international players present, yet they represent only a small market share.</p><h4>DOING WHAT WE DO</h4><p>We have a 2020 strategy, which is focused on continuous growth in what we do. We also aim to bring a lot of attention to the infrastructure of the country. We also try to be aware of our advantages in each particular market and do our best to strengthen current market positions.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>MAKING A CONTRIBUTION</h4><p>Our company is of significant importance for the country. It grew out of the program for import substitution and it is one of the success stories of this program in creating a diversified industrial base in Kazakhstan. We are the biggest paper producing company in the country, and the region. So, we are really contributing to the diversification of the economy.</p><h4>THE RIGHT FOCUS</h4><p>One of my main strategic focuses has been to change the financial management strategy. Instead of piling up more and more debt to finance current outflows I made the company face financial reality. We stopped loan payments and started a transparent, thorough, and constructive restructuring of our debt portfolio.</p><h4>BRIGHT FUTURE</h4><p>My outlook for Kazakhstan Kagazy is very positive. I refocused the company toward profitability through real growth, not growth by debt. With the economy growing, this company has great prospects. It is going to surprise a lot of players in the country.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>IMPACTS</h4><p>Before 2010 there was no Amcor plant in Kazakhstan, as its current facility had been operating under the Alcan brand since 2000. Amcor acquired the Alcan packaging business in 2010, and the acquisition had a significant positive impact on our business from a global point of view.</p><h4>THE STRATEGY</h4><p>We do not export directly, but we produce packaging for our customers' products manufactured for other markets in the region, but much smaller in terms of the volume. This is not because Kazakhstanis use more than the markets around us, but because those markets have other companies that provide them with tobacco products, both local and foreign.</p><h4>LIFE AFTER THE UNION</h4><p>Before the Customs Union, there were limitations for Russian companies to supply goods to Kazakhstan. Now it is easier for us to import from Russia. On the other hand, there is a threat as well. In the global market we have competitors, and due to the introduction of the Customs Union it is easier for Russian companies to come to Kazakhstan with their products.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>UNIQUENESS</h4><p>The characteristics of Kazakhstani society are unique, which is one of the root causes of their purchasing behavior. Family values are very important here, and friendship, trust, and respect have great importance in society. This is also reflected in their way of doing business. If a foreign businessman can adopt those values, he has the opportunity to build long-lasting relationships.</p><h4>THE HUB</h4><p>Our objective is to create production facilities in Kazakhstan and use it as an export hub. It is one of the most stable economies in the CIS region. The government is stable, legislation is strong, the tax regime is positive, and all these factors are very favorable for us. Our main facility is in Almaty and our aim is to keep on enhancing it and create a hub for exports.</p><h4>STRONG FOUNDATIONS</h4><p>Our foundations are very strong. We never stop investing in technology and the skills of our people. Our mentality is to bring in talent and grow leaders. We are very keen on nurturing the learning culture. Of course we believe that the future is very strong.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>BIG GROWTH</h4><p>HSBC always maintains long-term strategies. We adopted an aggressive growth approach for our business, and it resulted in us going from about 120 employees to about 750 in three years.</p><h4>TRADE IS THE WAY</h4><p>HSBC believes in the value of trade, and so I clearly believe the Customs Union will increase commerce in the region and that, by itself, will result in net benefits. But exactly who will benefit the most is hard to say.</p><h4>THE CUSTODIAN</h4><p>HSBC is the largest custodian for foreign investors in Kazakhstan, with one out of every two dollars invested in Kazakhstan invested through and held by HSBC. That gives us quite a good insight into what happens with international capital flows in terms of directly investing into Kazakhstani securities.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>THE REASON WHY</h4><p>Kazakhstan is a very young nation. If you look at its origins as a part of the Soviet Union, the development it has gone through is extraordinary. There are other nations that have good potential, but Kazakhstan has taken the lead in Central Asia.</p><h4>THE AMBITION</h4><p>The ambition to grow and to excel leads to a constant need for the latest financial services, and we apply the knowledge from our network to deliver the best service to our clients in Kazakhstan. This, combined with the ambition to turn Kazakhstan into a nation that can manufacture more products itself using its vast natural resources, adds a new layer to the services that we as a financial service provider can help our clients with.</p><h4>TAILOR-MADE</h4><p>We have brought many products to Kazakhstan that are no different to the products we offer elsewhere. However, we have been able to tailor them to specific local requirements or needs.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY</h4><p>Kazakhstan is a very important market for us. We have been in this country for quite a while now. We opened here in 1994. Then in 1998 we converted into a joint stock company and a fully fledged bank. Since then we have come a long way in terms of building Citibank into a stable, successful, and sizeable business in this country.</p><h4>MELTING POT</h4><p>Kazakhstan is at the crossroads. It's a vast country so it has, like all other vast countries, accumulated a little bit of many different cultures. It has a bit of Europe in it, and it has an Asian touch. Also, of course, it has a very big legacy of Russian culture. That makes it a very fascinating country, and it makes it an adaptable country.</p><h4>REGIONAL POWERHOUSE</h4><p>Kazakhstan is an economic colossus compared to other countries in the region. Therefore, I definitely see Kazakhstan playing a more regional role, as well as becoming more assertive on the international stage and carving for itself a more important place among the community of nations.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>OLD FRIENDS</h4><p>The subsidiary bank in Kazakhstan is the first bank outside Russia for the group; this is our first experience internationally. We chose Kazakhstan due to the close relationship between the two countries. Furthermore, there are many Russian companies in Kazakhstan and they are very glad to see Sberbank operating in the country.</p><h4>HELPING HAND</h4><p>With the development of the Customs Union, local companies will have to be more competitive. We are trying to help these companies. Our credit portfolio to non-extracting companies amounts to half a billion dollars. Banks are usually pessimistic, but I am optimistic on the prospects of these industries in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>MANY INDICATORS</h4><p>Kazakhstan has one of the most efficient systems of non-government pension funds among the CIS, which could be the main source of long-term investment into the economy. These are the main indicators that show it is a good time to start a business in Kazakhstan.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>GREAT EXPECTATIONS</h4><p>We have been here since 2000 when we entered the Saigak field, and then in 2002 we entered the Dunga field. In both fields, we have a 60% share and are the operator. Both fields have developed largely to our expectations. However, our biggest rewards are hopefully yet to come.</p><h4>FIR FOR PURPOSE</h4><p>Maersk Oil has the size and flexibility that enables it to operate in a “fit for purpose“ way on projects of varying size, and maneuver in a flexible way. The larger projects in Kazakhstan are mainly run by the majors, but there are also medium-size projects that are of interest to us. We have the flexibility and the speed to bring these projects on stream quickly.</p><h4>VAST RESOURCES</h4><p>To us, the biggest potential in Kazakhstan lies in the exploitation of existing discoveries, rather than exploration. The country needs to find the right terms and the right companies to operate here and then support them in developing the vast available resources. And we are certainly one of those companies willing to invest in Kazakhstan given that the terms are supportive.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>QUALITY ASSETS</h4><p>In 2008 and 2009 we drilled five wells on the Northwest Konys field. We found oil in four of them, and this yielded a maximum combined test rate of 1,200 bbl/d. The consultancy firm McDaniel and Associates confirmed the reserves that we discovered on that field.</p><h4>MAXIMIZING POTENTIAL</h4><p>The role of smaller players will be of great significance. If you look at the cross section of all the oil companies that are operating in Kazakhstan, you see the need for E&amp;P companies like ours that are investing in exploration and new ideas in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>CHANGING LANDSCAPES</h4><p>Once the Kashagan mega field goes into production, it will change the dimensions of the economy again in terms of how additional income will flow into the budget of the government, and allow it to execute its plans, enabling diversification in terms of investment. Kazakhstan will undergo far-reaching change compared to its peers in the region.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>PLACE OF INTEREST</h4><p>Claw Energy decided to focus on Kazakhstan as a place of interest because of the deal flow, because of the reserve base, and because of the opportunities.</p><h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4><p>The delays experienced in the sector have hurt the smaller companies more than the big companies. Production delays of six months to a year make life really difficult for smaller companies. Being more responsive to smaller companies would be better for the business climate and create more opportunities in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>THE WAY FORWARD</h4><p>With the new Customs Union there should be opportunities available for manufacturing and the development of goods in country. But again, there have to be some incentives to make that happen. Oil field service companies and equipment producers have a lot of opportunities here right now. In relation to services, big companies are fairly well developed, but smaller actors are still stuck using older Soviet-era equipment. Joint ventures can raise the standards of small local service companies working with large oil companies.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Kazakhstan is a huge country. The Caspian region is the center of the oil and gas industry. Almaty is the financial center of the country, and Astana is the capital of administration and national business. This is quite a tricky setup, as we still do not have a network in Kazakhstan like we do in Russia. At the same time, being the market leader and having first-comer advantage brings us great opportunities. We recently invested a substantial amount in a 2,250-sqm storage facility located by Almaty International Airport. It is the biggest storage facility between the Urals in the west and Siberia in the east. We are in the process of moving our operations to that facility. It is a state-of-the-art facility with 24-hour video monitoring, climate control, and fire-safety features. It has the capacity for a quarter of a million storage boxes. We took into account future demand and growth when obtaining this facility.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In the early 1990s, Turkey introduced mobile telecommunications systems based on GSM technology, which had been considered by some entrepreneurs and businessmen as “not worth going into“. From today's view one can easily say that they missed apprehending “the paradigm shift“. Iran invested hugely in the 1990s in developing fixed telephony, and it wasn't until the middle of the first decade of the new millennium that Iran started to introduce mobile telecom services. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan exhibit similarities, as they were both member states of the former Soviet Union. Investments were made on the fixed side well into the late 1990s. The introduction of mobile telecommunications licenses in both countries started to change the industry in the early 2000s. In all the countries above, the regulatory bodies and ministries had to adopt new regulations to cope with the newly arisen requirements, and they also underwent some structural changes. The above examples show that there is a phase difference amongst the countries in time domain, but once the decision is given and the action taken, such differences can disappear very quickly.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>It's a very young market, and there is a long way to go here in real estate sector development. Valuations have become increasingly important due to price fluctuations since the crisis. People need valuations to obtain credit and mortgages, and for restructuring and refinancing. It's clear from the fallout of the financial crisis that a lot of valuations provided pre-boom were not realistic and the banks are now much more careful. In addition, many of the development projects were highly speculative and were not based on sound research and analysis. The market will become more sophisticated as more students return to Kazakhstan having studied property-related subjects overseas. A key development in 2010 was the visit of Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors' representatives, which is encouraging for those working in the property industry to obtain a professional property qualification.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The most important sector will be digital connections for TV and the internet. The second key focus I can identify is data centers. Things in that regard must improve and get faster over the next three years. Other areas of investment opportunity are the mobile sector and 3D multimedia, the use of which can benefit the healthcare, education, and oil and gas sectors. E-government is also a sector that will see growth and development. The practicality of IT must not be overlooked. Our professors possess software that can alert gas companies to the presence of gas after drilling only 50 centimeters into the earth. This can save a huge amount of money in explorative drilling. We need to invest further into this kind of technology if we want to build an innovative and competitive Kazakhstan.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Regarding value-added services, there's definitely a significant amount of demand coming from consumers. The market is moving away from inexpensive and expensive phones toward smart phones. People are following the trends in Western Europe and demanding the same things. We are focused on building a sustainable infrastructure that will help us serve all the niches and all consumers irrespective of whether they are looking for an entry segment phone, or a highly sophisticated mobile device that will replace their laptops. Based on the size of the country, the challenge is in understanding how to work here locally, and throughout the country. All companies go to Almaty, and from there they try to figure out the rest of the country.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Kazakhstan is developing in line with global consumer and demographic trends. Consumers are more and more demanding about food quality and safety, and this tendency nudges food producers to search for appropriate packaging solutions. The other trends are related to rapid growth in population and urbanization. Cities drive economic growth and higher disposable incomes than their rural counterparts. Kazakhstan is currently around 47% urbanized, and this ratio keeps on growing every year. Though we experienced a sales drop of 20% in 2007/08, the recovery was fast and sales numbers grew again at around 23% in 2008/09. In 2010 we also achieved a significant growth in sales.  When it comes to basic products such as milk, we didn't see much of a downtrend. However, when it came to higher-end products, we could see that demand was lower.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are a prime necessity in countries suffering from a high rate of unemployment. This is even truer in Lebanon, which suffers from high emigration, while having a solid bias toward entrepreneurship. SMEs have become a necessity for all countries in the world, and not just for developing countries. It is estimated that more than 70% of national output in developed countries is provided by companies with fewer than 50 employees. A favorable policy for SMEs has been developed in our publication Emerging Lebanon toward an economic and social vision. It details the challenges of Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) and not SMEs, as this segment faces unique hurdles. Financing that is provided first by donors might be the last thing that a micro enterprise needs. Additionally, micro enterprises cannot be competitive while facing larger concerns; they cannot face the same taxes and social burden. Finally, the essential support we can provide to MSEs is to help them to grow and achieve better productivity.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon has a large number of brands and concepts. We do not want to be just an operator for only international brands. We want to develop our companies as Lebanese, as Arabs, and as Mediterraneans. This is why we developed the Mediterranean Franchise Federation, which we are leading. This is a federation in Greece, but Lebanon has the presidency. It is a 14-country group of associations and similar organizations, the purpose of which is to develop the franchising model throughout the Mediterranean area and to exchange know-how and culture and do business throughout the region. Lebanon is a hub between the Mediterranean and the Middle East. We have a role to play, and we know franchising is the best way to do that. It is less susceptible to risk because it is a tested and proven format. During the international crisis two years ago, while all the sectors were shrinking, franchising worldwide was growing by 15% to 20% per year. There is a big appetite for banks to give credit to tested and proven concepts with track records and high brand equity. The quality assurance that brands find through franchising creates safer investments and ways of doing business. A lot of the successful companies here in Lebanon are still in a family business format. There is a big move now toward more corporate structures, and everybody is looking for strategic partners that can take them to a higher level of development and internationalization.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>One of the chapters that has been identified as a Lebanese prerogative is education. Because of our political system of freedom and openness we have a good level of education. I believe our qualified human resources are our best export. We can help in improving the productivity and management of our counterparts in other countries. In addition, most Lebanese can speak more than one language, and soon Turkish will become more common. Speaking different languages is very important to properly share ideas. With our knowledge of foreign business models, we can be successful in various countries. There is also a lot to be done in terms of private equity development between the public and private sector. A lot of investments will come from abroad to increase the volume of production, and at the same time to make sure that a lot of products manufactured in neighboring countries can be produced at a cheaper cost here and at the same level of quality. We must start looking into value-added and high-tech niches because we have the culture and the education. Another area we can improve a lot on is in the field of alternative technology. A project we are working on is a communication and information system. This is a very concentrated industry that does not need a lot of space, and we have a lot of room to export from this area. Our role is to foster research and high technology.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>STRENGTH ABROAD</h4><p>Mercury Development started as a small logistics company in 2003. We entered the construction sector when we built camps, schools, hospitals, and other buildings for the Iraqi government. Then in 2008 we completed two development projects in Casablanca and built government facilities in Afghanistan in 2009.</p><h4>RELIABILITY</h4><p>Regulations for real estate developers are favorable, because the market doesn't have a history of being unreliable. Established developers always deliver, which is the most important thing for a buyer.</p><h4>THE DEMAND</h4><p>The concept of a 400-500-sqm apartment is history. People want 150-200 sqm. Middle class market demand stands between $350,000 and $600,000, and the upper class market demand is between $800,000 and $1 million.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>THE DESTINATION</h4><p>We are trying to develop a destination to generate a unique environment where people enjoy spending their time for eight or nine months out of the year. We have a mix of restaurants within reach of everyone's taste.</p><h4>WORKING WITH SOLIDERE</h4><p>We have very good relations with the people at Solidere as they have a very good understanding of quality and, more than that, are patient. They want the final product to be special at the end of the day, and I really enjoy working with them.</p><h4>THE UNIQUE TOUCH</h4><p>It will be a fully serviced environment—with seven-star quality—so the individuals having apartments there will enjoy all the facilities. Our philosophy as developers is not to go as mainstream, but rather develop unique projects.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>REDEVELOPMENT</h4><p>Approximately 70% of people are concentrated on the coast, especially in Beirut and the northern regions. This means that the amount of land available for development is decreasing over time. This makes the construction sector unique here, and redevelopment plays a larger role in the overall productivity of the sector.</p><h4>PRICING CHALLENGES</h4><p>The only increase in prices that worried the sector were land prices. There has been such a demand for land that prices have risen 10 fold. That is a big problem. While working on a large project, you must make sure that land has been purchased in advance in preparation for another project, otherwise there can be periods of down time in which there is nothing to do.</p><h4>HOLIDAY HOMES</h4><p>Expatriates often look to buy houses that they can stay in while back in the country on vacation, bringing their families. Due to the lack of a rent culture here, that means many residences remain empty over the winter months. For that reason, there is much demand for the construction of new houses.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>ESCAPE TO PARADISE</h4><p>There is a lot of construction and development being seen in the mountainous regions of the country, and these areas are mostly reserved for upmarket developments. Many people find Beirut too hot over the summer months, and thus like to escape to a second home.</p><h4>ROOM TO INCREASE</h4><p>Even in 2011 prices in Beirut are not as high as in surrounding countries. Beirut is a small place and still not as expensive as Istanbul. The market is not overpriced and we still have room for prices to go up.</p><h4>SAFE FOR INVESTORS</h4><p>Lebanon is a safe market for investors. The only trick you should learn is to go to a well-known developer. There are plenty of known developers who have a good reputation in Lebanon.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SPECIALISTS</h4><p>We are definitely the biggest contractor in Lebanon with regard to universities. We started off with the Beirut Arab University (BAU). The first contracts that we won were infrastructure contracts. We ended up building the largest part of its campus, which is a 1.3-million sqm development and the biggest campus in Lebanon.</p><h4>REGIONAL POTENTIAL</h4><p>The business investment potential in Iraq is immense, and expanding into Iraq will surely be a new milestone for us as it will establish Qualco as a regional construction company.</p><h4>WHY LEBANON</h4><p>I strongly believe that foreign companies show a tendency to move to Lebanon rather than any other country in the Middle East because of the quality of life and the cultural history that exist here. I think we are very complementary geographically, and within our competencies, I believe that Beirut has a role to play as an economic center for the region as long as we have political stability.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>AHEAD OF SCHEDULE</h4><p>I will work to develop a universal bank with a boutique flavor. At a boutique you can give very personal service. After I arrived, we worked on developing a five-year business plan with this boutique plan in mind. We achieved our targets set for 2013 in 2010.</p><h4>STRUCTURE</h4><p>We are almost a billion dollar bank, and our ROE is about 4%, which is significantly better than it was before I arrived. Our loan portfolio is similar to most Lebanese banks—it is around one-third cash, one-third securities, and one-third loans. We then have 10% fixed and intangible assets. This is the structure of almost every bank in the sector.</p><h4>EYE ON PERFORMANCE</h4><p>The industry average for non-performing loans (NPLs) is around 10%. Most lending in Lebanon takes place on a secure basis. This security can come in two ways: through a mortgage and real property, or personal guarantees. In the last two years there has been a boom in real estate and we have increased our exposure to project finance.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>LENDING GAMES</h4><p>The biggest sector for lending is the public sector. There is a large public debt, and part of it is in the hands of the banking sector. Another large sector is general trade, followed by real estate, and of course industry and agriculture receive some lending.</p><h4>FOR THE POUND</h4><p>The Lebanese pound has been extremely stable for almost 20 years because of excellent management and sound fundamentals. The fact that the Banque du Liban owns quite large reserves is also significant.</p><h4>WHAT WE DO BEST</h4><p>Our strategy is to specialize in corporate and private banking. We believe that, given our size, this is what we can do best. We can provide enough expertise for large institutions and high net worth individuals, who often happen to own or manage large institutions.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>MAKING DEPOSITS</h4><p>Deposit growth has been driven by interest as people keep their money in the country. Non-residents also continue to make remittances to the country, and this went up by 9% in the first seven months of 2011. The lending activity of the bank has also been aggressive this year, and that has also contributed to deposit growth.</p><h4>THE IMAGE</h4><p>We are keeping in line with everything that is being offered in the market in terms of consumer and corporate lending, accounts, cards, and so forth. We also try to differentiate ourselves by being modern in terms of technology, yet we remain traditional with how we communicate with our clients with the aim of building genuine long-lasting relationships with them and in accordance with our core value “Care,“ which is embedded in our culture and manifested in our slogan “Your Caring Bank.“</p><h4>RANKING</h4><p>We are number 10 interms of deposits, number 10 in terms of branches, and in terms of ratios we have one of the best liquidity ratings. This goes with our philosophy of being conservative during these tough times.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>GOOD CONNECTIONS</h4><p>ESA is managed according to the norms of the best business schools in France and Europe. Since it is managed by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCIP), and being an associate center of ESCP Europe, ESA benefits from their expertise, their educational resources, and know-how.</p><h4>HUMAN CAPITAL</h4><p>One of Lebanon's major assets is its human capital. There is a very important gap between the level you find here in terms of education and the level you find in the rest of the region. Families invest in education in a very big way right from the beginning.</p><h4>DISTINGUISHING FEATURES</h4><p>We look to distinguish ourselves in the market through innovation, international recognition, accreditation, rankings, and the quality level of the faculty. But the most important differentiation is our teaching techniques.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>IN THE BEGINNING</h4><p>In the beginning Saint Joseph was a school of theology, and soon after it became more related to an Islamic way of thinking and relations between Islam and the West. With the help of France and the University of Lyon, schools of law, medicine, engineering, and so on were established.</p><h4>RESEARCH</h4><p>Ten years ago the university began research in Lebanon and decided to dedicate 2% of tuition fees toward such projects. This has allowed us to do a lot of research.</p><h4>A UNIVERSITY OF FIRSTS</h4><p>We were the first university in the Middle East to have a Confucius institute, and we have very good relations with universities in China and Japan. We also have very good relations with institutions in Canada and the US, and we think that all of these create very good opportunities for us.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>RICH HISTORY</h4><p>Beirut Arab University (BAU) was established in 1960. It was started with the support of the Egyptian government. At that time there was no better institution than BAU, and it attracted people from all over the Middle East. We started with two, then four faculties. Now there are 10, covering most of the main educational domains.</p><h4>NO PROBLEM THERE</h4><p>There are a lot of Lebanese graduates. It is good that they have opportunities to work abroad. I have no fears of a brain drain. When a Lebanese graduate works abroad, it means he or she will bring back foreign currency to the country. The Lebanese have strong links to their country and family, so the money will always come back.</p><h4>DIRECTION OF CHANGE</h4><p>I would like to see an upgrading of education regulations, as they are mostly relics from the past. We need to produce people with quality. Lebanon must review its education laws, and monitor the performance of universities. If universities are not up to standard, action should be taken.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>STARTING POINT</h4><p>This is a large group, of which some companies are industrial, some trade in the automotive business, and some are involved in investments in the tourism business and other areas. Lebanon is the base for this family business, and this was the starting point for growth around the region.</p><h4>RESALE VALUE</h4><p>In 2011 we are doing better than we expected in terms of car sales. The market is quite interesting for such a small country. People see cars as an investment as they don't lose much value on resale.</p><h4>FACILITATING BUSINESS<br></h4><p>We have opened a large truck and car service center to help people from the north do business across the country. This is successful as it is very expensive to buy or rent within Beirut. We have employees in the hundreds working to keep things running smoothly.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>DEMAND FOR LUXURY</h4><p>There is a good level of purchasing power here right now, and the percentage of luxury cars as a total of all new car sales is quite high. Around 10% of the market consists of luxury cars.</p><h4>THE PRODUCTS</h4><p>For over 60 years we have been the exclusive distributor of Jaguar, Fiat, and Bentley. In 2005 we added Lamborghini and in April 2011 we became the exclusive distributor of the Abarth brand.</p><h4>JUMPING SALES</h4><p>The whole Lebanese market witnessed an increase in sales in 2008. Between 2005 and 2007, around 15,000 cars were sold in the sector per year, whereas in 2008 the figure jumped to 33,000, and it has stayed around that mark ever since.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>THE MIX</h4><p>We started back in 1998 offering only small boats from three American brands: Regal, Fountain, and Pro-Line. By 2008 we became the main provider for the whole of the Middle East, covering most of the major brands.</p><h4>POTENTIAL</h4><p>Since 2008 we have been opening offices all around the Arab region, in Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Our next target is Qatar, but Lebanon remains a priority for us. We would like to see the development of a large service center, as Lebanon has the potential to be a boating hub.</p><h4>JUST RIGHT</h4><p>When we talk about branding we talk about Lebanon. Arabs from the region like to come to Lebanon to shop, and so it is an important hub in the region. Lebanon is also in an incredibly suitable area for boating—Turkey and Greece are accessible for day trips, while Italy is accessible for trips of a few days.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE</h4><p>As an agent of Renault for 60 years we are one of the oldest in the world. In addition, we also act as distributors for BMW. With BMW we are the number one company selling luxury cars in Lebanon, and Renault is the number one company selling European cars in Lebanon.</p><h4>STRAIGHT FROM THE FACTORY</h4><p>We import straight from the factory. For example, Renault sends us some cars from Europe and some from Turkey by truck. They all come as finished products. Around 30% of our Renault supply comes from Turkey, the rest comes from France and Romania. And, of course, all of our BMWs come from Germany.</p><h4>CUSTOMER SERVICE</h4><p>Competition is fierce here as all major brands are present in the country. We offer the best service and have a passion for excellence. We always try to be the best, as having great service means people will always come back.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>NUTS ABOUT NUTS</h4><p>Al Rifai is the Rolls Royce of nuts in the Middle East. We recently moved to Europe and opened a production facility in Sweden of around 12,000 sqm in size. This center can produce almost 7,000 tons in one shift.</p><h4>POINTS OF SALE</h4><p>In the Middle East our exposure is really through our retail branches and outlets, and we have almost 200 shops in the region. We also serve the wholesale market with prepackaged goods that can offer customers all sizes from 20 grams up to 1-kilogram bags.</p><h4>CRACKING EXPORTS<br></h4><p>After Lebanon, the Middle East, and the Gulf, we targeted Europe for exports. It is this market that we are primarily focusing on. And after that we are looking at expanding in the US and Canada.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>CUSTOMER LOYALTY</h4><p>I think that the Lebanese are extremely focused on quality, and they are very brand-loyal consumers. Therefore, having a good product and good quality makes this a great market to work in.</p><h4>THE RIGHT MENTALITY</h4><p>Most international companies have a high rate of Lebanese workers in the country, and that is a testament to the education system. Lebanon is closer to the European mentality than its neighbors, and it is very easy to adapt to the business climate here.</p><h4>WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY IS<br></h4><p>There are very few international companies here alone, and most companies use local family distributors. These family markets hold the opportunities. In Saudi Arabia, however, the producer controls the entire value chain; it is very different here in Lebanon.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>HOLDING STEADY</h4><p>Malia Group is a holding company established in 1936, primarily in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry. At that time, until 1951, we improved our presence in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. Today, encompassing 21 companies, our group is present all over the Levant, mainly in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan.</p><h4>TARGETED INVESTMENT</h4><p>Lebanon is a hub for the Levant region. The second hub in the region is the Gulf. The market—the Middle East—is distinctly divided by culture and ethnicity. In that respect, we have to target our investments according to our know-how and understanding of the markets.</p><h4>WINDS OF CHANGE</h4><p>There has been a lot of change in the region following the unrest in Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. This is ushering in a new era of investment planning. The Lebanese have the know-how and experience to work well with international investors.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>TOP OF THE GAME</h4><p>As time went by our portfolio of perfumes and cosmetics grew and we became an important player in distribution. We are currently working with international groups in the beauty field. We then diversified in 1992 into alcohol and electrical home appliances. We always work with the top brands.</p><h4>DRIVERS</h4><p>We have close to 320 employees at Fawaz Holding. The retail market is very interesting because people here are trendsetters as they travel often and see what happens in the international markets. The sector is very related to the diaspora as well as the tourism sector.</p><h4>THE ALCOHOL SECTOR</h4><p>Lots of money is being spent on advertising in the sector, and that makes things difficult and challenging. The country is not large, and often there are several distribution companies competing in the same market. The alcohol market is developing too. We, however, are trying to create awareness about not abusing alcohol.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have the talent to make Lebanon a hub for innovation. There are costs on big companies with 200-250 developers that are based outside of Beirut and finding it increasingly difficult to do business here because of the infrastructure. It is not cost effective compared to neighboring countries, where high-speed internet is available at a low cost. As a company we participate in lobbying groups that call for the broadband manifesto. We are members of a number of associations that call for faster internet.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>SMEs will experience huge benefits from the introduction of 3G telecom services in Lebanon. These enterprises rely much on communication facilities, and 3G technology will make their functions much easier and more efficient. If we take the banking sector as an example, clients would be doing their banking transactions while on the move, and with some additional awareness, end-users will use their time more efficiently on a daily basis. E-shopping will boom and advertising companies will also see great benefits. On the other hand, the possibility to implement the e-government plan for Lebanon that was promoted five to six years back and supported by the World Bank can easily become a reality. IT companies will also be able to expand their domestic businesses. It's true that it requires a little time for this to occur, yet 3G telecom services and applications are mandatory prerequisites.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 2009 there was a study by the World Bank showing that for every 10% increase in mobile broadband penetration in a country, the GDP of that country increases by a sustainable 1%. In Lebanon we foresee 3G bringing a sustainable increase in productivity, in GDP, and in general economic value by connecting Lebanon to the world through this superhighway. HSPA stands for high-speed packet access. It refers to a family of high-speed 3G digital data services for GSM carriers. This is a technology that allows us to deliver higher mobile data speeds for Alfa and for Lebanon. Its capability will be 21 MB and over, but the actual speed will depend on how Alfa will want to deploy its services.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>THE DESTINATION</h4><p>Beirut is a link between East and West. It is a modern and cosmopolitan city with 300 days of sunshine, an immaculate nightlife, vibrant people, enriching cuisine, and a rich historical past.</p><h4>MICE</h4><p>Beirut has so much to offer for MICE groups, because it caters to all age groups and has activities that would interest anyone. In addition, the Mediterranean Sea, the extensive historical and cultural sites, and the wide selection of venues for dining and clubbing all make this an exciting and new MICE destination.</p><h4>FACILITIES</h4><p>The vast number of meeting rooms at the Mövenpick are all ideally located on two connected floors. The breathtaking Sea View Rooms all with balconies overlooking the Mediterranean Sea are also a sight to behold.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>WEALTH OF ATTRACTIONS</h4><p>Lebanon boasts a lot of destinations. We also see a lot of tourism from Syria and Jordan by bus, which we would like to see more of. There are many places to see and tourists need easily a two-week program to see 70% of the country.</p><h4>THE GUESTS</h4><p>In general the number one market is Jordan, followed by Iraq and then Syria. In Spring 2011 we mainly saw guests coming from Europe, especially corporate groups. Companies that have stayed here have included those involved in pharmaceuticals, beauty products, and fashion.</p><h4>DIRECTIONS</h4><p>Besides the five-star hotels and boutiques under construction currently there won't be many more built in the future. Investors are now looking mainly at the three- to four-star market, where there is future demand. The corporate sector often prefers these kinds of hotels, which are especially common in places such as Paris and London.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>MICE TRAP</h4><p>More and more, the UN holds its conferences in this hotel due to its safety. The pharmaceuticals industry is also active in holding conferences, thus boosting our MICE profile. This also boosts occupancy.</p><h4>SPACE IN THE MARKET</h4><p>There is definitely more room in the market for three- and four-star hotels. We are a five-star hotel, yet the country needs more three-star accommodation. We are a prime destination as we are well known for quality in terms of our accommodation and our traditional food. In addition, we cater for weddings and large-size banquets.</p><h4>SECOND HOME</h4><p>In the summer we have a lot of guests from the Emirates and Saudi Arabia. We also welcome many expatriates. This hotel is a trademark and a destination in Lebanon. It is a trademark without being a part of a chain. Built in the 1950s, the hotel has a real home-away-from-home feeling.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>WHY LEBANON?</h4><p>In 2009 and 2010 tourism prospects attracted a lot of people to Lebanon. For the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, why go to Europe when you have Lebanon no farther than a three-hour flight away? The airport is international. The people speak French, English, and Arabic—and some of them even speak Italian and Spanish.</p><h4>FRENCH CONNECTION</h4><p>Because of Lebanon's historic relationship with France we are seeing many French tourists. As half of the Lebanese population speak French, there is no language barrier for these tourists. We are also receiving visitors from Spain, Italy, and Germany, as well as the GCC.</p><h4>HOME AWAY FROM HOME</h4><p>The fact that 60% of our rooms are suites gives us a defining quality—to have a sitting room and a bedroom. We also offer a unique service, because we are only one-and-a-half years old, and we are trying to be like a small boutique hotel with friendly staff.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon boasts excellent doctors who are trained at the best universities and hospitals worldwide. The quality level of nurses is also very high. It is very important to have that structure. The quality levels of our facilities at Mount Lebanon Hospital are the highest, and we are very strict about cleanliness. The same levels of cleanliness are not seen at hospitals in the region. We have received accreditation from the Ministry of Health, and in accordance we must pass a test every two years. This hospital passed with the highest grade in 2011. Achieving the highest rating gives us an advantage over other hospitals. This is important to us because we are professionals. The staff here have a long history in this sector. We see many patients from Iraq and also from Syria. Many also come from the Gulf region. In addition, there are many Lebanese expatriates coming back for treatment. Patients even come from as far away as Canada, as waiting lists for hip prosthesis and replacement can be as much as six months long. We also see patients coming for kidney transplants, as world waiting lists are also not favorable.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are always looking forward, especially with what is happening in the Arab world. We feel that we are becoming more stable. We want Lebanon to re-emerge as a haven for tourism. We see a lot of patients from the Gulf area, as well as from Iraq and Syria. Lebanon has great potential. Our health system is advanced for the region. We would like to attract health tourism from all over the world. We have the means, and I think our rates are much better than anywhere else. Patients come here because the waiting period is much shorter and we have an availability of resources. For example, we have a lot of CT scanners. In fact, we sometimes feel we have much more than we need.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon has not been stable for a very long period of time. We asked KPMG to evaluate our hospital. They came in and worked for some time and said there really has not been a normal year to come in and look at your balance sheets and come up with any meaningful evaluation. In 2005, the prime minister was assassinated. In 2006, there was a war with Israel. In 2007, there were the strikes downtown. In 2008, there was an internal conflict, and in 2009, there was an election. We never have normal years, and unfortunately this affects most of the area for many years. Therefore, medical tourism is related to stability. When I was a resident, I remember we used to have a lot of people coming from Arab countries. I remember it was not unusual for a surgeon after an operation to get a Cadillac as a present, or a diamond ring for his wife as a present. That used to be very common in those days. But those countries these days have their own very sophisticated facilities now and their own staff of nationals, and those that do not have nationals bring in physicians externally to run their medical centers. In that respect, medical tourism still exists, but I do not think it is a major issue. However, this year people coming from Iraq have boosted the numbers, and we have contracts with some agencies that bring us complicated cases. However, medical tourism accounts for no more than 10% or 15% of our total load.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>My father used to tell me there is no elevator to success; you must always take the stairs. The reputation comes from your patients, and this is your strength because nobody can take it away from you. You can build a reputation through media exposure, by putting my face all over the billboards and becoming very famous, but this is fragile. When you have a satisfied patient, your work spreads through word of mouth. It's my job and it's a business also, but we must keep in the back of our minds that it is a part of medicine and we must have medical ethics. I am internationally certified so I can also practice at Beirut Beauty Clinic in Kuwait. People from the US can go to Thailand where the service is cheap. People want surgery to fit around their time, but they don't make bargains with their health. The price is certainly a factor, but I think if they questioned the quality they would not come and have surgery here. They know we have the same standards for quality and safety as the US and they come because they pay less. Lebanese doctors are well trained in the US and Europe, giving very good results. Lastly, people in the GCC see our ambassadors of plastic surgery: our singers, our television presenters, and even some politicians. All these factors came together to make Lebanon a country for plastic surgery.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The medical tourism sector is huge. People come from all over the region to take advantage of Lebanon's well-developed medical services sector. We stay open for business on Sundays just to be able to receive clients from all over the region, especially during high tourist periods. In the summer season 50% of our clients are foreigners. The Lebanese workforce is really the reason why the medical sector has taken off so well here. Being Lebanese is a great plus when it comes to trying to attract customers, and that is also boosted by the multiculturalism that our country men and women enjoy, meaning the Lebanese can build great relationships with people from all over the world.</p>]]></sections41>
