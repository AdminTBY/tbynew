		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been your main areas of focus when it comes to improve the foreign affairs of Qatar?<br></strong>The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs aims to communicate Qatar's foreign policy with the rest of the world, to clarify any misconceptions or unverified information, and to advance the Qatari narratives on many issues facing the region and the world today. Qatar continues to be an active member of the international community, hence, communicating our messages with the rest of the world is vital. We continue to work closely with our partners and allies in the region and outside the region, to bring views closer, and to share information and perspectives that could be useful for our regional security and stability, in addition, to ensure a better understanding of not only Qatar, but the Middle East in general.</p><p><strong>What is the holistic strategy of the ministry to increase diplomatic ties?<br></strong>Qatar has always strived to strengthen and enhance its ties with the rest of the world, regardless of geography. This has been tested ever since the blockade on Qatar was initiated in June 2017, where we saw the significance of reaching out to more countries for possible cooperation in all matters and in different areas. We always keep in mind our shared values and common interests when initiating new ties or strengthening a current one. We need to emphasize the fact that Qatar has an open-door policy, and it continues to welcome friendships and cooperation with the rest of the world, be it diplomatic, commercial, or in any other sector and area.</p><p><strong>How would you describe the current situation of the blockade, and what efforts is the ministry undertaking to mitigate this situation?</strong><br>Qatar has been coping with the blockade effectively and efficiently; in fact, Qatar has defied the blockade and its intended effects and consequences. Life in Qatar continues to function as normal, despite the blockade entering into its third year. The only thing that remains and continues to be an obstacle and hardship is the disconnected families in the Gulf. Many Qataris have extended families elsewhere in the Gulf; the citizens of blockading countries cannot meet their families from Qatar, and families have to meet in a third country unfortunately. Kuwait and Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah have worked tirelessly to put this crisis to an end and resolve it with mediation, and for that we greatly thank them and appreciate their ongoing efforts to bring everyone closer; however, the blockading countries continue to be unresponsive, unfortunately. Qatar stands firm behind the need for dialogue and communication to resolve the GCC crisis and end the blockade, which we called for since the early days of the blockade. It is important to keep in mind that any dialogue happening should be based on four principles, which HH Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad has addressed previously during the 48th meeting for Shura Council: mutual respect, shared interests, no dictation on Qatar's foreign policy, and no internal interference.</p><p><strong>What does it mean Qatar to host major sporting events in the world from a diplomatic point of view? <br></strong>Sports is a crucial pillar in Qatar's diplomacy, and we can achieve a lot through sports, sports bring people together, it bypasses all differences, all political and non-political disputes, and it is a way to showcase how tolerance and the spirt of sports wins over all political disputes. It is also important to highlight that Qatar embedded the importance of sports within Qatari society, which is why since 2012, Qatar celebrates the National Sports Day' every year in February. The day is aimed at encouraging people to practice a healthy lifestyle and for sports to be a daily and integral component of their everyday routine. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the main areas of interest between Ecuador and Qatar?<br></strong>I am pleased to be here as there is a great deal of interest from Qatari investors in Ecuador in different sectors, including agriculture and aquaculture, as we are the global leaders in aquaculture and the largest exporter of shrimps, having surpassed India in 2019. We are the largest exporter of bananas and tuna as well. We export mostly bananas and roses to Qatar today, and exports are growing steadily. Qatar is one of the markets growing the most for us, and there are possibilities of shrimp export investments. In addition, there is great interest in tourism for Qatar investors as well as in agriculture, real estate, and infrastructure, with road building, ports, and airports. Qatar is also interested in operating one of our ports. The Minister of Transportation recently visited Qatar and met with the Qatari Minister of Transportation. Esmeraldas port in Ecuador in the north is of interest to Qatar, as it specializes in oil transport. Ecuador produces 500,000bpd, and we mostly use that port. It needs investment, so we are looking for private investors.</p><p><strong>Are there plans to open a direct flight between Doha and Ecuador?<br></strong>The issue with a direct flight between Doha and Ecuador is the distance, and currently the only direct destination in South America for Qatar Airways is Sío Paolo. However, Qatar Airways owns an important airline in Italy, Alitalia, and there are 500,000 Ecuadorians living in Italy, so there is an interesting market for a flight from Rome to Ecuador that connects with Doha as well. This is great news, as you can fill up a plane which makes economic sense. That will be good news for Ecuador as we have an aggressive campaign with President Moreno to bring new airlines to the country. We have achieved about 10 new connections from abroad, including Spain, France, Canada, and the Netherlands.</p><p><strong>What are the possible areas of interest for both Qatar and Ecuador?<br></strong>For any country to contribute in a relationship, it will always be through trade. We are growing through trade. The most important thing that will benefit both countries is natural gas, because Qatar has natural gas and we need it.</p><p><strong>Qatar is currently attracting foreign investment. Are there opportunities for partnerships between Ecuador and Qatar to manufacture products here?</strong><br>There have been ideas broached about adding value to Ecuadorian products in Qatar, starting with coffee or chocolate. This is great, as there are free trade zones where Ecuadorian products can enter, and there one can invest with Ecuadorian companies to provide added value to these products. The best example is coffee, as we have high-quality Robusta coffee, so we could start with that. Qatar is in great strategic location in the region for such a distribution and logistics project. President Moreno has worked extensively on this relationship. The amir knows Ecuador and there have been sheikhs who have been to Ecuador and know what they are talking about. We have a president and a vice president who have visited Qatar, so when we speak about Qatar, we know what we are talking about. That is how relationships start.</p><p><strong>How has Ecuador's anti-corruption initiatives delivered successful results?<br></strong>The entire region was impacted by corruption two or three years ago. The government has worked hard on this; the first thing is not to cover up for anyone. That was the first change. The second was that President Moreno started a process via a referendum where people voted to give the entire institutional system strength to uphold justice. We are reinforcing our institutions with transparency processes, including SGS standards to fight against corruption through certifications. We started with the largest companies in the country and are certifying them with SGS anti-corruption standards. We are meeting with the relevant authorities in Qatar, who are willing to share experiences and are cooperating to see where we can help each other. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Qatar and Georgia enjoy great relations in many fields. Are there any expectations of a qualitative shift in your bilateral relationship in the coming years?<br></strong>Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in March 1993, Georgia and Qatar have maintained positive dynamics of bilateral ties. Over the years, cooperation between the two countries has grown stronger in various areas, such as economy, culture, education, trade, tourism, and people-to-people contacts. Qatari-Georgian relations have developed rapidly. Several high-level visits took place from both sides. More than 10 agreements and MoUs have already been signed in different areas, and more are being prepared or ready to be signed in the nearest future. Georgia has become one of the favorite tourist destinations in Qatar. Three daily flights operated by Qatar Airways bring hundreds of visitors from Qatar to Georgia every day. Georgia and Qatar are discovering each other more and more as economic partners. In the last few years, bilateral trade volume has increased. Georgia exports agricultural products to Qatar and imports various products of petro-chemical industry. A number of Qatari investment projects is underway in Georgia. Taking into account Georgia's strategic location and the recently achieved FTAs with major markets, such as EU, EFTA, China, and CIS countries, there is potential for a qualitative shift in our relations.</p><p><strong>What are the main areas of cooperation between Georgia and Qatar in which we expect to witness further enhancement in the near future?</strong><br>Investments, trade, education and culture, innovation, and technologies are the main areas in which cooperation and interaction between our countries are expected to grow. Georgia is a leader in the region in terms investment attractiveness. Georgia has created one of the most advanced investment friendly environment: efficient public services, corruption-free government, and a free, fair, and transparent business climate, which is reflected in international institutions ratings. For example, the World Bank's Doing Business report 2020 placed Georgia in sixth place in terms of the ease of doing business out of 190 countries. According to World Economic Forum's Lowest tax rates 2018, Georgia occupies eighth place. The Heritage Foundation placed Georgia in 16th place on the Index of Economic Freedom out of 180 countries. Georgia has established itself as reliable partner and represents a role of stability in the region, a dialogue between Europe and Asia that can only attract more investors and create more confidence.</p><p><strong>In 2010, Georgia and Qatar signed an agreement exempting both nationals from visas. What impact will this have in attracting more visitors to boost tourism to Georgia?</strong><br>According to Georgian legislation, Qatari citizens are exempted from Georgian visa requirements and can travel to Georgia visa-free up to one year. Also, third-country nationals residing in Qatar permanently and holding Qatari IDs are exempted from Georgian visas and can travel directly. Nowadays, tourism is booming in Georgia. In 2018, the number of international visitors exceeded 8 million, and this year we expect more visitors. There are many reasons why people around the world choose to travel to Georgia—unique culture, gorgeous nature, mountains, local cuisine, seashore, ski resorts, and well-known hospitality.</p><p><strong>How can scientific and cultural cooperation between the two countries be further encouraged?<br></strong>I see great potential for cooperation in the fields of science and education, particularly in the field of innovation and technologies. Qatar is the seat of numerous prominent university branches, while a number of Georgian universities provide high-level medical education. Every year, Georgian students learn Arabic in Qatar University. Such student exchanges and cooperation in this direction are extremely important. In terms of culture, the famous Georgian National Ballet Sukhishvili performed in Doha twice this year, its first performance in GCC region. Cooperation in terms of joint film production is also a promising area. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The phenomenon of climate change is undoubtedly one of the most serious challenges of our time. It is a problem that is continuously exacerbating and causing many problems that intertwine in their economic, environmental, and social dimensions and have very serious negative repercussions on all forms of life, including human life, and on both developed and developing countries alike, especially on the tracks of the sustainable development which all peoples aspire to.</p><p>All states must fulfil their responsibilities and honor their commitments which international agreements have established to this effect. The State of Qatar has assumed its responsibility as an active partner in the international community to confront the climate change phenomenon.</p><p>In 2012, it hosted the 18th Session of the Conference of States Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Doha Carbon and Energy Forum, in which international experts participated to develop public policy recommendations for this sector and for governments on climate change and alternative energy, and carbon capture and storage. The State of Qatar has also spared no effort to ensure the success of negotiations of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015.</p><p>At the national level, the State of Qatar—in the light of its National Vision 2030—has taken many measures to develop technologies taking into consideration climate change and the adoption of clean energy, through the optimal use of water in order to reduce the loss of desalinated water, encouragement of recycling and reuse of water, improving air quality, promoting the efficiency of using gas and energy, waste recycling, and increasing green spaces.</p><p>In the same context, and to achieve our long-term environmental goals, the State of Qatar has prepared a set of fixed goals, the most important of which are those related to renewable energy and generating 200MW from solar energy within the next two years, which will increase to 500MW afterwards, and we are seeking to regulate carbon pricing as a means of reducing emissions and driving investments toward cleaner options.</p><p>We, as the host country of FIFA World Cup 2022, are committed to organizing an environment-friendly tournament and the first carbon-neutral tournament through the use of solar-powered stadiums and the use of cooling and lighting technology that is water and energy-saving.</p><p>I would also like to point out that the Qatar Sovereign Wealth Fund assumes an active role in combating climate change through Qatar Investment Authority, a founding member of the One Planet Global Sovereign Wealth Fund, which was established in accordance with the initiative of French President Macron to promote green investments and accelerate efforts to take into account climate change issues in the investment sector and management of sovereign wealth funds.</p><p>Within the framework of the State of Qatar's keenness to assume its role as an active partner with the international community, I announce the State of Qatar's contribution of an amount of USD100 million for the support of small developing island states and the least developed states to deal with climate change, natural hazards, and environmental challenges, and to build the capacity to counter their destructive effects.</p><p>The strategic importance of the Gulf region renders the realization of stability therein a regional and international need. We assert our firm position to keep the region away from the risks by resolving differences through dialogue based on common interests and respect for the sovereignty of its states. Stirring up tension and dictating the will by using siege and sanctions are not in the interest of any of them.</p><p>I have previously pointed out to the necessity for the work to establish a regional security system that preserves the security and stability of the Middle East and the Gulf region in particular. The overall events confirm the importance of this idea and the need for the work to achieve it. In this context, the unjust, unlawful, and unjustified blockade imposed by some countries on the State of Qatar continues. The Gulf Cooperation Council was its second victim paralyzing and causing it to lose its role.</p><p>I am confident of the steadfastness of the Qatari people and their brothers residing in Qatar of surpassing the blockade's effects and even of taking advantage of the challenge imposed on us despite the cost we paid. I have also been confident since the first day of the campaign of incitement and distortion that preceded the blockade that the Arab, Gulf, and global public opinion will soon realize the concealed objectives of the propaganda campaign against the State of Qatar, which is driven by tendencies of domination, the imposition of tutelage and control over the potentials of other states, and the real objective of making accusations that were quickly proved to be untrue, as this approach had been unveiled repeatedly when other states fell victim to it.</p><p>In line with our firm policy of respect for international law and the peaceful resolution of differences and disputes, we, who have sustained aggression, emphasize our position that the unconditional dialogue based on mutual respect and the lifting of the unjust blockade is the only means to end this crisis. We again express our deep appreciation of the sincere efforts of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Amir of the sisterly State of Kuwait, and the endeavors of the brotherly and friendly countries to resolve this crisis.</p><p>The combination of terrorism and violent extremism has become a major threat to the entire world. The elimination of terrorism requires a comprehensive approach that includes tackling its political, economic, and social roots along with security and military action. We reiterate our condemnation of all forms of terrorism.</p><p>The State of Qatar will continue to actively participate in the international efforts to combat violent extremism. And in this respect, I refer to the conclusion of a partnership agreement between the State of Qatar and the UN Counter Terrorism Office and the contribution of USD75 million to strengthen the capability of that office, as well as opening the international center on applying the behavioral vision on preventing and countering violent extremism, and the partnership agreement between Silatech Organization in Qatar and the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, with the aim of capacity building and launching projects in the Arab region aimed at terrorism prevention.</p><p>Locally, efforts are continuing at the legislative level and the support of national counter-terrorism specialized institutions until they became a role model to be followed at the regional level. Today, Qatar assumes an active role in implementing the counter-terrorism mechanisms adopted by the international community.</p><p>Mindful of the growing importance of communication technology, I renew my proposal last year calling for an international conference to address ways of regulating this issue in international law, and I affirm the readiness of the State of Qatar to host this conference under the auspices of the UN and to exert every effort with international partners to make it a success.<br>Qatar has made significant achievements in terms of workers' rights and work conditions in coordination with the International Labor Organization.</p><p>The success of the UN in countering the common challenges depends on the member states implementation of their commitments and responsibilities.</p><p>In this context, the State of Qatar has concluded partnerships with many UN organs, and Doha will soon host the UN House, which comprises offices of various organs of the International Organization concerned with peace, development, human rights, the rule of law, humanitarian action, terrorism combating, and extremism to enable them to perform their tasks ideally.</p><p>The State of Qatar has recently announced the support of the core resources of the UN with the allocation of USD500 million to be added to the support that Qatar has already provided, making Qatar one of the biggest partners supporting the UN in various fields.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Mexico play within Aura Minerals' international business strategy, and why did the company decide to invest here?</h4><p>When I joined Aura Minerals, we had projects in Honduras and Brazil. Mexico was not the best place to do mining because of past losses and problems. Today, Mexico is becoming one of our major operations, and the more we learn about the country, the more we see it is a top-tier place to invest in the world. Based on our analysis and learning since we reopened our operations here, we like three things about Mexico: it is a natural mining country—it has great mines; it has all the mining infrastructure, suppliers, parts, technology, and know-how, together with excellent labor; and all the legal framework and processes for acquiring and renewing permits and concessions are in place. Certainly, there is room to improve, though when we compare it to other countries, Mexico has a good transparency and straightforward process. We are currently looking for opportunities either to invest in other projects in Mexico or to expand our existing production. Aura Minerals has come to stay and grow in Mexico.</p><h4>What have been the main advancements in the Aranzazu mine since Aura Minerals restarted its operations in December 2018?</h4><p>We had a great start for the first three to four months where we saw opportunities to fast track production at Aranzazu Mine. However, we had a bump from the fourth to the seventh month where we had to learn how to work more closely with our contractors. We needed better communication and planning together as well as a better understand of our respective responsibilities and the decision-making process. Now, we are on the right track. On some of our numbers, we are ahead of our initial plan. Aranzazu Mine is a difficult mine; it is not as rich as our neighbors. Its copper grades are not that high compared to other mines. We have thinner veins, meaning we have to be more precise about where we mine. However, our team has been adept at understanding and adjusting to the complexity and has been successful in dealing with a more difficult mine.</p><h4>When will Aura Minerals invest in exploring its early stage targets?</h4><p>In the first year, we focused on how to restart the Aranzazu Mine and did a precise and detailed plan for this. In the second year, we did the restart and focused on an efficient ramp up before starting production. Now, as we move into the third year and phase, it is about how we expand our geological understanding and hopefully increase our operation management to double capacity, though that would take a few more years. We are now close to 40 million pounds of copper equivalent per year production from Aranzazu Mine. With our projected increase of 20-30%, this would take production close to 50-55 million pounds of copper equivalent per year. However, it will take at least 12 months to start this increase in production. That is our mid-term plan because we have to do all the geological studies followed by the technical studies before ramping up production.</p><h4>What is the main objective behind your 360-degree mining concept?</h4><p>Aura Minerals has a concept called 360-degree mining, which is an intuitive approach. We are bringing in a different way of managing mining companies that has less structures, less layers, and less centralized decision-making processes. To do this, you have to create an environment where middle managers really understand the values of the company and how they should make decisions, hence 360-degree mining. Managers have to ensure they have fully analyzed the impact on the environment, society, and communities as well as our employees before making a decision. Those are the three major angles they have to look at. Then, they need to consider the values inside each of these three categories. For example, one of the values we are promoting is safety as a priority. Another is how to hire staff, manage the best talent so they can grow and progress within the company, and help those who perform badly to improve or go. Once one has an understanding of this 360-degree management approach and its underlying values, it leads to fast decision making. We are still in the process, though the results have been extremely positive. We have mapped everyone in the company, and everyone has their own development plan.</p><h4>I saw that Aura has also reviewed it Mission and Vision, can you describe more about it?</h4><p>Our impact over the communities and employee's safety is being discussed and considered in all our decisions. We are very focused on excellence in whatever we do, we want to be among the best with safety, community, operational efficiency, our employees and talent management. When you add all of it, we reached our new mission which is “To find, mine and deliver the planet's most important and essential minerals that enable the world and humankind to create, innovate, and prosper“ and our Vision which is “To be one of the most trusted, responsible, well-respected and results-driven mining companies.“  When you add the new Mission, Vision and the 360 degree than you can have a clear understanding about us and you can feel all of it in Aranzazu, for example.</p><h4>Empowerment, opportunity and personal growth. How are Aura developing these 360-degree mining's concepts locally? </h4><p>Empowerment means providing a rewarding and meaningful opportunity to the approximately 3,000 people in six countries, in a wide variety of trades and professions, from geologists and miners, to engineers, electricians, mechanics, accountants, information technology specialists, and more. We give employment preference to the people from communities where we operate. Over 85% of our workforce are local people. Creating job opportunities for them is one of the most powerful positive social benefits of our business, especially when we are able to offer new opportunities for women, youth, and residents of remote areas with limited alternatives. At Aura, we promote an inclusive and diverse environment where every professional is valued and respected for who they are, and has the opportunity to develop their potential</p><h4>Mining is more than its employees. What are the programs created by Aura to improve local development? </h4><p>The wealth generated from our mining activities helps to reduce poverty and contributes to improving well-being and prosperity where we operate. We work with local governments, community leaders, and NGOs to contribute to community needs: Local development, quality of life, and education. We believe investing in these areas is the best way for us to contribute to building self-sustaining communities that will continue to prosper after our operations end. For instance, in Concepción del Oro we work with the mayor and the National Employment Service to prepare people for the job opportunities at Aranzazu and other companies or to create their own business.</p><h4>Safety is a challenge in mining industry. How does it work at Aura? </h4><p>We engage with our employees to foster a culture prioritizing health and safety. At Aura, safety is the responsibility of our entire team: employees, partners, contractors, and suppliers.  Create an environment where we never, under any circumstances, compromise on health and safety. By using effective risk management and resilient management systems, we believe the goal of Zero Harm for occupational health is achievable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>BİLGİ and the local higher education system have undergone considerable expansion in the last two decades. What challenges has this posed for BİLGİ?<br></strong>When looking at figures for both the higher education system and BİLGİ, the impact of the education sector's broad expansion over the last 15-20 years is evident. The increase in student and faculty numbers has made the Turkish higher education system, with over 7 million enrollments, the second-largest higher education market in Europe after Russia. When we examine BİLGİ —Turkey's third-oldest foundation university—you see a reflection of that growth. Such a rapid development brings in several challenges. This is why BİLGİ has gone through a stabilization, consolidation, and adjustment period in the last two to three years. We have entered an era where both the local higher education system and institutions need to focus more on outcomes and quality in order to survive in a swiftly changing market.</p><p><strong>How have changing economic conditions and education trends impacted the popularity of different programs offered by BİLGİ?<br></strong>Our four-year programs continue to enjoy strong demand. Our architecture, law, psychology, and engineering programs have undergone significant expansion in recent years; however, we are starting to feel the pressure of changing dynamics and a possible fall in demand in the near future. Furthermore, the last two years have seen students leaning more toward career-oriented programs closely linked to the economic outlook of the country. We have seen a rapid growth in two-year programs, which is a relatively new field for BİLGİ. We see it as a part of our mission to be inclusive and help those who are eager to join the workforce after completing a high-quality two-year program in line with market demands. On the other hand, the increasing number of international enrollments has been an important factor. The number of degree-seeking international students went up from 25,000 to over 148,000 between 2010 and 2019. This marks an increase in the number of students from Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan, India, and Europe.</p><p><strong>How has BİLGİ integrated technology?<br></strong>Almost 25 years ago, BİLGİ started its academic life as a social studies university. It took us over 15 years to introduce programs like engineering. However, due to our multidisciplinary approach, the elements of STEM were always part of the curriculum, especially in our wide array of postgraduate programs. We have opted for a new approach that aims to incorporate the industry's technology needs into our courses. We are looking at how some countries have successfully created value-added outcomes and made an impact on the development of an industry through this model. Top technology companies such as Apple actually enhance the findings of universities' research products. This is why it is critical for us to focus more on STEM; however, we need to make sure we do it in the selected fields where we have the necessary resources and capacity.</p><p><strong>In which social sciences fields is BİLGİ the strongest?<br></strong>BİLGİ was established with a focus on social sciences and law. In 2009, we revised our vision to become a comprehensive higher education institution and have since added the colleges of architecture, engineering, and health sciences and schools of vocational and applied-professional programs. Nonetheless, the university still maintains its vanguard position in the field of social studies. Our research centers in specific fields including migration, human rights, and civil society play an active role in creating a positive impact on society. Our center for migration research, for example, is the first migration research center in Turkey to carry out large-scale, multi-dimensional scientific research that contribute to policymaking processes at both national and international levels. Equally significant, our human rights law research center has conducted many projects and researches focusing on women's human rights, domestic and international human rights protection mechanisms, anti-discrimination, minority rights, and freedom of expression. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How suitable was 2019's annual pharmaceutical price increase for Abdi İbrahim's operations?<br></strong>Pricing in the pharmaceutical industry is controlled by the government, and this control mechanism has been developing against the pharmaceutical industry since 2009. The most recent price adjustment from 46% to 47% was needed. However, if we consider that almost all our costs are related to foreign currency, this figure still does not meet our costs. In recent years, pharmaceuticals production and import costs have increased more than prices, and 2019 is no different.</p><p><strong>What regulatory changes are necessary to promote and advance the Turkish pharmaceutical sector?<br></strong>Without the margins necessary for investments in R&amp;D, we cannot become a regional or global player. We need resources to make these investments, and we can only create them through higher sales. However, unfortunately, the sector is unable to make the investments needed to be competitive as a result of the changes in pharmaceutical prices. Several laws and plans were introduced; however, they didn't make the sector more competitive. We work with the government on amending these laws, both as a company and as part of a union. One plan is to review the mechanisms of incentives and, if necessary, contribute through grants. Some countries have become significant players in the pharmaceutical industry over the last 10 years largely because they have invested heavily in R&amp;D. In order to become a big player, we need to move away from the regulations seen in Europe and the US and tailor regulations to Turkey's needs. Finally, the sector needs more qualified human resources, and we have experienced and sufficient human resources in the production and development of conventional chemical products. However, the same cannot be said about biotechnology or other latest technologies. There is a need for government-funded incentives, doctoral programs, and overseas collaborations to further uplift the entire industry.<br><br><strong>What does the opening of your biotechnology facility represent for your future direction?<br></strong>We have divided our biotechnology investments into several stages. The first stage is called fill and finish, where we acquire the active substance from abroad and complete the formulation and filling processes in Turkey. The second stage is the production of biosimilars, which are devised in other countries from the cell through technology transfer. The third stage is producing our own biosimilars and biological products, which is the most difficult for a number of reasons: it requires a great deal of investment; there is a lack of related human resources; and the biosimilars field is new. Healthcare professionals and the related public authorities around the world are still skeptical of biosimilars. At Abdi İbrahim, we have invested USD100 million in this area in order to make Turkey a major player in this field and to prepare our company for the future. This number will continue to increase because one has to continue to invest when they start to work in this field. By doing so, we are now focused more on biological products.</p><p><strong>Why did you choose to invest in production facilities in Algeria and Kazakhstan?<br></strong>We studied both markets in terms of their market potential, access, and ROI, among other factors. Kazakhstan and Algeria are both big countries and big markets. Moreover, both countries enable us to access more markets. From Algeria, we can access Maghreb countries, and from Kazakhstan we can access Georgia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Russia. Another factor that works in our favor is Turkey's reputation in these countries. Both countries offer different advantages to investors.</p><p><strong>Which export markets are you focused on growing?<br></strong>Currently, the share of international markets in our total turnover is around 17-18%, and our goal is to increase that figure to 50%. To that end, we are working with more than 10 countries excluding Algeria and Kazakhstan, such as Azerbaijan, Georgia, Bosnia, Iraq, and Gulf countries.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Bıçakcılar shape its investment strategy?<br></strong>First, we need to determine the fastest-growing chronic diseases in Turkey, the region, and the world and then develop solutions to combat them. We want to grow into areas where we can compete and innovate. We have identified growth in lifestyle diseases related to heart and brain. While we have been traditionally distributors of therapies in these areas with the support of our extensive production facilities, we are working on making a direct impact on the healthcare trends. We are not competing against the established players; we want to bring in solutions that are within our specialty area and core set of expertise. </p><p><strong>How does your growth strategy rely on innovation rather than price competition?<br></strong>We started with a vision that focuses on the well-being of the patient. Ours is a vision that strives for a future where patients can live a quality life with easy and affordable access to quality healthcare. The patient is key to reach some of our targets for 2020. We will achieve our goals by investing in innovation and not by competing in terms of price. We already started developing a competitive edge by adding value and creating value proposals. We also want to increase our exports, which make the bulk of our revenue. These two strategies fit well together; in Turkey, localization and innovation are highly important whereas outside of Turkey disruptive innovation is the most important factor. The Turkish healthcare system is advanced. We have successfully penetrated the local market, which means we can also succeed internationally. Our strategy will help Turkey become a hub for medical device manufacturing.</p><p><strong>How are you rethinking your sales channels?<br></strong>Our goal is to stay in close touch with all the stakeholders, who are themselves in touch with the patients. This is better than choosing a channel and limiting ourselves. That means we have to step back and look at expanding our channels, rather than focusing on one channel. This will enable us to get in touch with hospitals, government officials, clinics, and the companies that work with them. We are also segmenting the markets and researching which segments need the most attention. One segment we are increasing our focus on is pediatric packages. In the US and Western Europe, there are hospitals specifically for children, and we are really excited about serving them. We are doing it through market segmentation, providing solutions such as surgical space and technical services, which is a huge added value. Notably, we are the only Turkish company with its own technical service, as others are mostly outsourcing it.</p><p><strong>What are Bıçakcılar's largest export markets and where would you like to expand?<br></strong>In terms of percentage, Western Europe is our biggest market; however, we don't offer the full variety of our products there. Fortunately, the situation is changing; our standards and quality can compete strongly against everyone in Western Europe. We have another way of looking at markets. In sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, some markets cannot afford new solutions. The majority of products being produced in western countries are not designed for developing and underdeveloped markets. We grabbed this opportunity by bringing in affordable solutions that can still do the job. This way we can boost our sales volume rather than relying on revenues from a few big clients. We want to serve as many patients as possible. </p><p><strong>What are your primary goals for 2020?<br></strong>We are taking big steps. We started as a family business and are now planning to go global. This requires big changes in the organization. We have to first and foremost build the internal structure, bring in the right talent, and cultivate existing talent. One of our goals is to enter the US market because being able to sell in the US proves a company's competitiveness and quality. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do Medtronic's products and services help tackle the cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes?<br></strong>Medtronic is the best-positioned company to help treat chronic diseases on a global scale. Cardiac-related deaths are the leading causes of death around the world. Medtronic has an innovative portfolio of solutions to treat cardiac-related diseases, such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure. The smart algorithms in our devices manage a patient's condition to sustain life without suffering severe heart failure conditions. Medtronic has invested heavily in several technologies in the cardiovascular field. Our external heart pump is an example of this, as is the first lead-less pacemaker, Micra, which is implanted directly into the patient's heart via a minimal invasive technique without leads, removing the risk of misplacing or moving leads and reducing medical complications. On the surgical side, Medtronic has the most innovative portfolio of treatments for diseases ranging from obesity to cancer, colorectal, and thoracic. For diabetes, our insulin pump and continuous glucose-monitoring technologies are important tools to manage a diabetic patient's condition effectively to avoid associated medical complications from escalating. The future of this technology is artificial pancreas. In Turkey, around approximately 20% of the entire healthcare budget is spent on diabetes and related complications. Healthcare systems and governments can save money by paying for the value that we add with our technologies. Those savings can then be reinvested in other areas.</p><p><strong>How has Medtronic introduced connectivity to its devices?<br></strong>Technology is in our DNA; our technologies help hospitals and healthcare systems treat patients in a more efficient way with better outcomes. This in turn prevents patient complications and additional costs arising from low clinical outcomes. The company's CareLink network links its devices, enabling them to monitor remotely, gather data, and reach out to the patient for early prevention or diagnosis. We use CareLink technology for implanted cardiac devices like pacemakers and for insulin pumps, and we are adding more devices to the network to gather massive amounts of data. </p><p><strong>What are the biggest challenges of overseeing such a large region?<br></strong>The majority of countries under my management are emerging markets. In Turkey's case, if we compare the population size and prevalence of disease with the number of surgeries performed, the ratio is low compared to developed countries. Increasing access to better healthcare is one of the main challenges in the region. At the same time, we have to keep in mind the differences between every healthcare system. In some countries, there is an advanced healthcare infrastructure. In Turkey, advanced PPP hospitals are being built, and there is universal healthcare coverage. Challenges in healthcare are too complex and require collaboration between industry, policymakers, and government bodies. The Turkish healthcare system is more mature than those of its neighbors. Other countries can learn and benefit from Turkey.</p><p><strong>What role is training and research playing in Medtronic's future strategy? <br></strong>Training and education are our primary means of increasing access to healthcare, helping physicians become more skilled, and consequently improving outcomes. Medtronic Innovation Center (MIC) in Istanbul, one of our seven training centers around the world, plays a critical role in training physicians. It has the capacity to train a few thousand physicians a year and hosts physicians from 35-40 countries.</p><p><strong>What are Medtronic's goals for 2019?<br></strong>First, through our training and education, we want to help the region treat more patients with better outcomes. Second, we would like to engage with our customers in a more meaningful way so they can better realize the value we provide with our technologies and solutions. Medtronic recently established its operations in Pakistan. In that context, we want to train Pakistani physicians and ensure the market has access to high-quality medical devices. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What impact did the annual adjustment of pharmaceutical prices have on Nobel İlaç's operations as well as the broader pharmaceutical industry?<br></strong>This is not the first time that we have been through the annual adjustment. Since price increases are typically announced some time before the effective date, some companies choose to deliver products at the previous price as a sales argument. It is no different than common surplus or rebate practices, and it creates a demand from warehouses and pharmacies. As a company, we are not prone to compromise in sales and thus do not have any special implementations to apply in such periods. We do not experience problems in our product delivery either. Our supply system obliges us to make planning months in advance, and since we do not keep a large stock at the consumption channel, we cannot be open to extraordinary demands.</p><p><strong>More broadly, how does the Turkish pharmaceutical regulatory structure support the healthcare sector, and what changes could be made to improve it?</strong><br>Turkey is a global example in terms of drug legislation, production ability, and capacity as well as access to drugs. We have a sufficient number of factories and R&amp;D facilities in GMP standards that can readily satisfy the national requirements. About 150,000 physicians and 25,000 pharmacies produce about 500 million prescriptions annually and we convey 2.5 billion boxes of drugs to our people. While the system is sound, what is missing on the regulatory side is national regulation of biosimilar products. Such regulation will improve the market for pharmaceutical companies. What is in practice at the moment is mostly from Europe and the US, and these regulations make it difficult for Turkish pharmaceutical companies to enter the market. Similar countries with success in biosimilars such as Russia, South Korea, India, and China have been operating with their own regulatory systems. Turkey can experience the same success with the implementation of a similar system.</p><p><strong>How does the increasing strain on the health insurance system impact the industry and Nobel İlaç's operations?<br></strong>Currently, save for a limited number of exceptions, the entire Turkish population is covered by health insurance. This is a benefit we should be proud of, as even some developed countries are unable to provide this. However, such an inclusive system also brings about financing problems. In the past 15 years, along with the growth of the population and average age, the improvements in access to health services and medication have unexpectedly increased the costs. In the past 15 years, the per capita number of referrals to a health center has increased four-fold. Currently, each of us visit a physician more than eight times, have six prescriptions issued, and consume 30 boxes of medication a year on average. About 80% of pharmaceutical consumption is financed by the public budget. We are proud of the level of services we have achieved as a country. However, the financial resources needed to enable this system are scarce. Drug prices have been in constant decline despite inflation and increasing foreign exchange rates, and thus the main agenda for companies in the sector has been to survive. Nobel enjoys a greater feeling of security due to the fact that our activities have not been limited to our efficient domestic operations; however, but we have also internationally expanded and become a net exporter. However, currently, we fear the pharmaceutical supply in Turkey will no longer be sustainable, and our culture of R&amp;D and production will be damaged.</p><p><strong>What investments has Nobel İlaç made—in part through the 2023 vision—in the area of biosimilar drugs?<br></strong>One of the main reasons for the funding problem is that we are still considerably foreign-dependent in the field of drugs. Each year, the pharma industry incurs a foreign trade deficit of about USD4 billion. That is why reducing foreign dependency on drugs was introduced as a target in state programs such as the 10th Development Plan and the 2023 vision document to support the domestic development and production of biosimilar drugs. We have been chosen as the first company and are working together with TUBITAK on this project. The first stage of the project, namely cell development, has already been completed. Next are the more advanced stages. We have made the necessary investments and have been progressing in a determined manner. This is very much in line with the general stance of our company as a champion pharmaceutical exporter with no foreign trade deficit. We consider the field of biotechnology one of the most crucial conditions for future existence and success.</p><p><strong>Other key areas of investment for Nobel İlaç include injectables and hospital products. Why were these areas chosen?<br></strong>We needed an injectables plant for the production of finished biosimilar products. The second reason for the investment is to increase our exports. We are operating in countries where injectables are highly used and plan a large number of exports to those countries. Domestically, the use of injectables in Turkey is also increasing. As the government has built city hospitals, which will enhance health tourism, the use of such products in hospitals will increase.</p><p><strong>What are your most import export markets, and from where do you expect greater demand growth?<br></strong>Currently, we have been carrying out marketing and sales operations in 20 countries through our own teams. We have been active in an extensive geographical region from Central Asia to Eastern Europe, in part through our international production facilities in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which were our first steps in international expansion that started 20 years ago. These countries had potential and were open to development. These facilities not only satisfy national needs but also provide a means for exports to the neighboring regions. More recently, our newest export destination is Russia, which is especially important to us as it holds a potential equal to the combined total of all the other countries we have been active in. It is difficult to gain a place in the Russian market but our initial results are extremely promising. As future endeavors, we have been considering Africa, the Middle East, and some European countries. We have already taken the first steps in some of them.</p><p><strong>What are Nobel İlaç's most important ongoing investment plans and biggest objectives?<br></strong>Our investments are ongoing in the biotechnology area, and our objective is to finish our facility and proceed with our project so that we can be in the market with these products by 2023 at the latest. Outside of that, we hope to continue to increase our domestic market share and to achieve our targets in our foreign operations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell me about the evolution of Alvimedica since its founding a decade ago?<br></strong>Alvimedica began as a start-up based on my father's idea to improve the quality of life. From a business standpoint, he looked at Turkey and saw that the country was importing 95% of medical devices. We acquired a small company and started to operate and manufacture catheters and balloons before moving into more sophisticated products. Around 2014, we decided that we needed to have a unique selling point, so we went out and acquired a company called CID, a spinoff of the Sorin Group in Italy, and started investing more in R&amp;D. From there, we built our second factory in Çatalca. At present, that factory produces 900,000 drug-eluting stents per year. The annual demand in Turkey is around 350,000, allowing us to export the rest. At present, we export to more than 70 countries. </p><p><strong>Why did Alvimedica acquire CID?<br></strong>Within CID's portfolio is a unique drug-eluting stent called Cre8. The stent has a special selling point for diabetic patients, which is growing at a very fast rate. Our latest product off of the Cre8 line is the Cre8EVO. Its good market perception paired with our low production costs and high capacity indicate it will be a success. </p><p><strong>What new products will you introduce in the near future?<br></strong>Our R&amp;D department is highly active. An exciting area we are entering is peripheral products. We will launch Nitides, a below-the-knee stent that works with the Sirolimus drug, by the end of 2019. We will also launch it in Europe before expanding globally. I am also excited about Cre8EVO, which is developing quickly, especially in East Asia.</p><p><strong>Broadly, is your export strategy to first succeed in Europe before you go global?<br></strong>Yes, we aim to succeed in our own region before expanding further. This strategy also helps from a regulatory standpoint. Regulations for drugs and medical devices across Europe are strict. There are ongoing checks, which helps us improve our standards. There are similar systems in place in the US, but the approval process there makes life hard for all foreign companies. As a normal-sized European company, we want to focus first on Europe and then on the rest of the world.</p><p><strong>What is Alvimedica's growth strategy?<br></strong>At present, our revenue is around USD50 million per year, and we expect to reach USD80 million by 2020. Our main objective is to help Turkey become a hub for the global medical device market. The government is aware of the potential and has decided to give incentives to the medical devices industry. So far, Alvimedica is the only company that is on the list to receive incentives, which will include incentives for funding and skilled workforce, such as specialized engineers, and support for R&amp;D projects. We have already partnered with the University of Ankara to do research on the mitral valve we are producing, a project that falls under the R&amp;D incentive program. From an investment standpoint, we also hope to go forward with our IPO in two years.   <br>What are the biggest challenges you face in the area of R&amp;D and workforce development?<br>R&amp;D is not a big problem because we have been heavily investing in the area since the beginning. Finding the correct workforce has been a challenge in Turkey, which is why we are currently building a new vocational school near our factory in Çatalca to educate the workforce on biotechnology.</p><p><strong>What are your primary objectives for the next 12 months?<br></strong>The primary goal is to launch our Nitides product. Big companies that would like to distribute it have approached us, and this will bring even better news for Alvimedica. Another objective is to continue producing Cre8 in Turkey at a different level using automation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Acıbadem is a leader in the Turkish healthcare sector and also operates internationally. What are the greatest challenges in operating in countries that have different legal arrangements and health systems?</strong><br>Acıbadem has been serving outpatients from 21 hospitals in four countries; we have a total of 14 medical centers and 30 representation offices in 18 countries. We provide direct health services in Bulgaria, Macedonia, and the Netherlands in addition to Turkey. Each of these has different systems and dynamics in relation to each other. An interesting aspect of the health sector is that although one may operate in different regions, the fundamental problems are similar around the world. For example, we operate in 10 countries as IHH, though the problems we discuss with our board of directors are usually the same. We encounter the lack of qualified health personnel, growing costs, ways of using efficient work models against raising costs, as well as the impact of health policies and practices on the private sector. When making investments in a country, it is important to understand the relationship between the private and public sectors, as well as the payment system in the country. In some countries, we have a strong and sound foundation of general health insurance, while in other countries there is the exact opposite. In addition, the health sector is subject to a high degree of regulation from many different angles. Because of that, one has to provide the best service by prioritizing both patient safety and patient health. In the meantime, you plan and expect to earn the return you desire. This is not an easy task.</p><p><strong>Acıbadem entered Bulgaria and Macedonia through acquisitions, whereas it began its operations independently in the Netherlands. Why were these separate models selected?</strong><br>When entering a country, you evaluate market entry options from many different angles, and many different factors can play an important role. For example, both Bulgaria's and Macedonia's health sectors are developing and are far behind in terms of regulations in comparison to Turkey. In such cases, the fact that there are already profitable elements within a certain quality of service justifies the acquisition. Besides, it is crucial to have local partners, especially in acquisitions, that understand both the country and the health sector well. The presence of partners that are familiar with the dynamics of the country is an important catalyst for one's goals. The Netherlands has a relatively highly developed socioeconomic structure, and its health insurance system is fairly developed. Using this structure in the Netherlands as a guide, we wanted to test ourselves by investing in an already-developed country for the first time. In summary, we took our model to both Bulgaria and Macedonia. Within the framework of our growth strategy, we prefer to move forward with both new hospital construction projects and possible acquisition projects. Our growth strategy abroad will continue on these foundations. This will vary slightly depending on the country and the conditions in which we aim to enter. Our growth strategy focuses on regions close to the areas where Acıbadem operates, rather than focusing on certain countries. In this context, we can count the Balkans, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.</p><p><strong>How has Acıbadem University contributed to the group's employment policy? What role does Acıbadem University play in educating doctors in the region and Turkey?</strong><br>Acıbadem University, which provides education in the field of health sciences and reflects our pioneering and holistic perspective in the health sector, is my social responsibility project. With a capacity of more than 4,000 students and 100,000sqm of indoor space, Acıbadem University educates health professionals of the future with its world-class academic and technological infrastructure. In this sense, Acıbadem University has a very important function in the terms of training qualified human resources. Young people who graduate from different faculties are not only doctors, but also nurses, health technicians, and administrators. As a result, individuals blended with the Acıbadem culture at the start of their educational lives continue to be a part of our family. In this respect, Acıbadem University has a significant complementary power. It is one of the best health science universities in the whole world. In addition to our strong academic staff, we also have our CASE Clinical Simulation and Advanced Endoscopic and Robotic Surgery Training Center, one of the most advanced medical simulation training centers in the world. We demonstrate our difference with our advanced technology student laboratories that offer practical training in the associate and undergraduate programs. CASE, our center of clinical simulation, is accredited by Europe and the US. It is also one of the two centers in the world that has a certificate of excellence. One of them is Acıbadem University and the other is University of Toledo in the US. In four years, more than 15,000 specialists from abroad have been trained in this simulation center. One needs the highest test scores to apply to Acıbadem University's school of medicine.</p><p><strong>Over the next 12 months, what are Acıbadem's primary objectives?<br></strong>2018 was a difficult year for our country as a result of the economic fluctuation and the devaluation of the lira in the second half of the year. Nevertheless, we managed to increase our revenues by 32%. The volatility of foreign exchange had a negative impact on our foreign currency debt. Nevertheless, Acıbadem has always succeeded in getting out of crisis. In 2019, we are taking important steps to reduce our foreign currency debt and strengthen our balance. In the short term, through the refinancing of our loans and through capital injection in the company, we plan to minimize our risks by reducing both our foreign currency debts and our remaining debts in more favorable conditions. Thus, Acıbadem will be ready to make significant progress in the near future as a cash generating company with a strong balance sheet. We have two hospital investments in Istanbul, and we continue to work on them. We are doing it slowly to see what is ahead. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How will the new Istanbul Airport improve Turkey's tourism industry?<br></strong>The new Istanbul Airport will soon have an annual capacity of 150 million passengers, making it the largest airport in the world. It was built on 80,000ha, which is seven times larger than Atatürk International Airport. Turkish tourism has lately made a rapid recovery. By the end of 2019, Turkey expects to receive 48 million tourists. Our expectation in the near future is 70-80 million tourists. During peak seasons many groups travel on charter flights, constraining the runway and disturbing the entire operation. The new airport's size and capacity fits perfectly into this equation.</p><p><strong>How does Mercan formulate its strategy around evolving consumer habits?<br></strong>We closely track the buying behaviors of Middle Eastern markets, which represent the majority of our customer base. People from Middle Eastern countries tend to buy our tour packages, even on a last-minute basis. With this in mind, we take care of block-booking on flights, special room agreements, guides, and all other relevant ground services, then wait and sell most of our packages close to the deadline. This is called mass tourism, and we have been engaged in this for the last 10 years. 60-70% of our revenue is generated from this segment.</p><p><strong>Which region represents your primary market and where are you planning to expand?<br></strong>Around 90-95% of our business comes from the GCC, the Middle East, and North Africa. The growth in our current markets is good, and we monitor arrivals from these countries on a monthly basis. These markets are growing by 15-20% annually, and we are expecting even higher growth with the new Istanbul Airport. Our target is to add new markets to our operations, particularly Asian markets. To that end, we are closely looking at China, India, and Pakistan because tourist numbers from these countries have witnessed a major boom. While people from these countries do not have the same buying habits and language as the Middle East, the concept of tourism is similar and we know how to please them.</p><p><strong>What is your strategy for entering a new market?<br></strong>First, we study the market in terms of what products and cities it prefers, the languages they speak, and all of their quality requirements. To get to know the new market, we do all the necessary research, starting with the resources provided by Turkey's Ministry of Tourism and Culture. Thereafter, we attend tourism fairs and exhibitions in the target market and form a specific marketing strategy to penetrate the market.</p><p><strong>How does Mercan position Turkey against competing tourism destinations?<br></strong>In 2014-2015, prices in Turkey declined by 50-60%, which squeezed the industry but also created new opportunities. As a result, tourists going to resort destinations such as Egypt, Tunisia, Greece, and Cyprus started considering Turkey. For example, we often check the rates in Sharm El Sheikh when we do comparison for Middle Eastern tourists interested in Antalya.<br>Are you keen to expand into the MICE segment?<br>The majority of our guests are leisure tourists; however, we do have some business travelers from the Middle East. During the last five years, we have arranged several MICE organizations. At present, we are managing a number of new MICE requests. We have an efficient and professional MICE team capable of handling all operations. In 2018, our MICE department marked a notable improvement, and we are even more optimistic about 2019.</p><p><strong>What is Mercan Tourism's online strategy?<br></strong>In 2014, we became a destination management company (DMC) that can handle all travel arrangements, offline and online. We shaped our strategy and three years ago created a booking platform to serve our clients via the Mercan online system. In terms of back office processes, we are leveraging software to improve our service quality and optimize costs. Our in-house IT department oversees these improvements and manages IT-related projects. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Could you give us a brief history of Swissí´tel The Bosphorus?</strong></p><p>Swissí´tel is one of Turkey's first five-star luxury hotels. Our location, formerly the garden of Dolmabahçe Palace, makes us even more unique. The original owners of the hotel were Japanese, and since then we have undergone many changes. Our name, however, has remained the same throughout, and this consistency has made us a renowned Turkish institution. 70-80% of people working in leading institutions within the local hospitality industry built their careers, in part, at Swissí´tel. We have been essential in training the very best talent for Turkey's hospitality industry, and we are still a market leader across every segment we operate in. </p><p><strong>Which regions or countries are you focusing on?<br></strong>At present, Swissí´tel is concentrating a great deal on Asia. Russia is a key focal point, as is South America. All hotels in Istanbul want to expand the diversity of their client base, as relying only on one demography carries too much risk. Many hotels suffer because of over-reliance on a single segment or demography, and we want to avoid this mistake. I am personally focused on Asia; specifically, I am keen to bring Chinese tourists to Turkey. Additionally, AccorHotels—our management company—has a great presence in the Americas, which gives that market a certain appeal. Russian business travelers also represent an interesting market. My goal with respect to the Russian market is to maintain the momentum that we have already built. Our broader strategy is to diversify as much as possible. In Antalya, in the south of Turkey, the industry has seen the negative effects of investing too much in a single market. The advantage of Istanbul is that the city appeals to people from around the world. Saudis are still the number-one visitor group from the Middle East, but we are seeing growth from Qatar and Kuwait, as well as Iran. </p><p><strong>What percentages of your clients are leisure and business travelers?<br></strong>Leisure comprises nearly 80% of our business. Business travel, on the other hand, is presently trending downward, but we are looking forward to promoting it, particularly among US and European visitors. Istanbul's luxury cruise sector has been declining over the past two years but is showing signs of reversal of late.</p><p><strong>What is your strategy for capturing the business segment? <br></strong>We pride ourselves on being able to offer the best experience that business travelers can receive. The value they get from us is unparalleled. As a destination, Istanbul itself is amazing, enriched by thousands of years of history. I recently attended a panel with German travel agencies, and they are interested in bringing customers back to Istanbul. In recent seasons, German travelers have sampled alternative destinations like Spain, Portugal, and Greece and have consistently found that the value they receive in Turkey is far superior.</p><p><strong>What efforts or investments has Swissí´tel made to improve guest experience?<br></strong>Swissí´tel Istanbul has a separate multinational team focused on improving guest experience. The company utilizes a strong set of tools to track and fulfill a guest's personal preferences. The goal is to create an excellent experience for visitors of all backgrounds and build an emotional connection with them. This is why Swissí´tel Istanbul has the highest guest satisfaction rating as well as the highest employee satisfaction level out of all of our global locations. </p><p><strong>What are your biggest goals and plans for 2019?<br></strong>Our number-one goal is to focus on guest experience. Maximizing that will increase our average daily rate. Guests reflect on their experience and pay accordingly. Additionally, we want to expand our reputation in Asia and South America. We are working very hard on this and believe we are on the right track. We want to be able to offer experiences that justify higher rates. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Jolly kept pace with tourism growth in Turkey?<br></strong>Jolly is a company with 33 years of experience in Turkey tourism industry. We have operations in leisure, business travel, and MICE. We have been working with both local and global suppliers to enable Turkish tourists to travel around the world. All business units have recorded strong healthy growth in last 10 years. This ongoing trend has bloomed with Goldman Sachs' investment in our company. Goldman Sachs first invested in Jolly in 2015, and it chose to buy a second stake with us in November 2018. Now, we have a foreign investor within our company. It has minor shares, and the management is still done by the Vardar family. </p><p><strong>How has Goldman Sachs' investment allowed Jolly to expand outside of Turkey?<br></strong>This was an important step for us, turning the Jolly brand into an international tourism company. We want to contribute to Turkey's tourism sector. The first step for us was to overhaul the entire technological infrastructure of our company. After three years of hard work, we have developed our own ERP system, which was also funded by Goldman Sachs. We have made an important start in our short-, medium-, and long-term plans. After a full deployment in Turkey, we plan to export this technology around the globe as well. We will also work on expanding our outbound operations in key markets. With our previous partners Germany's Öger Tour and Russia's Moss Tour, we brought in 2.6 million tourists to Turkey in the 90s. Now, we will start our incoming business again. </p><p><strong>How will this strategy change impact your customer profile?<br></strong>Jolly annually serves around 1 million Turkish tourists. 80% of this is inbound, and 20% is outbound tourism. We have reached an extremely important point in our future strategy. In this new period following Goldman Sachs' second investment, our goal is to work our brand in foreign countries too, starting in 2019. We will sell our local contracted hotels to providers in foreign countries within our system. We are the biggest operator in Anatolian tours, and our goal now is to bring our international guests, especially European guests, on Anatolian tours. Last but not least, another focus area for us will be MICE. We currently serve more than 300 companies in organizing meetings, business trips, or congresses. We will also start providing this service to foreign companies.</p><p><strong>Across Jolly's products, where do you see the most revenue growth and profitability right now?<br></strong>In our packaged tours, individual hotels, airplane tickets, and all the other tourism products, price is the most important variable. Our two-most important products in volume are flight tickets and hotel accomodations, and we have identified the hotel segment as an area of focus for us. In 2019, our goal is to get 7,000 hotels in Turkey on our website. We created an extranet for this. Hotels define their own prices, capacity, and programs on our site. We used to make contracts and then entered them into our system, but now we give hotels their own platform for this.</p><p><strong>How has Jolly changed its operations and strategy to adapt to changes in technology and how people book vacations?<br></strong>We established a technology company called Gordion technologies in 2012. Goldman Sachs became a partner of this company too. In terms of what we call end-to-end tourism mobility, we can carry out operations with a technology program from a guest's first purchase to their last. Thanks to our technological infrastructure, our guests can buy concert tickets in their destination, train tickets, make reservations in any restaurant they like, or buy football match tickets. We have many ideas and plans and will realize all of them in the new era. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>When Işık Tarım began organic farming practices in the 90s, what was the competitive landscape like?<br></strong>At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, several international companies came to Turkey and started to produce organic products, primarily seedless grapes. They went through contracted manufacturers. We never had contact with these companies. Instead, we decided to start our own organic farming because our background and land were suitable for it. The 90s were a strategically important milestone for us. We are the first Turkish company to independently begin organic farming. We expanded to different areas and started to produce organic figs and apricots. Today, we produce more than 30 different products. </p><p><strong>How did you develop an international network of buyers and business partners?<br></strong>We expanded internationally by participating in international exhibitions. We first started exporting to Germany and at present, we export to 40 countries. Our second strategic move was to invest in production geared toward the intermediate food industry. That means companies that produce chocolate, biscuits, and baby food. Entering this sphere was not particularly difficult for us; since we directly buy from the farmers, we were able to supply the products easily. </p><p><strong>You invested in an individually quick frozen (IQF) facility in 2013 and a hazelnut facility in 2015. Why did you invest in these facilities?</strong><br>The dried fruits segment makes up 74% of our revenue stream. After our success in the organic dried fruit segment, our customers began demanding IQF products and hazelnuts. In the early 1990s, we had already started producing these products through our contractors but over time, this resulted in quality problems. To overcome this issue, we rented some facilities to produce frozen fruits. By 2013, we decided to invest in our own facilities. The same story goes for hazelnut. We started to process hazelnuts in 1995. Eventually, we opened our hazelnut processing facility and became an exporter.</p><p><strong>Işık Tarım's two main revenue streams are organic products for consumers and intermediate food products for businesses. Which segment are you working on growing the most?</strong><br>In the beginning, our intermediate food products segment was bigger than our retail segment. However, over the years, the demand for B2C products has grown larger and larger, and today, 60% of our revenue consists of intermediate products and the remaining 40% comes from retail products. Our primary goal within the B2C segment is to develop our 'Happy Village' brand. We aim to supply healthy products to our consumers. </p><p><strong>Which regions and specific countries are most important for your export strategy?<br></strong>98% of our sales materialize through exports. Canada, the US, Germany, France, and Switzerland are our main markets. We also export to Russia and Eastern Europe. In the east, we export to Japan, Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea. Organic products are usually consumed by health-conscious customers. Although there is a perception that organic foods are mostly purchased by wealthy consumers, we have realized that the middle class in highly developed economies is more inclined to buy organic foods.</p><p><strong>What are Işık Tarım's primary objectives over the next 12 months?<br></strong>We have two primary objectives. First, we want to protect lands both in Turkey and the region. Successfully initiating investments in organic farming for the past 35 years is the result of this philosophy. We strive toward expanding lands where organic farming is done. We have 12,000ha of organic farming land in Turkey and 20,000ha of land in Turkish-speaking countries in Central Asia. We plan to increase this over the next 12 months. Our second objective is to serve healthy products to our consumers. To do that, we try to introduce dried fruits outside our existing markets, such as East Asian countries, Eastern Europe, South America, Africa, and the Middle East. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What investments has Assan made for its production facilities in the areas of robotics and automation?<br></strong>Thus far, we have invested more than USD50 million in industrial investments. Two years ago, we invested EUR6 million in a fully robotic system and are the only food company in Turkey that has acquired such a modern and efficient system. This is because we have been growing by double digits for the last five years, and much higher than 10%. In 2018, we also experienced significant growth, and 1Q2019 was as successful as planned. We, therefore, have to invest in the production line, and not for machinery growth. We also focus on know-how, and this shows how the group believes in Assan Foods.</p><p><strong>How have you vertically integrated to minimize some of the supply chain issues typically faced by food and agriculture operations?</strong><br>We have been working with many international companies such as Heinz and Nestlé. The issue of general supply is important in food because of the ingredients. We invest significantly in ingredients like tomatoes and have been working with more than 450 contracted tomato farmers in the region. We give them seeds, fertilizer, and know-how. We have contracts with them to follow the entire process all the way to harvest. We also give them the necessary equipment to have great results. Two years ago, we started a smart farming project. We have a base on that farm that collects all the information from the ground and the plants. We measure 11 parameters, such as the wind and humidity, for example, and send updates to the farmer saying it is time for watering, and so on. In the first year, we saved 50% water and almost 60% pesticides. We are working with the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) and would like to bring this technology all over the valley because at the end of the day it is good to have a smart farm and sustainability. We are part of a sustainability program with many other international companies in which we supply them with raw materials and products. We also produce their brands.<br>What is the breakdown of your revenue in terms of private label production and your own brands?<br>It is around 50/50. We have also been expanding our private label business into new markets. For example, in mid-2018 we signed an agreement with eight countries in East Asia. We entered countries such as Cambodia, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, and so on with their private label products.</p><p><strong>How has Assan changed its product offering to adapt to consumer demands for healthier, more organic products?<br></strong>It is important to have strong suppliers. We also certify them; the supply part is extremely important in the first stage. We also need to have a healthier way of producing all these products. We have all kinds of certification and have been checked by many international companies. As we develop, R&amp;D becomes more important. We continue to develop this in a healthier way. For example, we started using sunflower oil in mayonnaise but are now also working on olive oil. Moreover, we do not add preservatives. Current trends are definitely moving toward healthier and cleaner labels.</p><p><strong>What is the breakdown of your revenue from Turkey and your international markets, and where are you looking to grow?<br></strong>Our revenues are 60% Turkey and 40% international. We have been in Europe for a long time, and a new market for us is East Asia. Our entry into Wal-Mart China was a large step with our own brand and recipe. GCC countries are also close, and we know their taste profiles extremely well, so we can supply many products. Not all are our products, as we also produce for international brands.</p><p><strong>What new products are coming out soon as a result of your R&amp;D efforts?<br></strong>We have a marketing and R&amp;D team whose target is to launch three new products every year. Our main focus right now is value-added products, such as sauces, mayonnaise, and ketchup. There are always 10-12 new products in the pipeline. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-therapeutic-touch]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is Altıparmak working to grow its domestic market share as well as its exports through the introduction of new products?<br></strong>We are the top brand in our category in Turkey. Our market share is 57%, excluding discount brands, and 42% with those. Our company has been around for 40 years. We first targeted the domestic market but have been exporting for 25 years. Right now, our exports are small, representing about 4% of our total production, and our goal is to export 20% of our products by 2020 and subsequently grow that to 50%. We are able to increase that figure quickly because we have more innovative products and in general a wider selection of products that appeal to the international market. We have two important products that are more competitive in the global market. One is Apitera, which uses apitherapy, a branch of complementary medicine done with bee products. Apitera Peak products include royal jelly, honey, pollen, and propolis. These are all phytotherapeutic products. We also used herbs like ginger, cinnamon, pepper, ginkgo biloba, and ginseng to combine aromatherapy, apitherapy, and phytotherapy to create a medicinal line. They are also innovative in their packaging, using single-use, practical, and hygienic packaging.</p><p><strong>How has the lira's depreciation impacted your exports?<br></strong>The lira's depreciation has been an advantage for our exports. We can provide international customers lower prices than previously determined before in foreign currency. This makes us more competitive.</p><p><strong>In which markets do you see export potential for non-traditional products, such as Apitera?<br></strong>These are products with great profit and added value because honey is available everywhere around the world, and competition is much steeper; however, these products allow us to reach out to different market segments. Our expectation with these products is to have high demand in the US and Japan because of the nature of the product. This product doesn't exist in the US or Japan and is an on-the-go product that can be carried in one's pocket. It is a practical product and fits in with American culture. As for the regions and countries, we work with Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, China, Japan, Singapore, the UAE, and Qatar, and hope to enter Saudi Arabia soon.</p><p><strong>Apitera and many of Altıparmak's new products fit within the health segment. How do you stay in touch with changing consumer preferences?</strong><br>If one wants to progress in their category, they have to innovate. It is impossible for us to copy a product from the competition. We cannot be the leader. For example, for these products, we thought about the mixture that would be used. One of the most important factors of gaining market share is differentiating one's product. We need to know our consumer and their needs. Thus, for Apitera we wanted to make practical but healthy products that customers could carry in their pockets. This is not our discovery. However, putting it into such a format with products inside is something unique: only we do this.</p><p><strong>What marketing tools has Altıparmak used to educate the market about its health-conscious products?<br></strong>We focus on how to earn the trust of consumers as best we can. We have a QR code on our products to provide customers with additional health and ingredient information. With this, we not only provide an analysis of the product to the customer, but also supply them with information about the flower the product comes from. Consumers can read this before purchasing the product. This will enhance the trust between Balparmak and its consumers. If only all food products had such a thing. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-right-kind-of-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the reduction of the minimum real estate investment for citizenship impacted your sales?<br></strong>Following the reduction of the minimum real estate investment for citizenship to USD250,000, there was a 40% increase in sales to foreigners. Reducing the requirement was a correction to the standard in the global market, as most countries giving residency permits use similar values. Compared to the local market, foreign sales account for about 10% of sales. It is not a big market for Turkey, though the change in regulation has helped.</p><p><strong>How do you seek to grow the number of sales to foreigners within Turkey?<br></strong>We are a real estate network with around 50 offices. In Turkey, we started selling real estate to European markets in tourist areas and began selling in Istanbul four or five years later. We have almost 10 years of experience in the European market and have an operation in the US as well. We see significant growth from the Iranian, Iraqi, Afghani, and Pakistani markets. We do local business through our branches and system and the international business in our headquarters as a separate team. We have a network of sub agents, similar to a franchise system, and have organic balance in many countries.</p><p><strong>Considering the depreciation of the lira, how have your customers been impacted?<br></strong>The depreciation of the lira and the reduced real estate investment for citizenship combined have increased foreign sales by 40%; however, there is still room to grow. Domestically, the impact comes down to financing. As a developing country, customers do not live on cash and need mortgages. If the rates are high, they have to wait. TRY400,000 is a psychological limit for people to purchase; no one can take out all the cash to purchase when the interest rates are so high. However, this has happened before and will happen again. The real estate market is cyclical. The demographics of the market will result in future growth. Turkey has a young population that demands real estate. There are 21 million housing units in Turkey, and 14 million of them were not built up to code according to the earthquake law. There is a great deal of room to grow, and foreigner movement is just a small piece of the journey.</p><p><strong>What elements of technology have you incorporated into your business?<br></strong>We have a conventional agency system and are also extremely strong in digital. We are doing most of our operations digitally now and have a software company with sales office CRMs, applications for real estate dealers, and online payment systems for property management stuff. We are also doing software products for marketing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[monitoring-progress]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What steps is GABORAS taking to accomplish its goals?<br></strong>GABORAS seeks to develop a real estate environment that creates trust. In our sector, there are many different real estate values being quoted. For example, property appraisal institutions and insurance companies both have values that differ from the market price. Investors, both local and international, are not sure which value is correct. GABORAS seeks to digitize the entire real estate sector's operations and provide concrete and technical information about each and every piece of real estate in Turkey. We have 183,000 title deeds in total and can provide information about all of these, whether it be earthquake issues, new legislation affecting the property, or the market price over the last 24 months. GABORAS seeks to digitize, standardize, and provide property information, as well as create indexes and then later come up with a real estate stock exchange. We have done 10 years of hard work on big data, algorithms, and creating technical information. We have finished that first stage of big data, and the second stage is monitoring one's real estate portfolio. This is crucial, for example, for a general manager who needs to know exactly what real estate assets the institution has, along with their current value. Property values change over time, and valuation reports take time to do, so we need to digitize the valuation process. We want to create a real estate declaration control system because there are a number of real estate listing services and websites in Turkey, though these are not controlled so they are easy to manipulate, for example, by using fake valuation declarations or prices. We want users to be able to access all the legal documentation relating to a property, such as construction permits and real estate broker documents and then work with the various real estate listing services to verify the information. The third stage includes various systems, such as providing contact details for a list of the best real estate brokers, appraisal institutions, and planners in each area (i.e. grid system) for people who want to verify information on the ground. This way buyers can verify if the online information about a property is true or not. We have all the smart data ready and can provide external services to government officials as well.</p><p><strong>What is GABORAS' strategy to ensure its real estate platform always has the most up-to-date information?<br></strong>The information is instantly updated because we use open source data on the internet, which is always being updated. We also use government data relating to any special analysis, and if there is a decision that is announced publicly from the government, it will immediately go into our system. This is the most up-to-date real estate information you can access in Turkey.</p><p><strong>Has GABORAS received any support or push back from the government? What hurdles do you face under the current regulations?</strong><br>The government has different institutions and ministries. When introducing something new, such as a digital model that has not been used before, some may oppose it. However, the president has explicitly stated that a real estate stock exchange market should be established in Turkey, that studies for this should be accelerated, and that we do not have time to waste in this area. Some ministers are also highly supportive of this idea. Thankfully the government has been extremely supportive, and this idea and project are getting bigger. In six months, we will be talking about something more. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Core Media has undergone a number of restructurings since its creation over two decades ago. Can you outline the changes and reasons for them?</strong><br>In 1994, the company was called Magic Advertising. Initially, we did advertising on municipality buses. Magic Advertising was acquired by Clear Channel, an international media company, in 1999 and became a strategic partner of Istanbul Municipality. Initially, it was one of the two big suppliers of bus shelter advertising around the city before expanding its business into Anatolia, winning tenders in cities like Antalya, which is the biggest tourist center in Turkey after Istanbul, and Kayseri, an industrial hub near Cappadocia. Between 2002 and 2013, Clear Channel was fairly successful in Turkey. Then, due to Clear Channel's concerns with the global economy, it decided to exit some of its emerging markets. I was CFO when we acquired the business from Clear Channel. Now our firm is called Core Media.</p><p><strong>How have Core Media's operations changed since you acquired it from Clear Channel?<br></strong>Clear Channel Turkey was a financially healthy company when I acquired it in 2016. When the coup attempt happened, it brought some instability to our business. The elections, referendum, presidential elections, and changes in the administrative and municipality systems all followed the failed coup, making the last three years difficult, especially since we were no longer backed by a multinational company. But having local knowledge and relationships has been more important than having multinational support. Our business is heavily dependent on local dynamics and experience both to sell advertising and win tenders. We have become leaner as a result of Clear Channel's exit and have outsourced much of our operations, so we can focus on sales. We no longer have the quarterly financial reporting obligations of a listed company, so we have reduced the amount of bureaucracy in the company. We are able to make decisions faster. Core Media is a big company in our industry. Now we have gone from moving like an elephant, powerful but cumbersome, to moving like a cat, quick and crafty. </p><p><strong>Across your markets around Turkey, what different revenue streams do you have?<br></strong>Core Media has different types of revenue streams. In Istanbul, we have a bus advertising business, free-standing units in urban areas, and the metro bus line, which is the backbone of the city. These components complement each other, because in this industry you have to sell the units as networks. Therefore, the metro bus line and free-standing units together are becoming a good network for us. In the shopping malls, we run digital advertising units and have high end shopping malls in our portfolio. Among others, we operate in the top two malls in Istanbul—Zorlu and Kanyon—in addition to the Mall of Istanbul, where many tourists visit. We manage more than 300 digital advertising screens in malls, all from a central control point, so it is much more efficient than traditional forms of advertising. However, it is also more capital intensive initially, as you have to invest in the technology. We also run the advertising units for Yalıkavak, one of the top five marinas in Europe. Aside from Istanbul, we run billboards and all the bus stop advertisements in Antalya, Kayseri, Edirne, Kırklareli, and Kahramanmaraş. We provide advertising spaces in some shopping malls in Izmir and Ankara as well. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

Why has India been a target for Çelebi's ongoing international expansion?</strong><br>Train travel has always dominated transportation in India. Only recently has its aviation sector established itself as a safe, affordable, and credible alternative. The number of passengers traveling with Indian airlines has more than doubled over the past seven years, compared to just a 6% increase in railway passengers. The growth is not only in passenger traffic, but also evident in the volume of air cargo transshipments, bolstered further by growing pharmaceuticals and perishables. Moreover, as the world's largest democracy with a population of over 1.3 billion, India's potential for further growth and industry development is clear. We expect air passenger numbers to, from, and within India to increase by 3.3 times over the next 20 years to more than 500 million passenger journeys per year—increases underpinned by a growing middle class increasingly able to travel. Çelebi Aviation is already seeing its investment opportunities grow in India. This strong growth outlook for air passenger demand will see India overtake Germany, Japan, Spain, and the UK within the next five years to become the world's third-largest air passenger market. The air transport market in India employs more than 390,000 people and supports another 570,000 more in the supply chain. Overall, the industry contributes some USD30 billion annually to India's GDP. These are exciting times for air transport in India and for Çelebi Aviation's Indian subsidiaries.</p><p><strong>How does the privatization and commercialization of an aviation sector—such as the case of India—dictate into which markets Çelebi enters?</strong><br>India is one of the two mainstays of Çelebi Group's ground handling and cargo business; the other is our home market, Turkey. Çelebi will stay focused on both organic and inorganic expansion opportunities in India for the foreseeable future, such as a selection of independent ground handlers at all airports operated by the Airport Authority of India and divestment of the ground handling business of Air India. That being said, Çelebi is always on the lookout to widen its footprint. The privatization and commercialization of new aviation markets has been an ongoing trend in our business for quite some time now and will definitely continue at an increasing pace. In this context, we are closely following opportunities in certain countries in ASEAN and Africa. Where the incumbent service providers are mostly government owned or controlled, the trend is now catching up with them, and they are eying opportunities to monetize and divest their ground handling and cargo-related businesses.</p><p><strong>More broadly, in which regions is Çelebi interested in for expansion?<br></strong>The Middle East is always a focus for reasons of growing trade and new airport projects that indicate an ever-growing region of interconnecting flight hubs and transfer points. Northern and Eastern Africa are other areas of interest, as there is an emerging middle class and increasing capacity and demand for regional exports that will inevitably fuel air traffic growth. The economic hubs of APAC and ASEAN are other regions we are focused on. Large populations with steady growth, coupled with major economic growth and proximity to other export and manufacturing bases, make those regions not only highly attractive but also fiercely competitive.</p><p><strong>How has the opening of the new Istanbul Airport impacted and challenged Çelebi's operations?<br></strong>The preparation for that was challenging, though surprisingly, within the third day we were almost at the right on-time performance level in terms of our handling. In terms of challenges, the average taxi for aircraft is about 22 minutes and can take up to 40 minutes. Çelebi Aviation's costs have risen by about 30-35%, mainly because of the distances involved, and we have had to increase our workforce to serve the same number of passengers. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do Ceynak's different logistics services and infrastructure work together to form an integrated network for its customers?<br></strong>Over the course of our 50-year history, we have developed ports located in major domestic and foreign trade centers, logistic centers, free zones, and container and liquid terminals, and offered logistic solutions to our customers with our efficient transport fleet management system. We are a success story of the development of the logistics industry in Turkey. Ceynak provides logistics services for 20 million tons of cargo annually with its four ports, two free zones, seven logistics centers, and two land terminals. We have always planned our investments around the strategy of offering integrated logistics solutions. Therefore, an increase in any logistics service directly affects the growth in other services. For example, a customer that brings bulk cargo to Samsunport has an integrated logistics solution to unload the product from the vessel, store it in our warehouse, pack it according to market demand, load it onto wagons or trucks, and deliver it to the final buyer by rail or road. Our customers can fully focus on the commercial part of their business after they have delivered their goods to us.</p><p><strong>Can you outline Ceynak's capabilities for large-scale infrastructure projects?<br></strong>Infrastructure and energy investments in Turkey require serious logistic organization and capability. We contribute to this process with our ports and shipping fleet. The TurkStream natural gas project signed between Turkey and Russia will be one of the largest energy projects in the region. Samsunport shouldered Turkey's part of the pipeline that will be built under the Black Sea. The pipeline building process is a challenging one and needs strong logistic support. The unloading, transportation, storage, and reloading of approximately 30,000 gas pipes, each weighing 12 tons, was completed successfully in thanks to the technical and professional competence of our port. The company conducting the TurkStream gas line project and the company that built the pipeline both thanked us for the successful logistical support we provided. They had previously been involved in similar projects around the world and did not receive such quality of service. These comments made us extremely proud and demonstrated the great progress made by Turkey's logistics sector.</p><p><strong>What are the primary uses of Ceynak's storage facilities?<br></strong>When we established our first logistics facility, a 10,000-sqm closed area in Mersin in the 1980s, Turkey had adopted a neo-liberal economy and opened its borders to the world. As the economy has developed further, we have invested in response to the needs of different sectors. Today, we have a total of 165,000sqm of horizontal warehouses and 560,000 tons of silos in Samsun, Kocaeli, Istanbul, Tekirdağ, Izmir, Mersin, Adana, and İskenderun. These are in service for all our customers, though we primarily serve the agricultural sector. We have the largest storage capacity after the Turkish Grain Board and can offer 1.5 million tons of storage all at once in bulk cargo, which mainly comprise grain and fertilizer.</p><p><strong>Why does Ceynak want to move into port operations and this sector in general?<br></strong>We acquired Samsunport for USD125 million in a privatization auction. Later, with an additional investment of some USD50 million, its business capacity tripled to reach 11 million tons. The annual freight handling figure, which was 1.5 million tons, tripled to 4.5 million tons. Our port, which did not receive container cargo before 2010, has become a favorite of the world's major container lines and handles 75,000-TEU containers today. It has also become one of the most important logistics grounds on the Turkey-Russia trade route. Agricultural exports to Russia are mainly carried out through Samsunport with regular Ro-Ro voyages, while grain products imported from Russia are unloaded and stored in our facility. We aim to increase the number of ports we operate in line with the strategic goals of our group. As a step in this direction, we undertook the operational services of Erdemir Port, where we unload approximately 11 million tons of goods annually. Our group now annually handles 17 million tons of cargo. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Two years ago, MNG Kargo's acquisition by outside investors was completed. What was the reason behind the acquisition?<br></strong>This is an industry mostly established by Turkish companies and entrepreneurs with classic methods and cargo logic. However, in the last decade a number of foreign investors have entered the market through acquisitions. This showcases the foreign interest in this strategic industry and appetite for investment into a high potential business. Seeing this potential, Turkven and Sancak Group acquired 100% of MNG Kargo and decided to invest and transform the industry. As someone involved in these processes, these investments have made a major contribution to the industry and contribute to establishing the corporate infrastructure of the industry.</p><p><strong>How has MNG Kargo benefited from the e-commerce boom within Turkey, and how has e-commerce affected your operations?<br></strong>The growth of e-commerce positively influences not only MNG Kargo, but also the entire industry in terms of volume. However, since industry business model was not designed to meet the requirements of B2C in a cost-efficient way from the beginning, the industry cannot fulfill this in terms of costs, performance, and customer satisfaction at the moment. Especially on the last-mile side, there is a culture of the consumer in Turkey of delivering everything to homes coming from cargo, namely the B2C end. Since this culture creates a similar expectation on e-commerce side, our costs and operation infrastructure cannot keep up. The costs of operations are rising, as the mail and B2B side shrinks and the small parcel side of the industry expands. Here, we seek to differentiate the pricing mechanism between customer pick-ups and home deliveries. We are also working with e-commerce companies to change this in order to reduce their costs and facilitate our costs and operations.</p><p><strong>Outside of pricing mechanisms, what solutions is MNG Kargo working on to meet the challenges presented by e-commerce?<br></strong>There are two dimensions to our solution. First, we strive to make the last-mile side more technological and accessible for customers; second, we seek to improve sorting systems suited for e-commerce. With last mile, we are investing in pick-up and drop-off points to better reach customer preferences. For sorting and separation systems, there will be full automation, and we will move toward a structure where the cargo will go to distribution points directly and where we can reduce the number of handling and dispatch the last mile directly from the hubs. We also have plans to invest in some locations in 2019 and 2020. We will not eliminate branches; they will serve as a customer contact point, a pick-up point, and so on.</p><p><strong>How have MNG Kargo's international operations changed with the growth of e-commerce?<br></strong>Our first priority is using the right technologies and ensuring customer satisfaction. The world is turning into an integrated market with the development of e-commerce. The key transformation made by our international business, INTER, has been to integrate our processes with large international e-commerce companies such as Amazon and AliExpress, which ship products to Turkey. Therefore, as much as we can manage this effectively within Turkey, we can become a right and established partner in international trade. A healthy formation of this integration will also lead to Turkish products and market transforming to e-export on the e-commerce side and will make us reverse logistics provider in that sense. We will collect the cargo from within Turkey and transfer it abroad, reaching out to the world with our network there.</p><p><strong>What are your primary objectives over the next year?<br></strong>We are doing an in-depth study of all our 25 existing hubs, calculating where they will experience bottlenecks when we grow at a projected rate every year. In relation to this, we have projected a 15% physical growth necessary in the next three to four years and have shaped our investments accordingly. Our second project is to review our vehicle fleet. We are renewing around 300 vehicles in 2019 and will renew our vehicles every year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>DFDS entered the Turkish market in 2018 through its acquisition of U.N. Ro-Ro, the second-largest Turkish acquisition of the year. Why did DFDS seek this acquisition?<br></strong>DFDS sees the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions as having huge potential. We are not doing any business within the Black Sea region for now, though our acquisition of U.N. Ro-Ro makes it possible to enter that area. We felt it was a great acquisition because it linked our network to the Mediterranean and broader MENA region. In addition, we added 12 vessels to our portfolio, all of which fit fairly well into our fleet because they were built in the same shipyard in Flensburg as DFDS' existing fleet. When one runs a pool of as many vessels as DFDS does, it is beneficial that they are extremely similar so we can easily swap them among routes.</p><p><strong>From a management and operational standpoint, what challenges did DFDS face with the integration of U.N. Ro-Ro into the larger DFDS system?</strong><br>There is certainly the issue of integration. U.N. Ro-Ro was a standalone company in Istanbul that has become a major business unit in our system, and it was a huge task to bring it into our system. We have our core corporate and headquarters functions in Copenhagen, with everything like insurance, procurement, and fleet management located there. Aligning all these things has been a huge task, though my predecessor and the team in Istanbul and Copenhagen have done well, and we are satisfied with the integration. As far as operations go, it is business as usual—we have to treat our customers well. U.N. Ro-Ro is now owned by DFDS, a Danish company. We want to incorporate DFDS' values onto our operations here while still respecting the difference in cultural and operational styles. The big difference between DFDS and U.N. Ro-Ro's previous owners is that we are an industrial buyer rather than an investor. We are not here to sell; we are here to develop. We will connect our intermodal system, which is one of the reasons why we acquired this company.</p><p><strong>In addition to the 12 vessels, DFDS also acquired two terminals from the transaction. How do those fit into DFDS' broader intermodal system?</strong><br>There are certain procurement synergies, and we can optimize the new terminals with our IT and gate systems and other operational efficiency-oriented systems. The terminals are extremely similar to the rest of our system, so they fit in well, and the locations are strategic for us. Trieste Port—one of the two that were acquired—is in Italy and is one of the major entrances to Europe. It is the only free port in Italy in that region, so it has a special status. With its extremely well-connected intermodal system, it is an important strategic point in terms of development.</p><p><strong>Can you break down the big categories of Turkish goods that fill your cargo volumes to Europe?<br></strong>We transport more or less everything produced in Turkey, such as textile goods, machinery, automotive parts, and finished vehicles. The only cargo we partially carry is reefer cargo—fruit and vegetables. There is a fair bit of fresh produce in Turkey that ends up in European supermarkets, so it is an interesting market for our business that we have not truly dived into yet.</p><p><strong>How has the current state of global trade and Turkey-Europe trade in particular impacted your Mediterranean operations?<br></strong>It is no secret that we acquired U.N. Ro-Ro when everything peaked. The slowdown came faster than we had hoped and expected, though it has not changed our mindset. Based on the numbers, Europe is an important partner for Turkey and vice versa. Trade volumes will recover, and we have not been shaken by this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How will the opening of the new Istanbul Airport impact your operations?<br></strong>The new airport is key for us, logistics-wise. From an investment point of view, for DHL the airport will start the largest project we have ever had in the country. It has the right location for our business as a hub and is a way for us to grow new trade links.  60 countries and 120 destinations can be reached within a three-hour flight from the airport. DHL has been present in Turkey since 1981, and we are a market leader—with more than 53% of the market—and first mover in many areas. For the DHL group, Turkey is an emerging market. It has a clear road map whereby it wants to increase its revenue share from 22 to 30% over the years. We are one of the 11 countries within the DHL group nominated as an investment area. As a result of this, and because of the new airport, we are going to invest in a 42,000-sqm building located at the new airport. It will be a EUR135-million investment with a green build set up using the latest technologies. While DHL's main hub in Europe is Leipzig, we see Turkey as being a major sub-hub in the future. </p><p><strong>How do you see the transition from Atatürk to the new Istanbul Airport?<br></strong>As a transition, going from Atatürk to the new airport is a big step; however, this is not new to us. DHL has transitioned many times before. For Turkey, it is new. But those working with us are a global team that know what to do from an experience point of view. </p><p><strong>Which regions are using DHL Express Turkey the most?<br></strong>Most of our shipments go to Europe. We follow the patterns of the Turkish economy as we are facilitators of trade. Whatever happens in Turkey is reflected in our capabilities. With DHL present in 220 countries and territories, our trade is spread out, but we are centralized in Europe. That is why our Turkish operations are key. Germany is one of our biggest destinations inside Europe. Outside of it, we see tremendous growth in the US and in new areas as a result of e-commerce. </p><p><strong>What impact has e-commerce had on your operations?<br></strong>E-commerce has significantly changed our operations. We are traditionally a B2B company, picking up and delivering shipments during work hours. For the last five years, when e-commerce began booming, we have seen our e-commerce volumes in Turkey grow by 63% YoY. The global e-commerce market will likely have gone from USD300 billion in 2015 to USD1 trillion by 2020. Our operations have to adapt to changing customer needs, which are much more immediate nowadays. To accommodate, we had to invest heavily in our capabilities. Hubs and gateways can ensure demand can be met, and new technology here is key to meeting customer demands for flexibility and choices. Choice is essential to this industry, and data is essential to knowing our customers, providing options, and having availability, all so that you can get to the right destination as soon as possible. We are also finding that e-commerce is making us focus more on speed than capacity. </p><p><strong>What challenges do you face in Turkey?<br></strong>From the simplest perspective, Istanbul is massive; therefore, logistically it is difficult. Our couriers are tough and knowledgeable. They have the technology to route deliveries effectively. That being said, Istanbul's size gives us plenty of opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the opening of the new Istanbul Airport impacted Turkish Cargo's operations, and what is the investment plan for the airport's new cargo hub?</strong><br>In addition to its own fleet of freighter planes, Turkish Cargo utilizes the belly cargo space on Turkish Airlines' passenger fleet for its operations. On April 5, 2019, Turkish Airlines moved its entire passenger operations to the new airport, which meant our belly-held cargo operations also moved there. Continuing its freighter fleet operations at Atatürk Airport, Turkish Cargo will join its new premises at Istanbul Airport, where the carrier will offer its services in the largest air cargo hub in the world. Turkish Cargo's investment, Smart Istanbul, is set to be one of the most technologically advanced infrastructures in terms of smart operations and AI in the sector. The cargo hub will be operational by late 2020 and will have a capacity of 2 million tons, which is expected to increase to 4 million in 2021. </p><p><strong>From a capacity and operational strategy standpoint, can you break down Turkish Cargo's split between belly-held and freighter-held cargo?</strong><br>We use a little more than 240 aircraft. With 23 freighters, we have one of the largest cargo fleets in the world. Belly cargo provides about half of the capacity. The passenger/freighter decision for each leg is determined according to customer time constraints as well as the size of the shipment. </p><p><strong>What impact has the growth of e-commerce and the increasing customer demands had on Turkish cargo?<br></strong>The e-commerce share in our portfolio is doubling almost every year and currently represents 15% of revenue. The e-commerce boom requires strong physical and technological integration. Air cargo, similar to passenger, is a fragmented industry. In cargo, there is an agent, forwarder, or logistics company for warehousing, as well as customs clearance if it is cross border. There is also the airport authority and final-mile delivery companies, which are both different at every destination. In total, a chain of about six to seven entities make it work. Data integration is critically important—you must provide updates for every movement the package makes, not just for the different entities involved in the transit but also for customers, who increasingly demand their package's movement data and delivery at a specific time. Turkish Cargo is one of the few global air cargo carriers that have taken so much exposure in the global commerce market. There are two reasons for this: we have the largest network, and Turkish Airlines and Turkish Cargo operates with port-to-port business focus. In order to enable our capabilities, in 2018 we initiated a strategic partnership with ZTO—one of the leading Chinese and global parcel companies. We built a strategic facility in Hong Kong with it in 2018 for an e-commerce focused, door-to-door integrated virtual company called We World Express. It can pick up packages anywhere in East Asia from any supplier or producer of components, electronics, or manufacturers from AliExpress, China Post, or other channels. It can deliver those parcels to the nearest airport where Turkish Airlines flies, and Turkish Airlines makes the fastest connection between the origin city and our 260-plus destinations around the world. For the last mile, we have started to form partnerships with delivery companies on the ground. All this shows how dedicated Turkish Airlines is in the e-commerce business. This industry will grow even more and will be the main drivers for cargo operators in the future. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the primary commercial benefits of the newly opened, 426km-long highway project between Istanbul and Izmir?<br></strong>This project affects the region since it is considered the backbone of the national economy and is where approximately one-third of the population lives. It also makes a significant contribution to commercial activities as well as solving problems such as road safety, emissions, and traffic. The route passes through Istanbul, Yalova, Bursa, Balıkesir, and Manisa, paving the way for new investments in the region.</p><p><strong>What is the significance of the new Istanbul Airport for Turkey and the broader region?<br></strong>Istanbul Airport will satisfy the needs of not just Istanbul and Turkey, but also the greater region. This project will also raise Istanbul to its deserved position in the international airline market and make the country a major center and a bridge among nations. Turkey's commercial aviation industry has grown considerably in recent years, and the growth potential will gain greater momentum when Istanbul Airport, one of the largest in the world, reaches full capacity. </p><p><strong>What are the ministry's development plans for nationwide port infrastructure?<br></strong>We are currently in the top 20 in terms of maritime transportation and shipbuilding, and Turkey's overall maritime trade fleet is 29 million DWT. Our national shipbuilding industry has also been successful in commercial shipbuilding and maintenance and nationally designed and 100% domestically built warships, and is one of the top three industries globally for yacht building. We currently have 175 port facilities open to international vessels, though we have considerable investments ongoing in order to increase our maritime trade volume. Çandarlı container port in the north Aegean Sea will be Turkey's biggest port and one of few container ports around the world. We planned this facility as a hub for the combined transport chain, which is the result of potential traffic between Europe and the Middle East. The port will have a capacity of 4 million TEUs per year in the first stages, while the final capacity will be 12 million. We also started the construction of Filyos Port, a major transportation route to the Black Sea. It will have a final capacity of 25 million tons per year once completed and will lighten the burden on Marmara ports and the Istanbul straits. </p><p><strong>What have been some of the major developments of the commercial rail network?<br></strong>Almost 98% of our railways were single-track until 17 years ago. We completed the renovation of all our conventional main rail lines, including the Izmir-Aydın one, which was renovated for the first time in 150 years. While improving our existing railways, we completed major railway projects such as Marmaray, high-speed train lines, and the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars Railway. We increased the length of the conventional railway from 10,959km to 11,527km and reached a grand total of 12,740km, with the addition of 1,213km of YHT lines. We also inaugurated and carried more than 50 million people on the Ankara-Istanbul, Ankara-Eskişehir, and Konya-Istanbul YHT lines. İZBAN and Başkentray raised the standards of urban railway transportation in Izmir and Ankara.  </p><p><strong>What are the ministry's investment plans and main objectives in the next 12 months?<br></strong>We plan to complete the 82-km Menemen-Aliağa-Çandarlı highway and will partially complete 119km of the Ankara-Niğde highway by the end of 2019 and the remaining 211km by 2020. Additionally, some of our important tunnel projects such as Malatya-Hekimhan, Ilışar, Honaz, Alacabel, Asik Festival, Karasu, Güzeldere, and Ilgar tunnels will also be opened to the public as soon as possible. The construction of a 3,953-km-long railway line will also continue, as will the Ankara-Sivas high-speed railway line, whose trial runs will start by the end of 2019. We also plan to finish the Ankara-Izmir high-speed railway by completing the Polatlı-Afyonkarahisar-Uşak section in 2020 and the Uşak-Manisa-Izmir section in 2021. And the Ankara-Bursa railroad will also be completed in 2020. The construction of Port of Filyos, which has great importance to Turkey, is 75% complete. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[atheeqe-ansari-ceo-electric-way]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you pioneered the sector and what progress has been made in that regard?</h4><p>We were lucky to start our business in 2003 when the economy took an upswing with the meteoric rise in the construction sector in UAE. It was a good time to be in business and growth came by managing customers, suppliers, and inventory. However, we soon realized that that we had to be different than the rest if we had to continue to grow irrespective of the economic vagaries. We embarked on the journey of process improvement and innovation to usher in a new paradigm in our history. We built a new state of the art distribution center and defined a system of processes and work flows encapsulating the steps of the supply chain ecosystem, commencing with the goods rolling out from the manufacturer to the final customer. We interviewed our customers to discover their pain points and identified the services that would bring service and cost efficiencies. Next, we hired the best consultants to put together a technology platform that would help us automate as well as expedite the processes with a single objective of enhancing customer satisfaction. We believe that we pioneered the use of technology and best management practices in a traditional sector turning the stockist into a value-added-distributor and thus gaining an equally important place in the supply-chain ecosystem.</p><h4>How do you assess the opportunities for growth in Dubai and beyond?</h4><p>Dubai is a non-stop juggernaut and continues to exceed expectations. In an economic climate like this growth is natural, and despite the impacts of regional imbalances and global slowdown, we see Electric Way maintain its pace of progress. We project to grow multi-fold in the near horizon within three to five years and have stretched begun our expansion plans to double the capacity of our distribution center. We are going up the ladder of value-added-services and will be offering advanced services to our customers that will enhance their procurement efficiency, cut inventory carrying costs and reduce administrative effort.  All of these are being enabled by a host of innovative technology and tested processes. We continue to grow in our focus sectors that include oil &amp; gas, energy, construction, MEP, and manufacturing and also exploring new sectors where our innovative services can add value to our customers. Our plan is to grow our business in Abu Dhabi and northern Emirates, while our regional plans are to expand our operations in Saudi Arabia and open offices in India. We hope to see top-line growth coming from regional expansion while our bottom-line growth will come from enhancing our value-added-services enabled by customer serving technology.</p><h4>How do you convey this message and promote yourselves as an innovative focal point in the sector?</h4><p>Our facility in NIP is a true reflection of the digital transformation that has taken place in Electric Way and our state-of-the-art warehouse and equipment will give visitors a glimpse of this. Customers are already experiencing the speed at which we do business and are impressed with the array of value-added-services we offer in comparison to our competitors. Our technology roadmap is in motion and we plan to launch a transparent and efficient customer portal that will become an industry standard for end-user interactions.</p><h4>How does the government support SMEs to grow in the way Electric Way has developed into a regional player?</h4><p>We are blessed with great leaders like His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. He is not just a visionary but also ensures that his vision translates into actions that benefit businesses. The Dubai SME is a great platform to support the SME sector and the other measures of the government have made it easier for genuine businesses to get finance and realize their growth potential. We are grateful to the banks in the country for the confidence they have in the SME sector and equally thankful for the business friendly processes of all government departments dealing with trade.  The ongoing efforts to bring accountability and establishing credibility of business partners is helping businesses to thrive. Moreover, the UAE has proved to be a great hub in the region for all types of businesses including manufacturing, trading and services owing to its fantastic infrastructure.</p><h4>How will Expo 2020 influence Dubai, and what role will Electric Way play in the expo?</h4><p>Expo 2020 will be great milestone in Dubai's history and we are hoping that it will catapult the overall economy of the country.  As a supplier to the various EXPO projects, we are thrilled to be a part of such a globally visible project and we feel immense prestige in being associated with it. Electric Way is working with large contractors and supplying a wide range of electrical and construction material for the pavilions and EXPO facilities. Our innovative services such as Just-in-Time are attracting new customers who are working under tight deadlines and budgets. We hope that the Expo 2020 will attract not just tourists but many other people including entrepreneurs and investors who will find Dubai a place to start new ventures and use it as a launch pad to bring their businesses to the region, thus benefiting us all.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for Electric Way?</h4><p>Our long-term vision is to be the largest value-added distributor in the markets we serve.  We aim to grow not just in terms of volume, but also in terms of the value we bring to the supply-chain ecosystem. We see ourselves as a conduit for change in the way the trading and distribution business is being done in the UAE and in the region. We want to have a global footprint with a seamless offering across all our branches enabled by technology.  Most importantly, we want to be a team of happy people achieving positive growth by working for the happiness of our customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of Valeura's operations in the Thrace Basin, and how the basin's distinct geology impacts exploration?</strong><br>There has been oil and gas production from the Thrace Basin for a number of decades now. It has been heavily explored and developed, so there is a long history there. Valeura came in with a partnership with Transatlantic when we purchased Thrace Basin Natural Gas in 2011. At the time, we recognized that the reservoirs there were quite tight with low permeability, and we thought that by drilling horizontal wells and stimulating them we could increase production in the existing fields. For the first three or four years, there was a lot of activity to work our way toward gas production in the area. While we were doing drilling and research on these reservoirs, we found the potential for a deep unconventional gas play. In 2017, we brought in Statoil, which is now known as Equinor, as a partner to help the company fund and explore for that deeper unconventional gas play. Once we drilled the discovery well, Yamalik-1, in 2017 we then brought in our reserves auditor DeGolyer &amp; MacNaughton, which conducted an evaluation and came up with a prospective resource estimate ranging between 3 and 20 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas. It really speaks to a potential world-class gas opportunity, though we still have work to prove this and demonstrate that we can flow this gas commercially.</p><p><strong>Beyond funding, what role does Equinor play in the operations at Trace Basin?<br></strong>It is a funding partnership, though Equinor also puts in a great deal of technical work. We recognized the potential for this play but also understood that we needed large amounts of capital to drill these deep wells and stimulate and test them, which is when we looked to bring in a partner. There were several companies who put offers on the table, but Equinor was the best at the time. Once it has fully earned its interest, Equinor has the right to request Valeura to transfer the operatorship of the deep unconventional play to it. If it does so, Valeura will retain a working relationship with approximately a 50-50 split with Equinor and maintain operatorship of all the shallower sections and production facilities, while Equinor would have operatorship of the wells that are drilling deep into the unconventional play.</p><p><strong>What pricing risks do you face here due to the volatility of the Turkish lira?<br></strong>Pricing is extremely important. Currently, the prices are set by BOTAÅž and are in lira. For foreign investors in different sectors this might create uncertainty given the volatility around the lira, but when converted to dollars, the BOTAÅž price has historically closely tracked the euro gas price in the region. One positive step in 2018 was a new monthly review and update of the price by the government. We have been pleased with the new Minister of Energy and Mining and how he has communicated with the entire oil and gas industry. He sat down and listened to the issues the industry is facing and the list of things we need to support it. </p><p><strong>Does Valeura have plans to export?<br></strong>If we look at upscaling this project and its potential to be extremely large, exporting is an option. Having a pipeline like TANAP that will run into Europe creates that opportunity. However, we tend to run all our economic and development scenarios assuming the gas is going into the Turkish market, which is a captive market with great fiscal terms where 98% of gas is currently imported. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Upon completion in late 2018, SOCAR's STAR Refinery—Turkey's single largest FDI—underwent a testing phase and has now reached full development. What did the testing phase involve, and what are the refinery's production targets for 2019?</strong><br>The STAR Refinery is one of the newest names in the refining industry. We held the opening ceremony in October 2018, which was followed by a period of pre-commissioning and commissioning activities. These take six to eight months and involve clarifying conditions and looking into the typical challenges faced by large facilities during the start-up stage. During this and the performance testing period, the EPC contractor is responsible for ensuring all units are working as per the design. We are currently close to the end of testing, and the refinery will soon be fully handed over to us. The refinery is currently operating at 100% capacity and is producing all its intended products. It is designed to process 10 million tons of crude oil per annum. Until the end of 2019, we will operate at the maximum capacity and process 7.5 million tons of crude oil.</p><p><strong>How is the STAR Refinery reducing Turkey's energy import requirements?<br></strong>STAR Refinery will reduce Turkey's annual current account deficit by around USD1.5 billion. Petkim, SOCAR's petrochemical facility adjacent to the STAR Refinery, will receive a large share of the refinery's production, much of which was formerly supplied by imports. Besides raw materials produced for the petrochemical industry, the refinery produces a number of products that Turkey currently imports, such as diesel fuel, jet fuel, LPG, sulfur, and petroleum coke. Some 60% of the annual 24 million tons of diesel fuel consumption is currently supplied by imports, so STAR Refinery's 5 million-ton annual diesel fuel production will reduce that figure to below 40%. The refinery will also produce 300,000 tons of LPG on an annual basis, reducing the import rate of LPG in Turkey from 80% to 70%. Turkey also imports 3-3.5 million tons of petro-coke on an annual basis, and the refinery's annual production of 700,000 tons will substantially reduce those import figures as well. STAR Refinery will also annually produce 200,000 tons of sulfur—another imported product in Turkey. Finally, and notably, STAR Refinery will produce approximately 1.5 million tons of jet fuel on an annual basis, providing a substantial contribution to the ever-increasing need for jet fuel in parallel with development of the aviation industry. In recent months, SOCAR Aviation won the tender to provide 700,000 tons of jet fuel for the aircraft at Istanbul Airport on an annual basis for a period of five years. A substantial portion of the jet fuel produced at STAR Refinery will be supplied to Istanbul Airport, as well as many other airports around the country.</p><p><strong>What percentage of the refinery's petrochemical production will be off-taken by Petkim, and what percentage will be sold in the domestic market or exported?<br></strong>Our refinery will annually produce 1.6 million tons of naphtha, which will go toward meeting Petkim's entire naphtha demand. In addition to naphtha, Petkim will offtake approximately 200,000 tons of the refinery's 1 million-ton production capacity of reformate and xylene. The remaining 800 million tons will be exported in the short term. This will change once SOCAR's planned investment in a pure terephthalic acid facility in Aliağa is completed in 2023. Upon completion of this, the entire combination of reformate-xylene produced at STAR will be used as raw material domestically. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>As a Turkish entrepreneur based in London, how would you compare the creative industries of Turkey and the UK?<br></strong>There are definitely a few distinctions, the main one being the size of the creative industries and their contribution to the respective economies. There are a few elements that contribute to each country's strengths when it comes to the creative industries. In the UK, the ease of operation, for example being able to register a company online easily; ease of accessibility, given the UK is the ultimate networking hub, via its events, industry talks, and conferences, allowing one to easily reach out to high-level executives. There are also the various levels of support for innovation, such as incentives or funding available for new innovation hubs to back creative industry start-ups purely focusing on R&amp;D all contribute to its strength in the creative industries. Meanwhile, Turkey has one of the most tech-savvy and young demographics at hand, provides innovation hubs and incentives to support R&amp;D as well, and is an extremely quick when it comes to adopting new technologies. Therefore, even though it might seem like it is playing catch-up in the creative industries, Turkey is stepping up at a quicker pace.</p><p><strong>You provide optimization services for YouTube creators around the world. What is your evaluation of the challenges the platform faces in different geographies?</strong><br>There are some general challenges that the platform faces globally, as it grows in reach and popularity. In the early days, the main challenges of the platform revolved around managing its scale and rapid growth while setting the ground rules for its users and content in terms of its policies. As the platform started localizing into different territories, I assume the challenge then would become more of adapting to the local rules and regulations in order to be able to operate in a specific geography and amplify its growth in that region. Apart from that, in terms of YouTube creators' evolution and adoption of the platform, there are a few similarities. For example, individual content creators are quick to learn and adopt usage of the platform compared to institutional or traditional media owners or players, which results in the rapid growth of user-generated content.</p><p><strong>Brain drain is a common challenge for emerging markets like Turkey. How can incentive programs encourage graduates to stay in the country and set up businesses?</strong><br>I have been witnessing a great uptake of entrepreneurial initiatives emerging from Turkey, with start-up culture and entrepreneurship being supported by various different groups such as angel investors like Galata Business Angels, institutional VCs such as Revo Capital, and accelerators. US- and UK-based funds like 500 Istanbul are also investing in Turkey and launching a base in Istanbul. These initiatives might be encouraging for graduates to stay in the country and set up a business. I also hope other initiatives are launched to attract back talent that have left the country to set up a new business here or expand their existing businesses to Turkey.</p><p><strong>How significant is YouTube as a platform for brand promotion?<br></strong>YouTube is the second-largest search engine after Google and the second-most popular social media platform with 1.9 billion users. There is definitely a massive reach available on YouTube and an audience for any type of content, which, if utilized in the right way with the right strategy, can be highly effective for brand reach. However, many brands have not yet fully taken advantage of the platform or do not fully understand the platform. It is also important to note that once you optimize your content for YouTube, you are indirectly optimizing your content for Google search as well. One of our missions as a business is to make sure brands and content owners are fully aware of the size of the opportunity available on YouTube. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the chief goals that drove the establishment of ULAK Communications?<br></strong>ULAK is the result of a vision that began in 2013 that communication infrastructure has a strategic significance in a country's life. It has an economic, technological, and cybersecurity aspect. Since then, the Defense Industry Directorate (SSB) has initiated two major communications infrastructure R&amp;D projects. One is ULAK 4.5G, a base station project, and the other is MILAT, a network infrastructure project with 5G technologies such as software-defined networking and network functions virtualization. We are starting to see solid results from these projects after four years and considering the necessity of additional steps between R&amp;D projects and product realization, which is why SSB decided to establish ULAK Communications Corporation. Our first task was to turn the results of exciting R&amp;D projects into products and then commercialize them. The second is to continue research by enhancing the telecommunication network's capabilities through 4.5G, 5G, and 6G with solid roadmaps and apply the results to existing product lines. Finally, we set out to increase our intellectual property rights and patent portfolio. Finally, concentrating in the telecommunication sector, we want to utilize the overall ecosystem in Turkey to enhance the capabilities of the ecosystem.</p><p><strong>What role does ULAK play in providing telecommunication services to areas that are economically unviable for telecommunications operators?</strong><br>Our first challenge was the Universal Service Project, which provides communication services with government funding to areas that telecom operators deem unfeasible, like villages and rural areas. It has been a challenge for us in terms of productization lifecycle and getting the products in an operational state. We have delivered around 500 base stations that we call Universal Phase I and around 400 for Universal Phase II, both on time as planned. Phase I enhanced the existing 2G technologies on base stations with 4.5G technologies, which we completed along with Turkcell. Phase II is establishing new base stations, a task which has also been given to Türk Telekom and Vodafone.</p><p><strong>How well integrated is ULAK's network with telecom operators?<br></strong>Thanks to the Universal Service Project, we have proven our capability by partnering with telecom operators. Having a strong installed base and real footprint in the Turkish telecom infrastructure with this project, we successfully made Ulak base stations available to telecom operators. We have become a reasonable alternative to the existing global telecom vendors in the market and a strong supporter of Turkish mobile operators, considering the licensing agreement conditions. We want to emphasize that Turkcell has been truly supportive of this project from the beginning. Universal Service Phase-I would not have been possible if we had not had the support of Turkcell, which played an important role by managing the project, risks, supporting us, and relying on us. Working within a commercial telecom infrastructure was another challenge, but Turkcell again got the lead when we signed an agreement covering the utilization of around 2,650 base stations for the next four years. Besides providing the radio equipment, we also provide babysitting and operation services for the telecom operators, which greatly helps our cooperation with the operators. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How will 5G factor into your mobile growth strategy in the coming years?<br></strong>Once 5G is up and running, it will create a global platform encompassing the next generation and digital society. As the operator with the most extensive fiber infrastructure—i.e. 80% of the entire fiber network in Turkey—we will continue to be by the side of our customers and country every step of the 5G transition. One key area of focus for us will be providing a better customer experience and creating a sustainable subscriber gain across all our service channels, especially mobile. We already offer innovative, attractive packages and tariffs, especially on the mobile side in order to meet our customers' rapidly changing communication and technology needs. We are on the right path and became the fastest operator to increase its mobile subscriber market share in the past 12 years, from 15% to 28%. We are Turkey's number-one porting champion, with a net subscriber port of 7.4 million since 2008. This proves consumers appreciate the quality of service we provide. Going forward, we will continue to grow our digital products and services with our three main subsidiaries Innova, Argela, and Sebit and provide the highest quality of network and infrastructure.</p><p><strong>How does Türk Telekom work with its subsidiary Argela to develop 5G capabilities?<br></strong>At our Türk Telekom Innovation Centre and Argela 5G Centre of Excellence, we develop local products and technologies that create added value for the national economy and accelerate national development. This helps Turkey reach a position where it not only produces but also exports new technologies. With our network slicing smart software ProgRAN, developed by Argela and its Silicon Valley affiliate Netsia, we have raised our productivity to the highest level through our use of AI in the optimization of fixed and mobile networks. Most importantly, we have reached a position where we now deploy patented 5G products for leading global operators such as Telefonica, Verizon, and Orange, furthering our contribution toward the national economy. Adding onto the success of ProgRAN, Argela continues its work on 5G with products such as Virtualized Radio Access Network (VRAN) and Software Enabled Broadband Access (SEBA). VRAN provides a network-virtualizing feature, a highly important step on the journey to 5G, while SEBA provides the opportunity for configuration between different networks as well as compatibility between various devices. Moving forward, we will continue to develop flexible systems and next generation mobile communication technologies.</p><p><strong>What investments has Türk Telekom made in cybersecurity?<br></strong>We have built Turkey's largest cybersecurity center, successfully increasing the diversity of traditional and innovative cybersecurity services we provide. As a result, we have become Turkey's largest cybersecurity operator. Ensuring that Turkey's data remains in Turkey and is secure in the best possible way is one of the most valued responsibilities we have taken upon ourselves. In addition to providing cybersecurity to 500 of Turkey's largest companies as well as many private and public institutions, we are systematically preparing them for the switch to Industry 4.0.</p><p><strong>What are Türk Telekom's most exciting plans and primary objectives over the next 12 months?<br></strong>Digitalization and the proliferation of internet usage are key for Turkey to actualize the development leap it is aiming for. In order to realize this, we will continue to focus on extending the fiber infrastructure. We will strive to be the operator that carries out the most investments, provides the most advanced customer service, leads the digital transformation process, provides the highest-quality network and infrastructure, and develops the most innovative digital products and services. Türk Telekom will continue to work in line with Turkey's 2023 vision and be the driving force for its economy, so that Turkey can become self-sufficient in the ICT area. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How will Turkcell's ongoing focus on digital services change its domestic priorities, and how has it impacted Turkcell's revenue growth?<br></strong>Backed by Turkcell's strong mobile and fiber infrastructure, our strategic focus areas comprise digital business solutions, services, and fintech solutions. Turkcell has spearheaded the digital transformation of the telecommunications industry and continues to lead the digital transformation of Turkey. Its 1,000-plus R&amp;D engineers and developers place its customers first, and its unique ability to combine telco and OTT abilities have helped it achieve its objectives. We have constantly expanded what users can do with our digital services, recently removing language barriers on BiP. It now knows more than 100 languages and provides users with real-time translation. Leveraging the power of AI backed by our engineers, Turkcell's digital services like fizy, Dergilik, and TV+ now offer personalized content recommendation. Our AI-powered personal assistant Yaani will be launched by the end of 2019, and we will continue to develop technologies that augment the capabilities of our customers. Our fintech solutions serve as a backbone for our digital services, and our digital business solutions continue to improve as we add new products and features. In the domestic market, we have successfully captured a strong revenue growth of 21.3% in 2Q2019, as we generated TRY6.2 billion in revenues. Through our customized solutions in providing connection, cloud, cybersecurity, and surrounding IT and integration services, we facilitate the digital transformation of companies in both the public and private sectors. Our subsidiary digital business services combine ICT and telco abilities and offer end-to-end solutions to enterprises in Turkey. We aim to become the top-of-the-line ICT service provider through our digital business solutions in three years.</p><p><strong>How will the digital transition change Turkcell's international operating strategy from one of acquisition to digital penetration?<br></strong>The immense impact of next-generation technologies and 5G pushes telecom operators to the center of digital transformation. At this point, the fundamental global strategy shifts to providing digital services and solutions to customers. Our strategy to capture global expansion and growth focuses on our digital services instead of providing traditional telecom services. Turkcell's “Turkey's data should be hosted in Turkey" strategy applies to this field, as we have gathered our global operator collaborations under one roof. Our digital services and solutions help other telecom operators in the world host their data in their country, too.</p><p><strong>How is Turkcell's strong subscriber base helping the company's growth in the fintech area?<br></strong>Our investments in the fintech area are part of our vision to expedite the growth of Turkey's digital economy, i.e. we see fintech as an opportunity not only for Turkcell but Turkey at large. Turkcell's subsidiary Paycell, in this sense, serves as a backbone in its strategic focus areas—it offers payment solutions for Turkcell's digital services, ranging from the instant messaging app BiP to the music streaming app fizy. The transition to a digital operator required a mobile payment solution for our customers combining OTT and telecom abilities, our know-how in technology, our stores all over the country, and the largest customer base in the market, which have helped us become an important player in the fintech industry. Our established experience with mobile users in Turkey and thorough knowledge of the financial behavior of our customer base also uniquely positions Paycell as a financial service provider in the Turkish market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you explain some of the unique features of your operating mandate, and what resources and expertise you bring to the local EPC market?</h4><p>Técnicas Reunidas started operations in the UAE in 2007. Our first project was for Borouge (Utilities &amp; Offsites). We have completed milestone projects in Shah Oil Field, Al Hosn Gas, GASCO &amp; ADOC and have recently started the oilfield expansion works for Bu Hasa, one of the most critical projects for ADNOC in the UAE at present. The increase in capacity relates to the UAE's self-sufficiency goals and its energy priorities. The targets set for Bu Hasa are ambitious, and involve fast track development. Overall, we foresee this project being a huge success. Moreover, we have been awarded projects with ADNOC LNG and are currently doing a front-end engineering design (FEED) for ADNOC offshore. In addition to this, we have also been entrusted to carry out the FEED for the Linear Alkyl Benzene (LAB) plant in the Ruwais Derivatives Park by the JV formed between ADNOC &amp; Mubadala (Cepsa). A large percentage of our total backlog is in the Middle East, and the UAE is our second-biggest market after Saudi Arabia at this moment. In the UAE, we collaboratively approach things with our clients to find solutions. It is important for a company to create a legacy. Hence our role is to build on our existing partnerships to create further value.</p><h4>The introduction of ADNOC's ICV (in-country value) program has driven change in the local market, particularly in regards to tender evaluation and contractor selection. What has been Técnicas Reunidas' experience working with the ICV program?</h4><p>We became involved in the ICV two years before it was launched. ADNOC invited some of its key partners working with other regional nationalization programs to get together and share their experiences. Interestingly, the origin of Técnicas Reunidas is rooted in ICV. The company was created in the 1960s to enhance and promote the industrial sector in Spain. ICV has numerous benefits, but it can be a challenge too. The leadership behind the ICV program is proactive in terms of appraising it and making necessary adjustments. Consequently, it's not reasonable for companies to come here, execute one project, and then leave. We are now planning a six-month-long training program for 100 Emiratis. We aim to do this not just for the good of ADNOC or for Técnicas Reunidas but the country and its people.</p><h4>What are some of the ways that you are working to develop local human capital and the next generation of oil &amp; gas professionals? </h4><p>The program we have developed has three categories: for high school graduates, undergraduates, and university graduates. It starts as a general program and becomes more technical, depending on the level of education and potential. We start with a general introduction to the oil and gas sector. What's more, we take the students to our operational sites such as the oil &amp; gas fields. The qualification authority in Abu Dhabi is interested in the program, and we are discussing ways to have appropriate certifications recognized by the National Qualifications Authority. We have been approached to enter into a JV with government learning centers, besides which some technical skills colleges have also shown interest in the program. We recognize that to engage young people we must apply a flexible approach. If these students develop a passion for a certain segment, we will be quick to recognize this and develop it further. We aim to provide a realistic experience with the potential to build a future career that not only benefits the individual but the UAE as a whole.</p><h4>Where do you see the long-term impact of the energy transition, and how will your business model evolve?</h4><p>Traditional oil and gas will be a mainstay for some years to come; however, we must go greener, and there are many different ways to achieve this. Going green can relate to optimization for synergy creation, efficiency, or sustainability. This is an opportunity for the entire sector to reevaluate its relationship with oil, gas, and petrochemicals. There is no doubt that the demand for petrochemicals will increase in the next few years. In order to transition and go greener, we need to capture CO2 and improve reinjection. Standards will have to evolve, especially with digitalization entering the mix. The sector will stand to benefit as a result. In this particular environment, those who adapt to change the fastest will come out on top. Thus, we have to be able to adapt as quickly as possible.</p><h4>What synergies and benefits are created by having a strong regional presence? </h4><p>To truly understand a country, you must have a strong presence in it. I cannot expect to understand the particularities of the GCC market without ever having made a foothold in it. Abu Dhabi is very important to our understanding of the market and plays a crucial role in our GCC network. Creating effective bases is essential for a company to be successful in the region. Looking ahead, the UAE will invest around USD132 billion between 2019 and 2023. Now is the right time to be here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Dominant Marine Logistic Services Provider]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ambrose-ovbiebo-managing-director-ceo-tamrose-ventures-limited]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on the background of the company and its position in the Nigerian market today?</h4><p>In 2003, Nigeria's Cabotage Act was passed to summarily make coastal trade the exclusive preserve of indigenous companies. Eventually, the National Content Development Act was also enacted. These were part of deliberate attempts by government to facilitate the deepening of indigenous participation in the marine logistics in particular and the Nigeria's oil and gas industry in general. Tamrose Ventures Limited entered the market with a strategy based on three pillars (tonnage age, service delivery culture and organizational structure). We looked at the age of the indigenous tonnage, which was averaging above 20 years, and decided to buy a brand-new vessel. We looked at the caliber of people in the marine space and how they approached service delivery, and decided to do things differently. From day one, we decided to be a customer-centric company that puts customers' interest and expectations above all else; and we walked our talk. This made Tamrose Ventures Limited a service-driven company. Thirdly, we looked at the management structure of some of the existing companies and realized that most business owners were actually running a lifestyle oriented businesses with attendant consequences. We decided to set up a business with proper structures built to last. The strategic integration of these three pillars defines TAMROSE, and the response we have received from the market thus far shows we are doing something right. From just one relatively small vessel in 2010, we have grown organically to a fleet of 12 vessels (including 2 PSVs) in 2019. We have also grown in terms of our vessel tonnage and category and are looking into the future with confident optimism.</p><h4>What does the acquisition of new vessels signify for the company, and do you have any other expansion plans?</h4><p>Our vision is clear; we aspire to be the dominant marine logistic services provider in the Nigerian oil and gas industry. With a vision like that, expansion is second nature to the company. Over the last four to five years, we have been extremely cautious about how we grew, primarily because of the slump in oil prices. In the absence of any political crisis as a result of the 2019 elections, we projected there would be an upswing in industry activities, which is why we undertook an aggressive fleet expansion drive. Of our 12 vessels, eight were added in 2019 alone and all are gainfully employed adding value to our customers' operations. With these new additions, we also had to strengthen our human resources to sustain and even improve on the quality of our services. In 2020, we intend to consolidate our operations to ensure all these assets run the way we want them to and that our operations allow us to consistently deliver the service quality that Tamrose is associated with. In 2020, we also want to take a step back, look at the environment, and decide what to do next. This industry has great potentials and consequences; a single move can impact a company tremendously one way or the other.</p><h4>One key challenge for indigenous companies in Nigeria is that of sourcing capital. How have you overcome this challenge?</h4><p>There is a funding challenge in Nigeria no doubt. However, lending institutions in Nigeria are doing their best to support serious indigenous players. The recent CBN policy on deposit lending ratio is another step in the right direction. So, one can say we are making progress, and the prospects are looking brighter going forward. In 2019, with the purchase of eight vessels, TAMROSE spent a significant amount of money on assets acquisition. This was made possible by the robust financial support received from our financial partners Union Bank of Nigeria Plc and the Bank of Industry via the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) intervention fund focused on enhancing indigenous capacity by granting them, single-digit USD-denominated loans. Tamrose has been able to secure good-sized funding from her primary financial partners at very competitive and supportive rates. Recently, we have been receiving overtures from foreign-based entities, such as private equity firms and fund managers looking to partner with us. the world believes the opportunities and prospects in Nigeria and Africa are fantastic, we are the new frontiers. The funding challenge can be tackled if indigenous players can get their act together; it is only a matter of time.</p><h4>What is the perception of local players in the sector, and what future opportunities do you envision in the industry?</h4><p>The main reason for setting up TAMROSE was to change the indigenous service narrative in the oil and gas industry. In addition, we have seen other indigenous companies push the envelope, break the glass ceiling, and make an incursion into areas that were hitherto dominated by multinationals. It is only a question of time before this narrative is completely rewritten. Therefore, the future opportunities are endless. The price of crude oil is better than it was in the very recent past. With that, we expect to see a great deal of activity within the oil and gas industry. The security challenge is there, but the accessibility of the Nigerian terrain, ease of extracting crude and the low Sulphur content of our crude, will continue to be drivers that will encourage IOCs to invest in the country. If we look at our industry segment and the combined marine services spread of the four major players in the E&amp;P sector in terms of what is owned by indigenous players, you will realize that we are just scratching the surface.</p><h4>What are your key priorities and expectations for 2020?</h4><p>My priority for 2020 is to set the framework for making TAMROSE an institution. I have taken a look at our industry historically and cannot find any indigenous company that existed 20 years ago in this space. Therefore, 2020 is about laying the foundation to ensure that in 20, 50, or 100 years from now, Tamrose will not only be here, but will dominate this space.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Can you outline DMT Group's involvement in the coal mining sector in Turkey?<br></strong>Vehİp Kaçı DMT's work in the coal—and more broadly, mining—sector mostly involves greenfield projects. Before investing in an un-mined area, our clients want to be sure what is underground and whether it is feasible to mine there. Our expertise lies in scoping, pre-feasibility, and feasibility as well as bankable feasibility studies that determine what is happening underground and whether a project makes financial sense. In the last 10 years, we have had more than 20 customers in the coal and metalliferous mining industry. These range from new entrants to the mining industry that are interested in small deposits all the way up to the top five multi-industrial Turkish companies that are big players in a number of sectors and want to invest in the coal mining industry to produce energy. Our work in the coal mining sector in Turkey is part of a larger country-wide push for energy independence; however, we believe it is good for the country to reduce its dependency on imports for energy sources.</p><p><strong>How useful are Turkey's coal resources for power generation?<br></strong>Ulrich Ruppel The calorific value of coal deposits in Turkey range from 1,000 up to roughly 5,000 kilocalories per kg. Everything above 1,200 or 1,500 is usable with new thermal coal power plant technology to produce energy, while anything below 1,000 is very poor. However, if one does not have anything of better quality, they have to make do with what they have. At the end of the day, energy is energy, and new technologies have been created to allow power plants to better utilize low-calorific coal. In Turkey, there are several power plants that can utilize this coal. It also makes sense to use domestic coal from a strategic standpoint, as it reduces Turkey's dependence on imported energy sources.</p><p><strong>Can you give an overview of the different needs of your clients?<br></strong>VK First, we provide services to so-called junior companies in coal and metalliferous mining that generally do not have much know-how in-house and need guidance from the beginning to the end. We also work for bigger companies that usually have excellent knowledge of mining and are able to solve problems on their own, but who come to us when they have specific problems our experts can solve. Our third group of clients are state-owned companies whom we help present reports according to international standards to possible Turkish investors at the international level, in addition to assisting with valuations.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for diversifying DMT Turkey's revenue stream?<br></strong>UR For DMT's global operations, of 2018's EUR120-million turnover, roughly 20% was related to mining. This diversification is due to the decline of the mining sector in Germany, where the underground coal sector no longer exists. We were forced to change our operating structure. In Turkey, where we are currently much smaller, 100% of our revenue is from the mining sector. In the mining industry, some of our clients are private investors that are curious about financing a mining project by bank loans. At the end of the day, our strategy is to develop our mining know-how in Turkey. Turkey is a great place for us to do so because there is also the possibility of making connections with Central Asian as well as African companies with whom the Turkish government has good relations. Additionally, Turkey has a large youth and many highly skilled mining experts and geologists. The mining core of DMT Group could be in Turkey in the next 10 or 20 years. Our vision is to have Turkish experts being trained by our British and German experts to complete knowledge transfers in five years' time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cengiz Holding has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to renovate Eti Bakır's operations after acquiring it. Can you give me an overview of these investments and what operational benefits were achieved?</strong><br>Eti Bakır is Turkey's largest mining metallurgical and chemical company, operating mines in Küre, Murgul, Cerattepe, Adıyaman, and Siirt, as well as a smelting plan in Samsun, and a metal recycling and integrated fertilizing plant in Mazıdağı. In the past 15 years, we have made investments into Eti Bakır plants totaling USD635 million to increase production capacity, modernize the equipment, and help other valuable fields such as the environment and occupational health and safety. We have become one of the most modern underground and open-pit mining and metallurgical plants in Europe thanks to these investments. As an example, the Samsun smelting plant was producing intermediate quality blister copper, which had 98-99% purity before the investments, but can now produce 99.999% cathode copper with LME A-grade quality. Before the privatization of Eti Bakır's Samsun smelter plant, it was damaging the tobacco fields in the surrounding villages due to its outdated technology, as it could not hold all the SO2 gas coming out of the chimneys. This is why we initiated a major investment and improvement initiative in the facilities following the privatization process. Today, its emission rate is one-third of that allowed by EU standards, and the waste gases that previously damaged farmers' crops are now recycled back into production thanks to the investments. The ammonium sulfate fertilizer plant that we built in Samsun captures the SO2 gas, converts it to fertilizer, and sells it back to the local economy, producing 580,000 tons of fertilizer annually.</p><p><strong>What investments were made to increase mineral production to meet the increased capacity of the renovated plants?<br></strong>The renovation of the factory was not enough to increase production, as the amount of raw materials supplied needed to increase as well. For this reason, we drilled and found new reserves in the copper mines of Küre and Murgul. We also acquired new mining companies in Adıyaman and Siirt. Thus, with these new investments, we increased our annual production from 32,000 to 75,000 tons.</p><p><strong>In the future, what specific renovations and modernization efforts will Eti Bakır focus on?<br></strong>We are finalizing a new investment plan that will see another USD450 million invested by 2023. These investments will be in zero-waste technology, high value-added end products, and finding additional mine reserves. We are also establishing an R&amp;D base with an investment of USD5 million and conducting more than 200,000m of drilling per year to expand our mine reserves. In addition to these investments, the Mardin Mazıdağı Metal Recycling and Integrated Fertilizer Plant, which we designed and built from scratch, was completed and began operations in 2018. The USD1.2-billion investment in this facility is the largest private-sector investment in southeastern Turkey to date.</p><p><strong>From a turnover perspective, can you break down Eti Bakır's revenue by product? Who are the primary end consumers of your products?</strong><br>Broadly speaking, cathode copper sales account for 60% of our revenue, sulfuric acid and antimony sales account around 10%, recycled metals around 15%, and DAP or phosphate-containing fertilizer 15%. Digging into the uses of these products, cathode copper is a key high-purity industrial product used in copper wire and plates production, especially in the production of various alloys such as brass-bronze alloys. The demand for copper is high in Turkey because only around 20% of the demand can be sourced domestically. Sulfuric acid is used in many industrial fields, including the ore-leaching process and widely in the chemical industry, thermal power plants, sugar factories, and production stages of the iron and steel industries. Our metal recycling and integrated fertilizer facilities output precious metals, including zinc, iron, and cobalt, which are largely sold locally. Cobalt, which is used in battery production, has become a product of strategic value for our country, especially with the increasing interest in electric vehicles. Almost all of Turkey's phosphate resources are located where we operate in Mazıdağı, Mardin region, and are key inputs to fertilizer products. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the tourism sector and of the hotel market in Morocco?</h4><p>The tourism sector in Morocco is under development. We have Marrakesh, a destination that has been chosen among the best 10 worldwide. There are also new areas such as Taghzout and Dakhla, which are gaining momentum quickly. There is plenty of new hotel construction in Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakesh, and Tangiers.</p><h4>How does the beginning of 2018 compare to last year's results, and what has changed in North Africa's tourist trends?</h4><p>The first five months of 2019 were good for Marrakesh, Agadir, and Rabat, but it slowed down toward the third quarter. Casablanca has started below last year. Growth has slowed mainly due to the new openings and the slow economy performance in all sectors such as real estate, agriculture, and others.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges in the sector that Mövenpick Hotel Casablanca has successfully overcome to maintain its position within the hotel industry?</h4><p>The biggest challenge is to continue to update the property to meet the demanding requirements of customers and keep in close contact with guests to understand their needs.</p><h4>Serving both business and leisure travelers, how do you position Mövenpick Hotel within the hospitality market? </h4><p>Mövenpick Casablanca is oriented toward business travelers during weekdays, with a daily presence of local seminars. Over weekends and during the summer, we host the leisure segment in addition to several airline crews as well.</p><h4>What are your unique offerings? How can people utilize your premises for business or special events?</h4><p>Mövenpick Casablanca has a unique location, centrally located between the headquarters of the major banks and next to the head office of major multinationals. We are close to shops and cafes with an amazing sky bar rooftop with a pool.</p><h4>How are increasing innovations in technology, specifically AI, affecting the hospitality industry and your operations?</h4><p>We have succeeded in acquiring the latest technology in Wi-Fi and internet-enabled television. We are working on putting an iPad in each room. You can use your iPad to order room service, manage the lighting in your room, and operate your TV.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2020?</h4><p>With new openings in Morocco, and especially in Casablanca, we expect that the competition will be furious. 2020 will definitely give plenty of choices for the guest at very competitive rates. Each hotel will need to concentrate on updating their infrastructure to concentrate on guest satisfaction to retain their loyalty.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why did you choose to invest in the Turkish mining sector, and how is the company well suited to develop mining operations?<br></strong>Mining resources in Turkey are fairly unexplored considering how widespread they are. Turkey sits on the Tethyan Belt—one of the most prospective mining belts in the world—yet the mining sector is still in an early growth stage due to the high capital investment and technical barriers to entry. The combination of high geological potential, whereby Turkey hosts about 0.5% of world metallic mineral reserves, attractive value-capturing opportunities, and the sector's ability to reduce Turkey's current account deficit through exports all made the sector interesting for us. The company is also well suited for the sector as a renowned local investor profile. Since mining is a commodity-driven business, and Delta has a long track record in the commodities business, whether it is in metals, energy, or other commodities, the pairing was natural. </p><p><strong>What mining sub sectors has Delta invested in, and do you prefer to invest in greenfield or brownfield projects?<br></strong>We have acquired both brownfield and greenfield projects and are open to both depending on how they fit our investment criteria, though our target investments focus on relatively quick time to market cash flow production (less than two years). We are developing a strong portfolio of mining assets mainly in base and poly metals, including chrome, lead, zinc, copper, and poly metal sites. For now, our mining investments are in Turkey, though hopefully in the medium term we will grow our portfolio internationally into parts of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.</p><p><strong>What efficiency-oriented practices does Delta implement for its new mining acquisitions?<br></strong>The mining sector is a commodity-driven market; therefore, one usually acts as a price taker, which means we focus our investments on what we can change. With our acquisitions of brownfield projects in particular, we can improve cost management, investment skillsets, and R&amp;D management. Looking at our chrome sites, we have spent a great deal of time and money developing exploration tools such as new exploration and drilling equipment and in R&amp;D, with a new laboratory for metallurgical testing and 3D software systems to scan and analyze mineralogical alterations on the surface and identify resource areas for development. As a result, we have been able to extract significantly more resources from our mine sites. We employed an expert technical team of geologists and mine engineers to build an effective network team, and we continuously provide training and workshops to enhance the technical expertise and development within our organization. </p><p><strong>What is your current strategy to gain a larger market share within the mid-stream oil and gas sector?<br></strong>Our appetite is to continue our investments in mid-stream assets in storage, logistics, transport, shipping, trading, pipelines, and port infrastructure development. At the moment, we are eying investments in the international market. Our areas of interest include the Middle East, Europe, Africa, and southern Europe, as well as the Black Sea region. Africa, for example, is a great growth story, though the infrastructure is still insufficient, so there are many opportunities there for development and management. It could involve developing a greenfield project development from scratch, rehabilitating existing infrastructure, or management contracting, where we bring our own expertise in international standards and oil and gas market knowledge to existing projects in order to add value and bring projects to fruition.</p><p><strong>What are Delta's investment strategies to invest in markets where Turkey has competitive advantages?<br></strong>We have always worked with international trading companies, majors, and state companies; from that perspective, the quality of receivables is important for us. As a company, we want to be more of a market maker, and our investments demonstrate that. For example, in mining Turkey is one of the top three largest producers of chrome in the world, and we are one of the leaders and biggest exporters within Turkey. We are looking to expand not only into extracting chrome ore but also investing in horizontal developments such as plant developments, enrichment plants, and possibly smelting plants as well. The state is offering attractive incentives to that effect.  Our goal within the mining sector is to be truly international and integrate and capture more value through our mine portfolio of assets. We also see similar market opportunities in the midstream energy and petrochemicals markets. Turkey has considerable market power in the midstream area as well as in industrial production and chemical plants.  It has a strong domestic demand and sits in a geographical region, where it can provide an export production and/or a logistics hubs regionally to take advantage of the international flow and nearby demand markets.</p><p><strong>What is Delta Group looking to invest in right now?<br></strong>We are looking at both local as well as international acquisitions. We have a dynamic team looking at acquisitions mainly in base metal mining, namely chrome, lead, zinc, and copper. Second, we are looking into energy and chemicals, so anything to do with mid-stream assets, logistics, and even industrial production plants especially with the export possibilities to international markets and chemical plants. Those are the specific areas that we target investing in. On the mining side, we want to be a truly international company, and in the coming years we want to continue to develop and build a sustainable and strong portfolio and list in international markets. We want to develop the other part of the business, which is the energy, chemical, and petrochemicals side. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>New mining regulation passed in 2017 freed up the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources' approval process to transfer mining licenses to private firms. How will this change in regulation encourage investment?<br></strong>New regulations will mostly affect projects related to the transformation of coal into energy. Actually, tenders about this were made in Soma and Zonguldak. These will contribute to both the mining and energy sectors by converting and transforming existing idle reserves into energy. Large companies usually get them. Large companies with operations in Soma took them, partially because the government awarded incentives for this. They do not tax this, for example. They also gave incentives on investment, such as the restructuring which affected coal production, mining, and energy, which was a good one. It was an operation for the production of lignite resources in Turkey done according to national energy and national mining policies. We also support this effort as an association. </p><p><strong>What progress has been made thus far to develop new lignite and hard coal mines as a result of the regulatory changes? <br></strong>Turkey normally imports USD4 billion of coal each year, most of which is for energy-oriented power plants. This project is meant to reduce imported coal according to the national energy and national mining policy by substituting domestic resources for it. Some very large coal deposits were found in Alpu in Eskişehir and elsewhere such as Konya. Projects and preparations for these projects are ongoing, and tenders for some of them have already been made. Some of them started operations, too. New production projects still continue, but they have not been finalized yet. Many of them will be in production in 2019 and soon thereafter. There will be an incentive for coal mines and power plants, whose target number we will reach after 2019.</p><p><strong>Outside of coal, how have liberalization efforts impacted other mining sectors? <br></strong>The regulation was not just issued for coal. A special incentive was given for coal, but an incentive for metals was also given, in addition to incentives to support metal mining and the production of metal. There were some serious incentives to build the sector for the end product. The incentive was 50% and was increased to 75% by the 2018 law. They still support it, because Turkey has about USD25 billion worth of imports related to mining. These consist of coal, gold, lead, zinc, and iron ore. There is research related to the reduction of imports and the substitution of domestic mines, which the regulations also include, be it related to gold, coal, lead, or industrial raw materials.</p><p><strong>What role does the TMD play in helping shape regulations promoting liberalization and encouraging investment? <br></strong>Both TMD and other components conducted studies on these issues in which we provide our opinions and suggestions regarding the laws and regulations being made. We present them both to the ministry and the sector, in which we play an active role. We also provide reports, legislative proposals, and regulatory recommendations on these proposals. We take the examples you mentioned earlier on practices of other countries and check if they can be applied to Turkey; if they can, we present them to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, the Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. </p><p><strong>Which mining sectors have been most affected—positively or negatively—by the depreciation of the lira?<br></strong>Mostly the exporters have been affected. There are two kinds of products in the mining sector in Turkey: those aimed at the export sector and those for the domestic market. We have an export value of USD4.5 billion in total. Almost half of this is marble. The rest of it comes from metal exports and industrial raw materials. The most negatively affected parties are the ones that sell marble or other materials in the domestic market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What recent investments has Çayeli Bakır made to improve the production and safety of its mine?<br></strong>In the last few years, we have invested in the safety of our shaft hoisting system. It is an underground mine and the hoisting system corresponds to 50% of our production; therefore, the shaft is a critical element of the mining process. The mine has been in production for 25 years, so the system requires constant maintenance. This has been the focus of our investments. We have started using new safety systems to keep in line with the latest technology, such as new communication systems. We have also invested in equipment, as some of our equipment is 15 years old.</p><p><strong>What automation techniques are you planning to introduce?<br></strong>Ours is the first mine in Turkey to introduce a fleet management and mine control system. This improved the efficiency and productivity of our underground operations. After seeing the benefits of it, we cannot imagine a mine without a fleet management system now. We have also equipped our auxiliary ventilation with remote control systems to increase efficiency, reduce fan maintenance costs, and save energy costs. It enables us to operate and shut down remotely from the surface. Notably, it has reduced our ventilation energy costs by approximately 15%, which corresponds to USD250,000 per year. The third thing to mention is the personal tracking system underground. We implemented it before it was made mandatory.</p><p><strong>What investments have you made to increase the energy efficiency of your mining operations?<br></strong>We have an energy management team that consists of engineers from the mine, maintenance, mill, and finance departments. They meet every month to look for opportunities to reduce consumption. Underground, ventilation is our main energy consumption, while on the surface, it is the milling side. At present, we are processing increasing amounts of low-grade material, which consists of clay, and when the clay comes into contact with water, it becomes hard to crush. We are working hard to improve the crushing equipment so that we can feed the running circuit as much as possible so that the energy consumed per ton falls. We have also engaged in campaigns outside of the production process to reduce energy consumption. We have replaced roofs with transparent roof covers to use sunlight instead of artificial light. Similarly, we have installed higher efficiency bulbs ones to further reduce our energy consumption.</p><p><strong>Can you outline how your water recycling techniques work?<br></strong>Our water recycling begins with underground drainage water, which is collected and pumped back to the surface. This water then accumulates in a large pond and is recycled to be used in other plants around our production facility, primarily the grinding circuit. Rainwater and runoff water are also collected in the same pond. The third thing we have done successfully on the flotation circuit is the copper overflow. After doing necessary tests, we found that using the grinding circuit does not affect the flotation. We recover, recycle, and restore the water at our facility. We use the rainwater for our processing needs and ensure that no water is discharged to the environment. It is not only about efficiency but also about making sure water from our site does not leak out.</p><p><strong>What is your operational and business plan leading up to 2022, when Çayeli Bakır's reserves are predicted to be depleted?<br></strong>The ore is currently depleting, and as it depletes, we are back filling the mine at a rate of around 20,000 tons of backfill a week. This process goes on 24 hours a day, as we aim to replace the extracted ore with backfill soon after the production. Once the mine is completely depleted by 2022, we will have to look at the service facilities. Turkish mining laws say we need to return the mine site to as it was before the mine started operation. Beyond that, we want to do something more and leave a legacy if we can. The mine has been in production for 25 years, and we plan to generate socioeconomic benefits for the environment and local communities. We do not want to leave a gap once the mine closes down. We have plans to do something that would bring some income to the community once we leave. Quantum Minerals, which owns Çayeli Bakır, is actively looking for opportunities all over the world. The plan is to find a project that can be beneficial for the company and operate it once the mine goes offline.</p><p><strong>What are your primary objectives over the next 12 months?<br></strong>We want to deliver budgeted revenue numbers and give return to our shareholders. In order to do so, we need to set targets and achieve them. Our target for 2019 and 2020 is achieving higher safety standards. Our second target is to acquire the right tones and grade from the underground. We also aim to reduce the operating costs of the mill. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Turkey's mining sector accounts for around 1% of GDP but the government has a goal to increase that to 3%. How well positioned is Turkey to expand its mining sector?<br></strong>It is important to increase the output of the mining sector in Turkey for a number of reasons—beyond just GDP growth. Mining activity in Turkey produces vital raw material inputs for the industrial sector; therefore, its expansion will reduce our dependence on imports. Turkey imported around USD27 billion worth of mining products in 2018; in comparison, Turkey's mining exports in 2018 stood at USD6-7 billion. Much of that USD20 billion trade deficit is due to gold imports, which amounted to USD8.5 billion in 2018. We also import other products such as copper and iron ore, among others. Contrary to what these figures might indicate, Turkey has significant mining resources—there are about 90 kinds of mining products in the world and 70 of them exist in Turkey. </p><p><strong>What are the biggest challenges to expanding the mining sector's share of GDP, and how is the ministry working to decrease the sector's environmental impact?</strong><br>Mining is a time- and cost-intensive activity. It can sometimes take 10 years between exploration and production. Investments in the sector are long-term commitments and therefore we need to be patient. The sector's expansion is also limited by environmental and location constraints. We don't initiate mining projects close to residential neighborhoods and cities as well as protected areas such as natural parks, national parks, SIT areas, and touristic areas. When you look at the remaining areas, they are often agricultural or forested land. In these cases, the Ministry of Agriculture or the General Directorate of Forestry have to be consulted, and we engage in studies about the environmental and economic impact of initiating a project. There are protections in place to ensure that citizen land rights and forested lands are respected.</p><p><strong>How is the ministry involved in the rehabilitation of land after mining projects are completed?<br></strong>We are involved in the rehabilitation process, especially when it relates to forested areas. If a mining project is to be initiated in a forested area, the General Directorate of Forestry has a specific permit process that has to be undertaken in line with its own legislation overseen by its regulation boards. For example, it is prohibited to mine in dense forests. Moreover, there are per unit costs of cutting trees, and projects are required to plant as many trees as they cut in a different location. The General Directorate of Forestry also receives rent income to help improve the condition of forests around the country. Once the mining operations cease, the mining area needs to be rehabilitated, which involves a number of processes, including reforestation. Our ministry has also contributed by initiating a campaign involving a number of stakeholders from the natural gas, electricity, mining, and energy sectors aimed at planting 5 million trees around the country. Maintaining a fair balance between protection and production will enable the economy to realize the full potential of the mining sector.<br>  <br><strong>Can you outline the importance of the mining sector?<br></strong>Minerals are used in nearly every product we use on a daily basis. In Turkey, the sector employs around 130,000 people. Its importance for the economy is clear. While Turkey's mining sector accounts for 1% of GDP, the mining sector in countries such as the US, Canada, China, South Africa, and Australia represents over 10%. While we are doing all we can to catch up, it is also paramount that we vet the companies operating in the sector to make sure they are sensitive to the environment and local communities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What role does technological innovation play in Numarine's line of yachts?<br></strong>Technological innovation in the yachting sector did not truly exist until we started in 2001. Everyone was building boats in the same way that they were doing in the 1960s—we were in the dark ages of production. In 2001, when I started Numarine, I felt we needed to do things differently, and our differentiator had to be lower prices than our competitors, the main European brands. At this time, vacuum infusion was something extremely high tech that only race sailing yachts were utilizing. The technology is environmentally friendly, as it emits 99% less styrene gas into the environment. I saw that the environment would be a key issue and selling point in the coming years, and the technology produces a light and strong product, so we invested heavily in developing the technology. We were the first shipyard in Europe to produce everything with vacuum infusion; by the time many other companies switched and started doing vacuum infusion, we were leading the pack. Another of our key technologies are lithium ion batteries, which we introduced two years ago. </p><p><strong>How does your new yacht, Adonis, implement even more advanced technology?<br></strong>Adonis is our collaboration with Furrion Design, a Hong Kong-based technology company that created Angle AI. It also does a great deal of work integrating AI into household appliances. Adonis mixes these two aspects of Furrion with yachting. It is wonderful—as one walks in, a smart camera recognizes them and sets the mood to their preferences, changing the music and learning their preferences. Sailors can ask about the weather in a certain location and request that the yacht navigate there. The yacht will take them there, and en route it will ask if they want to visit a restaurant. Then, it can select the best one. The temperature of water in the shower can be adjusted via voice recognition. In the future, this will all be standard. However, when it comes to extremely high-tech solutions such as Adonis, I am slightly cautious, as it is still extremely new and untested. If our boats are to sail all over the world, we need to ensure they are safe and can be serviced.</p><p><strong>How do changes in taste drive Numarine's technology and yacht line?<br></strong>10 years ago, speed was a selling point, though this has changed. Now, people want to be able to navigate quietly so that they are comfortable and can sleep during navigation. This is why our lithium ion batteries are popular as the technology is quieter. It is one of the reasons why our XP line has been successful, as the yachts are quieter and roomier. </p><p><strong>What are the biggest operational challenges you face?<br></strong>We used to face many challenges when we were new into the market and were learning; however, it has been 18 years, and we have produced close to 150 boats, so production-wise we do not face many challenges. On the marketing side, producing in Turkey and selling worldwide still has its challenges. Turkey had a fantastic image up until five or six years ago—when I went to the GCC or Europe before, customs were extremely positive and processed us even without a stamp. However, we have lost that prestige over the last five years due to international politics. It is becoming harder to sell such an expensive product to a global customer from Turkey.</p><p><strong>Over the next 12 months, what are your plans and objectives?<br></strong>We have a new 45-m Explorer, which is our biggest project and one of the most exciting. It will present many challenges for us, though it will also bring many rewards because once it is out there, it will be the only boat of that size with those amenities. I do not know what the global economy or politics will bring in the future; however, we are focused on our growth plans. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Why did Tersan move into the building of passenger and fishing vessels and away from cargo vessels and tankers?<br></strong>The economic crisis that all shipping companies and shipyards in Turkey faced in 2008 and the balance of the supply and demand chain falling apart to our disadvantage caused us to move away from the cargo vessel and tanker sectors and pushed us to discover the potential in northern Europe and Scandinavian countries. After 2008, we focused on producing tailor-made, purpose-built, and technologically sophisticated niche vessels and worked on developing new business opportunities. As a result of our business development activities, we secured our first niche fishing vessel order from a Norwegian fishery company. We recently signed our sixth vessel contract with the same company, our 100th new building project.</p><p><strong>Tersan exports its vessels to markets across the global and has a considerable presence in the European and North American markets. Which regions and countries are Tersan's focus?</strong><br>We are mostly focused on the Scandinavian, Russian, and North American markets. Given that we offer optimum quality and price balance, ship owners from Norway, Iceland, Russia, Canada, and Denmark prefer Tersan. Logistical advantages, time zones, and cultural similarities also help us establish new partnerships with these countries.</p><p><strong>Hybrid solutions in Tersan's new vessels have proved effective in lowering emissions, fuel consumption, and noise. Can you describe the primary technologies behind Tersan's hybrid vessels?</strong><br>In accordance with the demands of ship owners and end users, we are increasingly applying new technologies to our products, especially to meet requirements such as lower fuel consumption, operational costs, and emissions. Apart from hybrid vessels, we also offer 100% electric-powered ferries. In fact, Tersan was one of the first shipyards to build 100% electric vessels. These ferries are charged at the automatic charging stations at both piers of the ferry route they operate, and they can sail to the other pier without using any additional energy source and charge the batteries again during the loading and unloading of the vehicles. We also equip these ferries with autonomous navigation systems to reduce fuel and energy consumption. These types of ferries evaluate factors such as weather conditions during the cruise, including separation and docking maneuvers, and perform the course with minimum energy. During loading and unloading, instead of holding the ferry to the pier with propellers, which is the conventional method, the vacuum system on the pier holds her up. The energy stored in the batteries of these ferries also meets the targets of zero-exhaust emission since the energy is sourced from hydroelectric power plants. Apart from the battery technology, we apply waste heat recovery systems, permanent magnet synchronous motors, direct drive main panels, variable speed machines, and other new technologies to almost all of our vessels. We also incorporate regeneration technology into the vessels. Using this, we can store the invert energy generated from cranes and winches during the unloading and direct the converted energy to the consumers on the vessel. We work closely with our solution partners to apply renewable energy applications and closely evaluate the results of our applications.</p><p><strong>The Turkish shipbuilding industry is on par with European companies in terms of quality and Asian companies in terms of prices. How has Tersan benefited from this position?</strong><br>Our quality and price have played vital roles in helping us gain a bigger market share. We have focused on purposed-built, tailor-made projects as we can meet all the expectations of the ship owners from European and Scandinavian countries. We aim to maintain this position by satisfying our customers' expectations and ensuring high quality and on-time deliveries. We also provide flexible solutions to our customers in each and every step of the shipbuilding process, from designing and engineering to delivery. Apart from our performance, political stability and financial strength also play a significant role in maintaining the standing of the Turkish shipbuilding industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the most important factor behind ARES Shipyard's success?<br></strong>In fact, I would say all of them, as a vessel that meets the requirements can be developed only when all of these components are brought together in harmony. For this reason, we are ambitious in all of these areas; but if pressed to explain briefly about all four factors, I would start with production. In 2018, we delivered 11 vessels in only 12 months, and this is in itself a record for Turkey, but we can go further and state we are Europe's largest manufacturer of composite hull vessels. When it comes to design, we are as ambitious in this area as we are in production, such that the point that we have achieved in design takes us a few steps ahead of our competitors and increases our sales capabilities dramatically. Our success in system engineering, on the other hand, is exemplified by our integration capabilities. Finally, we owe this harmony to our young, dynamic and energetic cadre.</p><p><strong>You said that you are Europe's largest manufacturer of composite hull vessels. Can you elaborate on this? <br></strong>ARES Shipyard invests most of its revenues into new facilities, investments, and infrastructure, and this allows us build three or four different vessels at a time and to manage these processes in such a way that they are not affected by each other. Of the 11 vessels we are able to deliver a year, most are in the 35-m and 48-m class, but we should not only talk about physical magnitude, as we also need to underline our technologies, quality, and speed of production. We are the only company in the world that builds composite hull military ships with epoxy resin and vacuum infusion technologies. We achieve all of this without compromising on quality; in addition, none of the vessels we have delivered to date have ever been returned to us.</p><p><strong>You have experienced rapid growth since the establishment of ARES Shipyard in 2006. Would you tell us the story behind this growth? </strong><br>We first started production in late 2006 on a 700-sqm production area that we had leased from Siemens in the Antalya Free Zone. In 2008, we completed construction and commissioned our first 3,000sqm facility. After producing vessels for a French company on contract basis for a while, we realized we had to specialize in this field and turned our attention to two main branches, namely commercial and military projects. The economic crisis of 2008 hit the shipbuilding sector badly, and the sector has still not managed to recover. But we did not give up and found new businesses to undertake. Moreover, we did not lend any money to achieve this growth; we have been growing in a healthy way, making use of our own resources, ultimately becoming a globally well-known company that relies on its own capabilities and marketing strategy.</p><p><strong>How about your growth in terms of investments? <br></strong>Our most important ongoing investment is the new building we are adding to our facilities. The building will permit the construction of vessels of up to 90m in length. Our intention is to make use of this building initially for an offshore patrol vessel and a fast attack craft program if we are awarded with the contracts. Our existing facilities allow us to construct such boats, though with our new investment we will be able to increase production and offer higher quality products. I hope we will soon be offering to the market a number of new boats on the strength of this new facility, working with such partners as thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, BMT, and Rolls-Royce. We have also expanded our furniture factory, where we are operating with increased capacity and producing more different furniture styles. To accommodate all these additional works, the area of our facility has been increased from 26,000sqm to 40,000sqm. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cemre recently delivered its 50th vessel to Havyard Group, a Norwegian shipping company. Why did Cemre begin working with northern European companies, and what future plans do you have with them?</strong><br>We started to work with Havyard in 2005 when northern European countries showed their interest in Turkey's shipbuilding sector. We rented a place at Istanbul Shipyard from the Ministry of Defense and started looking for clients. When we came into contact with Havyard, all the Turkish shipyards were working at full capacity. We won our initial contract with Havyard because we had capacity, but we won follow-up work because of our performance. Later, we continued to work with it because we provided high-quality ships and delivered on time due to our entire team's hard work. We have delivered Havyard 50 ships so far and are working on 10 more ships, hopefully with more to come. This partnership has a win-win model and is based on mutual trust. We think it will strengthen and grow in the future.</p><p><strong>Other than Norway, which European countries are you most interested in?<br></strong>We consider Europe as one bloc, so it is not wise to look at a single country from a business development standpoint. We prefer to construct project or niche ships, such as the ships we construct for the energy sector that service offshore windmills. These ships are often used by more than one country and are extremely versatile. We have constructed ships for Norway, Denmark, Iceland, the UK, and France. The most popular ships of late are fishing vessels, ferries, and energy-support ships. </p><p><strong>Why did the company choose to focus on niche sectors of the shipbuilding industry?<br></strong>Turkey's construction of classical ships has decreased substantially because of competition from East Asia. We have focused on project ships based on our client's needs, or on a tailor-made basis. One of our goals is to construct cruise ships and to grow our presence in that area. We see great growth potential for ships that use advanced technologies, such as hybrid power. There is growing demand for hybrid and battery-powered ships because the environmental factor is gaining prominence, especially in northern European countries. Hydrogen-powered ships are also being designed and people are beginning to realize the future of autonomous ships. We have to follow the technology. We have to target the ships that involve technology and demand more engineering contribution. </p><p><strong>What benefits do hybrid vessels offer, and do those benefits justify the higher cost? <br></strong>We have different technologies for our hybrid solutions. The key benefits are fuel efficiency, silent working ability, and environmental impact. So far, we have built hybrid ships primarily for ferry companies. Eventually, I believe all ferries will use electrical hybrid solutions, especially in Norway. Regarding cost, hybrid technologies will become cheaper in the future. For example, the batteries were expensive last year but now their prices are dropping. With time, all of the associated costs will be more balanced. When it comes to the market for the first time, the prices are higher because of the R&amp;D costs.</p><p><strong>How has the lira's depreciation impacted your input costs and export demand?<br></strong>For us, the lira's sudden depreciation or appreciation is a disadvantage. Although we export and an increase in the value of foreign currency may seem to benefit us, that is not the case. Around 60-70% of our costs depends on foreign currency. Once our suppliers accept the foreign currency exchange rate and calculate costs accordingly, pulling the prices back is extremely hard. On the contrary, stable and small increases are better for us as that helps us plan ahead.</p><p><strong>With Cemre's pipeline full for the next two years, what investments are you planning to expand your capacity?<br></strong>We have always invested in expanding our shipyard capacity; each year we grow by 10,000sqm. We started ship construction in 2005 with a really small area and in 2007 we had our own 20,000-sqm shipyard. The first shipyard we had has grown to 70,000sqm. After expanding it yearly for a few years, we decided to purchase a larger plot of land. At present, we have two 70,000-sqm shipyards and a 10,000-sqm piece of land; however, according to our production plans, we need more space. There are 37 other shipyards in Yalova, and we plan to outsource some of our jobs to them. We want to invest more in technology, because the ships we construct are special ships and we want to construct these ships as quickly as possible with the best technology available. </p><p><strong>In the future, how do you envision Cemre further diversifying its shipbuilding capabilities?<br></strong>We recently acquired a facility security document, so we plan to work on military projects for foreign countries. Another alternative is that we want to construct small-sized passenger ships, especially because passenger ships are also sensitive to the environment and use hybrid technologies. With the advancement of technology, new routes are formed, which boosts demand for new ships. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Arena Offshore operates in three primary business segments: sale and purchase, chartering and brokerage, and shipbuilding and ship design. How does each segment fit into Arena Offshore's overall strategy?<br></strong>At present, around 60% of our revenue comes from the brokerage business. We are focused on providing the offshore industry with the highest standard of sale and purchase, chartering, and market intelligence services. Due to our high deal flow, in 1998 we assumed an active role as a bridge in the offshore industry, facilitating coordination among the buyers, sellers, and charterers from all over the world. Shipbuilding and design go hand-in-hand with each other as a lot of our design work ends up supporting our shipbuilding process as well as the brokerage side with its technical knowledge in deals. We are seeking to increase our brokerage business while maintaining our current levels of design and building. Our clients have been happy with our shipbuilding work and the majority have become repeat customers. Our customers' satisfaction is both a result of our quality work and of their trust in us. These aspects hold true for many Turkish shipbuilders; we offer high-quality services and products and value our relationships with clients. Arena Offshore built trust first through its brokerage services, and that relationship of trust carried on into the shipbuilding and design businesses.</p><p><strong>In 2011, Arena Offshore acquired a 35% stake in Alfa Marine Design—a Turkish naval architecture and design company. Why did you seek this acquisition?</strong><br>Having a design department or office is a huge advantage for any shipbuilder. Prior to our acquisition, our new build process sometimes faced a bottleneck at the design stage because we were contracting out the work. Firms with strong design capabilities don't face this problem. This advantage was the primary motivator for our acquisition. A short, efficient production process is one of the most important parts of the shipbuilding business. Therefore, our acquisition was not purely profit motivated; rather, it was a way to run a better vertically integrated shipbuilding company. </p><p><strong>Arena Offshore is now building some of its vessels abroad. Why did you decide to diversify your production facilities, and how does it provide you with a competitive advantage?</strong><br>In our new build business, we are constantly seeking competitive advantages that allow us to offer top-quality vessels at attractive prices. Our decision to build vessels abroad is a business decision, and it came down to some price structures that make it advantageous to build in countries like China, Singapore, and Indonesia. The dynamics of the global shipbuilding industry have evolved over time. Since there are only a few shipyards in Europe, the world considers Turkish shipyards to be the leaders. However, competition is getting stronger. The input prices and labor costs for Asian shipbuilding industries I are lower than ours due to the dynamics of international trade and their national economies. I now offer my clients the opportunity to build their vessels in a different part of the world with the same maker list at a lower price. We control all aspects of the process to make sure the delivery date and quality of the vessel is determined by my company, not by the shipyard we are working with.</p><p><strong>Within Arena Offshore's shipbuilding business, what kinds of vessels are you currently focusing on?<br></strong>Our new-build vessels are mainly for the offshore oil and gas and marine construction sectors. These vessels are capable of operating in marine constructions, harbors, towage, and offshore extracting activities.</p><p><strong>Where are you expecting to see demand in the future?<br></strong>We have greatly diversified our customer base so that we are not overly-dependent on a single market. While we have dealt or built mostly for the European, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern markets in the past, we have diversified into Asia, Africa, and South America of late. In order to reach these markets, we have offices in Singapore and Nigeria. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you break down Sefine's exports to Europe and, more broadly, where the company hopes to grow in the future?<br></strong>Sefine Shipyard has been involved in many 'firsts' in Europe. We were the first Turkish company to begin making turnkey ferries for Norway, which is where we still have our strongest European presence. After our first work in Norway, we produced two ferry boats for the Estonian market, again a first for a Turkish company, which also represented the largest single Turkish export to Estonia. In 2018, we built a hybrid LNG-diesel electric ferry for Italy, the first LNG powered ferry in the Mediterranean. We are seeking to broaden our market to other Scandinavian countries, like Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Iceland because we specialize in two types of vessels—ferryboats and live fish carriers. Scandinavian countries in particular use these two types of vessels, so we have plans to continue growing our market share in those markets. We have had 40 new builds to date, almost all for the European market, with five or six of them in Turkey. It is difficult to expand beyond Europe because we are a boutique shipyard and not like a huge Korean-type shipyard. It is hard to compete with the East Asian shipyards, which is why we focus on tailor-made ships for European countries. For this reason, we will not go to markets beyond Europe.</p><p><strong>Sefine Shipyard is also involved in the repair and conversion of vessels. What projects has the company done in this field?<br></strong>We have completed six cement carrier conversions for the Italian market and two livestock carrier conversions for the Gulf. Ship conversion is a different market; one never knows when the next conversion project will come. One cannot market this service in the usual way; people will seek them out for specific projects. Sefine Shipyard is successful in conversion projects because we have a great design office, and we are more economical than other companies. </p><p><strong>The local shipbuilding industry is known for its versatility and capabilities in niche sectors. What niche markets has Sefine defined for itself?</strong><br>In Turkey, we generally do tailor-made jobs, so our advantage is that local shipbuilders are able to enter niche markets, as we did. In our case, we used to produce bulk carriers, tankers, and tugboats like everyone else in the world; however, we later realized we needed something else to give us more competitive advantages. We entered the ferryboat market before anyone else and now dominate the segment. Sefine Shipyard is now the leader in the ferry market. However, that was not enough to survive and keep the business sustainable. We had to find other markets and after conducting some research. For example, we identified an opportunity in the live fish carrier segment. </p><p><strong>The depreciation of the lira has benefited many exporters in Turkey. How has it impacted Sefine Shipyard?<br></strong>Initially, the depreciation was difficult for us, because although our labor costs are in lira, everything else is in foreign currency, such as euro, dollars, or even the Norwegian krone. We had to wait two or three months for the lira to stabilize to find the correct costs for us. Sometimes, our suppliers and sub-contractors were afraid to even provide us with quotes. But once the currency stabilized, we were able to start pricing accurately for our customers again. We have not benefited as much as other exporters have from the depreciation.</p><p><strong>What are Sefine Shipyard's biggest plans and primary objectives for the coming 12 months?<br></strong>We are almost at full capacity for the next two years, so we need to invest in our shipyard infrastructure and buildings; for example, we have a new social building because we previously had 1,500 employees and now require facilities for 4,000 people. We are also investing in more workshops. Our primary objective for the year is to complete all our infrastructure investments to continue growing Sefine Shipyard. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Kale Pratt &amp; Whitney was founded in 2010 and began its operations in 2014 manufacturing aircraft engine parts and subassembly groups. Can you outline how the competencies from both Kale Group and Pratt &amp; Whitney combined to create effective R&amp;D and manufacturing capabilities?<br></strong>Our company's JV contract was signed in 2010. The company was founded in 2011 in a small rented building within the Izmir ESBAÅž free zone, and our new plant building opened in 2014. It is a 16,250-sqm building on a 100,000-sqm land within the ESBAÅž free zone. In the first few years, competencies were gained both with experts from PW and Kale Group. Kale had been active in the aerospace and defense industry for some years, and it had experts made available to Kale Pratt &amp; Whitney. Today, Kale Pratt &amp; Whitney has developed its own qualified workforce staff in engineering, production, and quality. Together with all these achievements, we have an effective process development and continuous improvement projects in place.</p><p><strong>What percentage of Kale Pratt &amp; Whitney's revenue can be attributed to each the F-135 engine and the F-100 engine, and what additional aircraft parts does it currently manufacture?</strong><br>Our company was founded in large part to manufacture F-135 engine parts, which is used in F-35 fighter jets. F-100s are also manufactured, though their share is small. Throughout the years, we began manufacturing commercial aircraft engine parts, especially for PW1000G GTF new generation engines used by Airbus for its NEO aircraft. Actual revenue share for F-135 military engine parts is 30%, while the share of commercial engine parts is 70%.</p><p><strong>How will Kale Pratt &amp; Whitney adjust its business model following the decision made to exclude Turkish manufacturers from the F-35 program?</strong><br>We do have a significant F-35 business that accounts for 30% of our revenues, and our business will be adversely affected by losing this share. To reduce the potential impacts on our business and employees, we are working actively together with Pratt &amp; Whitney to receive additional commercial parts to maintain the level of work we have. Pratt &amp; Whitney's orders for GTF engines are continuously going up, and our JV in İzmir is growing in parallel. However, there will be a few years of setback before we replace F-135 parts manufacturing with the commercial engines. In addition, during our last general assembly meeting in 2019, we gained approval to enlarge our field of business aircraft structural parts.</p><p><strong>What investments are needed to shift away from F-135 production?<br></strong>We are in the process of checking the necessary investments. A total amount of USD90 million in investment has been already made, and investments in special processes such as hot forming, hot expander, hydroforming, plasma/HVOF coating, chemical lines, painting, brazing, electron beam welding, and so on have been made for sheet metal high Ti and Ni alloy sheet metal fabrications.</p><p><strong>In the coming three years, what are Kale Pratt &amp; Whitney Group's primary objectives?<br></strong>We want to strengthen our position and be the first choice of our customers. With continuous improvement and implementation of lean philosophy in our shop, we want to become a Pratt &amp; Whitney gold-level supplier. We will also continuously invest in knowledge and expertise of our employees to excel in all our processes. On the other hand, we also want to achieve success in our new field of activity, the structural parts for aircraft industry to balance our workload between aircraft engines and wing and fuselage parts. As a result, we plan to increase our actual sales to USD100 million in a few years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>STM recently completed several significant projects for the Pakistani Navy. How important is this strategic relationship for STM's future?<br></strong>Turkey has close relations with Pakistan as we have deep historical ties. STM and the Pakistani Navy have been and are still working together in the training area, especially with young naval officers. That training relationship has brought us an opportunity to improve our business relations with Pakistan because its navy wants to use the same platforms and technologies in Pakistan. </p><p><strong>STM has signed a contract for the development of four corvettes for the Pakistani Navy under the MILGEM program. Why does the contract call for the building of two vessels in Turkey and two in Pakistan?<br></strong>Many countries want to develop their technology, especially for the defense industry, because it has strategical importance for national security. Similar to Turkey, Pakistan wants to establish its domestic defense industry. One cannot depend on other countries for their defense requirements. With that in mind, we offered to build two ships in Pakistan. It improves the country's capabilities and localization, which is vital for the Pakistani Navy to strengthen its overall infrastructure and increase the capability of its human resources. The difference between STM and its western competitors is that STM doesn't see a country as an open market; on the contrary, it offers to transfer its technology. Many countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Peru, and Colombia are demanding such contracts. We offer them the same service, and they are impressed by our offer. </p><p><strong>What regions or specific countries will have a high demand for STM's products?<br></strong>In terms of regions, Asia, South America, and Africa are our target markets. Moreover, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the MENA region are our focus areas at present. It is not easy to compete within the penetrated developed markets in Europe and North America. Due to that, we are investigating emerging markets, especially those seeking an opportunity to build their own technology. Our focus countries are interested in the MILGEM Corvette program chiefly, and also submarine modernization. Cybersecurity is a hot market across the globe, and STM's cyber capabilities allow it to penetrate this market as well. We have remarkable cybersecurity capabilities, which we use for the government and other strategic institutions in Turkey. We are following our export strategy for all our products and aim to improve our export potential. Our teams are working hard to find new clients. At the same time, we are focused on developing our business in the international market, including products such as navy platforms, submarines, cybersecurity solutions, and drones. After that point, we want to use our leverage and engineering capability to create a new business area, which can be a new area for the market. On the other hand, there are numerous technologies in the international market that companies in Turkey are unaware of. We plan to find these and bring them to Turkey in the long term.  </p><p><strong>What share of STM's cybersecurity revenue comes from the private sector?<br></strong>About half of our revenue within the cybersecurity segment comes from corporates. Cybersecurity is not a government issue only, as every corporate and company has to defend itself, especially as data is becoming a strategic target. We offer our products to both the government and corporates and are trying to improve our offerings in line with future requirements. That is why we included AI services in our list of services; it acts as a leverage point because corporates can acquire our AI services at a reasonable cost. Otherwise, companies have to hire a separate team, which requires substantial investment. Incurring such a cost is not probable for SMEs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>TAI's ANKA unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) program has produced and delivered finished products to the Turkish Armed Forces and is undergoing development for new, more advanced models. What does the future of the ANKA program look like?<br></strong>So far, we have delivered more than 18 ANKA-S UAVs. We are also in the process of securing some export deals. Regarding development, our newest UAV ANKA-AKSUNGUR has twin engines but the same control system as the ANKA-S; hence, it was not a big leap to develop. AKSUNGUR incorporates some additional capabilities—it has more payload, uses bigger cameras, and has an improved rudder for better land observation. The ANKA system is mature, but we want to develop it further. </p><p><strong>What new technologies does Turkish Aerospace's Gökbey Helicopter use, and what are your production and sales targets?<br></strong>Gökbey uses the latest design, and is a lighter and stronger helicopter with new systems, including a transmission system. The company is going through the certification process and once that is completed by 2021, Gökbey will be really successful and will likely sell several hundreds of units. At present, Turkish Aerospace builds 25 helicopters a year, but once the new technology program is complete that number will jump to 100. Our objective is to be a key player. In 2019, it is not hard to build aircraft and helicopters, but to be a key player requires having a strong brand and good products. </p><p><strong>TAI is producing the T129 under license from AgustaWestland, based on its A129 model. What additional capabilities does the T129 ATAK Helicopter have?<br></strong>We have the license to produce it, but we are currently the only producers because AgustaWestland stopped producing it. The engine has changed from the A129 model, and the T129 is a new machine in terms of structure. The T129 ATAK helicopter is a great product, but our target is to produce a bigger version. For example, the current version weighs five tons and we are targeting to increase it to 10 tons, adding a bigger, better engine and replacing the 20mm guns with 30mm ones. The bigger model will be completely produced in Turkey. Given that we are able to design a new transmission, which is a crucial part, and we have new milling machines and so on, we can do all the process at the micro level easily.</p><p><strong>The T129 ATAK Helicopter's export has been in doubt because of US export license restrictions. Why is it important to resolve it? </strong><br>We are still working on this and since NATO countries have invested in the company, all countries should support us. There is no conflict with the US—it is just an ongoing process.</p><p><strong>What percentage of Turkish Aerospace's revenue comes from making components for commercial airlines?<br></strong>In 2019, our total revenue will be about USD2 billion, and a quarter of that comes from exports. We make about 30% of our overall revenue from the commercial side and moving forward our plan is to expand that to 50%. If we want to make money and reinvest in our company, we have to rely on commercial products because the market for defense products is volatile. Undoubtedly, our future will be in the commercial aerospace sector. </p><p><strong>How will TAI ramp up production over the next 12 months?<br></strong>We have been investing heavily on both the labor and the infrastructure side of the business. We have a great deal of construction going on and are ordering new equipment and machines. The important and difficult part is the labor. We are hiring about 1,000 engineers and technicians and training them. Finding the right people is not difficult but training them is. Our plan is to grow TAI's presence on the global stage. This is why we have offices in London and Seattle, and there are plans in place to open an office in Malaysia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the most important products and solutions for HAVELSAN's export business?<br></strong>We have four main lines of business—two primarily in the defense field, one in the civic e-government area, and one in homeland security. In training and simulation field, we have developed numerous advanced technologies, products, and services, and are one of the top-five companies in the world. We have aircraft simulators, sniper simulators, submarine simulators, and parachute simulators—it is a diverse product line. We are not just selling the simulator itself; our main business is to establish turnkey training centers along with the simulators. The second line of business is command and control, which involves command, control, communication, intelligence, surveillance, and security systems. It is a large-scale segment, and we are one of the top-five players in the world in this area. The third line is management information systems, which are software-based solutions primarily for governments. This line is one of our long-established businesses and is aimed to provide information systems for critical infrastructures. Our fourth line of business is homeland security, which also includes cybersecurity. Up until now, our products have been available in 13 countries, including South Korea, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Malaysia, and Pakistan.</p><p><strong>What is HAVELSAN's strategy for penetrating new markets?<br></strong>South America is one of our target markets. The company is already selling training services to some South American countries, such as Colombia, but we want to continue growing there. As a way to expand future exports and develop commercial relations with other countries, we have developed some training centers in Turkey for the Turkish Armed Forces, including some slots we are able to sell to foreign countries. There are two limiting factors to our export business. In the defense sector, the exporting country has to have a good relationship with the customer's country. Second, there are some big markets in Western Europe where it doesn't make sense to expand because either such markets are highly competitive or they offer no room to grow.</p><p><strong>In the cybersecurity field, what is the advantage of technology transfer versus exporting ready-made products?<br></strong>Our strategy in the technology transfer area is limited to countries with strong diplomatic ties to Turkey. We have offered technology transfers to countries like Pakistan, Qatar, and Azerbaijan. In cybersecurity, if you do not have some control over your services, you are not on the safe side.</p><p><strong>How have HAVELSAN's roots as a technology company allowed it to be involved in high-tech infrastructure and IT projects?<br></strong>We are the biggest software technology company in Turkey and the region. Our headcount is 1,800, our subsidiaries employ around 400 people, and we have more than 400 subcontractors in our ecosystem with around 2,500 employees. Tallying those numbers means about 5,000 people, and around 75% of them are electronics and computer engineers. That is why we are defining HAVELSAN as a regional power, and hopefully in the near future, as a global power. Since we are a technology company, we have to not just follow the technology but also create and develop it. </p><p><strong>What are HAVELSAN's most important plans to implement its product-focused strategy in the near future?<br></strong>The company was established in 1982 and moving forward, we are excited to do business in Turkey, the region, and the world. The previous business model at HAVELSAN was a project-oriented one where we worked on tailor-made projects for individual customers. Two years ago, we changed our business model and at present, we are trying to create our own products and solutions and target more than one customer. We call this model productization. We have already finished our productization period and have 25 products in the pipeline, which we are expecting to put on the shelf. Future growth will be defined by how well we sell these products through different channels and direct sales. This will be our focus for 2019 and 2020. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>From a revenue standpoint, in which of sub sectors has Vefa Group been the most successful, and where do you expect to grow? </strong><br>Our prefabrication work is carried out through Vekon, one of Vefa Group's subsidiaries. We have 30 years of experience and have done projects in more than 100 countries. In these projects, we use four different building systems: prefabricated panels, modular containers (living containers), lightweight steel, and structural steel. Through these structures, we have been involved in many different projects around the world such as worksite structures, commercial structures, public buildings, as well as camps for the military, refugees, mining facilities, and so on. In addition, we run social housing projects. As per revenue, our profitability is high in social housing, schools, hospitals, and camp projects, as they are relatively big and centralized projects in terms of execution. Our focus for the future is on transferring our know-how and technology abroad.</p><p><strong>How challenging has it been for Vekon to convince price-sensitive sectors to invest in high-quality prefabricated units?<br></strong>Being a strong brand brings about high production capacity and high quality. In the prefabrication sector, one of the most important things is speed. When our customers make an inquiry, they say “We need it yesterday." Fast and high-volume production capacity is essential because the material we produce is used in emergency situations, such as refugee camps. We generally work with top companies, both international and domestic, and these companies have already accepted the fact that we are 10-15% more expensive than the standard market prices. They still purchase our products because they know they will have a long-term gain by using our products.</p><p><strong>How did you end up building a production facility in Afghanistan?<br></strong>The proposal to build a factory came from the Afghan government. The minister of environment and urban planning visited our facilities and our offices. He informed us that Afghanistan required a factory to produce prefabricated units and asked for an offer. After we sent an official offer, they invited us to Kabul to make a presentation alongside another company from Ankara and one from Dubai. In the end, the Afghani government decided to go ahead with us because our delivery time, price, and quality surpassed our competitors. The project is worth USD11 million in total. It took us 14 months to finalize it as promised. Before the project, the Afghan government sent a group of 30 architects and civil engineers, and we trained them in our facilities for three months so that they can now run the factory in Afghanistan. We have also been providing a consultancy service for the factory for a year now and is due to finish soon. Afghanistan's primary need at the moment is schools. Everyday, the factory produces 1,000sqm of two-story schools. However, the facility can also produce hospitals or houses in the future if needed.</p><p><strong>Which countries or regions are the most important for Vefa's exports, and into which new markets are you hoping to expand?<br></strong>We work on projects in 30-35 different countries annually. Currently, we are working on projects in 10 different countries, including South American countries, Africa, Turkic countries, and those in the Gulf. We hold a Turquality Certification and have chosen five target countries within the scope of this certification to export to. Those countries are Indonesia, Ethiopia, the US, Kazakhstan, and the UAE. Africa and South America have always been our target markets because premixed concrete is extremely expensive in these regions, or sometimes unavailable. For this reason, our products are suitable for building schools, hospitals, or mass housing projects in Africa. We have an excellent competitive edge in the countries where the cost of labor is expensive, such as the US and UK. There is currently a social facility project under construction in the UK by using our products. We have a distributor in the UK and export our products there. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>As the manager of Eaton's electrical business in Turkey, how does your business segment fit into the company's overall operations?</strong><br>Eaton has three legal entities in Turkey. One operates our hydraulic manufacturing facilities, another is our electrical operations business, Eaton Elektrik. The third is Ulusoy Elektrik, operating our switchgear factories in Turkey. I am responsible for Eaton Elektrik's operations. From a business point of view, we are focusing very much on the construction sector, including commercial and industrial buildings. In addition, we are also providing electrical products to machinery OEMs. We are also actively targeting some specific industries, such as cement, metal, and oil and gas. </p><p><strong>Why did Eaton enter the shipbuilding industry, and what subsectors are you focused on growing?<br></strong>The Turkish marine industry is well developed and large, and the country has more than 70 shipyards. There is huge potential in Turkey. Eaton's product portfolio fits the marine industry's requirements extremely well. We offer various types of products such as CCTV systems, UPS backup power, and circuit protection products. The niche shipbuilding industry in Turkey has grown considerably in recent years, and we have expanded with the sector. As a result, we work with shipbuilders that are building commercial fishing boats, ferries, and tugs. We work with all segments of the marine industry, and it is one of the key sectors we are focusing on.</p><p><strong>How has Eaton's diversified business helped ease the burden of last year's economic slowdown?<br></strong>This is definitely a strength of ours and an advantage in terms of our competitiveness. Eaton's wide portfolio has allowed us to approach other sectors as some have slowed down and others have grown. Moreover, we are fairly active in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) industry, which is more resilient than purely domestic-focused companies. Our OEM customers in Turkey export their machinery to Europe and other regions. We saw great advantages working with our OEM customers; export business has continued to support the wider Turkish economy and our business.</p><p><strong>Can you break down Eaton's annual revenue in Turkey between products and services?<br></strong>Our service-related revenue is around 10% of our total revenue. However, our service business is an important growth factor for us. We sell many products, and most of them require servicing. If one has a proper service organization, they can also bring a great deal of added value to their customers, generate additional revenue, and enable their customers to use their products more efficiently, reliably, and for a longer period of time. Our strong service offering is an important driver of growth for us, and we made investments in 2019 to capture more of the service market. We are strengthening our service organization and increasing our staff numbers. The cost of ownership is important to a business—companies should consider not just the cost of buying a product, but also the cost of running it. To use a product efficiently, one needs regular maintenance—preventative maintenance is key. In the past, the industrial sector had a reactive service approach. Today, new technologies allow businesses to monitor the operations and condition of its equipment and determine if maintenance is required before a product fails. This prevents costlier fixes for failed pieces of equipment and money lost from stopping production. Even if the cost of fixing the product is minimal, stopping production is always costly. We call this a proactive service approach.</p><p><strong>What are your investment plans and primary objectives for the next 12 months?<br></strong>We have already started to improve Ulusoy Elektrik's product portfolio. We plan to use our international resources to expand our product portfolio over the next 12 months. We will also increase the diversity of Ulusoy Elektrik's product portfolio. It is particularly focusing on construction, industry and the marine segments in Turkey right now, and we  will continue to target these in 2020. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Üntel Kablo is well diversified across a number of cable subsectors. Could you break down your revenue stream by sector and identify from which sectors you expect to see the most growth in the near future?<br></strong>In 2018, more than 30% of our revenue came from the mining industry, a quarter from the marine and offshore industry, more than 10% from industrial and instrumentation cables, and around 15% each from railways and airports. In the future, we are expecting the most growth from the mining industry. We are preparing for this by investing in our mining capabilities and increasing our certifications for the sector—we are now working for new market certifications in for different countries around the world. Having these new certifications for the mining industry will make the sector more exciting in terms of revenue and budget, both of which we expect to grow in the coming years. Relatedly, another area where we want to expand is crane cables, where many of the cable types are similar to the mining sector.  </p><p><strong>What capabilities does Üntel have in the marine sector, and in which marine subsectors are you seeing the most growth?<br></strong>Üntel is a well-known brand of marine cables globally. With our high-quality products, know-how, and experience in marine cables, we had the opportunity to serve the shipbuilding and offshore industries in leading maritime countries such as Norway and the Netherlands. One of our most important projects in the marine sector was the national warship project, which is an amphibious assault ship called the TCG Anadolu. This ship was built by Sedef Shipyard, and we produced the cables for it. This was a prestigious project and is one example of our work with all the major Turkish shipyards for naval and commercial vessels. </p><p><strong>Approximately what percentage of your annual turnover comes from exports, and which countries are most important for your sales?</strong><br>Currently around 65% of our sales can be attributed to exports. We export to 70 countries across six continents. Germany, Netherlands, and the UK are the large buyers right now. We are nearly everywhere internationally, but we are positioned in different ways depending on the region. We prefer to work directly both with the end users and the big wholesalers in Europe, the UAE, and India. We have exclusive agreements with wholesalers.</p><p><strong>What strategies have you implemented to minimize supply chain interruptions?<br></strong>Europe is our main provider of raw materials, especially Italy. Most of our compounds have been imported from Italy for 15-20 years. We also import from Asia. We are always in search of new suppliers with better quality and more competitive prices. Our suppliers, like our customers, are our friends. We have worked with them for many years. Üntel is a company that does not change suppliers just to get a slightly better price. We check for new technologies and products every day with our R&amp;D team, but we do not change suppliers often. </p><p><strong>One of Üntel's most recent major projects was the new Istanbul Airport. How do you expect this experience to benefit the company?<br></strong>We have served the industry for around 15-20 years with airport ground lighting. Üntel has certifications from all the major airport markets, including the US, Russia, and Europe. We supply our cables for nearly every airport in Turkey, including cables for new airport constructions as well as repairs. The new Istanbul Airport was a huge project. The competition was obviously really tough. Many producers around the world tried to get that project. As a domestic producer, with domestic product certification, we had an advantage. For the first phase of the airport, we delivered around 5 million meters of ground lighting cables. This was a prestigious project that boosted the Üntel brand all around the world. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How have Bell's operations changed over the years, and where have you had the most success? <br></strong>As of today, Bell Holding is mostly a consumer packaging group. The holding controls seven operating companies, which are based on state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, high product quality, and service. We produce plastic packaging and aluminum packaging materials. In terms of plastic packaging, we produce items such as bottles, caps and closures, as well as IML tubs and lids; our aluminum products line largely comprises collapsible tubes and aerosol cans. At the end of the day, what drives our business are the industries we service. We produce the packaging that brand owners turn into consumer products. The sectors we service are mostly FMCGs, personal care, home care, pharmaceuticals, food, and industry. We try to establish long-term relationships with our customers, because most of our production is tailor-made, premium packaging material. The companies we work with are mostly blue-chip companies, both multinational and local, which is obviously a good place to be. They value not only our operational excellence but our business agility, entrepreneurial ability and breadth of packaging formats to deliver packaging solutions in a fairly volatile and growing regional market.</p><p><strong>What aspects of Turkey's economy and demographics drive Bell's business?<br></strong>The fundamentals of Turkey are positive, in particular for a company like ours. The economy is structured to support export activities and has clearly had significant investment in improving infrastructure. In recent years, Turkey has been experiencing high urbanization and birth rates. </p><p><strong>In which of your four main product segments—personal care, home care, pharmaceuticals, and food—are you seeing the most revenue growth?</strong><br>Since the EU-Turkey Customs Union went into effect, there has been significant growth in imported products as well as the development of larger factories to service a wider geography. There have, of course, been winners and losers but, overall, this treaty has greatly boosted trade and consumer choice. While the effects have shifted over time, the one sector that has been the most resilient is food. That is certainly a sector that has seen growth for us. The sector requires a certain number of additional safety measures. There are some non-tariff barriers to import, such as tastes, which change from country to country. Apart from that, all of our segments have developed considerably, but not always for the same reasons. Looking at pharmaceuticals, for example, 20 years ago the state was covering only half of the population's needs. Now the entire population is covered. That has given a boost to the domestic pharma sector. If there is one sector that is underdeveloped, it is cosmetics. In Turkey, cosmetics consumption is still low, and many products are still being imported. It is an area that we are not necessarily geared to service, but the sector needs to grow.</p><p><strong>What are your objectives and investment plans for the medium term?<br></strong>Our plans are usually set over a four-year period. We have been unlucky with a volatile lira, but we consider this to be short-term. It does not necessarily affect our long-term plans. We have a big investment project where we are set to start building a new factory in Turkey. Most of our tube and aerosol can production takes place in central Istanbul. That is not sustainable because we have reached the physical limit of growth. Therefore, we bought an 80,000sqm plot of land in Thrace where we will build a 40,000-sqm factory and gradually move all this production, while at the same time increasing capacity. Strategically speaking, we are developing our regional production footprint, looking at opportunities to either partner with other players or set up in the EU and other countries. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Sentez Grup was originally founded to serve the packaging needs of Selçuklu Holding, but later developed into a global packaging producer. Can you outline the most important steps along Sentez Grup's timeline?<br></strong>The purpose of Sentez Grup's establishment in 1992 was to manufacture boxes for pharmaceutical companies. Later, when Mehtap Kitchenware joined the holding, we started manufacturing boxes for housewares as well. Realizing that it is a promising market, we decided to increase our packaging production using our experience in the pharmaceutical sector. We also expanded through our subsequent acquisitions of Gül Offset and Naturel Packaging, two of the leading packaging companies in Turkey. We held three facilities, employing roughly 550 people. In order to benefit from the shared competencies of these structures, we decided to gather these three facilities under a single roof in 2011. Since 2014, we have been operating in our current Dilovası facility, which has 55,000sqm of indoor area. Our operations here are an example of an industrial profile that is rarely seen around Turkey or even the world. The logic underlying our establishment is to be able to produce any kind of packaging the customer may demand.</p><p><strong>How has the growth of the food sector driven Sentez Grup's expansion and helped shape its product offering? <br></strong>The increase in the volume of our business and the packaging industry could only have been possible with the growth of the food sector. Today, we hold a global market share of around 1%, which is fairly large considering the size of the market. We constantly develop and produce various products ranging from inner and outer packages to flexible packages in order to fulfill all the packaging needs of our customers, which are mainly in the FMCG sector. We target a balanced growth in these packaging groups within the framework of our customers' demands. Since our establishment commenced its operations with cardboard packaging, our production volume in this group is larger than the flexible packaging group. Currently, 25% of our packaging is flexible and 75% is cardboard. We are one of the three-largest cardboard packaging producers in Turkey. We continue our efforts to balance our flexible package production and cardboard package production. </p><p><strong>What percentage of Sentez Grup's overall revenue comes from exports, and in what markets are you working to expand your global market share?</strong><br>Our current export rate is around 25%. However, we plan to increase that figure in the near future. In the short term, we are working toward the goal of attaining a rate of 35%, and then reach a balanced export rate of 50%. We primarily export to European countries and neighboring countries of Turkey, though we want to have a more diversified export base. To achieve this, we have recently begun cooperating with an American firm that has facilities at various different regions of US. The trading volume of the packaging industry is much higher in the US, so it is our most important target market in the first phase. There is also a huge trading volume with our southern neighbors as well. Iraq is a major market for us, but the political situation there affects the business tremendously. Likewise, Syria has the same problem. If everything goes smoothly in global politics, that would be a huge benefit to Turkey's exports. Looking to Europe right now, we are primarily engaged with northern Europe. We also aim to expand to central European countries.</p><p><strong>What challenges do you face in the sourcing of raw materials?<br></strong>Our pricing is mostly based in euros in our domestic sales and exports. Sometimes our suppliers can give their prices in dollars. The fluctuations in USD/EUR parity may cause problems in our costs time to time. This is not an operational issue related to the supply chain. However, we do have alternative suppliers that can offer pricing in both currencies, though such supplier shifts do not always occur easily. Our top priority is always maintaining quality. A few years ago, the Chinese government shut down many cardboard facilities due to environmental concerns, and this had a huge impact on world trade. Aside from the increase in paper prices, firms were forced to find alternative suppliers. The recent trade dispute between US and China and the restructuring of global trade have caused producers to act much more carefully and sensitively. </p><p><strong>Over the short term, what are Sentez Grup's investment plans and primary objectives?<br></strong>We do not plan to make a huge investment especially in machinery and facility in the near future since we have arrived at this stage with continuous investments. We recently signed a subscription contract worth of EUR6.5 million with Heidelberg, a leading company in offset printing technology, and can now produce what we used to produce with four machines using only two machines. We have a capacity that will fulfill our mid- and long-term targets. We have been working on a project for seven years to develop our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and are working with a Portuguese company to achieve that upgrade. Currently, all our ERP modules are integrated with each other. However, the project requires a second step, which we started in 2018. We have an intense schedule to complete this upgrade within the next 18 months. We call it the “Completion Project," as it will finalize all the other projects we have done so far within the scope of Industry 4.0. It is a structure that enables the control and tracking of all processes within our facility. We can currently do it with a 60% flow rate, and this project will increase that to 100%. Moving forward, we will emphasize increasing efficiency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Kanık Group of Companies serves a variety of sectors through its three subsidiaries: Özka Lastik, İlka Plastik, and IRC Automotive. What major competencies do these companies share?</strong><br>Kanık Group and its subsidiaries manufacture based on a fully domestic capital model. All of our subsidiaries are large exporters to the world's major markets. We also create our technological infrastructure ourselves and produce our own machinery in-house by Turkish engineers and workers in our R&amp;D units, without having to import. Looking to our three subsidiary companies, there are obvious common features between IRC and Özka—IRC is in the automotive sector and Özka is in the tire sector, an automotive sub-industry. Also, Özka provides some raw materials to IRC. Second, there are major competencies between tires and plastic—the sector where Ilka operates. Plastic factories produce some of the mid-products used in production of tires. All three have connections to each other.</p><p><strong>Could you break down Özka Lastik's revenue by sector and where you expect to see demand growth in the near future?</strong><br>Özka Lastik manufactures tires in the fields of agriculture, construction, logistics, and defence with a daily capacity of 130 tons in the categories of garden/field, trailer, tractor, combine harvester, construction machine, forklift, pickup/van, and military vehicle tires. Whereas 72% of our annual turnover is from the agricultural group and 25% is from the industrial group, the group that produces pickup and van tires constitutes the 2% and the defense industry 1% of our annual turnover. In the agricultural and industrial group, radial tires constitute the 25% of our total turnover, while the conventional tires constitute 75%. According to the market research we have carried out, we have found out that the agricultural tire market we are involved in has a market share of 60%; the industrial tire market has 33%; and other OTR tire market has 7%. It is projected that these shares will be stable in the near future. However, in the near future, a growth in the radial tire production is anticipated both in agricultural and industrial tire groups, mainly in European countries and all around the world. We also aim to increase our work on the defense and aerospace industries in the future. They are difficult sectors to work in, but they are areas where we have capabilities and would like to expand.</p><p><strong>IRC Automotive exports 90% of its products. What hedging strategies do you employ to shield the company from an individual market's auto sales slowdown?</strong><br>Although the vehicle sales are stable in the current business cycle, a decrease in sales are anticipated in the long term. That is a factor that will cause economic stagnation. One of the ways to cope with such a global effect is to diversify the market strategy as much as possible. Today, more than 90% of our total sales are from exports. We have a system that watches and monitors world markets in our sector constantly. As a result, we have diversified our markets.  </p><p><strong>What are your plans and primary objectives over the next 12 months?<br></strong>Our goal for Özka Lastik is to increase our market share in the markets we are involved in and to enter new markets such as Latin America. By continuing with our success from 2018, in which our exports grew by 440%, in 2019 we plan to reach our goal of a turnover of TRY681 million. With our new investment that will be completed by 2020, our daily production capacity of 130 tons will be increased by 55%. By being able to produce 200 tons a day, we will be able to meet the needs in current and new markets. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Belgin Oil exports to around 50 countries around the world. What are your most important export markets, and in which regions are you hoping to expand?<br></strong>Due to Turkey's location in the middle of Asia and Europe, around 40% of our exports go to Middle Eastern countries, 30% to Africa, 20% to Europe and the rest for the Americas and other countries. We are growing in Asia, which is one of our main goals. In Asia, we are planning to enter with all of our product lines, but most importantly with our automotive and metal working oils. In China, in particular, we want to enter with automotive oil, whereas India is a prospective market for industrial lubricants. We are equally distributed between industrial oils and automotive oils. </p><p><strong>How does Belgin's JV in Germany support exports in the European region?<br></strong>This small JV is a standalone entity manufacturing highly niche products for automotive industry. But, before that, we are continuously checking Western European companies, especially in German-speaking countries, to find an opportunity to form a JV or acquire a company. It is not easy to find a suitable company to form a JV. </p><p><strong>Can you tell me how the strategy to market and export metal working oils and automotive oils differs?<br></strong>For metal working oils, you need to understand customers' processes very well, define the needs clearly, and work to develop the business because entering a market is not easy. It requires a lot of trials, approvals, and certificates, for example. But once you are successful, it is a long-term business. Automotive oil, meanwhile, is not that difficult. It is quicker to form relations. The marketing and sales activities are easier to do. </p><p><strong>Given the difficulty of the segment, how is Belgin working to penetrate new markets in the Middle East for industrial and metal working oil? </strong><br>The key is finding the right channel or the right business partner. We work mainly through distributors who have experience in the sector, certain financial strength, and strong relationships in the relevant industries. Once we find such a business partner, we discuss and design short-term and long-term strategies together. <br> <br><strong>What are the main challenges Belgin faces in its global supply chain? <br></strong>We have suppliers in and outside of Turkey. One of the main challenges for not only our company but almost all the companies in the sector is establishing long-term agreements and reliable relationships with suppliers. Another important challenge is digitalization, including automation in production and the use of big data. Our company has a large customer portfolio, exceeding 3,000 industrial companies, and we have regular, ongoing business relationships with at least 50% of those. Therefore, we have a huge data base and a lot of information to manage effectively. Another important component is connectivity with clients. In brief, in the whole supply chain process, we have a digital transformation challenge that we have already included in our investment plans. </p><p><strong>Within the R&amp;D field, what investments have you made, and how have they yielded new products for Belgin?<br></strong>Our company's vision statement declares: “We strongly aim to grow beyond borders through high technology products." This is how we plan to proceed. We have highly knowledgeable and experienced experts in R&amp;D, and we are hiring new ones. We have invested heavily in R&amp;D over the last two decades. In 2018, we acquired official R&amp;D Center Certification from the Ministry of Industry and Technology so that our R&amp;D and innovation activities will benefit from the governmental incentives. R&amp;D is one of our main strengths, and we want to add more competencies on top of this. Every year, we are launching new, value-added products for several industries such as tubes and pipes, defense, automotive, aerospace, home appliances, aluminum, iron, and steel. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[tissue-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Lila Group was established in the mid-2000s as its parent company's investment into the tissue sector. How did the tissue sector fit into the larger company's competencies, and why did you choose to invest in this area?</strong><br>Before entering the tissue business, we started in the textile business in Gaziantep, where we have more than 250 years of history in textiles. At the beginning of 1980s, we relocated to Istanbul. We were one of the five largest textile companies in Turkey but wanted to diversify and began looking for opportunities in different industries. We decided on the tissue sector because the paper industry is a big industry, and the tissue sub-sector is one of the fastest growing parts of it. The tissue industry's growth follows demographic and economic trends—as long as the GDP and population of a country is growing, tissue consumption will increase. In the tissue industry, there are two main production components—the paper mill and spinning mill. We are a fully integrated tissue company. That is why we invested in both. When we started our tissue business in 2005, we constructed greenfield paper mill facilities in 2006 and made our second machine investment in 2012. On the spinning side, we started our first converting facilities in 2008 and expanded our converting capacity again in 2010 and 2015. Our production capacity is currently 150,000 tons per annum. We are also investing in the third tissue machine.</p><p><strong>How does your sales strategy differ in Turkey versus internationally?<br></strong>We are a major player in the Turkish market. Within the FMCG sector, we distribute all our products to every city of Turkey and at every sales point similar to multinationals in Turkey. Internationally, we compete with all of the major multinational FMCG companies. We export about 75% of our production, and about 70% of our revenue comes from the export business. Today, we export to 78 different countries. Internationally, we export to many converters, who buy our paper product and convert it to tissue to meet the needs of their specific end users. We are competitive internationally because every customer is extremely important to us, big or small, and we serve them all with the same attitude and in the same manner. </p><p><strong>What market conditions in the US led to your entry and growth in the market?<br></strong>The US is a large country, and the demand in the US is extremely important for us. Mills in the US are mostly from the 1970s and 1980s and are outdated compared to the technology we use in our mills. These market conditions are some of the important aspects to our expected growth in US market share.</p><p><strong>As a fully integrated tissue company, you compete in two separate—but related—industries. How does your operating strategy differ for each?</strong><br>Looking at the two divisions—fully integrated versus converters—fully integrated companies hold about 85% of the global market share, while the remaining 15% is held by independent converters. </p><p><strong>How does Lila Group's investment timeline differ from its multinational competitors?<br></strong>For tissue production investments, multinationals make their decisions based on a period of five years. We make our decisions and react much faster than multinationals. Our investment period is about 2.5 years. Our third machine investment decision was made at the end of 2017, and we expect to have the machine running by the end of 2019 or early 2020. That will be a 50% capacity increase, which means another 75,000 tons per annum. At the same time, we are increasing our converting capacity. Today, our converting capacity is 100,000 tons per annum, and we will increase it to 120,000 tons. With the new capacities, we will serve the existing regions that we are selling today, though there are at least another 120 countries that we have not reached yet. Our target is to reach other 25-30 of those. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Kopaş is a market leader across its brands, which are found in four main market categories. What drives Kopaş' considerable growth?<br></strong>We doubled our turnover in the past three years. We plan to do it again in the next three. We have four main categories and four main brands, the biggest being baby care, Dalin. Dalin has 45% market share in this category, whereas the second player only has 21% market share. The category is growing by double digits, and Dalin helps drive growth in the category, which is supported by strong population growth and other positive demographic trends in other consumer businesses in Turkey. We are growing our market share within the category by increasing penetration and improving customer perception of our products. The second-biggest category is hair removal products. Its market size is bigger than baby care products for toiletries. Our Sesu depilatory product is the number-one selling item in its specific category, where we have 24% market share. In that category, demographics and penetration do not drive our growth. Instead, it is about introducing new products. The third pillar is perfumes and deodorants. Our brand is XO in that specific category. We did a re-launch in August 2018 and more than doubled our market share in only five months. It has been extremely successful for us, though this category is highly fragmented. The fourth category is hair colorants. Our products are being sold in the professional channel, namely to hairdressers. </p><p><strong>Kopaş also has two additional business lines: a distribution services portfolio and contract products. How much do each of these contribute to Kopaş' turnover?</strong><br>The distribution services portfolio business line provides distribution services to multinational companies seeking to enter the Turkish market without establishing their own sales and marketing operations. We provide distribution services only if we believe in and feel these are complementary to our own branded portfolio. This business line is relatively new—we are halfway through it, and in the past two years, we have introduced five brands to the market.</p><p><strong>Looking to Kopaş' exports, where do you expect to see growth, and what new markets do you want to penetrate right now?<br></strong>In overall consolidated sales, our export figures account for less than 10%, though our plan is to increase that figure to 40% in five years. In the most recent strategic plan, we determined three business units based on geographies. The first is called Turca, which is Turkey and Central Asia. The second geographical category is EMEA, namely Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa as a whole, but particularly sub-Saharan (Nigeria and Kenya). We are in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya already and will be in Algeria soon. We hope to be in Morocco in 2019 as well. For 2020, the big target is Nigeria and Kenya. The third geographic unit is APAC, which stands for Asia Pacific. We are currently in Malaysia and will soon be in Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines. We selected these regions because they have the youngest populations in the world combined with generally high GDP growth rates.</p><p><strong>From an investment standpoint, what are your biggest plans over the next two to three years?<br></strong>Over the next two to three years, we will expand our logistics and warehousing infrastructure because our existing production capacity is good enough. Abroad, there are plans to start local manufacturing, one in Africa and one in Southeast Asia. Turkey has a free trade agreement with some of these countries like Malaysia and Morocco. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why has Atmaca chosen to focus its future strategy around TVs?<br></strong>For the past 40 years, we have been in the consumer electronics sector. We have a good understanding of consumer needs. Atmaca Group has made many different kinds of electronics, but today it is specialized in the TV segment. A TV is no longer just a TV. Now, it is capable of many things, much like how smartphones have become extremely versatile devices. We feel fortunate as a company to offer something that people need. We are in a highly competitive market and are focused on staying ahead of the competition.</p><p><strong>What role does R&amp;D play in Atmaca's development of smart TVs?<br></strong>Technology is getting cheaper every day and, in a few years, a smart TV will be a basic item. Our advantage is that we have our own R&amp;D center, with around 40 engineers. There are 900 R&amp;D centers in Turkey, and we are one of them. We do all types of designs, namely hardware, software, industrial, and mechanical. From the idea to the product, it is all done in-house. This gives us a great opportunity to cooperate with technology providers. We can easily develop the most up-to-date solutions and get them to the TV. We follow the latest trends and needs.</p><p><strong>Atmaca is one of the largest Turkish exporters of electronics. What are the regions where you are most focused on expanding sales?</strong><br>Most of our exports go to Eastern Europe. Our export business has been going well, especially since 2018. In 2017, around 5-7% of our revenue came from exports, but in 2018 it rose to 17%. In 2019, we hope it will be more than 25%. Exports are thus rapidly increasing. The main reason for this is that our quantities are increasing, which is giving us an edge on the competition.</p><p><strong>How does the company account for tariffs when looking at potential markets?<br></strong>There are high customs taxes for some countries. In those cases, the best approach is to find a partner or invest in a plant. It is easy, in theory, but not so much in practice. Entering a market by investing in a plant is not a simple decision to make. We tried to start a facility in Egypt, but scrapped these plans in 2014. </p><p><strong>What investments have you been making in more efficient means of production?<br></strong>We have an excellent maintenance and development department in our factory. We design and produce the majority of our products. We are also producing our own robots for our production lines and transportation. We have a great team focused on efficient production. There are ways to increase production, but it is important to make it ourselves, because we know our needs better than anyone else. When we design a TV, we are not only trying to make the best TV for the consumer, but one that is also most efficient to produce. </p><p><strong>What are your goals and objectives for the year ahead?<br></strong>We are trying to prepare our 8K TVs. That technology is on its way. The market is moving and we are following it. Success comes if you can follow the market and its demands. We are trying to apply the latest technology to the screen as soon as possible. We want to launch these products in 2019. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How difficult has the development and market introduction been for Vestel's smartphone business?<br></strong>The initial development was fairly difficult, though the process was aided by our experience producing television sets, smart appliances, and other devices that require processors. We invested a great deal in the R&amp;D and production side. However, because it is a personalized item, design is extremely important. We had to develop the latest technologies in design. The introduction to market was smooth for us, as we were able to work with all of the big operators in Turkey—Turkcell, Vodafone, and Türk Telekom. Soon after release, we reached almost 10% market share, though there is now a huge influx of Chinese-made mobile phones that has reduced our market share to around 7%. Chinese mobile phone manufacturers benefit from their economies of scale and offer attractive prices. To compete with the Chinese mobile phones, as well as major players such as Samsung and Apple, we are now expanding our range and offering high-end models, entry-level models, and mid-level model phones. Our goal is to reach 20% market share in Turkey, which will allow us to benefit from the economies of scale that other large manufacturers enjoy. Once we reach that scale, we can start to export on a larger scale. Broadly speaking, having a smartphone business significantly boosts Vestel's image as a high-tech company. Our smartphones are the only fully locally designed and produced phones on the market.</p><p><strong>How will Vestel's partnership with Google to produce Android TVs be received by the market?<br></strong>We recently signed an agreement with Google to produce Android TVs, which fits in well with our broader technology strategy. For our mobile phones, we are using the same Android platform that will be used in our Android TVs. This makes production easier for us; for customers, it means if they have an Android-based mobile phone, tablet, or computer, there will be interactivity between the TV and their device. </p><p><strong>How has the lira's depreciation affected Vestel's business?<br></strong>Domestic consumption for almost every category of our products has fallen because of the depreciation of the lira. However, it helped our exports, because a great deal of the costs in our operations is in lira. A strong lira is not good for exports, and the devaluation helped all exporters, including Vestel. The depreciation is one reason why we were able to increase our exports in 2018 and turn a solid profit. We were able to significantly increase our overall combined profit in 2018, which is reflected in our share price, which saw a 100% increase after the release of our financials.</p><p><strong>How is Vestel investing to expand in software and other high-growth sectors?<br></strong>We want to position Vestel as a technology company rather than a manufacturer of appliances or consumer electronics. That is why we are increasing our investments in R&amp;D. We have 1,600 engineers and will increase that to a minimum of 2,000. We are investing significantly in the software side, rather than hardware and manufacturing, because software allows us to increase our value-added projects. We will continue to grow our consumer electronics and white goods manufacturing and sales, though currently our emphasis is on growing our technology projects. A result of this emphasis can be seen in our investments in the automotive and healthcare industries. We recently established a company that will penetrate the automotive electronics parts market, most notably with electric car chargers. We have installed many of these already in Turkey and abroad. We are working to expand our exports to high-growth electric car markets. We are also investing significantly to improve the connectivity of medical systems. We have extensive experience with connected devices, and these digital and connected services create new areas to offer our services and devices—such as in the health and automotive industries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>While Temsa is broadly known as a bus manufacturer, it is working toward being known as a technology company. How does this change Temsa's corporate and operational strategy?</strong><br>Temsa took action long ago to prepare for technological advancements and completed the necessary R&amp;D work, and our electric vehicles are now ready for serial production. Turkey's first 100% electrically powered buses are produced by Temsa. We are indeed evolving into a technology company with the advent of new technologies. In addition to value- added production in our bus and midibus business, we also generate solutions tailored to the needs of our customers and offer new automotive technologies developed by Turkish engineers. All our investment plans for the near future are shaped around the smart mobility vision that defines the future of the automotive industry. We allocate approximately 5% of our annual revenues on R&amp;D activities. In addition to our leading position and experience in manufacturing electric vehicles, we also have the capability to create new segments based on the needs of domestic and international markets. We combine all of these with price advantages and advanced technologies. We already predict the transformation that the transportation and shipping industry will experience and work toward meeting our customers' future needs.</p><p><strong>Beyond electric and autonomous buses, what other important technologies is Temsa currently working on?<br></strong>Temsa continues to offer products with high technology for various segments. We strive to bring customers the most useful solutions. Across multiple segments, we are setting new standards for safety, ergonomics, and energy savings and helping every passenger safely reach their destination each day. Temsa is working on energy storage systems for buses. We are developing a new battery management system for these energy packages. We are able to build our own battery packs with our own battery management software, and this system will be ready by 2020. Another project is telemetry hardware for all transportation vehicles. We are working together with STM on Fleetics fleet management system. This system delivers vehicle data to the Amazon cloud system, allowing customers or manufacturers to track the information of the vehicle via STM's graphical user interface.</p><p><strong>Temsa has a strong market presence in 70 markets. From which regions do most of its revenues come?<br></strong>Temsa offers its broad product range to Turkey as well as the world's leading markets. As of 2019, we have exported over 12,000 vehicles to 66 countries. Today, there are 5,000 Temsa branded buses on the roads of France alone. In addition to France, Germany, the UK, and Italy are among our major markets, and we are increasing our market share in the US rapidly as well. A strong sales and service network development is the key to success in our business. We have opened Temsa North America (TNA). By establishing a more direct relationship with our North American operators, we are setting a customer-centric foundation for major growth in the years ahead. We aim to quickly increase our market share in the US. Our first electric bus in the coach segment will be on American roads within a short time. Our biggest priority in the near future will be to grow our presence in the US and increase our market share through TNA. We will also continue strengthening our position and taking a larger market share in Europe, especially France, Italy, the UK, and Germany, which are priority export markets for us.</p><p><strong>What are Temsa's plans and primary objectives for the next 12 months?<br></strong>Our investments in R&amp;D, technology, and innovation will continue at full speed in 2019. The digital transformation that started within the organization will also proceed with further actions. Our organizational structuring will also expand in export markets. Our priority will be growing through value- added exports in the months and years ahead. The focus of our work will be more environment friendly, green, and next-generation technologies, and particularly electric and autonomous vehicles. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Nurol Holding diversified its operations over the past decade?<br></strong>Since its creation, Nurol Holding's diversification has followed Turkey's economic growth, though we have adopted a more strategic mode of planning further diversification, as evidenced in our defense sector investments. Nurol started its involvement in the defense sector in 1989 through a JV with a US defense company then known as FMC, which has since been acquired by BAE, which remains our partner. At the time, the Turkish armed forces wanted to develop a fleet of armored personnel carriers called the M113, which FMC agreed to produce in Turkey with Nurol. That partnership eventually became known as FNSS, of which Nurol is currently a 51% shareholder, with BAE holding the remaining 49%. That project was extremely profitable, and at that time Turkey was starting to push growing the indigenous defense industry to the top of the national agenda, so we began to further expand our presence in the sector. First, we set up another 100% Nurol subsidiary, Nurol Makina (Nurol Machinery) to create components for FNSS. In time, Nurol Machinery started its own R&amp;D and began producing its own vehicles as well.</p><p><strong>Outside of vehicles, how is Nurol further involved in the defense sector?<br></strong>Turkey has been and remains a major purchaser of international defense products, but it has long been growing its indigenous industry to maximize local content, including armor. Before we decided to enter the armor sector, we invested around USD100 million into R&amp;D to design and produce armor around 60% lighter than traditional steel armor. It is chiefly used in body armor, but it has also been a big success when used in armored and civilian vehicles. Only the US, China, and Germany have this technology, and we have been able to sell it so far to 27 countries. Those three companies make up the majority of our defense business, but we are also beginning to work in the aerospace industry. Turkey has begun a program to build its own indigenous fighter jet program. The government has mandated that the jet be as locally produced as possible, which will further develop the broader aerospace industry in Turkey. We have set up a subsidiary here to design software for the flight, fuel, and landing management systems that can go into that aircraft. The subsidiary, BNA, is a JV with BAE, which has been operational now for two years.</p><p><strong>What is the status of your precious mineral mining operations?<br></strong>Our gold mine in Lapseki is already operational and produces between 5,000 and 6,000 ounces of gold per month. This is the first mine in Turkey that entirely abides by international standards, and the project financing is from a consortium of banks including EBRD, which has strict environmental and social impact policies. Our second gold mine is in Ivrindi and is expected to produce around 10,000 ounces of gold per month once operational. For our mining operations, our production costs—including financing costs—are at about USD550 per ounce, so at today's gold prices that equates to a minimum 55% EBITDA margin, which is excellent. The 2018 turnover with only six months of operations of the smaller facility was TRY305 million, and it will rise to over TRY1 billion this year. The mining share of the total business turnover in 2018 was only 4% and will rise to 9% in 2019 and 14% in 2020. This is while defense business sales are exponentially growing, so we can see the impact of the mine business on total turnover.</p><p><strong>Over the next 12 months, what are your top operational objectives?<br></strong>For 2019, one of our key objectives is to open the second mine facility, which hopefully will be just as successful as the first. Our biggest challenge in 2020 will be to make sure that the second mine performs as well as the first. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[inorganic-expansion]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ak-Kim has recently diversified its business through the acquisitions of Gizem Frit, Dinox, and Mega Color. What motivated these three acquisitions?</strong><br>In January 2015, we acquired Gizem Frit, a completely separate business from what we do at Ak-Kim. Gizem Frit is successful in the high-performance coating field. It is the most important player in the Turkish market, with 70% market share. Globally, it is among the top-three companies in the field. About 60% of its products are exported, which is important for Ak-Kim because we were previously low on exports. Dinox is a chemical distribution company based in Dortmund, Germany. It was more of an integration for us to get closer to the customer and create new opportunities. It was a natural expansion for us. Finally, through Gizem Frit, we acquired Mega Color in 2017. It is located in Castellón, Spain, one of the largest areas for ceramic production in the world. The ceramic industry is now using jet printing technology, making this acquisition complementary to our product range. Mega Color has two subsidiaries, one in China, and one in Mexico, which are helping improve exports. </p><p><strong>Among Ak-Kim's sectors of involvement, where do you expect to see the most growth in demand in the near future?</strong><br>Our paper products and water treatment segments are growing quickly. We are active in two growing segments in paper: tissue and recycled paper. Looking at growth in water treatment, we see new water treatment plants being developed all around the world. Water stress is coming, and it will get increasingly severe. Another area we are also working heavily on is the composite industry, or products such as carbon fiber. We have a sister company, DowAksa, with which we have a number of R&amp;D projects involving composite chemicals. We have already produced some important products for that company.</p><p><strong>What complementary or entirely new business lines is Ak-Kim developing?</strong><br>We have a few mature and developing business, such as textiles, paper, construction, and water treatment. Each group has about 50-100 different products. Part of the job is to constantly improve these products. We always need new products to complete the product rage and develop new complementary products. These are ongoing, though some projects are more difficult than others. Some could require small tweaks and others could require entirely new innovations. We also have projects in completely new industries or businesses. One of these is plastics. Turkey is a large consumer of plastic products and perhaps ranks third in the world for plastic imports as well as PVC consumption. We are developing these products from scratch. This is a big industry, and we must do something. Most performance additives are imported. Another area is the composite industry, and we have been selling finish oils and such. The chemical business is a long-term business.</p><p><strong>What are your most important expansion plans in the coming three to five years?<br></strong>We are starting an investment in hydrogen peroxide. We are one of two players in Turkey. We had 40,000 tons of capacity and are investing in another 40,000 tons of capacity. Demand for this product is growing globally, and this is one of our important projects. We are also after some inorganic growth initiatives. The target of the company is to make acquisitions, especially in Europe, in the EUR300-400 million range. It could be something with synergies or something new. We have a few targets in mind. We want to acquire one of these assets, combine it with our existing EUR300-million company, and eventually grow to a EUR600-700-million company. We can also attempt an IPO, probably in Europe. This is the big vision for the next three to four years. We need to identify the correct targets and raise the capital over the next year, and then we will work on merging companies and optimizing the business. The acquisition will more than double the size of the company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Breaking down Dow's business into its three main business units—packaging, infrastructure, and coatings—where do you see the most growth potential?</strong><br>The first of Dow's three segments globally is packaging solutions, which as publicly announced, constituted around half the company's net sales in 1Q2019. The next one is industrial intermediaries and infrastructure, which involves polyurethanes and industrial solutions. That accounted for around 31% of revenue. The last one is performance materials and coatings—mostly related to the paint and construction industries—which represented about 21%. When you look at Dow Turkey specifically, we work with a large customer base in all these sectors. The main business operations for Dow Turkey utilize Dow's global sourcing to supply its customers, which constitutes most of its business in Turkey. We also provide solutions through our local manufacturing capacities. Our local manufacturing units include the emulsions that we manufacture for coatings, plastic additives that we produce to modify PVC window frames, and the polyurethane systems where we formulate systems for automotive and appliances, and for insulation for the construction industry. We also operate a 50/50 joint venture with Aksa, called DowAksa, a large-scale, full-service, fully integrated provider of carbon fiber solutions for industrial applications in current and future transportation, infrastructure, and energy markets.</p><p><strong>What balance of exported versus domestically consumed products is Dow Turkey producing?<br></strong>Most of the products we make are domestically consumed or are indirect exports. This is a result of the structure of our products. For example, one of our major markets, coatings, is mostly a domestic market. At the end of the day, most of our coating solutions are liquid, and it is not feasible to transport liquid over long distances, which is why our coating exports are mostly focused on nearby locations. The plastic additives products that we manufacture are easier to transport, as these are granules, and we export to countries in close proximity. Dow Plastic Additives business' contribution to Turkey's exports was recognized by the Istanbul Chemical Products Exporters' Association (İKMİB) in the Plastic Raw Materials category in 2018 with the “Stars of Exports" award. DowAksa produces carbon fiber and various composites for wind energy, wind turbines, and wrap materials for building retrofits. Its exports are mostly generated from the materials produced for wind energy. We signed a USD300-million agreement with Vestas in 2018. We started the exports for Vestas, so that is a major item for us for value-added exports.</p><p><strong>How do your solutions improve energy efficiency?<br></strong>A fair bit of our business is indirectly related to energy efficiency. For example, our polyurethane resins for appliances are all about energy efficiency, so at the end of the day we are making a difference by reducing the amount of energy our products consume. The solutions Dow provides to the appliance industry make it possible to qualify and improve energy efficiency ratings and the performance of the end products. Similarly, DowAksa works with the renewable sectors such as wind energy. Here, we make a substantial difference by manufacturing products that increase the energy efficiency of wind turbines, such as critical parts of the blade.</p><p><strong>Considering the increasingly environmentally conscious habits of consumers, how is Dow working to adapt its products accordingly?</strong><br>A great example is what we do in the packaging market with our Pack Studios concept. The Pack Studios are a global network of packaging experts, equipment, and testing capabilities that provide the right collaborative environment for the development of better packaging. Through Pack Studios, we are able to bring key value chain players together and provide access to the whole packaging value chain in order to define functional and sustainable packaging products that will satisfy current and future consumers. This collaboration is critical to design and deliver the packaging solutions that are both innovative and environmentally friendly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does the slowdown in M&amp;A activity in Turkey fit within the global M&amp;A narrative?<br></strong>Within Turkey, M&amp;A activity has declined from an annual average of around USD25 billion between 2010 and 2015 to less than USD10 billion in the last four years. M&amp;A in 2019 was especially weak; however, with its dynamic private sector, favorable demographics, sizable and growing economy, and geographical advantages, Turkey will continue to be a preferred investment location for multinationals and financial investors. With the risk perception taming, international relations improving, and fundamental reforms underway, M&amp;A deal flow and foreign investment interest will be on the rise again after 2020.</p><p><strong>What global and domestic trends will drive M&amp;A growth in Turkey moving forward?<br></strong>The lira's depreciation has driven down asset prices. As a result, many local companies have become targets for strategic and financial investors as they may be available at lower multiples, and their performances can soar after a transformation. The normalization of Turkey, which has already started, will provide lucrative opportunities for investors who act before prices recover. Outside of this, the ongoing international trade war, specifically between China and the US, stands to benefit Turkish companies and will make acquisitions in the market more attractive. Many companies produce products that can replace Chinese- or US-made products that may be priced out of the market due to tariffs. Many local manufacturing companies have become even more competitive with the weak currency, so acquisitions accompanied by capital investments can make these companies regional champions.</p><p><strong>In which sectors of the economy do you expect to see the most activity?<br></strong>Most of the renewable and thermal power plants that have been built with substantial leverage cannot service their debts. This means many energy assets are available at attractive terms from their owners, as well as creditor banks. The automotive industry will also see a boost if some expected investments by multinational companies are carried out.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about TurkishBank's investments in innovation and your strategy for technology and digital banking?</strong>Turkey has two main advantages in digital banking: its young population and smartphone penetration ratio. Daily banking transactions, like new account opening and money transfers, have already become digital. Now, asset management and investment planning tools are also becoming digital, which will result in lower costs for banks and less commissions to be paid for customers. AI, chatbots, and blockchain technologies are also new areas of improvement for the financial sector. Individual customers can also choose robo-advice tools to manage their portfolios. TurkishBank is aware of this development and is in close contact with fintech companies, which are also becoming important players in the market. Such collaborations with fintechs will enable us to reach more customers without a huge branch network or heavy infrastructure investments. These advancements in technology will also provide banks the ability to reduce costs and allow customers to reduce their fees for banking transactions.</p><p><strong>The Central Bank of Turkey has reduced interest rates twice in recent months. How will this impact TurkishBank's corporate lending strategy?</strong><br>After the last two interest rates meetings, held by the central bank, interest rates have been cut by almost 750 basis points. We expect the central bank to continue with these actions, in line with their monetary policy. Even though these are technical figures in the finance market, they also have an important psychological influence. If customer perception is negative, then they choose not to apply for any loans from banks. A drop in the rates can quickly change this perception to positive for customers and the banks. With borrowing costs expected to fall further in the coming period, credit interest rates should also fall. TurkishBank has always tried to pass along any advantages or discounts from the central bank or funding markets to the benefit of our customers, and this is how we will continue in the future.</p><p><strong>What are the updated figures on TurkishBank's non-performing loan (NPL) ratio, and how are you working through this instability?</strong><br>The NPL ratio of the local banking sector has increased, though it became more of an important issue for the local financial sector to manage this bad loan portfolio. This forced all banks to be more aware of the risks. We are a small-sized bank in the market, so our agility enabled us to react swiftly. We analyzed the market circumstances and sought to be proactive on how we could further help our customers. We are not an active player in the individual loan market and did not see such a negative impact on our individual portfolios. On the corporate side, we had some bad debt to manage. In terms of ratios, we are currently on the sector average, though in comparison to our previous level, our NPL ratio is now higher. Instead of selling any bad debt—which is a common practice in Turkey—we sought to restructure it internally, which is the reason why our ratio is slightly higher.</p><p><strong>What are your objectives and plans for the next 12 months?<br></strong>Firstly, we are working hard on more digitalization in banking services for a better customer journey. Secondly, in Europe especially, the open banking concept is becoming a big trend, though this is not the current situation in Turkey. TurkishBank wants to be part of the open banking trend and has already entered that zone with TurkishBank UK. Another important issue is the strong synergy between TurkishBank and our subsidiary company, Turkish Investment. This improves our financial service and product offers to affluent segment customers in the market. Developing partnerships with fintech companies to fulfill customer needs in a cheaper and easier way compared to traditional banking services and products is another goal for TurkishBank Group. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What major strategic changes has Kuveyt Türk made in recent years to respond to changing customer preferences and market opportunities?</strong><br>Kuveyt Türk has been serving retail and wholesale customers for 30 years and is the largest participation bank in Turkey in terms of asset size. Kuveyt Türk served mostly corporate customers until around 2008, when it expanded its services to retail, commercial, SME, and corporate segments. In 2009, we laid the foundations of digital banking and established a platform-based structure. We have redesigned personalized customer and employee experiences, taking into account the changing expectations of the digital generation. Thus, we aimed to create a culture of work that is transparent, simple, agile, and prominent. This process gave us the opportunity to switch from a product-oriented structure to a customer-oriented structure, from a process-oriented structure to an experience-oriented structure, and from a transaction-centered structure to an interaction-centered structure. In 2015, we expanded internationally by establishing KT Bank AG as our 100% subsidiary in Germany, becoming the first interest-free bank operating in continental Europe.</p><p><strong>How has Kuveyt Türk been impacted by the recent economic instability?<br></strong>2H2018 was an especially difficult period in terms of fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation, but due to the measures taken by the relevant public authorities we entered the normalization process. The efforts of banks to renew their syndicated loans were significantly successful and as a result the economy has stabilized. In this environment, maintaining the asset quality for banks and minimizing the damage in their balance sheets are extremely vital. We are closely following the risks of our customers and strive to keep our non-performing loans (NPLs) at a minimum level. As a result, as of end-2018, the NPL ratio in the banking sector was 3.7%, and we managed to keep this ratio at 2.47%. Through our early prevention and monitoring committee created solely for this purpose, we ensure that our head office and branches are in close contact with each other to take timely actions. The Central Bank's decision in May 2018 to forbid the use of FX-indexed loans was an apt move. It reduced our need for foreign resources as well as the negative effect of exchange rate volatility on the market.</p><p><strong>What are Kuveyt Türk's primary objectives and plans for the next 12 months?<br></strong>In 2019, we plan to maintain the growth we achieved in the last five years. As of end-2019, we plan to reach asset size of over TRY85 billion, which we have exceeded, and a net profit of more than TRY1 billion. Regarding our priorities for 2019 and beyond, we are aiming to focus more on strategic products such as leasing, foreign trade financing, project financing, and consumer financing. In line with all these targets, we aim to be among the best-performing banks in terms of NPL ratios to sustain our asset quality. As the only bank in Turkey with two R&amp;D centers, we place great importance on digital banking. We are selling products produced at Architecht, a technology firm we established in 2015. We positioned Architecht as one of Turkey's leading technology companies, and it has an agreement with Kuwait-based banking software company ITS. We have exported many technologies, such as branch and mobile branch automation systems. The BOA Banking Platform, developed by Kuveyt Türk, will be used by more than 60 banks in more than 20 countries via ITS. At the end of three years, we will export approximately TRY120 million worth of software. Moving forward, this is one of our most important priorities. Another area we are focusing on is personalized banking experience. We will continue our efforts to bring personalized biometric security solutions to our banking processes. In addition, we will create value for technological solutions such as chatbots and audio technologies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How does Vakıf Katılım differentiate itself in a competitive banking sector?<br></strong>We are the only public bank in Turkey that does gold banking. We rank third among 854 institutions active in this market over a period of three years. Therefore, gold banking is our niche. We should consider its different advantages as well, in terms of reserves and such. In gold, the usage area is limited on the credit side. However, we are also the biggest public bank doing the most transactions on the Istanbul Gold Exchange. We are the leader by far in this and are constantly among the top three banks. We carried out gold exports amounting to USD425 million in this period. We do imports as well. We work as a gold correspondent. Gold will make up an important part of our strategies for the coming period. We are thinking about what we can do differently regarding gold banking right now.</p><p><strong>What is Vakıf Katılım's strategy to hedge against the increasing number of non-performing loans (NPL) in the market?<br></strong>We have not been affected as much by NPLs as other banks. We may have chosen our clients well, but our clients are still a part of this economy, so they were impacted. The sector's biggest problem has been companies declaring bankruptcy. Most that did so regretted it, because if they had sat down with banks and talked about it, they would have found refinancing solutions, especially public banks that can provide solution-oriented approaches. NPL rates increased, though they are currently on a level of 4-5%, which is manageable. Even though we acted drastically, this rate came to 2% for us. The Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BDDK), the Central Bank, and the Capital Markets Board (SPK) as well as independent audit companies have all created a structure to deal with NPLs. There is an increase in NPLs across the country, though Turkey's strong banking structure can handle this. Everything is returning to normal currently.</p><p><strong>From which sectors of the economy have you seen the most demand for sharia-compliant financing?<br></strong>We do not have such a sector distinction; however, we do pay attention to this. We are a public bank, and we seek to support the sectors working in parallel with the government's new economic plan. All our products and services are Islamic, though we do not support a sector specifically. There are four important areas for us: companies that export, companies that support employment, companies that provide import substitution, and the manufacturing sector. We provide them special prices and payment terms because these are beneficial for a sustainable economy, and one of Turkey's biggest problems is its current account deficit.</p><p><strong>Participation banks in Turkey want to capture around 15% of the banking sector's assets by 2025. From a regulatory and banking strategy standpoint, what steps need to be taken to reach that goal?<br></strong>In the last 10 years, especially in the participation-banking sector, many important arrangements have been made. However, there have also been challenges. When Bank Asya was in the sector, it had a market share of 35%. After it went defunct, new participation banks opened up immediately to fill the gap. However, that market share has been filled by foreign and conventional banks; participation banks only filled a small portion of that 35%. Still, many new entrants and participation banks have broken the 5% barrier in market share, which is a magic number for us and will improve in the future; it is currently 6%. The role of a public bank is important here. The authorities are helping us overcome our biggest disadvantage, which is a lack of financial products. This is one of the most important problems in comparison to conventional banking, especially for products sold at a personal level. With new legislation and regulations, we will increase our penetration. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How have BoC's operations and strategy in Turkey have changed since the bank began its official operations in 2018?<br></strong><strong></strong>BoC has been present in Turkey since 2011 through a representative office. After the announcement of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, Turkey was defined as an important country by the Chinese government. Looking at the long-term prospective of the Turkish economy, and the improved bilateral relationship between Turkey and China, the bank resolved to invest in Turkey in 2015 to establish an operational agency. BoC Turkey A.Åž., a fully owned subsidiary of BoC Limited, started banking business in Turkey in May 2018. With the start of the subsidiary, the bank plans to increase its credit portfolio in a rapid and healthy manner under a prudential risk management approach. Given the fact that we are still at the beginning phase, we expect a higher annual increase rate in total loan and deposit base on a YoY basis higher than the average level in the local banking industry compared to our peers.<br><br><strong>In 1Q2019, BoC Turkey A.Åž. increased its loan portfolio by over 70%. Broadly speaking, what has 2019 represented thus far for the bank's expansion within Turkey?</strong><br>Since BoC Turkey A.Åž. became operational, BoC has financed more than USD1.1 billion worth of deals within Turkey, demonstrating its commitment to continuous work with local corporate partners. Currently, the bank has adopted a strategy geared toward corporate banking. Its prospective clients include top local corporates, cross-border corporates—especially those with links to China, including their subsidiaries in Turkey—and local financial institutions. In the first year of its operations, BoC Turkey A.Åž. has identified, financed, and facilitated the financing of some eligible large ticket projects in Turkey, particularly in energy, infrastructure, transportation, and banking sectors by utilizing BoC's global network and financial strength.</p><p><strong>Looking at BoC Turkey A.Åž.' corporate lending strategy, can you break down the bank's corporate loan portfolio by sector?<br></strong>Bilateral trade and investment volume between China and Turkey continue to increase. The relationship between China and Turkey has improved in recent years due to great efforts by the two governments. BoC Turkey A.Åž.' main drive is to support the cooperation of trade, investment, and finance between the two countries while contributing to the realization of China's BRI and Turkey's Middle Corridor Plan. The bank has made great efforts to introduce entrepreneurs to the Chinese and Turkish economies to increase bilateral trade volume and do our best to bring more Chinese entrepreneurs and financial institutions to invest in Turkey.</p><p><strong>What BRI projects in Turkey has BoC Turkey funded, and looking forward, what are your goals in Turkey for funding BRI projects?<br></strong>Since the establishment of diplomatic rapport in 1971, Turkey and China have followed a course to develop their political and economic ties. Chinese investments in Turkey have expanded in a wide array of sectors including infrastructure, energy, transportation, telecommunication, technology, and finance. One of the last examples of such investments is the foundation of BoC Turkey A.Åž. in Turkey as part of BoC Group's expanding strategy to finance projects complementary to BRI. Turkey is an important country within this initiative, and China is willing to boost bilateral cooperation in the area of energy, telecommunications, railways, and ports in the countries that are part of BRI. BoC Group banks have funded many projects and Chinese investors under the BRI, in the way of cash and non-cash loans, in Turkey for many years. BoC Turkey A.Åž. will continuously endeavor to identify demand and finance eligible large ticket projects in Turkey, particularly in energy and infrastructure by utilizing BoC's global network and financial strength. We aim to provide financial services that create excellent values for our customers and shareholders and strengthen financial cooperation between Turkey and China. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What initiatives in Turkey has ICBC Turkey funded, and looking forward, what are the bank's goals in Turkey in relation to Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects?</strong><br>BRI upholds the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits. To build the “Belt and Road," ICBC Turkey provided funds to key projects and companies especially in port management such as Kumport (shares are held by Chinese companies), Arkas, and Ceynak. Our bank also provided funds to Turkish Airlines for its operations at the new Istanbul Airport. Moreover, China has become Turkey's third-largest trade partner and second-largest importing country. Turkey is an important market for foreign investments of Chinese public contracting companies. According to the long-term commercial target between the two countries, total trade volume is targeted to exceed USD100 billion in 2020. The integration of the systemic infrastructure between China and Turkey will accelerate trade. The use of cash management products commonly used in ICBC China will also be realized in Turkey.</p><p><strong>Can you break down the bank's lending strategy by sector?<br></strong>As of 3Q2019, ICBC Turkey has TRY9.3 billion cash and non-cash loans in total. Financial institutions—mainly banks but also leasing, factoring, and consumer finance institutions—have the biggest share. They are followed by the energy and real estate sectors. Outside of domestically disbursed loans, ICBC Turkey also became the arranger of about USD2.3 billion in loans from other ICBC subsidiaries to Turkish financial institutions and corporates operating in different sectors such as real estate, construction, aviation, and port management. Moving forward, ICBC Turkey will continue to contribute the development of the Turkish economy by supporting long-term domestic investments through project finance. ICBC Turkey's main strategy is to provide a wide range of services mainly in energy, infrastructure and transportation, real estate, public-private partnership projects, and acquisition financing in order to contribute to the Turkish economy whilst becoming the premier business partner for our customers.</p><p><strong>Why is ICBC Turkey's NPL ratio—around 1.5%—considerably lower than the sector average, and how will this benefit ICBC Turkey moving forward?</strong><br>ICBC is the largest bank in the world and has been operating in Turkey since May 2015 under the name of ICBC Turkey Bank A.Åž. Since its entry to the market, a prudent approach to lending and achieving high asset quality has been ICBC Turkey's priority. In newly established loans, this approach has been instrumental in decision-making. Our teams constantly provide analysis on a macro, sector, and company level. This detailed approach enables us to channel funding into projects and companies that will create the highest value addition.</p><p><strong>Over the next 12 months, what are ICBC Turkey's most important strategic plans?<br></strong>Under BRI, China is committed to promoting open, inclusive, pragmatic, and effective cooperation in third-party markets, so as to help Chinese and foreign enterprises utilize their complementary strengths and achieve a “1+1+1&gt;3" all-win results in which the benefits of three-party cooperation are greater than what the parties can produce separately. Based on consolidating the Turkish market, we will also focus on other credit areas such as Greece, Israel, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Macedonia, focusing on the BRI project, local major financial institutions clients, and Chinese and Turkish companies operating locally. We welcome other Turkish enterprises to develop those markets jointly with us. On the financial side, our bank will employ the following development plan: steady development and continuous improvement of assets, continuous enhancement of profitability and profit structure optimization, and continue to improve asset quality and increase the risk resilience. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you outline the goals of your protocol with Turkish Exporters' Assembly (TİM) in support of Turkish exporters, as well as the details of the bank's involvement?</strong><br>According to this protocol, Turk Eximbank raised TRY256 million in funding from TİM through a three-year, privately placed bond issuance. Turk Eximbank has always provided TRY credits to Turkish exporters at below-market levels. Exporters can qualify for these loans if certain conditions are met. However, amount wise, TRY credits are limited by the bank's shareholder equity. Currently, Turk Eximbank's shareholders' equity is TRY8.5 billion, of which 84% is in the form of paid-up capital. As stated in 11th Development Plan of Turkey, Turk Eximbank's equity will be increased by TRY10 billion during the plan period (2019-2023) as the bank's support increases to 29% of Turkish exports. Turk Eximbank is keen to diversify its lira sources by borrowing from qualified investors in Turkey. Thanks to the funds received from TİM, a new lira credit source has been put into service</p><p><strong>What sectors of the economy has Turk Eximbank identified for growth, and how is the bank working to expand credit to those sectors?</strong><br>In line with the government's strategic objectives, in 1H2019, we implemented a new financial scheme in parallel with the advanced, productive, indigenous industry (İVME) financial package. In this facility, all companies exporting high-technology products are eligible to benefit from more attractive rates and conditions. Turk Eximbank will focus more on the sectors specified in the Ministry of Trade's export master plan. The sectors prioritized in this plan include machinery, automotive, electric and electronics, chemical, and food.</p><p><strong>Another role of Turk Eximbank is to develop new markets for exports. Which markets is Turk Eximbank currently focused on developing and why?</strong><br>Turk Eximbank works closely with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Trade, and the Ministry of Treasury and Finance to determine the target markets in its programs. These institutions have focused much of their efforts on building economic and diplomatic relations with Africa. As a result, as end-2018, Turkish exports to the continent increased by more than 40% in the last 10 years to USD14.5 billion. Turk Eximbank also takes into account the requirements of sustainable lending practices to benefit recipient countries. In this manner, we provided a variety of financing opportunities for large-scale projects undertaken by Turkish contractors in the last five years, especially in the sub-Saharan Africa region, which is considered a strategic market because of its potential. Turk Eximbank is also focused on growing its operations in other regions outside Africa such as Middle East and North Africa, the Balkans, and Central Asia.</p><p><strong>Over the next 12 months, what are Turk Eximbank's most important objectives?</strong><br>As in the case of the export credit agencies of developed countries, the bank will place greater emphasis on medium- and long-term loans, export credit insurance, and guarantee operations. Under international loans program, we aim to expand the geographical distribution of loan agreements to be signed with eligible foreign banks for the purpose of providing financing to the foreign buyers willing to import goods from Turkey on deferred payment terms. Within this context, we plan to sign revolving based loan agreements with foreign banks located in MENA, Eurasia, and the Balkans. In addition, Turk Eximbank will continue to apply favorable foreign exchange interest rates to finance the export of capital goods. Furthermore, the bank places the utmost importance on developing international partnerships with other export credit agencies, international financial institutions, and multinational development banks through agreements in various forms in order to enable competitive financing opportunities. In this framework, through its credit, insurance, and guarantees, the bank aims to finance 27% of Turkey's exports via USD48.4 billion worth of support. This financing support consists of USD29.4 billion in loans and USD19 billion in export credit insurance and guarantees.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the economic slowdown impacted the banking sector?<br></strong>Due to the slowdown in the economy, the banking sector saw slow growth in 2019. Total assets annually grew by 15% in nominal terms as of June 2019 and reached TRY4.2 trillion; however, in dollar terms, total assets fell by 9%. The ratio of loans to GDP was around 64% in mid-2019, while the loan-to-deposits ratio was 57%. TRY loan stock remained almost the same compared to June 2018, while FX loan stock increased by 23%—a 3% decline in USD terms. Commercial loans grew by 11% and individual loans by 1%. Commercial loans accounted for 78% of total loans, while loans to consumers took 22% of the total. SMEs' share of total loans was 25%.</p><p><strong>Why has inflation fallen, and what stabilizing effects has this had on the economy?<br></strong>Inflation started to decline in 2H2019 and is expected to level off around 12% in December, below the target. A slowdown in domestic demand and a rather stable trend in lira value pulled inflation down and had a positive impact on expectations. The government is targeting 8.5% inflation in 2020 and 6% in 2021. Demand for the lira increased in 2Q2019 mainly due to the reverse currency substitution of residents. This allowed the TRY rate against a USD/EUR basket to at about 5.8 in nominal terms, a considerable appreciation of the TRY from 6.6 in April.</p><p><strong>How will the central bank's decision to reduce interest rates impact lending activity in the banking sector?<br></strong>Better (lower) inflationary expectations allowed the central bank to lower policy rates below 20%, and the downward trend in inflation will support the decline in interest rates. Thus, it will contribute to a fall in loan interest rates along with a fall in the funding costs of the banking sector. With the falling interest rates, the contribution of banks to the real sector and economic growth will increase.</p><p><strong>How well suited are banks to deal with increasing ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs)?<br></strong>NPLs before special provisions to loans ratio is around 4.4%. The ratio was around 4.5% for corporate loans and 3.8% for consumer loans. The ratio of restructured loans to total loans is close to 6%. The banking sector is well suited to deal with these NPLs, as the capital adequacy ratio is 17.8%, well above the regulatory ratio. Annual profitability ratios declined to 11.8% in mid-2019, from 13.7% at the end of 2018, due mainly to slow growth in loans, a squeezed interest margin, and higher special and general provision for loans. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Which Turkish industries are set to contribute most to increased exports to the US, and how is DEİK facilitating US-Turkish trade growth?</strong><br>Bilateral trade between Turkey and the US has significantly grown and reached USD23 billion in 2018. However, the state of global trade and Turkish-American bilateral relations indicate a need for multi-front effort to reach target levels. As DEİK, we prepared a report with the Boston Consulting Group to analyze the ways of reaching the USD100-billion trade target set by Turkey and the US in the coming years. This report was presented to both countries' leaders and cabinet officials. According to the report, automotive and parts, textile and apparel, jewelry, civil aerospace, white goods, building materials, and furniture are the sectors identified to contribute the most towards increasing Turkey-US bilateral trade. The Turkish American Business Council (TAİK), the primary business channel between Turkey and US, has been organizing business events such as high-level roundtables and trade missions to both in Turkey and US. After US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross's visit in September 2019, the USD100-billion trade volume target was discussed during Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's visit to Washington, DC in November 2019. DEİK and TAİK will closely work to realize this target by organizing more business events and creating new networks in the future.</p><p><strong>In Turkey, what sectors of the economy are expected to see increased Chinese investment, and what Turkish products are most suitable for exporting to China?</strong><br>As a result of the increase in the importance of the “China, Central Asia, West Asia Economic Corridor" in China's Belt and Road Project, Turkey will benefit more from Chinese investments in the future. In recent years, two Chinese banks have been increasing their financing activities and a Chinese insurance company has increased its support for trade finance in Turkey. Tourism represents a big area of growth with China. After tourism—although we still do not have a trade agreement with China—the food sector has the highest potential for Turkish exporters, with dried fruits, fresh fruit, and vegetables the most prominent subsectors. We also see high potential for our branded products, such as our fashion brands in the textile sector, as well as white goods, glassware, souvenirs, and small appliances.</p><p><strong>Outside of the immediate region, what targets has DEİK set for opening new trade relations with developing nations?</strong><br>Turkey has been interesting in developing deeper economic and trade links with African countries since 2005, which Turkey declared as “Africa Year." Since then, Turkey's share in Africa's imports increased from 1% to 2.6% with a stable pace. During the same period, Turkey's number of embassies increased to 41 African countries, and Turkish Airlines now flies to 55 destinations in 37 countries on the continent. DEİK has been organizing Turkey-Africa Business Forums in Istanbul in every two years since 2016 in cooperation with Turkish Ministry of Trade and African Union Commission, hosting over 50 guest ministers and 3,000 business people from all over the African continent. Also, Turkey has free trade agreements with four African countries—Morocco, Egypt, Mauritius, and Tunisia. With the implementation of Africa Continental Free Trade Area, we expect a trade boom that will reach every corner of the continent. Having highly improved relations with Africa since 2005, Turkey will focus now more on young and developing African countries.</p><p><strong>Over the next 12 months, what are DEİK's most important objectives?<br></strong>As DEİK, our priority is to create new and strengthen existing ties around the world. We are launching events on partnerships with Japan and European countries to make joint investments in African and Asian countries. We are connecting investors in countries with Islamic to use Islamic finance to manage their investments. In order to realize this purpose, we will organize a PPP event with the Islamic Development Bank on March 2020. Africa will be a priority of ours in the future as well. Finally, along with increased Chinese investments and because of the cultural and historic ties with Turkey, Central Asian countries will be one of the most important targets for Turkish business people along with the recently announced Turkey foreign policy, “Asia Anew." <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>After a year of significant reforms, the government remains committed to an ambitious agenda of economic transformation. With no elections for the next four years, Turkey offers great investment opportunities. We acted swiftly upon assuming office to restore price stability and guide the economy toward a more sustainable growth path. The results of our intervention are encouraging—inflation is already lower than a year ago, and single-digit inflation is within our grasp. The central bank continues to take measures independently to pursue its fight against inflation. In tandem, we are working to contain food prices by supporting the optimization of supply chains, with an expectation to reap the benefits of such initiatives. This is critical given food prices have been a nagging source of inflation since the early 2010s.</p><p>Following the structural transformation steps announced in April, certain policies have been implemented to improve the economic outlook in the near term as well as to increase the productivity and growth potential in the long term. Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth while addressing Turkey's main source of fragility, the chronic current account deficit, which has been financed by short-term debt.<br>Looking into the financial system, banks have capital adequacy ratios well above global benchmarks. However, we remain vigilant; state-owned banks received new capital injections in April, a number of privately-owned banks also raised capital, and the banking regulator has asked all banks to retain earnings. We are also developing state-of-the-art macroprudential oversight capabilities to detect systemic risks to financial stability.<br>The volume of credit, which contracted approximately 15% YoY, remains a serious concern. We want to ensure the system continues to provide an uninterrupted flow of credit to eligible businesses. The new law on financial restructurings shows our determination in this matter. In addition, we are keeping a close eye on banks as they work through distressed loans, particularly in the energy and construction sectors. It is worth noting that several international and domestic investors are interested in forming funds to acquire such loans. We are keen to introduce the necessary rules and regulations to extend our support to businesses.<br>A major policy initiative to boost domestic savings is to be announced. This will lead to long-term growth and reduce reliance on short-term capital flows. In addition, we are filling so-called information gaps by requiring firms with domestic bank borrowings exceeding TRY100 million to submit audited financial statements to their banks before they obtain loans. A national credit rating agency will further improve the information environment and deepen capital markets. Furthermore, there is great potential for growth in the insurance industry to supplement the diversity of funding sources.<br>Exporters have been playing a substantial role in the improvement of Turkey's current account balance. Their tremendous entrepreneurial drive shown in diversifying export markets to over 200 countries, benefiting from modern logistics, transportation, energy, and communications infrastructure, has been the backbone of export market growth. Targeted loan programs, launched in June, have been designed to further support in this regard.<br>Our sovereign wealth fund along with other state institutions are actively holding discussions with strategic partners in the pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, energy, and technology sectors in order to bolster the current account and attract foreign direct investment. In addition, significant joint exploration and production opportunities await investors in the Eastern Mediterranean. Turkey's natural endowments to become the preeminent energy, logistics, trade, and export base at the crossroads of three continents remain undeniably live and attractive.<br>Turkey's strong fiscal balance sheet is reassuring on the road toward re-establishing robust growth in 2H2019. We are about to undertake significant transformation of our tax code to strengthen tax administration, realize base expansion and reduce corporate taxes to create investments and jobs. Turkey's track record of fiscal discipline is self-evident and will never change. Other reforms including the effective functioning of the judicial system will be addressed before year end, contributing to a healthier and more predictable investment environment. These structural initiatives will be central looking toward the centennial of our republic in 2023. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>TCMB recently underwent a management change, most notably with your appointment as governor. Moving forward, how does the refreshed bank plan to maximize communication and enhance the effectiveness of its operations?</strong><br>The way central banks all over the world communicate has constantly evolved over the last few decades. In line with this evolution, TCMB also built strong corporate communication channels and invested a great deal of attention in this area, particularly after the amendment to its law in 2001. But there is still a lot of room for improvement. So, in the upcoming period, we will try to further these endeavors together with my colleagues. Establishing effective, transparent, and inclusive communication with the public on various platforms will strongly contribute to the effectiveness of our operations and achieve our objectives. In this context, our first steps will be to increase our corporate transparency and strengthen our monetary policy communication. A few practices may come up at the top of the agenda. First, we should share more information on the monetary policy decision-making process and the reasons underlying our decisions. This is crucial for the public to understand the arguments behind the decisions of the central bank. Second, we can fill some of the missing aspects in the process of sharing data on the bank's market operations. Moreover, sharing information of higher credibility regarding our monetary policy strategy more frequently will be beneficial. Moreover, thematic speeches that express our stance on some key monetary policy issues will be useful to clarify TCMB's overall approach to the public. In addition, we continue to work on enhancing the communication of the bank with its stakeholders. Accordingly, investors, financial institutions, and corporate sector representatives, and, above all, the financial press will continue to be our main stakeholders. Explaining the importance of price stability as well as the central bank's role to all segments of society has a significant role in achieving price stability. Moreover, the consistency of policies is also extremely important, and in this context, we will work in tandem with all parties that will provide input to the processes to enhance effectiveness of the monetary policy.</p><p><strong>Citing reduced inflation and data indicating a moderate recovery in economic activity, TCMB reduced its policy rate from 24% to 14%. Can you outline the specific goals of the rate cuts, as well as its potential risks?</strong><br>Economic activity, which contracted in the second half of 2018, started to recover at a modest pace in 2019. Both domestic and external demand contributed to the recovery in the first two quarters of the year. The main driver of domestic demand was private consumption, while investment demand remained weak due to tight financial conditions and elevated levels of financial volatility. On the external demand front, despite recent signs of global slowdown, competitiveness gains and market diversification led to a solid performance in exports of goods and services, while import demand remained subdued. As a result, the contribution of net exports remained positive, also with the help of buoyant tourism demand. Recent data indicate that moderate recovery in economic activity continues. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. Looking forward, net exports are expected to contribute to economic growth, although to a lesser extent, and the gradual recovery is likely to continue with the help of the disinflation trend and improvement in financial conditions. The current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement due to the composition of growth, is expected to maintain a moderate course. Inflation has displayed a persistent downtrend since October 2018. Tight monetary policy stance has been instrumental in controlling inflation and inflation expectations. In order to steer inflation expectations in the right direction and contain risks to pricing behavior, we have strengthened the emphasis on the role of published inflation forecasts as intermediate targets. Accordingly, we have made an explicit commitment to keep the underlying trend of inflation close to the published projections for the next three years. Accordingly, actual inflation has mostly remained close to, or even below, the lower bound of TCMB's published projections since October 2018, which has improved forecast credibility. The inflation outlook continues to improve. Over the course of the year, the relative stability of the lira and the negative output gap played a major role in disinflation, while falling import prices and food prices also contributed to the decline. We project inflation to converge to the underlying trend as the base effect fades away in the coming months. According to the October inflation report, forecast inflation will materialize around 12% by the end of 2019. The ongoing improvement in inflation dynamics and pricing behavior created room to reduce the monetary policy tightness. We delivered three rate cuts in July, September, and October, bringing the policy rate to 14% from 24%. The current monetary policy stance is largely consistent with the projected disinflation path that envisages a fall to 8.2% by the end of 2020. The easing in financial conditions supports the moderate recovery trend in economic activity by strengthening confidence and credit channels. We predict the economy will gradually return to its potential growth rate, hence the output gap will remain supportive of disinflation also in 2020. The sustained disinflation process is the key to achieve lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Monetary stance should remain cautious to keep the disinflation process on track with the targeted path. We will determine the tightness of monetary policy based on the indicators of the underlying trend of inflation to ensure the disinflation process and will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of price and financial stability.</p><p><br><strong>From both a domestic and global standpoint, what are the biggest challenges facing the Turkish economy, and what are TCMB's most effective tools to solve them?</strong><br>On the domestic front, steering the economy toward a sustainable growth path and ensuring financial stability are of key importance. This in turn depends on sustaining the disinflation process and achieving price stability. Given the persistently elevated levels of medium-term inflation expectations and associated risks regarding the pricing behavior, it is crucial to keep the disinflation process consistent with the target. This requires maintaining a tight monetary stance and enhanced policy coordination that prioritizes the decline in inflation. Anchoring inflation expectations around the projected disinflation path, and ultimately around the target of 5%, will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and reduce possible tradeoffs associated with disinflation. The re-balancing process that the economy has undergone is smoothly evolving into a healthier growth outlook over the next year. A macro-policy mix that prioritizes the decline in inflation through strong policy coordination will improve the external financing opportunities and long-term interest rates by reducing the risk premium, which will gradually strengthen domestic demand. By preserving monetary and fiscal discipline, reducing macro-financial risks and increasing predictability in the economy, economic growth will be steered toward a balanced and sustainable path over the medium term.</p><p><br><strong>Under TCMB's new leadership, what are the goals of the bank over the next 12 months?</strong><br>Our main goal is to sustain the disinflation process and bring inflation down to 8.2% by end-2020. Maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key to achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. On the back of mildly supportive global financial conditions, we expect the level of monetary tightness and the ongoing improvement in country risk premium to contribute to the stability of the exchange rate. The improvement in the current account is also expected to support the lira. As the fall in inflation becomes more apparent and exchange rate volatility is contained, inflation expectations are expected to converge to our 2020 forecast of 8.2% in 2H 2020. Our decision-making processes will continue to be data-driven. In addition to all macroeconomic indicators, primarily inflation and economic activity, we are closely monitoring micro dynamics and field data. To enhance effectiveness of the monetary policy, we are working in tandem with all parties involved. Also, we will continue to pay effort to enhance the communication of the monetary policy, which will provide major contributions to achieving our targets. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Russia's partnership with Turkey is marked by intense collaboration and investment, especially in the industrial domain. We have had constructive dialogue that is reflected by our dynamics and our bilateral trade growth, which increased by 60% last year and has exceeded USD25 billion.<br>We have together initiated large-scale successful projects in the sphere of metal works, automobile manufacturing and construction, and the production of various materials. We see huge potential to boost our cooperation further in the areas of shipbuilding, aviation, agriculture, and the pharmaceutical industry. Apart from this, we have a number of Russian companies operating in Turkey, and the Turkish industrial business has proven to be quite a success in the Russian market. On the ground in Russia, they are represented in special economic zones like those in Tataristan. We have already established seven enterprises that provide for a wide range of materials and items, including finished products, plastic, pipes, and materials for cars. These are excellent examples that should be used as examples of future participation by the Turkish side within the Russian Federation.<br>In order to cooperate even further, we need to maintain a continuous dialogue with our Turkish partners and incentivize investment in Russia even further. We will accomplish the latter through special economic zones, areas of advanced development, as well as industrial parks. We have mechanisms that offer long-term guarantees for investors and have established special preferential regimes in line with the best and most affordable work practices. We are focused on attracting advanced technology companies to invest in the Russian Federation and cooperate with Russian companies. We are ready to open access for them to enter the Russian market, and we are interested in providing certain subsidies to support them. Here, they can also cooperate with countries from all across the world.<br>Within the framework of our trade partnership, we also have systems and a special group to support Turkish exported goods. Within these support mechanisms, we want SMEs to be more involved. In this sense, our Turkish counterparts can make strong contributions. They can focus even more on different technologies and joint projects. We could establish even more alliances and strengthen our network and cooperation even more. We could further promote this form of long-term partnership.<br>To summarize, I would like to say that I wish you very fruitful and interesting work. I hope you enjoy breakthrough ideas and successful and mutually beneficial projects.</p><p>*Extracted from a speech given at Innoprom July 2019.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Turkey and the US are talking about increasing bilateral trade from USD20 billion to USD100 billion. How are political differences likely to influence trade?</strong><br>The way we get to USD100 billion is by reaching the point where we have USD50 billion on each side. The concept is balanced and reciprocal trade at a larger multiple of the current amount. We now have only USD20 billion.</p><p><strong>When it comes to imposing sanctions on Turkey for its purchase of S-400 missile defense systems from Russia, the opinion in Washington appears divided. What is your personal opinion, and do you support sanctions on Turkey?</strong><br>You have to look at the relationship from an overall point of view. Everything depends on everything else. I do not think you can answer one question separately from the others. I have learned never to forecast what congress or two administrations will do. The reason I am here is to try to see if we can do things in an amicable fashion. We are not seeking a big confrontation.</p><p><strong>Traditionally, the US has championed itself as a champion of free trade and open markets. Is that changing under the Trump administration?</strong><br>The policy is certainly different, but there are no free markets in the world. The people that talk about free markets the most are the Chinese and the Europeans, and they are among the most protectionist people. The reality is that the US is the least protectionist large country; it is just that we have not been as aggressive in our rhetoric about it. Our ultimate objective is to get other countries to match with their behavior their free market rhetoric.</p><p><strong>The Chinese say their political philosophy does not seek political confrontation. They want to create win-win situations. Does the US believe that a trade war with China is inevitable?</strong><br>We have been in a trade war with China in a sense for a long time. The difference is that we are now trying to negotiate a more equitable solution. We hope that we will get there. We thought we were there pretty well in May, then they went back to China and said they could not live up to what was discussed. We need them to get back to where we were in May. </p><p><br>*Excerpt from TRT World's One on One Express: Interview with US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Despite various shifts and changes over the centuries, the core functions of diplomacy persist in the 21st century. However, the “ground" and “table" of diplomacy are now broader and more multi-layered—Turkish diplomats are among the pioneers of this new diplomacy.</p><p>In places where war, coups, failing states, suffering, oppression, and bloodshed are taking place, Turkish diplomats perform their duties uninterrupted and are devoted to protecting Turkish interests. They are in constant negotiations in capitals, international organizations, and the tables of various processes.<br>We have developed comprehensive consultations and cooperation methods including bilateral, trilateral, quadrilateral, and other sorts of multilateral mechanisms. We are going to make more use of those not only on political but also technical levels. We continue to make a substantial contribution to regional and global stability and order through diplomacy.<br>Turkey is the leading country in mediation initiatives in three different international organizations. We will devote even greater attention to resolving disputes and frozen conflicts in the upcoming period.<br>This year, a Turkish Ambassador was elected as the Chief Monitor of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. Likewise, two very competent Turkish women were elected to important international organizations—one as a judge to the European Court of Human Rights and one as a member of the Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO). We reassumed the chairmanship of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process, which was brought to life under our leadership. Moreover, Turkey will also be assuming the presidencies of the D-8 (Developing Eight) Organization for Economic Cooperation, Southeast European Cooperation Process, and Asia Cooperation Dialogue.<br>Before handing it over this year, we performed our three-year long chairmanship of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) with the goal of revitalizing the outdated structure of the organization. Our chairmanship had an impact, and we dynamized the OIC. To name a few results of our chairmanship, we developed the Islamic Development Fund, the Center for Police Cooperation, the Contact Group of Friends of Mediation, the Women Consultative Council, and the Istanbul Arbitration Center. Regarding the Palestine cause and attacks on Jerusalem, we convened two Extraordinary OIC Summits and three Extraordinary OIC Executive Committee meetings at foreign minister level. With these meetings, we enabled the Islamic world to speak with one voice. We defended the rights of Muslims worldwide, just as we did after the attacks on mosques in New Zealand.<br>Turkish diplomacy is also highly active in the development of our foreign economic and commercial relations. The amount of FDI, which was USD14.6 billion from 1984 to 2002, reached USD210 billion from 2003 to 2019. We concluded or are in negotiations for free trade and preferential trade agreements with many countries.<br>Turkey's interests at home and abroad require working efficiently and in a focused manner. We introduced a “3+2" principle of effectiveness to diplomacy. We strive for effectiveness at the local, regional, and global levels, plus, on the ground and at the table.<br>In a geography surrounded by warfare, turmoil, proxy wars, sanctions, and unbridled ambitions, is there any other democracy that has managed to become one of the top-20 global economies, all thanks to her own efforts and assets? Can anyone imagine achieving this without being active both on the ground and at the table? This is our story, and our foreign policy reflects our very own story.<br>Turkey is a member of NATO and the Council of Europe. We are a part of the European legal and security system. We are both the west and the east, the north and the south. Our state and nation stand tall and strong as the guarantor of regional peace and prosperity. </p><p>*Sourced from the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you intend to innovate identity security in Mexico and internationally?</h4><p>Based on the regulation issued between 2017 and 2018, many companies and fintechs are trying to develop safer solutions for enrollment processes. However, currently there is little happening in terms of giving the end-user control of their own information, or security from identity theft, which is a big problem in Mexico. DICIO decided to offer a solution to enrollment processes that seem simple, but are highly regulated, and develop it as a best-of-breed. We are currently in the process of refining our own algorithm and in-house developments; our strategy is to position ourselves first in respect to opening bank accounts, though our technology can be applied to any other context. Today, in Mexico many institutions have major issues with frauds related to identity theft. The problem with today's token, digital, and cryptographic certificates is that once one stores the files on a device or system, the data is compromised. For example, the minute one stores a cryptographic key issued by Bitcoin on their cellphone, it is at risk of getting hacked. Even more so with non-encrypted personal information sitting in a bank or federal government database. We thus invented a platform that encrypts the whole cycle, including the communication channel one uses when signing up with a bank, along with the data, and the image of their face. For now, we are calling this a Crypto FaceKey. This is a game changer because by turning a person's image into a cryptographic key, it solves the problem of linking personal information with the physical person. The idea is to securely merge the real life of a person with their digital life to execute a transaction. We are linking their body to data and encrypting this data with a key that is generated from vectors and formula based on one's face. We use a computational neural network and data model to turn the vectors of one's face into a pair of asymmetric keys. The key is a three-page mathematical formula that is not stored anywhere. When you call it up it generates itself virtually, passes through the cellphone or computer and encrypts your personal data, and then you decide whether and what information to share with, for example, the bank.</p><h4>What strategies is DICIO using to position itself in the market?</h4><p>We are designing the DICIO's strategy and positioning it for the Mexican and global markets in 2019. We spent seven or eight months building a brand-new business case because our previous one was conceptual which is continuously reviewed and updated. If we could address the essentials of a person's identity in Mexico's challenging financial context, we could likely reproduce this anywhere in the world. The regulation in Mexico is probably the harshest and most taxing for banks and Fintechs. We decided to expand our services portfolio specific to the Mexican banking market. In an emerging economy, you need to identify a person to have any type of commercial business or government institution relationship. We apply this to a simple cycle in the banking industry, namely the opening of a low-level bank account through a bank portal or app. This type of bank account is called a Level 3 and 4 accounts. In Mexico, such processes are regulated by two governmental entities.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2020, and what further projects would you like to collaborate on?</h4><p>We are completing the construction of the platform as we speak and hope to have our first application release by 1Q2020. This is meant to be an initial version with a Crypto FaceKey, but we are not set to realize everything at once. When it comes to the FaceKey each user will have a unique number. This is inspired by a project in India, where institutions use a generated number that acts as a container for all other official numbers one has as a citizen. This is the same concept we have opted to employ. In Mexico today, we have too many official numbers that do not make much sense and cause security concerns. For instance, the tax registry number (RFC) and national identification number (CURP) give away a great deal of personal information to third parties, such as one's gender, place of birth, age, and initials. Most developed countries like Canada, the US, Japan, and New Zealand have a mask random number for their citizens for this reason. That number does not mean anything without additional data, but it is enough to identify you.</p><h4>How much effort has been spent in developing this software in terms of time and money?</h4><p>To build this, we are collaborating with US machine learning and AI company established by a prestigious mathematician and teacher at The University of Maryland, Baltimore. The first phase of the project involves a significant investment of which we spent to build our server-side components. We are working with the AI company to develop everything required at the back-end. The formula is being turned into code using the Python programming language. And meanwhile, for the front-end we have a local team developing a cellphone app for Android and iOS.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Latam Medical Cannabis Predictions]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[vicente-fox-quesada-former-president-mexico-director-centro-fox-member-khiron-life-science-corp-board-directors]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have said that medical cannabis in Latin America can reach USD12.7 billion, and Khiron will play an important role in reaching that goal. What is the key to achieving those goals?</h4><p>These are estimates on figures that are already published. Whatever the size of the market, Khiron will be the first company in the market in Latin America because it has a high ethical standard. That is why Khiron has decided it only has to participate in the medical market with high compliance standards. Khiron has established higher compliance goals than those required by the regulators. Second, Khiron's operative strategy is based on a package; the firm sells a complete service that includes a medicine recommended by the doctor, and it is prescribed by the personal physician for each individual patient. Khiron is acquiring clinics to provide its services with doctors and patients. Then, the accountability standards in Khiron are extremely high. This is a public company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and, as a result, it is obliged to meet certain standards. And lastly, the professionals at Khiron, including myself, are great professionals in their fields, so the company will acquire a large market share whatever the size of the market.</p><h4>The Colombian government wants to boost the medical cannabis industry. However, the issuance of licenses is slow. What decision should the government take to speed up the development of this industry?</h4><p>There needs to be mutual trust between government and companies. Companies and the industry will grow tremendously when there are regulations that are not excessively restrictive, but rather a legal framework that understands the market's needs. That relation is well understood in Colombia and in Mexico. The company is in talks with congress and legislators. In Mexico, congress is about to pass a law that will regulate these products. We are on track to have that mutual trust. Companies have to comply with transparency and regulation standards, while the government has to develop the best framework to develop the sector.</p><h4>What can be done to make legislators understand the potential that medical cannabis could have for the development of a country?</h4><p>We are working and waiting for legislators to make their decision. There is a ruling that they cannot escape from. The executive and legislative branches have been forced by the judiciary to regulate the industry. In Mexico, congress has requested additional time to pass the bill to establish a regulation, and that timeframe expires in April.</p><h4>What is your forecast in terms of economic and political terms for the industry?</h4><p>Currently, access to banking is extremely restricted. We will gradually see more openness. The problem is that in Latin America we have seen the violence triggered by narcos and cartels due to the prohibition of drugs. We need to have strong regulatory bodies so that banks will open their financial mechanisms to this industry as they do with other industries. No one will impede the development of this industry.</p><h4>What would you say to the regional leaders to have a different perspective on drugs?</h4><p>I would recommend they learn the history of this industry; all the places that have legalized cannabis have not experienced any problems. There have not been risks for governments and political leaders when things are properly done. We have to walk this road to develop it. We have to tell governments that it is better to legalize, instead of all the costs associated with diseases and criminality related to drugs. Regulating the industry can generate new tax collections and private investment in research and development. It is a potential job generator, and there is an important industry to develop. I would like to invite political leaders to make decisions in that regard.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Over 35,000 B2B Users Daily]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[richard-morgan-regional-managing-director-west-central-asia-maersk]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Maersk apply innovation to its operations to increase transparency and efficiency in shipping and supply chain solutions?</h4><p>We approach innovation and technology in a number of ways. First, our current vision is to become the global integrator of container logistics. That is our response to a changing industry wherein customers want more end-to-end solutions and a more managed service and product. We bring innovation through technology. Our website is one of the largest B2B sites with over 35,000 daily users transacting 20,000 bookings. This online booking management is, for our industry, a step forward. We have also automated our customer quotations. In addition, we are working hard to bring innovative ocean products to our customers. For example, we have an online product that allows for an instant quotation, instant booking, and guaranteed space on a pre-defined vessel. Customers can book with confidence and know their container will be on the right ship and arrive at the right time. We are witnessing significant volumes for this product, with the uptake developing much faster than we originally planned; particularly, our customers in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and India have really been embracing the product. Moving on to efficiencies and vessel operations, new technologies improve efficiency and speed. We use less fuel in the shipping process, allowing for a better environmental approach to our ship operations. Innovation permeates both the commercial and operational sides. We are also building a lot of new land-based products, including trucking, customs, storage, and warehousing. We are doing that around the world and are investing heavily in this region. We have launched a number of local products in the last month and are seeing real commercial traction. These new products will represent a significant amount of our planned growth for 2020. Trade finance is another example of an emerging segment we are looking in to. In the last three years, since launching our financial product, we have dispersed loans of about USD650 million to more than 200 customers, which have shipped about 60,000 containers with us in that period. The UAE is our leading territory in the world for this product. Finally, I will mention TradeLens, an open and neutral industry platform built on blockchain technology, jointly developed with IBM. Around 60% of the world's global container fleet and other shipping lines have signed up for it. TradeLens is signing up ports and customs authorities around the world. As all of this is connected, our customers clearly see a compelling value proposition emerging. Through TradeLens, we can bring a lot more transparency, reliability, and security to our client's supply chain.</p><h4>What is Dubai's significance in Maersk's regional and global portfolio?</h4><p>Dubai is clearly emerging as a significant part of the Maersk portfolio. There is tremendous potential, if you look at e-commerce around the GCC and the investments being made in free zones. We are developing products and services to support that initiative. What's more, Dubai has the opportunity to be a hub or significant point of entry across the GCC with the emerging cross-border products, allowing land transportation into Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere. We can provide a more secure service on an end-to-end, rather than fragmented, basis.</p><h4>Are there any markets that will pose credible competition?</h4><p>From our point of view, UAE is well positioned geographically and strategically. The key here is infrastructure and its availability, which is vital to driving trade. The region has a large multimodal transshipment hub and a regional gateway port in in Salalah, Oman. With APM Terminals we hold a 30% stake in the port operation company and have a concession agreement with the government of Oman that forms part of our east-west trade. However, a significant chunk of our volume moves through Jebel Ali. We work closely with our partners in DP World and other organizations around the UAE. There will be challenges; however, from our point of view challenges bring new opportunities. We see new opportunities in King Abdullah Port, for example, and opportunities for our petrochemical customers in the Kingdom. We are creating new products to increase the flow of Saudi exports to Asia and other parts of the world.</p><h4>How do Maersk and Dubai plan to leverage geopolitical trends?</h4><p>The geopolitical situation is constantly moving, and so far, the impact has been quite manageable. We have seen shipping from China move to Southeast Asia and India. We have such a heavy global footprint and strong representation in these markets that from our point of view the impact has so far been manageable. Our global presence offers us the opportunity to reassess the fleet, becoming less centered on certain markets and more diversified. It offers growth opportunities and new infrastructure investments, for example in Vietnam, to support that growth. The challenge really comes from managing the fleet. We do have a number of initiatives at the moment. We will continue to invest in China, that goes without saying. We are concentrating on Southeast Asia to create the infrastructure needed to enable faster growth. Maersk is also heavily investing in India. We have  large ports, transport- and logistics business there and are finalizing plans for future organic and inorganic growth in India. Saudi Arabia is the second-largest market in the world for refrigerated imports. That gives us real opportunity to develop our cold chain in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. We continue to invest in the Americas and Europe, where we are building our land-side infrastructure to support our strategy to be the integrated, end-to-end provider. Our investment is universal with interesting things happening in this region, ranging from anything between Turkey and Bangladesh.</p><h4>What differentiates Maersk from the competition?</h4><p>The company is in a clear transformation from offering legacy, traditional freight-dominant products to becoming the global integrator of container logistics simplifying customer's supply chains. Our advantage comes in several different areas. First, we are a strong brand, perhaps the most recognized in our industry. We have become the most recognized Danish brand in the world, building trust and delivering high levels of service and innovation for our customers for 120 years. That allows us to be able to move into logistic spaces with confidence and high financial stability. Aligned with this, we are ready to make the necessary adjustments to make the strategy come alive through both organic and inorganic growth. That allows us to move with pace and speed. We are a couple of years into the transformation now and logistics and services continue to grow as part of our overall portfolio. Because we are both an asset owner and a company that offers landside services—combined with digital innovations like for instance our website, which today is one of the world's largest business-to-business transaction site, TradeLens, and Maersk's  digital value proposition for small and medium enterprises (SME's) called Twill—customers can trust Maersk along every step of the supply chain. This brings confidence to companies utilizing the supply chain for commercial advantage as they cannot afford supply chain interruption. With arguably the finest customer base in the world, recently we have put more effort in listening to customer feedback. We are getting a clear outline to our vision and are building products to match that expectation. We have a methodology whereby we can quickly test our offerings, listen to customer feedback, and then make the necessary modifications to create compelling customized solutions. The Middle East and Indian markets, particularly Saudi Arabia and northern India, are pilot areas for our new online guaranteed shipping product, called Maersk Spot. We will continue to drive innovation while listening to customer needs. To accelerate the transition to carbon-neutral shipping, Maersk has set the ambitious target of having net-zero CO2 emissions from operations by 2050.  . We are investing heavily in that to have the right environmental impact and hope to inspire researchers, technology developers, investors, cargo owners and legislators to come together in co-development and sponsorship of sustainable solutions that we are yet to see in the maritime industry. The future vision is about end-to-end supply chain services that are digitally enabled and highly innovative, supporting customers in their growth needs and adding value to the brand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[115 Years in Operation]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[miguel-fernando-escobar-ceo-postobon]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the determining factors that made Postobón remain a leader in the Colombian beverage industry since its establishment?</h4><p>Postobón has been in the market for about 115 years, operating in Colombia, and has had a clear passion and agenda based on innovation. We have been bottling and packaging different products that today are considered “new age“ but, for us, are centenary products. Our success has been based on innovation, products, flavor, packaging, distribution, and our market channels. We have a solid distribution system that helps us to continue building our leadership and multi-category platform. That is why we consider our leadership strong, and we will continue in the same way in the coming years.</p><h4>What does it mean to be recognized as the best bottling company in Latin America by PepsiCo, and what is your strategic alliance?</h4><p>We are proud of it. Globally, we were awarded as the best in Latin America. We then competed in an open discussion with PepsiCo about its global franchise program, and it awarded us best in the world. It is not that we are the biggest; we are the bottler that performed the best during the year with execution, innovation, and an agenda of digital transformation. We have a robust relationship with PepsiCo, as we are closely aligned with its brands. We have our own brands but we have the franchise, and PepsiCo recognizes Postobón's great execution of its agenda.</p><h4>You also have an agreement with United Brewing Company (CCU) Chile. How strategic are these agreements, and are you looking for further future alliances?</h4><p>Back in 2016, we signed our agenda for the future where we clearly defined that we will convert this company into a multicategory company, beyond the traditional soft drink products we have sold on the market. We wished to penetrate with different products, like beer and malt. With our own new brands, like Andina in beer and Nutrimalta in malt, we decided to go with this big venture with  CCU in a 50-50 partnership. We are making progress every day according to our objectives. We will continue making more investments through that industry to really achieve our large long-term objectives. We are open to continuing to explore new opportunities because the multicategory is far beyond what we used to do and far beyond beer and malt. We have a huge platform and a powerful distribution network that we want to continue to take advantage of and capture value in the market.</p><h4>What role does innovation and technology have in your production process?</h4><p>Everything is based on those two concepts. Innovation has to be present, and whatever we do has to have innovation in its DNA. We will not have a “copy-paste“ of a product. Innovation and digital transformation will play an integral role in the future of this company. Digital transformation is happening today in our company, and we are making important capital investment behind that agenda. Hopefully, in the near future, we will conquer new markets based on technology. That is a fundamental part of our agenda today, and every day it will be more relevant.</p><h4>Can you comment on your distribution model and new countries that you want to reach in the future?</h4><p>We defined our strategic program to make a leap on the international side. We do export from our operations in Colombia, but also have a franchise in North America that bottles and distributes for us. We also have the same model in Spain, with a partnership with a different company that bottles and distributes across eight countries. We also export from our operation close to the ports in this country, but that is not enough. We need to be more aggressive and have a solid agenda for a larger presence in the international agenda. We are willing to go far from home but need to understand our capabilities and how we can operate, so our investments will be more focused within the region, to continue exploring and working on the different segments that we can attack and develop.</p><h4>How do your social responsibility actions contribute to the development of the country?</h4><p>The Ardila family that owns and controls this company has had a crystal-clear agenda on the social side, and we have been carrying it out for many years. It is a relevant agenda for us: everything we do socially and how we interact with the communities in many different ways is a clear instruction from the shareholders and from the board to us. That is because we have programs to support different agendas in different regions to help people to grow with our company. In 2018, we invested close to USD6 million in social media programs.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Postobón in the coming years?</h4><p>We continue to be optimistic and believe Colombia is a great place to invest. Consumption is moving forward in this country because, as much as this country continues to reduce poverty, with people moving from poverty to middle class, we see consumption of many different products expanding. This will continue to happen in the near future, and we want to capture that opportunity. We want to continue to invest. We have a robust capital investment program through which we will continue investing in the country, expanding in capacity and distribution. We can continue expanding with double-digit growth for the company in the near future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[75 Years of the UN]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[tijjani-muhammad-bande-president-united-nations-general-assembly]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UN will celebrate its 75th anniversary in 2020. What are the primary goals for your presidency of the General Assembly?</h4><p>As we look forward to the 75th anniversary of the UN's founding, it is important to acknowledge the challenges that confront us, as well as the opportunity for the UN as a multilateral institution to highlight its key role in tackling complex global problems. As president of the 74th session, I will focus on promoting peace and security, with a special emphasis on conflict prevention. Strengthening global action to tackle climate change is integral for the effective implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that will naturally receive my attention. I shall also give high priority to inclusion, human rights, and the empowerment of youth and women, respectively. Above all, my presidency will adopt measures to strengthen partnerships for the purpose of advancing the achievement of the SDGs, in general, and for poverty eradication, zero hunger, and quality education, in particular.</p><h4>The UN will hold its 'biggest-ever global conversation' on the future of the planet to address issues such as climate change. What is the strategic plan in terms of addressing the outcomes of this conversation?</h4><p>The General Assembly is the space for dialogue and consensus building. The Biodiversity Summit, also known as the Nature Summit, is an important opportunity and milestone to highlight the planetary emergency and to accelerate action for people and the planet. According to the 2019 World Risk Report, biodiversity loss and other climate-related factors are among the top ten global risks for 2019. Yet, 10 of the 21 targets of the SDGs set to mature in 2020 are related to biodiversity, so 2020 will be a critical moment for environmental decision making. The global biodiversity framework for post-2020 is expected to strengthen the linkages between and among diverse initiatives, notably, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and other relevant processes adopted under the biodiversity-related conventions. Member states are still making their final decisions on the timing for the 2020 Biodiversity Summit, its modalities, and the specific issues it will tackle. Ultimately, the Biodiversity Summit will build on the political momentum from the climate and SDG summits in New York in September 2019 to accelerate action. As president, I will call on world leaders to set ambitious commitments for nature and find robust nature-based solutions. It is my hope that this would make nature and climate change mainstream in all key political, economic cultural and social decision, more so, as environmental pollution and climate change pose grave threats to humanity as a whole and to agriculture, food and economic security. Ensuring the long-term resilience of the world's most vulnerable people warrant making hard choices about the ecosystem. I hope that world leaders will send the strongest signal at the summit on the need to reverse the loss of biodiversity and to protect and restore nature by 2030.</p><h4>During the 74th session of the General Assembly, Spain recommitted to tackling security within the UN's framework to face growing global security concerns including cybersecurity, nuclear non-proliferation, and terrorism. What is the role of collaboration and legislation in addressing these threats in the near future?</h4><p>When it comes to global security threats, it is essential to have dialogue and build agreements based on consensus. Collaboration among countries and within the entire international community is crucial for a successful fight against security threats. The threat of a nuclear war still exists and cannot be ignored. Any use of nuclear weapons would be a humanitarian and ecological catastrophe and will cause irreparable damage to communities and livelihoods. Nuclear disarmament is therefore one of the UN's top priorities. The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) remains the cornerstone of the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, including the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Next year, the 2020 NPT Review Conference will take place, and I hope that these discussions will provide momentum for a stronger commitment towards a nuclear weapons-free world. When it comes to terrorism, what affects one country affects all. There is a need for all states to adopt and stringently implement counter-terrorism laws at a national level. Furthermore, implementation should not end at countering terrorism, but should place high emphasis on prevention, that is, counter-terrorism strategies that address the very conditions that give rise to the menace in the first place. The UN Global Counter Terrorism Strategy that was adopted by consensus in 2006 has in it four pillars: addressing the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism; preventing and combating terrorism; building states' capacity and strengthening the role of the UN; and ensuring human rights and the rule of law that capture the indispensable role of multilateralism in countering terrorism. The reviews of the strategy so far undertaken by the UN General Assembly have urged all countries to provide full coordination and afford each other the greatest measure of assistance, at all stages in the fight against terrorism. Finally, the impact of rapidly developing new technologies has a security dimension that must be seriously considered to mitigate risks and prevent conflicts. I have in mind the issue of cybersecurity. “Do no harm" should be the first and foremost principle governing the internet. To make it a reality, all states and stakeholders in the digital world must refrain from any malicious activity contrary to international law. They should take reasonable steps to further exchange information, secure services, improve collaboration to promote inclusion, reduce inequalities, and eliminate potential threats. The General Assembly now has two parallel processes to discuss developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security: the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) and the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE).</p><p><em>*Contribution facilitated at </em><em>The International Economic Forum of the Americas (IEFA).</em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[MENA pharma: USD50 billion by 2025]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[joe-henein-ceo-new-bridge-pharmaceuticals]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the pharma market in Dubai and the MENA region?</h4><p>The pharma market in the Middle East &amp; North Africa (MENA) region is estimated roughly around USD32 billion. Analysts expect the pharmaceutical market in MENA region to grow to around USD50 billion by 2025. The U.A.E. will lead this growth among other countries during this period, like Egypt and North Africa. MENA is one of the fastest growing emerging markets, driven mainly by sizeable population growth, increased life expectancy, greater prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes, and greater prioritization of healthcare services among governments in the region such as mandatory health insurance in GCC or increased national health coverage in Egypt. More than 60% of medicines are imported mostly innovative medicines that come from multinationals, while local and regional companies market share is growing steadily, covering mostly the generic alternatives of medicines that come off-patent. There are more than 350 million people in this region, almost similar in population to USA.  However, region has a widespread income per capita among its countries, and far less spending per capita on pharmaceuticals than western countries. The global pharma market is estimated to be over 1 trillion dollars, with the US and China the two largest. MENA only represent little less than 2% market share of the global pharma spending. The region also has dominant health issues with diseases of very high prevalence in the world, like diabetes, hepatitis C, thalassemia, and sickle cell diseases, in addition to some other genetic diseases resulting from intermarriage within families.</p><h4>What is the main inhibitor to growth of the pharma market in the region?</h4><p>The pharma industry like any other, gets affected by the prevailing macroeconomics such as oil prices, for example the drop in oil prices in 2016 and 2017 led to a slowdown in public sector growth and heightened pressure on drug prices. Also, geopolitical factors play a key role in preventing the region to reach its full potential because of the many political conflicts, wars, and sanctioned countries. However, the biggest impediment to growth is access to medicines, as mentioned above, the region has a sizable population which is growing but also in age, with many high prevalent diseases, so access to adequate and maybe newer treatment modalities is key. However, and unfortunately, we still see many patients' payout of their pockets and number of countries in the region unable to provide necessary coverage to all these patients.</p><h4>What new innovations are entering the pharma industry?</h4><p>We are seeing a very promising signals in the scientific community that can't be ignored. The rise in precision medicine following accurate genomic sequencing heralds a new era of R&amp;D success. As one of the scientists described it recently as “Tsunami of Innovation“ coming our way in next few years. We started to see a slew of breakthroughs in treatment of diseases like Hepatitis C which may eradicate it in the next 15 years, Ebola, Malaria and some of these notorious infectious diseases with very high morbidity &amp; mortality rates. Meanwhile, an emerging class of biologicals called checkpoint inhibitors harness the power of a patient's immune system to extend survival versus traditional therapies in a variety of cancers. Gene therapy, which only a few years ago would be just a dream, is now becoming a reality and more to come. These advances are big deal and prompted hope of an era of new treatments and maybe cure to a wide spectrum of diseases that we still face.</p><h4>What opportunities do you currently see in emerging markets?</h4><p>Few years ago and when I was the Head of Wyeth MENA, my company then among many pharma companies looked East seeking growth and respite from market uncertainty in Europe and the United States and labeled Emerging Markets “Accelerated Growth Opportunity“ and MENA was one of them. Many companies then shifted its focus on these markets, as they found consumers able to afford largely out-of-pocket spending on its drugs. Soon thereafter some of these emerging markets went from boom to bust, and many suffered downturns or showed weaker growth forecasts, and many healthcare systems struggled to scale up adequately to provide needed care to its patients. Accordingly, this sentiment by pharma companies didn't last long, and meanwhile USA and “big five“ EU countries started to do better with many new products got approved, became available and hence attracted the attention back again to the developed economies. Analysts expect it will be a cycle that will return with strong growth expected to have revenue doubled in the next 10 years in key strategic emerging markets.</p><h4>Many companies neglect this market. Is that an opportunity for you?</h4><p>They do not so much neglect it but rather pursue other priorities. It is expensive and challenging to enter a new market. Most of these innovations I talked about come from small to medium size biotech companies, and if they are not acquired by big pharma, they definitely want to focus on USA, large European countries, China, Japan and probably will seek to outsource rest of the regions in the world including emerging markets. Yes for sure, this will be our opportunity, it was for this exact purpose and main reason behind creating NewBridge, looking into the white space and developing a regional platform bridging innovation from west to east and hence make NewBridge the partner of choice for innovative medicines in MENA.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[50% of Projects Outside of Spain]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jorge-miarnau-president-comsa-corporacion]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As COMSA Corporación is celebrating its 128th anniversary this year, can you give us an overview of the history of the company?</h4><p>The first generation of COMSA lived through the Spanish Civil War. My grandfather started from scratch again in the railway business in 1936. With the growth that came during the 1960s, we branched into roads and buildings, harbors, airports, and everything, really. We became a global construction company at that time while trying to maintain our railway specialty. In the 1980s, we began to venture abroad, starting our international expansion in Portugal before moving to South America. After the crisis of 2008, we merged with a company specialized in industrial engineering and focused our works on other countries. Today, our main areas are infrastructure, industrial engineering and maintenance services and we are present in more than 20 countries where we still try to maintain our railway focus. Our main business is in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. With the Spanish crisis, we looked abroad a lot and after the period of 2010 to 2012, we drew back a little bit and narrowed our focus more. It is better to be in fewer countries and have a stronger presence than to be in many countries doing small projects. Currently, over 50% of our work is outside of Spain. Mainly our projects are in the public sector all over the world. Only 30% of our turnover is private. Therefore, hiccups in the public sector affect us.</p><h4>In 2019, your profits are forecast to rise to EUR1.299 million (USD1.4 million). What is the strategy you take to ensure this growth takes place?</h4><p>We are focused on growing steadily as a result of the progressive concentration around our core businesses. We want to have the right people in place and the right procedures for the company to succeed for the long term. We are working on making a company for the future by making changes to bring younger people to the company, so that we have the next 20 to 25 years covered. We are also preparing for the new digital world and technological advances. It is clear that Spain's market is not enough to maintain our company in railway works, meaning we will have to work all around the world. Our strategy is to focus on South America and northern Europe, where we have a strong presence. For example, we have a large company in Poland, from which we are working with Croatia, Romania, and Bulgaria. It is an interesting region with growing economies, although less stable situations, which is why it is unreliable to only focus there. We combine this focus with more mature and secure countries, such as Denmark and Sweden.</p><h4>Where are you in the process of digitally transforming?</h4><p>As for in the office, we have a good digitalization of processes. We do not send invoices or paper documents but rather focus on processes that are computer-driven. Then we have the main thing, which is the construction business. It is hard to bring digitalization to steel and concrete, but we are trying hard in the soft parts of the business, such as the planning and how we control the projects.</p><h4>Barcelona has been designated as a hub for logistics and distribution. What do you think makes Barcelona stand out?</h4><p>We have a good situation geographically speaking, as we are close to almost everywhere in Europe. The city is also attractive, so many people are coming, particularly young people, further encouraged by regional projects such as The Collider, Pier01, and all the innovation happening throughout the city. In this sense, Barcelona's airport, harbor and railway have a lot of potential.</p><h4>What do you think is the role of the public administration here?</h4><p>Since the crisis, governments have reduced public spending not only in Spain or Catalonia but also in many other countries. Education and Health usually overtake infrastructure, so we are the first area to receive cuts. However, this does no one justice. Infrastructure is not only for business, it also impacts social and medical aspects, such as building hospitals and schools. We would like to see more money being spent there.</p><h4>What is your main objective for 2020?</h4><p>Our objective is to consolidate our situation with good projects and solid performance. We expect to grow nearly 5% and will continue to foster a spirit of innovation and sustainability. To attract young people, we must have these kinds of values.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[USD200 million investment by 2025]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jose-alejandro-cheyne-rector-universidad-del-rosario]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the secret of the university maintaining high-quality standards for over three centuries despite the dynamic changes in its existence?</h4><p>Universidad del Rosario is celebrating 365 years in two dimensions. One is training young people in the fields of law, economics, administration, and so on. We form lives but with a condition: they live to serve the country. The second is that we have served as protagonists in the construction of the national agenda for 365 years. That is the most important. We have been developing this country for 365 years, but this is not enough. With our motto Nova et vetera, we have to look at respecting tradition and, simultaneously, projecting ourselves into the future. With Route 2025, we defined what the university will be like in 2025 by interviewing 9,200 students, professors, graduates, and allies and outlines the university's greatest challenges. The first is innovation, for which new spaces must be created. By 2025, we will have invested USD200 million. It is the most ambitious infrastructure plan of the university. We recently acquired the El Tiempo newspaper building, where we will create laboratories for innovation, creativity, and so on. We will also create new innovative experiences and focus on pedagogical innovation. Students do not want to receive classes as people received them a years ago; they want new methodologies. Another challenge is regionalization. For 365 years, society has sent its leaders to train here, and these leaders then return to their cities and impact their regions. Some 30% of our students come from Colombia's regions, and we have a presence in Bogotá and in 10 cities with postgraduate programs. We train women and young people in entrepreneurship in 13 cities. Our vocation is not only Bogotá, but the country. Therefore, we are increasingly in our presence in more regions of Colombia. We have a project called Ruta Paí­s, in which we go to each region of Colombia to learn from it and meet with the mayor, governor, ecclesiastical authorities, military authorities, social leaders, and business leaders. Together we build an agenda that we develop. We even go to cities where we do not have students. The third challenge is internationalization and creating students who are “glocal," namely able to solve a city's specific problem but with an international vision. The next variable is reputation. Every day, each of our 60,000 graduates is building the reputation of the university. If there is a problem, a single graduate can end that reputation. The last is academic excellence. My commitment as a rector is that each of our students can be sure that their academic program is world-class.</p><h4>Private universities currently receive fewer students, largely because centennials no longer consider university necessary. What are your thoughts as an expert in education, and what does the university do to attract new students?</h4><p>There is something known as the paradox of universities. There are more young people who want to enter university, though, at the same time, due to their economic limitations or other issues, they cannot enter. At the same time, universities have empty seats. There are two reasons for this paradox. The first are restrictions, one of which is economic. Not everyone has money to enter. As a university, we support government programs and have financing mechanisms for young people. Our scholarship program has a budget of COP30 billion (USD8.56 million). We help eliminate economic restraint but that is not the most important. The main restriction is pedagogical. Not all young people have the skills to enter a high-quality university because they come from different regions, schools, and settings. The challenge of the university is to help them close the skills gap, for example, in mathematics, the ability to analyze, and a second language. The university works on helping with both economic and pedagogical restrictions. The second strategy is pedagogical innovation. Young people do not want to receive traditional classes; they want educational experiences. The challenge of universities in Colombia is pedagogical innovation. For example, a few years ago we had a challenge-based learning model whereby we took students from the school of administration, examined the challenges of the country or a community, and generated the skills needed to solve the challenge. The student's training is done based on the challenges of their environment.</p><h4>How can the private sector, government, and education sector work to seek progress?</h4><p>Before, it was believed that individual effort generated good results. Fortunately, what we have understood is that if all actors work together, the impact is even greater. In the university, we work with all the actors. A single institution, whether public or private, can never generate an important impact in the country. To build a country, everyone has to be involved.</p><h4>What is the main challenge of the university, and what are its short-term goals?</h4><p>For the following years, the challenge is pedagogical innovation, which covers all dimensions. Colombia needs pedagogy. We firmly believe in personalized education because it means to understand the other as a person.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>EPN's history goes as far back as 1869. More than 150 years later, what role does the institution play in Ecuador's national development? </h4><p>Since its foundation, the university has had a defining impact on the scientific and technological development of Ecuador. EPN has advanced greatly over the years, introducing programs and career paths according to the needs of the country. For example, our students and teachers have been involved in the development of large hydroelectric plants, which are related to the main forms of energy production in Ecuador. Similarly, our professional play an active role in the development of other key sectors such as oil and agricultural. We have a faculty of chemical and agroindustrial engineering, and a food department that particularly focuses on native Ecuadorian products such as cocoa, providing, for example knowledge about the specific organoleptic properties related to the chemical composition</p><h4>What does the demand for jobs in the extractive sectors represent for the institution and how is it preparing the next generation to fulfill these roles?</h4><p>Since the 1970s, Ecuador's economy has been dominated by oil, and the institution has played a vital role in the development of the hydrocarbons sector ever since. The professionals who have graduated from the faculties of the petroleum, chemical engineering and other technical areas as mechanical, electrical and environmental engineering have gone on to assume important roles in Petroecuador as well as in foreign companies that have operations in Ecuador, such as Schlumberger, Halliburton and others.  In the latter cases, some of our graduates work in these institutions, in other countries. The experience that our graduates have gained over the years has been crucial to the development of Ecuador's hydrocarbons economy. Some of our graduates have also served the country as ministers and undersecretaries, for example.. Overall, the oil sector recruits the majority of our graduates. We are also planning to target more sectors. For example, we plan the restructuring of the faculty of geology to better serve the mining sector. In this sense, our primary focus is postgraduate programs because they lead to more opportunities in the job market; EPN offer the highest number of doctorate programs in Ecuador. We also offer several different master's degrees that allow professionals to can acquire more knowledge and do more research related to their fields.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your plan to form new partnerships with other international institutions?</h4><p>Improving the institution's international status is important to us. We have been developing our student exchange programs, giving our students the opportunity to present their ideas and projects or develop their final degree projects or thesis in other countries . Our professors also travel abroad to share  their research results. We also invite foreign professors to teach some courses. By improving the institution's standing on the international stage, we aim to attract more foreign students.<br>This also enables us to improve the content and quality of our programs. We are a public university and the majority of our students belong to low-income sectors. We are proud that the training and education we provide them gives them a global vision and transforms their lives and the life of their families and communities. Our agreements with foreign universities and international companies also play a key role in this. We want to further expand our international cooperation with countries and companies in Asia, for example.</p><h4>What are your goals for next year?</h4><p>Notably, we entered the QS World Universities Ranking in 2019. We are one of the four Ecuadorian universities in that list. EPN is also ranked highly by The Highest Education Ranking. Doing research in Ecuador is not easy; it can take months sometimes to acquire some materials. Therefore, one of our goals is to improve our research capabilities. Given the resources on offer, the work that our researchers do in the university is really admirable. So far, around 1,800 of our publications are available on the Scopus database. Just in 2018 alone we submitted 400 entries. These include key studies in different fields of science. Our students and faculty members do cutting-edge and important research, representing a big chunk of the university's contribution to the development of the country. In addition, we hope to improve communication with industry and productive sectors, to work on their specific needs. Under this perspective, we hope to increase the academic offer with new careers and postgraduate programs. Finally, we work on implementing entrepreneurship training in our students.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Colombia: Medical Cannabis Market Leaders]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[margarita-cabello-blanco-minister-justice-law]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps have the Ministry taken to speed up the process to award new licenses in medical cannabis? </h4><p>The Ministry of Justice and Law has been working on several actions to normalize the waiting time to obtain a license in their different modalities. Those actions range from the correct preparation of the physical archive for each request to the hiring of new personnel to evaluate each request. We have hired nearly 15 people, including documentation experts and lawyers, that have supported the process to award those licenses. We have gone through special working days to support each of the procedures related to the licensing process for some requests from 2018. As a result, we have been able to issue some licenses that allow the initiation of activities in an attempt to reduce the number of requests. The large number of requests was one of the challenges for our portfolio. Additionally, this Ministry has led training days for those people who submit a request, and also for those who have already filed their own requests in an attempt to reduce the error margin with requests. That can help us to speed up the revision and awarding process. We have also developed and implemented a mechanism for cannabis control (MICC by its Spanish acronym). The MICC includes certain control mechanisms, as well as follow-up tools.</p><h4>What strategies have you implemented to guarantee legal security for those international companies interested in this industry in Colombia?</h4><p>The government wants to modify the so-called decree 613, through which we are seeking to increase legal security through the strengthening of legal and technical requirements to obtain licenses. This is done not only to maintain control around cannabis harvest and production, but also to guarantee the profitability of foreign investment for the sake of the country itself. Additionally, the training provided to our public officials is seeking to provide them with tools to ensure they make the right decision, and thus minimize the number of possible mistakes during the entire process established to obtain a license. Right now, Colombia has one of the most robust and complete legal frameworks and has been acknowledged as such by the global industry. The new decree, which will be published soon, will increase that international prestige, which can be demonstrated with the experience we have gathered in the last three years through Act 1787 from 2016, which has allowed us to improve the rules of the game and boost the development of the cannabis industry.</p><h4>What are your views on medical cannabis not just for the national economy, but also to position Colombia as a global leader in this market?</h4><p>The interest of the industry in developing medical cannabis in the scientific and health sectors fills us with pride and obliges us to work every day to guarantee equal conditions for companies, in particular to support entrepreneurship for those who meet the security and quality conditions that the pharma industry require. This will allow them to maintain a good market position without forgetting the control that the government requires to develop such activities. As a government boosting the pharma industry, it has to lead us to be seen as global leaders thanks to the development of a product that has been stigmatized for years and today represents a good possibility for a sector that cannot only generate jobs, but also development and well-being for the entire society. I particularly consider that the cannabis sector must continue having the importance it has and is expected to have a significant impact in the country's economy. We want to support entrepreneurs and generate a healthy level of competition in the framework of equity in order to be seen as a large cannabis producer, but also the producers of a product of the highest quality. We expect this will attract more foreign investment. We must support the industry, but always respect the existing legal framework.</p><h4>Medical cannabis is a growing industry in Colombia and many sectors including the government are going through a learning and adaptation process. What are the lessons you have gained in that time period?</h4><p>Three years after the implementation of the Legislative Act 02 from 2009, we have experienced many experiences, among which we can highlight that it is necessary the continue study and training not only in legal areas, but also in technical parts and technological developments to be able to keep up the changing pace of this hectic industry. It was evidenced that the market needed to start through a research and development phase to become an industry that will end up manufacturing products that will cater into the market needs. In that sense, we have learned that this is a changing market and the decisions have to be made in short time periods at the most efficient manner possible, and we need to maintain a constant dialog among government entities and the industry to identify the needs and adopt the required regulatory changes. Also, we realized that the industry, as a general rule, quickly changes and regulation and the State cannot be left apart and must quickly readapt to real practice. Also, we need to adapt to new offers and proposals from the industry as long as they improve the regulatory framework and the environment in the private sector. That's why we are currently working on a decree to amend the current regulation and serve as a roadmap for the cannabis industry in the short and medium terms.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[abdul-rehman-shaikh-vice-president-education-e-solutions]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of AI in education, and what are the future skills that are associated with AI?</h4><p>In recent years, we have seen the adoption of AI applications, especially in the segment of computer vision, voice recognition, translations, and medicine. Today, education is the next sector bound to be redefined by AI. This is true especially through the adoption of machine learning (ML), which further branches out to supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. While the first two categories are tackled through the provision of preventive and corrective interventions, respectively, reinforcement learning, on the other hand, works on concept of a dynamic path based on rewards, learning tasks, and skills achievements. As such, the progressive and comprehensive nature of AI requires a different set of skills to be developed in order to be able to contribute to its development, adjust in the job market, and live fully and comfortably. These three types of skills correspond to three equal levels of knowledge of AI per se, but they all assume a certain basic degree of understanding of the matter to embrace the modern era ahead of us.</p><h4>What are the key aspects students will encounter in an AI-dominated higher education program?</h4><p>The benefits of AI and its impacts on the student experience across higher education are multiple, but perhaps they could be summed up into seven points." The benefits of AI and its impacts on the student experience across higher education are multiple, but perhaps they could be summed up into seven points. First of all, AI will change student lives by providing deep insights into academics and extra-curricular activities. Second, it will help students grow through expanded peer and social learning. Third, it will give prominence to awards and rewards since AI is becoming a growth enabler for success. Moreover, it will help students complete pre-requisites more easily as it acts as post-class tutor. It will also improve the processes of routine tasks and operations such as assignments and syllabus progression. AI will also allow for the integration of added-value practices such as institutionalizing student-led weekly or monthly class summaries and delivering lessons more seamlessly with real-time transcriptions in major languages. Finally, it will be used comprehensively across the accreditation, graduation and recruitment sphere, simplifying processes and increasing objectivity in making decisions. For these reasons, embedding AI into teaching curricula through supervised and unsupervised learning and incorporating AI technologies within learning environments are two essential steps to empower stakeholders in the education sector.</p><h4>How do you expect the relationship between teachers and students to evolve in the medium term?</h4><p>Rather than a threat to the teaching body, AI represents a great tool for teachers to harness and engage with as they work toward the development of their students. In this sense, AI will not replace teachers, but will connect teachers and students making learning more relevant and authentic. Students will be able to connect with AI as a companion that will provide feedback them, track them against other peers to have a clear path of their progress. AI will also provide personalized tutoring to reinforce skills or master ideas before an exam, providing students with the dynamic set of learning tools they will need for college success. Grading and academic advising can also be highly improved with AI, as it will allow students to be assessed through an automated system based on Rubrics for standardization processes and improve access to feedback and counseling through chatbots.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[<p>In 1989, fresh out of Bowling Green State University, Ohio (USA), Naser Al Nabulsi launched his career at the investment bank titan, Merrill Lynch. He hit the floor running, and has never looked back since. By the age of 27, he was the youngest First Vice President globally within Merrill Lynch. He then went on to be ranked the Top Performer in private banking within MENA, Asia and Europe and was also ranked as a top three performer globally. These rankings were awarded for several consecutive years. Other notable achievements during his 11 years with Merrill Lynch was the award of “Banker of the Year“ both in 1998 and 1999, out of 60,000 employees. Nabulsi also earned further notoriety when he spearheaded the structuring of a USD250 million aluminium linked commodity financing deal for DUBAL, the first of its kind globally in capital markets. It was recognized by IFR as “Deal of the Year,“ worldwide in 1997. In the year 2000, he was handpicked by the Private Office of HRH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, to build up the investment and asset management arm of the office. Al Nabulsi served as the Senior Investment Officer for the Executive Office (then known as TIO, The Investment Office), and as Head of Private Equity and Asset Management for the group. Al Nabulsi represented HRH Sheikh Mohammed's interests and investments globally. During his time working with the government from 2000-2005, he was given the challenging mandate to launch the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC). As the first CEO, he was charged with, and successfully developed the full strategy of the center, the real estate development, setting up the Exchange (Nasdaq Dubai), and attracting over 200 financial institutions to the Financial Centre. The DIFC quickly evolved to be one of the major financial centers in the world and one of the key pillars of Dubai.<br></p>]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<url><![CDATA[naser-nabulsi-vice-chairman-ceo-al-mal-capital]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which trends, such strengthening UAE-China ties and increasing limits on foreign ownership of banks, do you anticipate having the most influence? How do you foresee investors responding to these developments?  </h4><p>Among the global factors—US/China trade talks, US Elections, Global &amp; EM GDP growth indicators, oil prices, central banks action and Brexit have some influence on our regional financial markets. Local factors do have strong impact as well, including the increase in foreign ownership of banks in UAE which can have a meaningful influence by driving in passive inflows, especially because banks are generally heavyweights in Indices. However, there are other variables which can move share prices in the banking sector; this includes NIM (Net Interest Margin) evolution, asset quality, further M&amp;A/ consolidation, etc. Another factor is the leveling of off-plan sales for the real estate sector; it will be interesting to see if companies can stimulate demand at lower price points. Also, further reforms to help population growth (or at least stabilization), perhaps going away from the employer sponsorship regime, is another variable. Another one is increased sector diversification of our regional stock markets, especially in under-represented areas such as education, healthcare, airlines, retail chains, and F&amp;B. This could invigorate investor enthusiasm — however this will play out over a multiyear time period. Finally, Expo 2020 will feature prominently in the news over the coming year, and this is another important consideration.</p><h4>There are some saying that Expo 2020 will give a needed added boost to Dubai, particularly the financial sector. How do you assess Expo 2020's impacts on the economy and on the financial sector?  </h4><p>The main sectors benefiting from the Expo would be tourism (including hotels) and retail. Telecoms could get a short-term boost as well. Real estate companies would not benefit directly but would get a chance to promote their assets to a larger (and new) audience. We think the immediate benefit for the financial sector is limited. Over time, as concepts and ideas get commercialized, banks will be able to capitalize on intermediation both in lending activity and merchant banking activities (through the generation of fee income). Dubai aspires to be a financial hub—between Singapore and London. From this perspective, the Expo should have a role to play as it is a unique opportunity to showcase Dubai to the rest of the World.  </p><h4>How will Dubai reach its always increasing ambitions and pioneer the future of financial hubs? </h4><p>In 2019, Dubai has risen up the ranks of the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) to eighth position, representing its highest ever ranking. The city is the only financial center within Middle East Africa and South Asia (MEASA) region to appear within the top 10 rankings, placing it alongside other pivotal financial hubs such as London, New York, Hong Kong, and Singapore. With more than 24,000 professionals working across over 2,200 active registered companies, the DIFC comprises the largest and most diverse pool of industry talent in the region. DIFC's Wealth and Asset Management market which was reported to be USD424 billion in 2018 is equivalent to approximately 30% of the GCC's combined GDP. Dubai has consistently risen within the rankings since the Index was launched 12 years ago. The city's steady ascent has been driven by DIFC's remarkable success in building an ecosystem that fosters financial industry growth. DIFC key to success has been the continuous pursuit of excellence and a focus on innovation. DIFC strengths include the business environment, the access to human capital, its great Infrastructure and its reputation. Given the above, and considering the uniqueness of its regional positioning, transport infrastructure, lifestyle quality and tax-free environment, Dubai is well positioned to become the leading Financial Hub within the East-West corridor.</p><h4>How does Al Mal Capital seek to position itself as these new opportunities begin to take shape and the UAE looks to a rebound?  </h4><p>Al Mal is one of the leading financial institutions in the UAE and is uniquely positioned to benefit from Dubai expansion as a financial center. The breadth of our platform, our ESCA license and the backing of a strong shareholder (Dubai Investments) enable us to attract the best talents and to structure world-class financial products and solutions. Our platform is scalable which means that we can not only act as a hub for local and international product management but also as a local distributor of international 3rd party products. When it comes to UAE assets, Al Mal is well positioned across the value chain. For instance, Al Mal UAE equity fund has the best and longest track-record on the UAE equity market with an 80% out-performance since inception (2016). We have always been at the forefront of real estate and private equity investments and continue to invest in local assets mainly thanks to the support of Dubai Investments. We also believe that local and regional capital markets activity will soon recover, triggering renewed appetite for IPOs and new issues. We aim to play a major role thanks to our corporate advisory capabilities.  </p><h4>How are investor demands changing, and what is Al Mal Capital doing to adjust to new trends to prosper with your clients? </h4><p>In terms of investment solutions, clients continue to focus on three objectives: capital growth, yield and diversification. Ten years of sub-par global GDP growth, quantitative easing and zero / negative interest rate policy in developed markets considerably complicate the task of financial companies when it comes to achieve these targets. Indeed, Growth is a scarce resource and the price to pay for above average growth is becoming very expensive. Fixed income investments generate very low yield which is pushing clients into lower quality issues and less liquid products. Last but not least the correlation between asset classes is on the rise hence diminishing the benefits of diversification. One of the side effects of quantitative easing has been the rise of passive investing (ETFs) at the expense of active management. With ETFs (Exchange traded products) being a scale business, only a few mega players have been able to remain profitable on that segment. Beyond investment solutions, the behavior of clients is changing as well. The DIY (“do it yourself“) is becoming a key trend in our industry. Wealthy clients are very often successful entrepreneurs and they want to keep the lead on their investment decision. There is thus less appetite for delegation of portfolio management but increasing demand for high quality information and differentiated solutions. The rise of digitalization is enhancing this trend while creating a very different investor experience than in the past.  Financial companies need to adjust their value proposition would it be at the client interface level but also in terms of content and operational set-up. In the years to come, blockchain technology is likely to transform even further the financial industry through more decentralization and the rise of new asset classes. Al Mal Capital seeks to adapt its product offering and business model in order to effectively match the changing behavior and demand of our clients. We view the rise of digitalization and blockchain as a unique opportunity for nimble and creative franchises such as Al Mal Capital. Nevertheless, we realize that these trends are also creating challenges such as increased competition from non-traditional players (neo-banks, internet &amp; social media companies, etc.). Finally, a very important aspect of the financial industry is regulation. Since the global financial crisis in 2008, regulators have been deploying immense efforts to protect investors through imposing strict rules on investors risk profiling and the way financial products are managed and distributed. We view enhanced regulation as an opportunity as it creates the necessary barriers to entry. For instance, we have adapted the way our highly successful MENA equity offering is accessible to investors. While Al Mal equity fund domicile used to be local, our flagship strategy is now investable through a UCITS Luxembourg fund domicile. We also decided to partner with a European Group such as Azimut (USD 60 billion assets under management) to broaden our distribution capabilities. This implies that our investment strategy is now accessible to both retail and institutional investors in the Middle East, Asia, Australia, Latin America, and Europe. This is a major milestone in our journey to become the MENA equity manager of choice for international investors and achieve critical scale.</p><h4>2020 marks an impressive 15 years for Al Mal Capital. What are your strategic priorities and vision for Al Mal Capital as we look beyond 2020 and at the next decade?</h4><p>From day one, Al Mal Capital' vision has been to be considered as the investment institution of choice in the MENA region. We are among the few local institutions who have survived over the last 15 years. Still, we believe that we are only at the start of our story. There are tremendous opportunities ahead of us and we believe that we are uniquely positioned to seize them. Our first strategic priority is to serve our clients in the best way. This means that the whole firm needs to work hard and efficiently to deliver high-performing, differentiated and compliant solutions with impeccable client servicing. Nowadays, a financial company can only focus on a few verticals. We thus stick to our core offering which include direct investments, corporate advisory, asset management, and capital markets. While these services have been directed towards local clients, we believe the time has come to offer our capabilities to international investors as well. The Middle East region is going through major reforms including the accessibility of our regional capital markets to the rest of the world. The intention to float by Saudi Aramco and the recent inclusion of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in the major international indices showcase the strong willingness of Middle East leaders to promote the region as a destination of capital (instead of a source of capital). We believe it is part of Al Mal mission to facilitate international investments into the UAE and the Middle East.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>BASF Morocco is active in numerous segments, including agriculture, water treatment, chemicals, and automotive paints. What is the main role of BASF in the Moroccan economy?</h4><p>BASF provides raw materials and solutions for the industrial value chain here, so it truly creates value in Morocco and beyond. We provide the ingredients for local producers in Morocco and create value in terms of products, jobs creation, and innovation. This is the big differentiator in what BASF does in Morocco that others perhaps do not. We are not B2C; we are B2B. We work with most of the big players and medium-sized companies in Morocco. We call the mid-sized local companies our local champions. We also bring in know-how and the right sustainable solutions for growth. BASF's aim is not to sell products, but to sell the right products so that our customers can grow and differentiate themselves from the competition. We seek to give our customers an edge with the most up-to-date materials and solutions. We want to create value in the country. Our KPIs reflect this—we want to sell things that match our customers' needs and add value. We also help producers in Morocco expand their business geographically into places like South Africa and Gabon. We even produce in Morocco and export to sub-Saharan Africa. We also provide our customers with technical training and hold regular symposiums. BASF's agricultural division goes into the field with a caravan and shows farmers new technologies, helps them identify and combat diseases, and teaches them to increase their yields in a smart and responsible way. Our aim is not to flood the market with products, but to help the customer grow in a sustainable way. BASF builds long-term relationships.</p><h4>Who are BASF's main partners?</h4><p>They are in many sectors. Our partners are large players and the local champions in the paint sector and in the shampoo and detergent manufacturing segments. We also serve the companies using coatings and most of the local Moroccan brands manufacturing shoes and mattresses. We look at what these customers want, and if we do not have a ready-made solution, we customize a solution for them.</p><h4>BASF signed an exclusive agreement with PSA Maroc regarding e-coating and a brand-new production line. Can you tell us more about this tender?</h4><p>The strategy is to work hand-in-hand with our global key accounts, and PSA is a key account for BASF worldwide. Whenever PSA invests in a country, we work to help it because PSA knows our products, so there is no disruption to its production lines. This is a positive development because there are others that want to invest in Morocco because BASF is here, and we can provide them with technical and warehousing services and technical expertise. Companies also feel comfortable when they see other multinationals already established here.</p><h4>What AI and digital technologies and solutions is BASF using in Morocco?</h4><p>In Morocco, most of the digital trends we are following are related to agribusiness. We are fairly advanced in screening fields, identifying diseases at an early stage, and using the right solutions at the right time. This includes monitoring diseases and their spread and the application of treatments. This is extremely helpful because agriculture is a major pillar of Morocco's economy. Stopping the spread of agricultural diseases is extremely important. We also have to be careful with the responsible use of any solutions. In terms of digital technology, we also have online platforms where customers can order, pay, and arrange for delivery of products directly with us.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the current state of Morocco's agricultural sector?</h4><p>Morocco is fairly advanced compared to its neighbors. For instance, there is the Agriculture School in Meknes with excellent academic staff. We are only beginning, but three of our colleagues from Morocco are working in Germany and sharing their expertise. There is still a great deal to do in Morocco's agricultural sector and many people are investing heavily in agribusiness. What is still missing—but it is gradually arriving—is food processing and adding value to primary agricultural production. However, we are seeing more processed and bottled premium brands of olive oil, jam, biscuits, pasta, and the like. This is great because it creates value and jobs in Morocco and potentially exports.</p><h4>Do you see these locally processed foods appearing more in the mass production segment or in the health and high-quality brand segments of the Moroccan market?</h4><p>The beauty of processing food is in extending its shelf life and avoiding waste. This means the company will make more money and create more jobs. Some 20-30% of the harvest in Africa is thrown away because of the lack of options to store, preserve, or process it. However, Morocco is fairly advanced in food processing today, and growth is sizable. There are several promising projects.</p><h4>Would you expand on BASF's internal mobility program for its employees?</h4><p>Our job positions are open to anyone worldwide. If one has the right skills and competencies, they have the opportunity to apply. We have people in Germany, South Africa, France, and the UAE. BASF is a multinational. In our country cluster, we have people from Algeria, Brazil, and China. Our HR structure is mobile and based on skills and competencies. Diversity is a driver; it brings a great deal of new vision and ideas with it.</p><h4>Does BASF have any partnering programs with educational institutions here that the company takes talent from?</h4><p>We do, and we are extremely pleased with the level of education here. Most of our staff comes from public universities. The only problem at times is differentiating between three or four candidates because they are all excellent. There is absolutely no problem in Morocco.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for BASF in Morocco?</h4><p>We need more transparency regarding corporate issues like governance, tax, and customs duties. Having said that, with the Customs Authority one can get an answer or an appointment within two or three days. It listens to companies, gives a definitive answer, and even provides ideas on how to solve problems. However, in terms of the big picture, the ease of doing business is sometimes not that clear. We have addressed our concerns to the government many times, and their role is to change the system to create opportunities.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities at BASF for 2020?</h4><p>We have a business plan and have to reach those targets. These are mainly qualitative targets. We have growth in certain sectors that we want to achieve. The main target is to improve our footprint in the region by expanding into new countries or expanding certain activities in other countries. We are setting up small investments in Mali and Cí´te d'Ivoire in 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[Luis Miguel Morelli is an Attorney at Law from the “Universidad Externado de Colombia“ with a Master's degree in Comparative Law - MCJ from New York University (New York), and Macroeconomic Policy and Planning Studies at Northeastern University (Boston). He has worked in various positions in oil companies for 28 years: four in Ecopetrol, 14 in Occidental de Colombia, six in Azabache Energy and four as a member of the Board of Director of Solana Petroleum, Petromagdalena and Azabache Energy. During his almost three decades of corporate work, he stood out for playing several roles related to Oil &amp; Gas contracts, environmental law and indigenous community's management. He was elected by popular vote as Governor of Norte de Santander, a position he held between January 2004 and December 2007. His work was highlighted on several fronts: he took first place in fiscal management in 2005; he was National Culture Prize in 2007; built 40 irrigation districts in the four years, the same number that the department had in its 97-year history; significantly recovered the department's energy mining sector; and had timely management of relations with its neighbors of the State of Táchira, Venezuela, among others. After completing his responsibilities as Governor, Morelli returned to the hydrocarbons sector, this time as an advisor and member of the boards of directors of several Canadian oil companies. Currently, he holds the Presidency of the National Hydrocarbons Agency since September 20th, 2018.   <br>

		<title><![CDATA[15 Contracts for Caribbean Exploration]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[luis-miguel-morelli-navia-president-national-hydrocarbons-agency]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do alliances with institutions such as Dimar continue to increase the scientific knowledge of the national maritime territory and the development of off-shore explorations?</h4><p>Entities like Dimar have excellent knowledge of the Caribbean Sea and have good tools to develop the exploration programs in the Caribbean Sea. We are taking advantage of the capacity of those institutions in order to increase the knowledge of the Caribbean Sea for different things, for example, making agreements for Piston Core and bathymetry. The idea is to have efficient agreements or a better understanding of those institutions that can give us the opportunity to have a better knowledge of the Caribbean Sea.</p><h4>What is your perspective of the project to be carried out in the Colombian Atlantic for the deepest offshore well in Latin America?</h4><p>In 2018, we found that the former government had spent three years negotiating the E&amp;P contract model for offshore. There were four matters that did not allow the companies to accept that E&amp;P contract model. We quickly decided to just face them, and with the support of President Duque's high consultant, we carried out our program to get the model approved by the Board of Directors of ANH. Immediately, we started to sign contracts and form the conversions for the technical agreement in the E&amp;P contracts for the development of the real exploration in the drilling program and also for the terms and conditions of the production phase. In that way, at that time we received the commitment of big companies like ExxonMobil, Repsol, and Shell. We were fortunate to materialize the entry of an important worldwide off-shore operator, Noble Energy. Right now, it is committed to drilling the deepest well in the Caribbean Sea. We are also providing support to obtain the environmental license that will allow them to spot the well in the first week of June 2020. Now, we have six contracts signed for E&amp;P in the Caribbean Sea plus seven contracts that were assigned before. In our administration, we signed investment agreements for USD140 million in two exploratory wells that will not be as deep though they are still important exploration wells. Ecopetrol and Petrobras will drill them in 2020. Those seven contracts currently represent an investment of USD1.8 billion for the next three or four years for the two initial phases of the exploration period of the contracts. We want to open a new province for oil and gas extraction. It is mainly expected to have gas, though companies are also expecting to find liquids.</p><h4>What is your interpretation of the arrival of multinationals such as Petrobras or Oxy to carry out these offshore actions in the Colombian territory?</h4><p>It is important for us to confirm that those major companies and major worldwide players are interested in Colombia. The projection of our Caribbean Sea will be confirmed when those companies arrive. If those five or six companies are committed to investing more than USD1.8 billion in the next three or four years, that means they see something interesting in our Caribbean Sea, and we are extremely pleased to have them. The technology and the capital that they can allocate in Colombia will be important for the development of the new gas province.</p><h4>What are ANH's goals to further boost the reactivation of the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>There is no unique recipe for the reactivation of the oil and gas industry in Colombia. The first and urgent measure has been taken, and now we have those commitments in exploration. Some adjustments to the regulation to agreement number 2, 2017, the regulation of oil and gas in Colombia are yet to be made; some of which include the opportunity for small and medium-sized companies to come to Colombia. It consists of coming back to the original inauguration of the oil and gas policy in Colombia, back in 2003, when ANH was created. We want small companies that can bring small investors, between USD6 and 12 million, to reactivate fields that have been closed because of the non-economic rewards for large companies. It is expensive for Ecopetrol to produce a field with 300 or 400bpd; many of those fields are in the hands of Ecopetrol but ANH has some fields that we want to put out again for the investors. Before doing so, we need to modify the regulation because there are extremely high requirements for companies to work in Colombia. Also, when the oil prices fell, there was a big consolidation of companies with experienced professionals. Those companies, being new, are not allowed to participate in the oil and gas business in Colombia. Now, we want to modify the regulation to allow those small companies to participate in small projects. We will be close to increasing production to 15,000-20,000bpd by the end of 2020, which is important for Colombia. It is a solid percentage of the production year in Colombia. We need to be the most competitive country in the region and to have the best E&amp;P model contract for investors. We also want to be the country that supports investors the most, not only being a regulator but being a real, strategic partner going with the companies to the regions and solving problems with the communities. We want to resolve the environmental processes and permits and support companies to get them to comply with the commitments of the contractor. Now, the idea is to go worldwide to make the promotion of the country in areas or in places where we have never been. Generally, investment from Canada or the US was enough. The real engine of the oil and gas industry in Colombia has been TSX in Canada. However, now, we need to go to China, India, Russia, Australia, and the Middle East like Dubai and Abu Dhabi. That is the challenge for next year. We need to be global, showing that we have the best terms and conditions and the best E&amp;P contract for investment. We must also take advantage of the political problems in Venezuela, Mexico, Argentina, Ecuador, and Bolivia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[felix-ortega-ceo-barcelona-activa]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Barcelona Activa evolved since it was founded in 1986?</h4><p>Barcelona Activa was originally established as an agency to develop employment policies after the crisis in the 1980s. At that time, Spain was a newly-formed democracy, so everything had to be built. Unemployment was high across the country, but our political leaders of then had a vision to make Barcelona a global city, so they knew we had to create and attract economic activity. In a simple way, our role has evolved over the last 30 years, from helping people find employment to helping them find quality jobs.</p><h4>What do you do for the youth of Barcelona?</h4><p>Spain has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in Europe. This is why we offer a number of trainings and courses, especially to develop their digital skills. Barcelona is known as an innovation hub and companies come here to seek digital talent, however we do not only focus on young people but also on older people. In November 2019, we celebrated 20 years of the Ciberní rium, a large academy that provides training for all the sectors, from basic digital technologies, to the more specialized ones.</p><h4>What are the different groups of people you train?</h4><p>We work in the basic education system, helping children learn the basic competences in different areas. Beyond that, people of all ages from many sectors come to us for continuous education and training. Digital transformation is cross-cutting, so all sectors of the economy must become digital, even the traditional ones. At Barcelona Activa, we develop capacities of a diverse group of people.  We work with small- and medium-sized enterprises. We also provide online training for individuals. In a parallel effort, we are trying to leverage major events such as Mobile World Capital Barcelona and bring them closer to the general public. A couple of years ago, we offered some tours to the commercial sector to come to the Mobile World Congress and to look for solutions they could adopt.</p><h4>How do you foster innovation for the biotech and medtech sector?</h4><p>There has been a strategic focus from the Catalonian government and even the Spanish government to develop research centers. To enhance this sector, we must develop new strategies to incentivize universities, companies, and the public sector to work together. We want to collaborate with all the public and private initiatives. For example, we give support to the Pasqual Maragall Foundation or the ICFO, both centers for different types of research. Even the zoo itself is developing a new plan to become a research center. But we are more focused on software and hardware start-ups and companies; so it makes more sense for us this way of promoting biotech and medtech.</p><p>What initiatives are in place for companies and start-ups?</p><p>We work with the Barcelona Tech City or the Caní²drom or Barcelona Global or the 22@ network associations, especially to develop those actions related to the strategic sectors. To make things easier for professionals that come from startups, we have incubators and twelve facilities. Some of these are Glí²ries, Almogí vers, Technology Park, and Mediatic. We also have spinoffs from some universities and research centers. Additionally, we can also provide SMEs help with grants, support programs or landing facilities.</p><h4>Why do you think is it useful to have all the companies in one place? </h4><p>Around 80% of the projects that originated in our incubators are still running, which is a very high rate. I believe clustering allows firms to access high-quality services and networks, and create synergies.</p><h4>Do you have partnerships with other agencies?</h4><p>We have collaboration partnerships with Fukuoka from Japan and Kigali from Rwanda. The latter developed the Smart Africa program. We also partner with programs for entrepreneurs with hubs or other cities around the world. And of course with the Barcelona metropolitan area agency.</p><h4>What other programs do you offer beyond the training courses?</h4><p>I have been visiting all Barcelona Activa's facilities and incubators and learning a lot from what they are doing. We have a lot of programs, so it is hard to pick just a couple. We have a leadership program called LIDERA for women. Another one is STEAM program, which is an excellent educational program for boosting vocations in children and women. All of our programs have two missions and one is being inclusive.</p><h4>What are some of your main challenges?</h4><p>First, trying to make projects accessible to all kinds of people and not to leave anyone behind. In a parallel effort, a challenge is bringing projects closer to all areas of Barcelona. Another challenge is thinking and planning in the long-term toward our 2030 agenda and beyond. Since we are a public entity, there is a tendency to think in electoral terms, meaning the next four years. We need to have a strategic idea of what we want to do for the city. Our third main challenge is how to make Barcelona Activa sustainable in terms of size, workload, and selection of the appropriate projects.

		<title><![CDATA[More than 1,000 Members]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[pau-guardans-i-cambo-president-barcelona-global]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Barcelona Global founded, and how has it evolved?</h4><p>Barcelona Global is an association created eight years ago after a group of entrepreneurs and prominent people in Barcelona felt the city was losing its momentum as a global city. We decided to create an association that is fully private and completely open in terms of representing different sectors, from large to small companies, culture to economics, and artists to entrepreneurs, with the clear mission of bringing more talent and economic activity into the city. Now, we have more than 1,000 members, partly because of the work we have done and partly because of people worrying about the future of Barcelona. When people get worried they have two reactions: stay at home or commit themselves to solving the problem and getting involved.</p><h4>What is your take on the talent pool in Barcelona, and what solutions is Barcelona Global offering?</h4><p>Barcelona without a doubt is a city of talent, both in terms of provisions and attractions. Our challenge is not to be a city of talent, but to develop and grow this local talent since one of the major problems we face is that after people succeed here, many move on. It is also to attract the right mix of talent, which means we do not just have to be attractive to a certain type of talent, such as digitally talented young people, but also to other types. Today, talent is much more important than capital for growth. In order to achieve this growth, we must work on the type of ecosystem and landscape to maintain our locally generated talent and continue to attract international talent to come to Barcelona in every field, age, and stage of development.</p><h4>What is it about the atmosphere in the city that generates such entrepreneurship?</h4><p>It is a mixture of soft and hard things. It is both a mixture of natural resources, weather, lifestyle, quality of life, and culture here as well as a fantastic education network. For example, in October we celebrated MBA day at Barcelona Global, with more than 600 MBA students from 55 countries now attending three fantastic business schools here: IESE, ESADE, and EADA, each of which are ranked in the top 30 European institutions, not merely in business, but also engineering, design, and other subjects. If one has the right natural conditions, a well-trained workforce, and a flexible and open-minded ecosystem that creates the right conditions, then things happen. There was a huge barrier to that in the past, namely access to capital, because investors were not looking at Barcelona. Fortunately, however, this has changed, and there is a great deal of interest from investors to come here. All the pieces are there.</p><h4>What initiatives or tangible services do you offer your members?</h4><p>We do three different kinds of things. The first is strategic thinking regarding Barcelona as a global city, which means identifying the challenges Barcelona can improve upon in its mission to be more attractive for talent and the economy. That opens a wide range of things, such as how a city like Barcelona can manage tourism, resolving the affordable housing problem that many successful cities face, improving the tax portfolio for foreigners that want to work here, and getting the public and private sectors to cooperate on culture, science, and medicine. One of the things one discovers being a global city is that they share problems with other successful global cities such as Paris, London, and New York. One can learn a lot by looking at others. Secondly, we get involved in many projects to implement ideas that came from this strategic thinking. Finally, we are working with the international press to rebuild the reputation of the city by bringing the press here, not to deny the political turmoil, which is part of our current landscape, but to explain that beyond that, Barcelona has much more to offer.</p><h4>How is Barcelona Global structured?</h4><p>As a private association, we are a strictly governed association, which means the chairman and executive committee have to change every two years. This is extremely demanding for the chair, but it is fantastic because it gives the opportunity for people like me, who have their own business and agenda, to be part of the story for a time. We also have an executive committee that has to approve every new project. Once that has done that, we open it to our partners to decide who would like to take part and get involved.</p><h4>Does Barcelona need more diversification away from just innovation?</h4><p>The idea of cities being oriented to one activity is part of a vision of what is happening today because people work both for Barcelona and from Barcelona. For example, there are people working for the market here who might concentrate on the digital world or tourism. However, something interesting that is happening in Barcelona is that people are moving to Barcelona to work remotely. If we want to succeed as a global hub in the long term, we have to create the conditions that will help remote workers serve the whole world, which means a well-connected airport, excellent infrastructure, a high quality of life, affordable housing, and a respectable health system. It does not mean all our resources and work should go to a single project like 5G. You have to create the conditions for things to happen, and if you create them things will happen.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would describe the vice ministry's scope within the mining sector?</h4><p>In November 2018, after administrative changes to the cabinet by presidential decree, the sector was underrepresented and deserved higher prominence within the government's agenda. The minister established the importance of the vice ministry and its significance. Since its creation, we have been one of the busiest vice ministries because of our constant travel to meet prospective investors and visit existing mining sites in what is expected to be the highest growth potential industry in Ecuador. To ensure the success of mining, we want it to include both major economic players and small artisanal mining sites or related activities. It is crucial that we properly regulate the industry setting the ground rules of operation and prevent illegal mining. Historically, mining has played a major role in the economic development of the country. In 2018, we exported up to USD278 million from mining products, and in 2019 we started large-scale exporting activity at Fruta del Norte and Mirador. We are defining the right mining policy and industrial regulation to develop the National Mining Development Plan and Mining Public Policy, which became official in May 2019. It serves as a roadmap for the industry's development and is based on six main principles giving paramount relevance to two important concepts: social and environmental sustainability and prevention of and engagement against illegal mining. To attract interests from important markets, we need to comply with harmonious and sustainable policies set by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and its 10 production principles. In addition, we pioneered the operation of state policy to orchestrate the joint work of all stakeholders to address the issue and work coherently and cohesively to combat these activities. We have defined our mining development plan and set the industry's objectives toward 2030, enabling us to plan for the short- and long-term outlook of the sector. Besides our policy work, we also provide oversight of the other three mining institutions attached to the ministry: the Mining Control and Regulation Agency (ARCOM), the National Mining Company (ENAMI EP), and the National Energy and Geology Research Institute (IIGE).</p><h4>2019 represented a major shift in the economic significance of mining. What impact do you expect from the shift from small and artisanal mining to industrial mining?</h4><p>For 2020, we expect 500% growth and predict exports of over USD1.3 billion due to major economic groups starting business and the sector shifting to large-scale mining sites and production. To achieve this growth, many projects need to come fruition, such as the USD59-million Rí­o Blanco project, which was inactive in 2018 because of administrative and legal reasons. Looking at 2021, we want to grow our referential current value by seven times to reach USD1.8 billion, including the USD271-million Loma Larga project. These are existing or realistically submitted projects that we can forecast. There are many other potential projects in our pipeline, such as the Cangrejos project by Lumina, for example. Cangrejos could actually be the first project to open business with a 16-year production plan and potential of up to 256,000 annual gold ounces entering the list of the 32 largest gold projects globally. On the side of Cascabel by SolGold, we would set global standards by becoming a major global copper and gold producer and the largest or second-largest silver exporter in the world. That is our current outlook and deserving of the spotlight placed on it within Ecuador's economic development planning. We are proud that up to USD300 million has been paid in royalties since 2015; this is proof of the confidence of private contractors and concessionaries in the long-term profitability and sustainability of their operations.</p><h4>How is the vice ministry hoping to advance the national mining cadaster project to open new opportunities for mining players?</h4><p>By 2020, we expect to complete the evaluation of the current state of the existing lands and permits in the national cadaster, thus allowing the institution to better manage mining rights and concessions. We have established strict requirements for interested parties to request and access mining rights and open businesses. We defined a 30-day window from the time of submission for the applicant to deliver all enabling documents for the application to be considered for approval, removing previous gaps that led to corruption in the process. Thus far, we have cleared 2,939 applications out 6,500 that did not meet the set standards or complied with the existing rule. The rest are ongoing processes that would benefit from the completion of the cadaster project. We are working alongside experts from the World Bank and non-refundable funding from the Interamerican Development Bank in the development of the cadaster platform and management of the industry's activities. We hope to complete the opening of the cadaster and creation of its software platform by mid-2020 with a complete different set of procedures and rules with optimal world-class standards for all elements involved in mining development including, but not limited to, a strengthened tendering process and removing intermediaries in cadaster permit requests. For 3Q2020, we expect a mining round with our revamped system and policies to attract major players to invest in our country.</p><h4>What message does the vice ministry want to send to the international economic community to promote investment in the sector?</h4><p>It is increasingly evident that every mining stake holder is looking at Ecuador's economic potential in the sector. From regulators to major players' testimonies, everyone is aware we have evolved and improved the sector and the national investment landscape establishing high standards and clear investment ground rules for companies to come to Ecuador. From the ministry, our message is crystal clear: Every major player is considering investing in Ecuador's mining sector today. The prime economic conditions are a reality in Ecuador right now. We constantly receive scouting trips from literally every top 10 company in the sector worldwide looking to invest in the country. More than an option or alternative market, investing in Ecuador is a must for the sustainable future economic growth of every major mining company in the world. We have established clear transparency policies with zero tolerance for any possible corruption and have removed all gray areas. The ministry has assigned a taskforce to work alongside all other stakeholders on the issues that fall out of our ministry's scope to ensure a government-wide coherent policy working toward the same goals and based on the same strategy. The mindset and misconceptions of foreign economic investors have changed because we have changed, and we are ready and open for business. We are convinced that by 2030, mining will become the cornerstone of Ecuador's economy, though we must make sure the industry's development happens in sustainable terms and while preserving our environment and positively improving the livelihoods of Ecuadorians.</p>]]></richbody0content>

He graduated in corporate economics from the Universit&agrave; Bocconi in Milan. Professional activities commenced in 1980 in the field of merchant banking, when he founded Finanziaria Internazionale Holding SpA., which today is one of the most innovative among Italy's financial institutions. In December 2014 Finint acquired a bank, and then grouped all the investment banking activities under the single roof of this new bank, named Banca Finint, of which he is Chairman. On June 1, 2000 he was appointed Chairman of SAVE. Originally the company was responsible only for managing the Marco Polo airport in Venice; SAVE has since branched out, and has become a modern group for the provision of services to passengers at mobility infrastructures. It has also raised the Marco Polo airport to the status of one of the top three intercontinental airports in Italy. Under his presidency, SAVE first created Venice and Treviso Airport System, and then, in 2014, the North East's Airport System including also Verona and Brescia.</p>]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SAVE Group manages the North-East airport system. How do the four airports in your network complement each other?</h4><p>First and foremost, we try to satisfy the demand of air transportation of each area: every airport has its own goals according to the area it belongs to. In particular, Venice and Treviso may almost be defined as a single airport with two runways. Treviso focuses on low-cost carriers; over 80% of the traffic is by low-cost companies. Venice, instead, has network carriers, international airlines, as well as companies doing intercontinental flights. Venice is one of the three Italian intercontinental airports, together with Rome and Milan. Since 2000, we have been adding new destinations, and we currently have a number of destinations in North America, the Middle East, and Asia. Verona is focused on the passengers in its area, including the Garda region—a very important location both business-wise, as it has many industries, and touristic-wise. Besides the ones in Veneto, we are also stakeholders of Charleroi Airport in Belgium.</p><h4>One of the group's main focuses is to deliver the EUR900-million 2012-2021 master plan. Can you give us a brief overview of where the plan stands today?</h4><p>We have already invested around EUR500 million for the development of the terminal connection with the dockyard and for the makeover of the main runway. We also brought the secondary runway to the B category level; this means these two are complementary runways, where a plane can land with zero visibility. In the coming four years we are planning, with an average investment of EUR100 million per year, to complete the investment's cycle, which will be focused mainly on the improvement of the terminal and on the plant engineering of the runway.</p><h4>In 2018, Venice Airport's traffic hit 11 million passengers. What drove this result, and what is your strategy to further increase this number in the years ahead?</h4><p>The results stem especially from the acknowledgment of not having a strong national airline and thus having to fill this gap. We looked all over the world for companies that could be interested in Venice as a transportation hub. That is why we chose international companies, and two of them are based in Venice. We now have seven planes by Volotea and seven by easyJet that are based here. We have over 50 companies flying to over 100 destinations from Venice. For the future, we aim to continue working on these lines—we have a pipeline of intercontinental destinations including Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Miami—continue to increase the frequency of flights, and improve the connections. The short and medium-haul flights will be operated both by traditional carriers that serve their hubs and by low-cost carriers that serve point-to-point segments, and the long-haul flights by international companies. We have started a program, called Venice Connects, with the goal of easing connections between short and long-haul flights. Venice can not only be a point-to-point airport, but also an airport that helps Venice make a huge step forward from a connection point of view. Passing by Venice could be a good and useful alternative to go to the south of Italy, Croatia, and the Balkans. We implemented a system that eases the loading of luggage to connecting flights, and an insurance package in case of missed connection flights. Even airlines have realized the importance of this project and engaged with it.</p><h4>EUR6.5 million of the master plan were invested in sustainability. Can you tell us more about this?</h4><p>This is another one of our focuses: constant, durable, and sustainable growth. We place great importance to the relations with the territory. There are many things we are working on. One is the level 3 carbon accreditation from ACI Europe, which we obtained a long time ago. The other crucial goal for 2050 is getting to zero net carbon dioxide emissions; we committed to this in Cyprus spring 2018, and it is a very important pillar for us.</p><h4>What is the role of the Venice airport for the region?</h4><p>A big and efficient airport is a pre-condition for the development of a certain region. We are one of the biggest companies in the region: for every 1 million passengers, about a thousand jobs are created. This means that today, by reaching 11.3 million passengers, we have created over 11,000 jobs. Besides this, there is a less direct spin-off, which is the airport's function in increasing the accessibility of local companies, as well as tourism. Venice is overcrowded but this is especially because most come and go in one day. Passengers coming by air usually stay longer and spend more. In this sense, the airport is a machine that creates development and employment.</p><h4>What should we expect in the next 12 months?</h4><p>In 2020, we will start discussing a new master plan with the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), so we will consider the new investment cycle that will go beyond the ones we have already in place. I see a great future for the SAVE Group and its airports. I am proud to say that the aviation and airport sector is the only sector among the public utility ones where Veneto was able to build a system. We showed it is possible to have four airports and manage them in an efficient way, making them a model for the rest of the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your first manufacturing plant in Africa, when it will be up and running, and how you financed the investment?</h4><p>Shalina is the market leader in sub-Saharan African pharmaceuticals, with a 35 year track record in providing quality medicines at affordable prices. No other company has our heritage, reach and presence. In Nigeria we have been one of the fastest growing companies in the last five years, with our brands such as Ibucap, Epiderm, Shal'artem, Polygel, Hemoforce, Shaltoux, Tanzol, and Super Apeti becoming highly valued and trusted by our customers, pharmacists, and doctors. We have long wanted to have local manufacturing in Africa, but we didn't want it to compromise our core values of quality, affordability, and availability. The decision to set up our first African plant in Nigeria was based on the potential of the Nigerian market, where we envisage our business to grow significantly in the next five years, and the resources available in the country. I am pleased to represent the company in a country where we will put up our first factory in Africa. The first brick of the factory was laid at the end of November and we will complete the plant by December 2020. That is a rapid turnaround. Hopefully, moving forward the government and different bodies will continue to take steps to encourage further investments in the country. The financing for the facility has come from a significant equity investment from the Group supported by a loan from the Bank of Industries.</p><h4>What challenges are you encountering?</h4><p>The challenges are no different to building a plant in many other countries, from securing sufficient land with the right access through to planning, regulatory approvals and environmental compliance. We are building this plant to meet WHO-GMP certification, so we need to make sure all of this is done right.</p><h4>How will the new plant change operations for Shalina and the sector?</h4><p>Shalina Healthcare has large ambitions, and local manufacturing is a key part of that. We want to be supporting the local economy not just with the quality of our products but through jobs and investment. In Nigeria the authorities have looked to encourage investment in the pharmaceutical space by offering reduced import tariffs for manufacturers or banning some products from import. With this plant we can manufacture locally, remain cost competitive with Indian and Chinese imports while providing our customers with essential medicines that they can trust. With a WHO-GMP certification, we will be manufacturing to a very high quality — and we want our customers to be proud of the 'Made in Nigeria' badge.</p><h4>How will Nigeria progress in local manufacturing in the short term and what problems do you expect to still exist?</h4><p>We would hope to see further incentives provided by the Nigerian authorities to both encourage local manufacturing and reward those who have already invested. We want to see a self-sufficient Nigerian pharma market with strong regulation, and everyone manufacturing to the same standards we set of ourselves. We think this will happen long-term but in the short-term expect a continuation of the same challenges faced to date — macroeconomic volatility, lack of infrastructure, insufficient incentives, competition from lower quality imports and local companies, and sadly, the ongoing presence of counterfeits.</p><h4>How do you compete against fake drugs available at low cost?</h4><p>Low-cost counterfeits are sadly found across all of Africa, and are a problem for all pharmaceutical companies and of course the end-consumers. However, as we only sell to sub-Saharan Africa, we are perhaps more focused on addressing these fakes than many other companies exporting from India and China. Moreover, as one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in sub-Saharan Africa, we have several advantages that help us address the problem better than most. Firstly, we use our scale and our end-to-end distribution to maximize our efficiency, meaning that our own products are themselves affordable as well as being high quality. Second, we have teams in India and China looking to stop the manufacture and export of fakes at the source. Third, we are always looking to innovate, either with technology or packaging enhancements, to make it harder for fakers to copy our own products. Finally, we have large, on-the-ground sales teams which give us a significant advantage — our retail and wholesale customers know that they are buying direct from Shalina, and in turn we can educate them on what to look out for. We also host a lot of community activities, including malarial camps, de-worming camps and market clinics, where we work with teams of doctors to address the medical needs of those who don't typically have access to health professionals or medicines. Our market clinics can see as many as 700 people in a day, and we use these opportunities not just to provide free medicine but to educate these patients on what to look out for. In a country like Nigeria, it is indeed a very difficult task to tackle the menace of Fakes. From our side, we seek to create value and use that as a differentiator from the rest of the competition. Our perfectly capable team on ground, spread across the length and breadth of the country ensuring connect with the last mile of distribution so that the correct products reach in the hands of the end user. Be it in terms of our brand presence at the Retail or even through the various initiatives we undertake in the different markets and channels we operate in; we always seek to bring about the element of value to position Shalina differently. For example, through our unique Shalina Preferred Partner Program (SP3), in retail we have gone beyond providing just profits for the partner but are now creating well-being and health security for them. There are also Shalina Market Clinics which we carry out across the country where we seek to create value with relevance. A group of doctors does free health check-up, prescribe medication and mostly provide free Shalina medicines to approximately 400-500 patients (with conditions of fever, body pain, malaria, or even anemia) in each such clinic who otherwise are deprived of such facilities in their proximity. Considering the high prevalence, they are also checked for diabetes even though we do not have a diabetes portfolio. Our other initiatives include de-worming camps, anemia-detection camps, antenatal camps (designed especially for women), where we engage nurses and physicians together with our partner pharmacy customers and hospitals. The enthusiasm and gratitude of all such stake-holders are not only significant to our successful journey so far but also helps us maintain ourselves as an organization with a difference.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[25-Well Drilling Program]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[marcela-vaca-torres-general-director-geopark]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what do you attribute your recent growth?</h4><p>We recently released our results for 3Q2019. Our consolidated oil and gas production grew by 6% to 39,619 boepd. We are getting closer and closer to our goal of increasing production in Colombia by around 15%. We have improved our revenue and increased our production on the back of our drilling program, which includes 25 wells. We have increased production with our work-over program and with our new discovery and development wells.</p><h4>How will the new oil discovery open up new operations in the country?</h4><p>We are still testing, so we cannot anticipate anything beyond the limits of our block. As with any new discovery, we aim to get as much information as we can. This is the case with every exploration well we drill. Guaco may or may not open new areas of exploration within Llanos 34 block but will certainly provide new information regarding how our structure works. That is a day-to-day operation. We will probably drill the last well 20 years from now and will still be obtaining information. The industry is interested in increasing exploration activities in the new blocks awarded by the ANH and, accordingly, GeoPark expects to lead new discoveries in the Llanos basin.  </p><h4>What added value does GeoPark bring to the consortium it is involved in?</h4><p>We are good partners for a number of reasons. Particularly in Colombia, it was Ecopetrol that decided to share with us our competitive advantages. It has designated Hocol to grow and operate in the Llanos basin. In order to grow, Hocol decided to look for operationally efficient partners. We have been talking with them for a while. The success of Llanos 34 is evident, not only in geological terms, but in terms of the speed at which it was developed, the cost at which it is being produced, and the social management of above-ground risks. When we started working with Hocol we realized that we have similarities, despite the fact that Ecopetrol is a national oil company. Hocol is also an agile operator, is knowledgeable about the above-ground risks, and has an excellent geological team. It was the right fit. At Geopark we are constantly looking for new projects and Ecuador's Oriente Basin, one of the most prolific in Latin America, is a good example of that. Ecuador is a great opportunity for us to expand our operations and continue working towards our long-term goal of becoming the leading independent Latin American oil and gas company.</p><h4>How have you seen good practice in the industry rise over the years?</h4><p>We still have a lot to do. After the 2015 crisis, companies learned a lot. We learned to manage our costs and be cautious with our investments. This is the only thing that is going to keep us alive in the long term. Because of the nature of our business, companies like us have a long-term view. We have all learned that the world is changing, and the industry needs to focus more on ESG practices. If we want to be sustainable and think of future generations, the industry can be a great contributor to that purpose. The industry learned and is willing to contribute more.</p><h4>What has positively impacted GeoPark in terms of reducing operational costs and improving its operations throughout the country?</h4><p>We do a number of things. Operational efficiency is important, as is cost control and the speed at which we do things. The decision-making process is pretty agile, helping us become even better operators. We are in Colombia and five more countries with the idea of staying for the long term. We do not have the vision of a fund or explorer. We are explorers, operators, consolidators, and good risk managers, all of which is embedded in our culture and business model. In Llanos 34 we have been working very hard on our commercial strategy to improve our commercial netbacks. That has been proving very efficient. We have been reducing and will further improve our costs. The flowline that connect our Jacana field with the Oleoducto de los Llanos (ODL) will be converted into a pipeline soon so we will be able to transport more types of crude. We are also working on the way we manage risk economically, as well as our social strategy and our ESG strategy. There is a lot to do, but it all comes together in the way we do things and it really makes a difference.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[25 Years in Colombia]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[juan-carlos-hincapie-ceo-cgp-region-teleperformance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Teleperformance boosted the growth of the IT and BPO sector in Colombia, and what is next for the company?</h4><p>Teleperformance is a great company because it is difficult to stay in the Colombian market for 25 years. We have a great deal of knowledge to share. Colombia is becoming a global market to the services industry, and we are developing the talent and understanding the processes and technology. We have a very strong footprint to leverage this knowledge for the world. We have been growing significantly as an industry in Colombia and as a company. The Colombian IT/BPO industry is doubling or tripling every three years. I have no doubt we will continue to ensure Colombia has its fair share in the international environment because we have a great deal to say about customer experience in the world.</p><h4>How has Teleperformance promoted human talent both in Colombia and abroad over the last 25 years?</h4><p>When one understands services, they start to see that this is a beautiful combination of process, technology, and people. Having a disciplined and customer-service oriented labor force plus a company with strong processes and technology means we have a beautiful blend, like a good wine. We work with new economy companies, healthcare, insurance, and banks; we can do whatever we want to do for the world. Our services are not only for the American market, but also Latin America and Europe. Some 30% of Teleperformance's employees in Colombia service Spain, so that shift comes in to work at 2am. That is a completely different environment and profile.</p><h4>Are there any particular cities that have attracted Teleperformance's attention for expansion and investment?</h4><p>Currently, 45% of our labor force is in Medellí­n and 55% in Bogotá. Before YE2019, we will launch in a third city, Tunja. We will have a presence in a fourth city, though that location is still under discussion. In 2019, we also started having agents working from home. Teleperformance's target is to have 1,000 home-based employees by YE2019. We already have 700-plus people working from home in Colombia in nine different cities. Moreover, we have people working in Colombia's coffee and Caribbean regions and in the east of the country toward Venezuela. We are big into investing in expanding the company, including in Bogotá and Medellí­n. We have a huge expansion project because there is a great deal of space to cover in the international markets and many opportunities—we are still small. In fact, Colombia is just starting to acquire its fair share of the global customer service. We are putting our talent out there. Many companies would love to have Colombia's people, happiness, and pride. We want to connect this with the world.</p><h4>How has Teleperformance handled such a diversified portfolio of client sectors, global markets, and services?</h4><p>That makes us strong—having such a strong Spanish and English hub for the world. We cover the European Spanish market and Latin American countries. We have clients in Argentina, Chile, Panama, Mexico, Central America, and the Andean countries, and another part of our business is extremely important to US companies. Teleperformance is extremely diverse, and this makes us strong because in business, markets will vary—some will slow down and others will evolve. One just needs to learn how to staff their company correctly according to the different markets they serve. This is extremely demanding work that needs to be well staffed for every market. That is the secret to surviving this huge growth. Teleperformance is also growing in staff numbers and resources. We have created our own university with over 1,000 people studying at any given time.</p><h4>Is there any specific niche that Teleperformance wants to target with new products and services based on its experience in different sectors and industries?</h4><p>We love the new economy companies. We are extremely strong in PCI processes for banking, insurance, healthcare, telcos, and travel and transportation. One must have really strong process, and to be successful they cannot put the company into just one market niche; they need to be truly diversified.</p><h4>Teleperformance has environmental and child welfare initiatives such as Citizen of the Planet (COTP) and Citizen of the World (COTW). How do these programs help you impact lives and elevate Teleperformance's role in the community?</h4><p>We have many initiatives to take care of the community. When one has a company whose core product is its people, they need to truly understand that they are part of the community. We take care of the environment and elderly, and we have many programs where we donate to the poor. For example, 150 leaders from Teleperformance did a cycle ride and then donated the 150 bicycles to kids in Tunja who have to travel more than two hours to school. We also build houses and take care of the environment on a large scale. It is all part of having a genuine participation in the society we live in. For example, we are currently helping with the Venezuelan migration issue. There are many different causes we support.</p><h4>In 2018, Teleperformance was recognized by Frost and Sullivan and IAPP. What does it mean to receive these awards, and what could be next for the company?</h4><p>In 3Q2019, we also received an award for being the biggest BPO exporter in Colombia. Colombia is starting to become an important hub for our industry, so everyone comes to study us to look at what is happening in the market. Analysts come several times a year to study Teleperformance, and one of those companies is Frost and Sullivan, which has given us a number of awards because of our people, our processes, and technology. Two years ago, it gave Teleperformance Colombia its Innovation Company of the Year award. There is a big technology transformation happening in the way we address our clients. We cannot just continue to strengthen our human talent side; we have to continue to create strong innovative products for our portfolio as well. We have been developing a great deal of information management and robotic processes. In fact, Teleperformance has decided Colombia will be the big innovation hub for this region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[steve-de-angelo-founder-last-prisoner-project]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your opinion about 2019 CANEx event?</h4><p>Jamaica is home to one of the oldest, most mature, and wisest cannabis cultures on the planet. I have been fortunate enough to meet with some of the leading people here such as Niambe McIntosh, Peter Tosh's daughter, who is interested in some of the work Last Prisoner Project is doing to release prisoners. Also, I met with a member of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, which is an old collection of Rastas who got in a lot of trouble with the federal government a long time ago. I have been able to spend time with Jamaican people whom I find remarkable in their resilience and depth of soul. So CANEx has been a really wonderful conference. The Rastafarian tradition in Jamaica is very close to my own hippy tradition. We are all about nature, natural food and fabrics, and peace and love. So Jamaica is a comfortable place for me.</p><h4>You have been an activist for cannabis legalization for decades. How would you characterize the current perception of medical cannabis from both a political and social viewpoint in the region?</h4><p>There has been a tremendous amount of progress over the last few years, especially in Chile, Colombia, and Brazil. But what I would like to see more of in Latin America is our physicians really being educated about, understanding, and using cannabis for the potent therapeutic tool that it is, which is not happening yet. For example, in Colombia there is a lot of excitement about the financial and economic potential of cannabis and the idea that it will be produced for export to Europe. But there is not much consciousness or emphasis on providing that same medicine to Colombians or on educating Colombian doctors about medicinal cannabis. That is the missing piece that is really needed; once that happens it will be a catalysis for further reform.</p><h4>From your standpoint where do you see the medical cannabis industry in five years?</h4><p>First, the unfortunate direction for it to take would be the same direction as we have seen so many industries in Colombia, Jamaica, and all around the region go. Namely, having foreign corporations come in, take the raw materials out of the country, and then process them into value-added goods somewhere else. Under this scenario, most of the profit and economic benefit goes outside the country. The other direction to go in, and Colombia and Jamaica in particular have a huge amount of potential in this regard is not to send raw cannabis to other countries, but to instead build on the incredible brand power that these two countries already have in the international market.</p><h4>Jamaica has huge ambition to leverage its medical cannabis potential, but it is not alone in this. There are around 100 players regionally investing in the industry today. Where is Jamaica currently positioned, and what should the local industry focus on to remain competitive?</h4><p>“Jamaica's competitive edge is that it has one of the oldest, most mature, and wise cannabis cultures on the planet.“ This is unique. You can grow decent cannabis almost anywhere in the world. But when a community has multi-generational experience with cannabis use, it affects the value system, and that is the case in Jamaica. So Jamaica's competitive strength is to share that culture, which is about a reverence for life, nature, and preserving the planet for future generations, and being gentle, peaceful, and kind to each other. Not to mention the beautiful art, reggae music, food, and the Rastafarian ceremonies that Jamaica has created out of this cannabis experience and culture. The question is how you take that cultural legacy and transform it into a commercial opportunity. There are a few ways to do this. One of the things I always advise, and I advise it here in Jamaica, is to create local brands that reflect the unique history and culture that cannabis has in this country.</p><h4>What do you see as the best way to balance the strong growth potential of medical cannabis cultivation with environmentally sustainable practices?</h4><p>Growing medicinal cannabis in Jamaica, which is what I think should be done, is not going to have as much of an environmental impact as growing it for industrial purposes, which I do not think is appropriate in Jamaica. There is not enough flat land in Jamaica to grow industrial hemp. Plus, it is a small island, and there would be no way to prevent the pollen from that hemp from spreading around the island. The last thing we want is for the very precious and ancient strains of cannabis in Jamaica to get contaminated. But Colombia, for example, has some great places to grow hemp. What's more, when you harvest a hectare of hemp you are sequestering four metric tons of atmospheric carbon. Then if you make that hemp into hemp concrete (hemp-crete) that you can build houses out of, as it dries it also sequesters additional carbon. So even without thinking about all the wonderful things we can make out of hemp from plastics to paper, textiles, food, fuel, and construction materials, just growing hemp is probably the best way we have to dial down global warming and start getting our planet back into balance.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2020 both for Harborside and the global medical cannabis sector?</h4><p>Harborside has some exciting things coming up that we have never been able to do before. One of them is that the city of Oakland has given us a consumption license. This is something that is frequently done in Spain and in a couple of places in California. We are looking forward to seeing what cannabis looks and operates like in a public social space. We are also going to be opening up in new locations in San Leandro and Desert Hot Springs in California. The latter is one of only two locations in the state of California that are drive-through dispensaries. For medical cannabis in general what I hope happens in 2020 is that countries like Colombia that are now catering to pharmaceutical companies understand that there is a different pathway for developing cannabis medicines. The traditional pharmaceutical approach is to take a substance and break it down into its single molecule component parts. This is very expensive to do, and afterwards IP rights are granted, which makes it difficult for anyone else to do the same thing. The product ends up being expensive and usually has a whole range of horrifying side effects. There is an alternative with cannabis. Instead of taking the whole plant and breaking it into pieces, we can breed strains of cannabis that have the desired chemical profiles and do a simple whole plant extraction of that medicine. This is far less expensive, so instead of this medicine being confided to wealthy people in the first world, we can get it into the hands of everyone who needs it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Overcoming Stigma]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[juan-manuel-galan-former-senator-congress-colombia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is a constructive dialog between the government and private sector key to the development of medical cannabis?</h4><p>This is a new industry that has a complex reputational challenge. We are coming after decades of prohibition, and this substance has caused, especially in Colombia, many deaths because of the war on drugs. We just started a debate on changing the framework that we have been following for 50 years, the war on drugs Richard Nixon declared. Nowadays, we are trying to open a debate to explore new policies, dealing with public health, human rights, access, quality, security, and a fair price. The industry, instead of continuing the way it is right now to be first, should instead put together resources as a common team to address this reputational challenge. They should invest, for instance, in track and trace, which is a fundamental aspect in building trust among regulators, patients, and doctor. On the other hand, scientific research is also common ground where the industry should invest and build alliances with universities and medical societies and make significant progress building up scientific evidence so people can approach this substance with a new vision.</p><h4>What is your perspective on the growth of the industry?</h4><p>Colombia has a big opportunity because of its geographic position and proximity to the equator. We have the sunlight that other countries do not. I am the son of a political leader who was assassinated by the war on drugs. This is why my political position is a favorable one to promoting this debate and presenting legislation that is now law. This, however, is a cultural process that takes time, and it is more important to treat this product like a pharmaceutical product. There is a weed rush or weed fever and everyone wants to be a billionaire by growing cannabis. In a couple of years, the industry is going to come to its senses after this fever passes and only the ones with a clear path of quality, good manufacturing processes, access to Europe, and track and trace are going to survive. There are going to be changes in this industry, and Colombia has the right approach, beginning with medical cannabis, which is the highest standard. After that we can move on to recreational and what adults use, keeping with this high standard of regulation and trust. Some countries have regulated adult and medical use at the same time, which is a little chaotic. I visited Colorado and witnessed its approach to regulating medical cannabis for 10 years before going to the next step of adult or recreational use. Colombia is taking the right approach.</p><h4>How would you relate Colombia's framework compared to other countries in the region trying to establish a medical cannabis industry?</h4><p>A few other countries have strong regulatory institutions for this industry. Colombia and Chile are strong, but apart from these I have my doubts. Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru need to strengthen their institutions, and I do not know if they are prepared to have the institutional framework needed for the industry. If the federal level of the US moves on, that will facilitate issues the industry is dealing with, especially financial and banking, which is putting a stop to the industry. They need a federal law.</p><h4>How has the medical cannabis industry helped break the stigma?</h4><p>It is a process. The first step was getting the law approved, and then setting up the regulatory framework to apply it. Institutions need the human and technical resources to be able to regulate the industry. We have many universities here that are at an advantage in conducting studies by needing far less money to do such studies than in Europe or the US. If we are able to showcase a successful example of people involved in illicit drugs that can get involved in legal, entrepreneurial projects, it will be an example for the rest of the world.</p><h4>What impact will this industry have in boosting employment and affecting the overall economy and mentality of Colombians?</h4><p>There is a major opportunity for rural areas and for the agricultural sector, which has long been in a crisis in Colombia. We have been concentrating on cattle ranching, but with climate change, it is now one of the worst things you can do. Since we invented the flour industry in Colombia, we have not invented anything new. We have an extractive emphasis on all we do, with no added value or technology transfer. This is an opportunity the medical cannabis industry can provide to the country, transferring technology and giving advantages to rural areas. We did not want the cannabis industry here to be a global <em>maquila </em>of marijuana. We want added value and the transfer of technology. This is a key factor and issue for regulations.</p><h4>What is your perspective for the industry in 2020, and what will be your next role in the senate in the process of legalization?</h4><p>If we have a move from the US federal government, it will expedite the changes everyone is waiting for. I am in favor of regulating all drugs. I am against prohibition and the war on drugs. Drugs have preexisted humanity, and when humanity disappears, drugs will continue to exist. We have to deal with them and have a less problematic relationship with substances. I also hope we can move forward with coca leaves. They have an ancestral use by indigenous populations, and health problems can be treated with coca. There is a prominent scientist in Colombia, Marisol Duque, who has been conducting research on liver diseases and treating them with coca leaves. That is the next step for us. Coca is at the core of the cocaine business in Colombia. If we deal with coca cultivation and business, we can make a huge step forward in changing the absurd policy on drugs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[7% growth in 2018]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[alvaro-munoz-ceo-am-fresh-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has AM FRESH evolved since the 1980s? </h4><p>AM FRESH Group is a global company present in the main markets of the world, and is the result of a commitment to innovation and passion that has been transmitted through three generations. Today, AM FRESH is part of the AMC Group holding company, founded in 1931, under the command of my grandfather and, later, my father. A vision of continuous improvement, transformation of the sector and service to customers and consumers has always prevailed. Now, more than 5,700 employees give life to this global company, with end-to-end operations. In AM FRESH we live an accelerated growth thanks to the geographical expansion,expansion of varieties of fruits and vegetables, incorporation into new categories, such as plant-based foods, and long-term contracts with the large distribution chains at a global level. Our expansion into Asia is also a very important pillar for our future growth.</p><h4>Your client portfolio is impressive, including El Corte Inglés, Walmart and Tesco. What differentiates AM FRESH and makes it a pioneer in the industry?</h4><p>One of our main points of differentiation is the ability to offer end-to-end operations, which allows us to offer highly competitive advantages in product quality, service quality and costs. With seven distributed operating centers globally, we have a significant capacity to execute distribution with highly efficient systems. This ability to offer end-to-end operations also allows for chains of distribution to be part of the innovation pipeline, so that the selection of varieties are in line with their strategies. These are long-term programs that we are working on with important global chains to establish programs similar to Walmart. Another aspect that sets us apart from the competition is our global presence, with coverage in the northern and southern hemispheres, that allows us to offer continuity in the supply chain, and 52 weeks of guaranteed products. On the other hand, our biotechnology programs, that are applied to varietal development, allow us to offer a long-term innovation platform that guarantees differentiation from retailers with exclusive patented varieties. AM FRESH is a highly innovative company. Innovation, science, and technology are the pillars on which we support our growth, anticipating the needs of retailers and consumers. We are not a traditional company, with predefined roles or matrix structures. We have the best talents and give opportunities and freedom to contribute to ideas, projects and proposals, both on a day to day basis as in the way of defining the company and the sector in the long term. It is precisely all these messages that we want to transmit to our clients through our new corporate identity. We present this new image so that our clients recognize us as a group and live our proposal of having a differentiated offer that is always close to their needs first-hand.</p><h4>What is the role of R&amp;D and the importance of consumer habits for AM FRESH?</h4><p>For AM FRESH, consumer knowledge is vital. The consumption boom of fresh, natural and healthy food is the result of trends and demands of consumers, what we call the 3Cs: trust, so guarantees of quality and transparency are required, convenience, as consumers demand products that are easy to eat and carry, without neglecting the sensory and nutritional value, and awareness, as consumers want to give new meaning to their food, and consume products that respect the environment. Our innovation projects focus on developing products and complete offers (product, brand, packaging, history) that meet your needs. Proof of this is the creation of FRESCO (its acronym in English: Fresh goods, Research and Engagement for Strategic Consumer Opportunity), an initiative without precedent in the fresh food sector carried out by AM FRESH that applies techniques of the consumer sector. Through quantitative and qualitative techniques, as well as Big Data analysis and neuroscience studies, we work hand in hand with the retailers with whom we have strategic alliances for the continuous development of their categories to establish a new era for the industry. The initiative is led by an international team with decades of experience in the consumer sector and market research and has been implemented in its first phase, in Spain, UK, Germany, and the US.</p><h4>What specific markets are you looking to expand into?</h4><p>In the late eighties, AM FRESH was a Spanish company, with local production, that exported to certain countries in Europe. Now we are already globalized: we sell in 60 countries around the world and produce in 26, a direct consequence of understanding our clients and consumers well, optimizing the processes of the supply chain. Today, one of our strategic levers is in geographic expansion throughout Asia, as well as in the consolidation of our operations in America. Today you can say that we have already entered the Asian market, which undoubtedly represents the biggest growth opportunities for our company, since it is growing significantly not only in terms of population, but also in terms of Fresh produce consumption per capita. Also in continental Europe and in the United States and Canada we have a great understanding and potential to grow from where we are, since they are becoming attractive destinations for agrotechnological companies and for innovation. This is what the results tell us. The preliminary closure of fiscal year 2018 (September 2017 - August 2018) has meant a growth of 7% (adjusted currency), closing at almost EUR1,000 million, and an EBITDA growth of 20%. For 2019 we hope to maintain a percentage growth similar to last year. In AM FRESH we expect solid growth in the company's core operations including the production and sale of fruit. We anticipate that our platforms of innovation and biotechnology will have accelerated growth as a result of the interest of farmers, supermarkets and consumers in innovative and exciting products. Our future ambition is to reach EUR2 billion in 2025. We anticipate a change of forces in which the highest quality offers with differentiated products and supply guarantees gain ground, and with which the sector will benefit from the continuous demand from consumers of fresh foods that offer better taste attributes, innovation, and nutritional profile.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[USD4.2 billion income for Ecuador]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mauricio-nunez-vice-president-legal-ecuacorriente-sa]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What milestones led to the start of the production phase of the project in 2019?</h4><p>Ecuacorriente was established in 1999, and in 2003 it acquired concessions from the mining firm BHP, which included the fields of Mirador and San Carlos Panantza, which belongs to our sister company ExplorCobres. We signed an agreement with the Ecuadorean government in 2012 to start our mining work. In December 2015, we started construction of the mine, including building the railroad tracks and campsite for the workers of the mine. Finally, after obtaining all the required environmental permits to operate, we started production in June 2019, a landmark in Ecuador's mining history, as Mirador is the first mine of its kind to start production. Ecuacorriente is taking mining to the next level in the country, and Mirador serves as an example of a large-scale metal mine. It has taken almost two decades to develop Mirador, and we are pleased to have contributed to developing a promising industry in the country. The Mirador mine and Ecuacorriente are the signs of a new era in the Ecuadorian metal mining industry.</p><h4>What benefits is the Mirador mine bringing to Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuacorriente has invested USD1.2 billion thus far, and we expect to invest an additional USD240 million. All that investment has an expansive effect in the country at the local, municipal, and state levels. We paid USD140 million in taxes to the Ecuadorean state, and that does not include royalties to the government. The company is committed to the country, and we want to generate favorable conditions to develop the Mirador mine. We expect to generate USD4.2 billion in income for the government during the lifetime of the mine. We have generated about 2,400 direct jobs in terms of the contractors we hired to develop the Mirador mine. About 48% of our workforce belongs to the Zamora Chinchipe Province, and we have helped the region become better connected by building roads and bridges.</p><h4>How would you assess Ecuador's potential as a mining country?</h4><p>Ecuador has great untapped potential. The country is in the same area as Chile and Peru, so it is evident there are mining reserves in Ecuador. The main question is if the extraction of those minerals will be financially sustainable. There are five projects that are strategic: Mirador, Fruta del Norte, Cascabel, Rí­o Blanco, and San Carlos Panantza; however, there are political and social factors that need to be addressed to unlock the country's mining potential and raise it to the level of neighboring countries, where mining has had and continues to have a net contribution to development and prosperity. It is key to have consistent public policies in the long term to continue to walk down the same path. Looking at international figures, mining represents 40% of Chile's GDP and 20% of Peru's, while in Ecuador the mining sector does not even represent 1%. All these show Ecuador still has a long way to go.</p><h4>What are your long-term plans for the Mirador mine?</h4><p>Production and export started in 2019, and we expect output to grow steadily in the next few years to reach a production capacity of 60,000 tons per day by June 2020. There is a second mining deposit Mirador Norte, which has reserves, though we still need to carry out feasibility studies to determine if we could develop that deposit. We expect it will be, and it would represent a significant boost for the production capacity of Mirador. The Mirador mine is expected to have an up to 30-year lifetime, which could result in larger resources being mined. In this context, we will work to raise awareness of the benefits of having responsible mining in Ecuador and how it can contribute to the overall prosperity of the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>KSMC has grown to become one of the leading tertiary care facilities in the Kingdom—while it is now also being incorporated into the Riyadh First Healthcare Cluster. What is envisioned by the organizational restructuring?</h4><p>In total, the cluster has around 16,000 employees, of which 9,200 are with KSMC—around 60% of the employee volume. In addition, around 60% of the care is provided within our facility. The task of the cluster is to better align primary, secondary, and tertiary care and to improve our services in terms of access, quality, and patient experience. Within the cluster, KSMC is the tertiary care facility, surrounded by a secondary care hospital and a number of primary healthcare centers. </p><h4>How have you succeeded in putting all facilities under one cluster?</h4><p>The first thing we have to know is that whenever you facilitate access for the patient. You need to facilitate the service and utilize the resources at the cluster level. For example, a patient that is waiting for a CT scan or for a surgery has now more options. We are also focusing on preventative care, as Saudi Arabia has a high rate of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes. We are trying to prevent communicable diseases as well, in part through public awareness campaigns. Our staff also receive guidance from our infections disease experts. </p><h4>KSMC partnered with Alfred University in Australia for the development of a trauma care center. How is the effort progressing?</h4><p>Collaboration started in 2013. It is an excellent opportunity for everyone to learn how the system of trauma works; management, pathway, and guidelines. The bulk of trauma cases were usually referred to KSMC, as we are an open door for all the hospitals in the Kingdom. We also accept patients who arrive in our emergency department. Achieving this at the level that you feel is satisfactory and at the same time meets standards is challenging for everybody. Alfred University helped a lot to organize trauma service at KSMC. We have four or five objectives wherein each branch of these goals have their own sub objectives. In February 2019, the first ever Saudi trauma conference was held in Riyadh. This conference reached out to all healthcare providers across the Kingdom. We had 45 speakers from the Kingdom and the Gulf. Experts from around the world were invited too. Attendees at the conference discussed all the solutions, risk factors, and what has already been done to improve trauma services in the Kingdom. We have trauma training, which has been ongoing for the last two years. We do training for staff with physicians and nurses who are skilled in dealing with trauma cases. The other thing which is important is the registry of trauma cases, where you can document all cases from major to minor. This will help give you a clear vision of what has been done and what needs to be done to prevent and avoid all the morbidity, i.e. sickness, and mortality issues related to trauma. </p><h4>What are your ambitions for development over the coming years?</h4><p>We need to expand the clusters we already have in Riyadh; that will help in a big way. The support we have from the minister, the CEO of the cluster, and all other concerned parties is already there. We have a cardiac service, which began in 2018. The case load was more than what was expected. We have a lot of procedures; however, we are planning now to perform cardiac service around the clock, rather than only during daytime working hours. We also want to add cardiac surgery to the cluster. It has not been available for a long time at our hospital. The cardiac service will expand both on the medical side and the surgical side, which will start soon. We are also performing ear implants for people who have difficulty hearing. We may need to expand the service according to the need. The bariatric service is already established. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>KFMC has grown to become one of the leading tertiary care facilities, now within the Riyadh Second Healthcare Cluster. What opportunities are there to increase efficiency and better serve patients in the new structure?</h4><p>The concept of “cluster" is a population-based entity that serves from 1.5 to 3 million people­—rather than a specific geographical area or location. We are moving from the previous service-centered approach toward implementing a patient-centered approach. Within the clusters, all levels of care are provided; primary, secondary, and advanced care. The system is driven by outcomes so the patient will have easy access to consistent quality and efficient care. We are empowering primary healthcare centers to take the lead in providing all primary and chronic care, which will offload the tertiary care centers. This care will be provided at the new and revamped primary care facilities, which will allow them to act as the vendor for triaging and referral to specialist care. Primary healthcare will be the hub for all access to care, which is a major transformation. In fact, it should deliver around 60% of the total healthcare provided. The grand vision is to have a healthier population and increase the life expectancy from the current 72 years to 80 years by 2030. </p><h4>How do you envision to enhance how trauma care is provided today?</h4><p>Trauma is fragmented today, which is why it is not yet on par globally. In fact, trauma is the leading cause of death in Saudi Arabia for the younger population. In other countries, the leading cause of death are cancer and chronic diseases, with trauma between fifth and 10th place. Therefore, it is one of our three primary focuses under our national programs along with stroke and coronary disease. We require an integrated efficient system that will provide a high level of trauma service. We want to deliver quick access to post-trauma care. </p><h4>What is your vision on the application of telemedicine, both for consultations and even long-distance treatment, and what do you think of using technology for advanced medical care in general?</h4><p>The country's healthcare administration has realized that without investing in e-health we will have redundancy in the system, so it is certainly a priority for all the stakeholders involved. Today, we are understaffed in terms of ICU and oncology physicians for which there is big demand. Therefore, it would be impossible to establish such a tertiary care center somewhere in the north of the Kingdom, but what we can do is strive to provide a similar service utilizing technology, telemedicine, tele-ICU, tele-emergency, and tele-oncology. </p><h4>What are the primary ambitions for the coming years?</h4><p>When we shared our experience with the other clusters, we realized we had many of the same issues in common. There is a robust infrastructure in place, but there is a large gap between the level of care provided by the primary system and the services delivered at the tertiary level, which are in great demand. The coming three years will be dedicated to building a robust primary healthcare system. This will offload our outpatient departments by 20%. We should be able to cut our waiting lists by 25%. At the same time, we can provide specialized treatment for chronic illnesses in the primary healthcare setting. In terms of financial management, we strive to develop a better data collection and data banking system. That will enable us to utilize a more transparent method of calculating costs. Over the last 10 years, we have invested heavily in certain disease groups, and we have become proficient in neuroscience, cardiac care, and oncology. Before committing and making new investments in specific areas, we need to have in place our value-based healthcare system and integrated practice units. Patients should be comfortable knowing that when they come for heart surgery, they will be taken care of from the moment they are admitted to the hospital until they are discharged. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have operations evolved across your three business lines of medical centers, diagnostic laboratories, and hospitals, and what are the major factors impacting them?</h4><p>Once Vision 2030 was unveiled, as a private-sector player we decided to participate in this highly positive transformation, aligning our plans with the Kingdom's strategy. We added the third line of business, represented by hospitals, through the acquisition of the Ghassan Najeeb Pharaon (GNP) group, a well-known brand which, was going through some operational challenges. As such, we completely restructured the various facilities both physically and operationally, adding the latest technology and focusing on patient service. We are developing these hospitals to become mainly tertiary care hospitals in sync with the goal of becoming a top-level, end-to-end healthcare service provider. So far, we have doubled bed capacity, introduced new technological breakthroughs, and launched 11 state-of-the-art ICU rooms. We are also in the final stages of to become active in the imaging/radiology field, a segment which will further improve our positioning as the partner of choice for the transformation of both the government and military sectors. It is essentially a matter of alignment, and although there is a general consensus, such massive plans require time to unfold. I can see clearly that the timing is right, targets are being met, and outcomes are positive and encouraging. From a financial point of view, Q32018 showed a surplus in the country's budget for the first time in over five years. </p><h4>Where do you see the opportunities for private-sector engagement?</h4><p>It will be a partnership with the Ministry of Health (MoH), which will start outsourcing most of its services to JVs between public and private companies so as to provide a wider range of services at a higher quality. Technology in this sense is opening up many interesting opportunities for collaboration within the goal of healthcare digitalization. Elaj has been active in this digitalization process, especially in the diagnostics business, where Al Borg is the first medical lab outside the US to have an FDA-approved digital pathology unit in the Middle East. This will supplement the lack of availability of doctors at a certain time, since no physical presence is now required. Indeed, technology will truly impact the entire healthcare spectrum.</p><h4>What is the key to balancing profitability for players in delivering these services and affordability for end users?</h4><p>With the implementation of national insurance plans and price monitoring by the regulator, we will achieve benefits in three components of the equation: price, end-user, and quality of service. The new approach is patient-centric, which proves to be beneficial because earlier approaches, such as cutting costs through digital practices, ended up benefiting only the providers without any tangible or long-term effect on the quality of service or benefit received by the end user and wider society. A second supportive approach should be to foster a culture of prevention, which has the benefit of cutting long-term treatment costs. The third element to play an important role in guaranteeing quality of services at affordable prices is the current operational shift from the public sector to the private, which is more adept at managing costs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In March 2019, the fourth Global Ministerial Patient Safety Summit took place in Jeddah. What were some of the outcomes?</h4><p>The concept is simple: to have subject matter experts in patient safety and policymakers under one roof. We had 45 countries participating, and half of them sent their ministers of health, while the director-general of WHO also attended. One of the significant outcomes was the Jeddah Deceleration on Patient Safety, which has been endorsed by 21 countries. This declaration included a commitment to encourage patient safety in low- and middle-income countries and to use digitalization to improve patient safety. At the summit, the Saudi Minister of Health launched the MedConsult App to help healthcare professionals connect with one another. Another major outcome of the summit was a whitepaper written by SPSC and the International Council of Nurses. One of our policy recommendations was a safe nursing ratio, namely that a recommended number of patients that should not be exceeded. Other countries are now adopting our recommendations as well.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your engagement with WHO to promote patient safety?</h4><p>A significant step in the global patient safety agenda was WHO passing the global action patient safety resolution with the unanimous support of member states, which, amongst other policy directives, established September 17 as World Patient Safety Day—the first one to be in 2019. In addition, our application to become a WHO collaborating center for patient safety is in the process, and once ratified will be another milestone. Another important step toward internationalization is the coming G20 summit, which will take place in Riyadh in 2020. We seek to place patient safety on the agenda.</p><h4>How have you advanced on your four main priorities: medication safety, infection control, maternal and child safety, and patient empowerment?</h4><p>Our vision is safer healthcare for all, and by all, we mean both patient safety and healthcare staff safety. Our mission is to eliminate preventable harm by working with two main stakeholders: patients and their families, and healthcare professionals. We are in the second year of the center, with still a great deal of foundational work to be done at a national level. We also have other priorities as well through our engagement with the global patient safety community. One of our current practical priorities is the establishment of our national patient safety platform, SAWTAK, which in Arabic means "your voice," as a learning system for adverse events in healthcare. SAWTAK will be a big game-changer for patient safety management and change the way reporting is done. We have 470 hospitals within the country, and over the coming seven years, the system will be implemented throughout those hospitals as well as in primary care centers and pharmacies. A key differentiator of this platform is that it will focus on what, not who. It will be a learning platform, not a shame-and-blame platform. We are building two reporting applications for this: one for healthcare professionals and one for the public, and it will be available in both English and Arabic. There are many moving parts within and outside the healthcare system, and we want this system to align with all the relevant stakeholders and smooth the sector's digital transformation.</p><h4>How will the SAWTAK platform drive further digitalization in healthcare?</h4><p>For the development of the platform, we partnered with Datix, a system used by 80% of healthcare facilities in the UK for adverse events reporting. As the backbone of SAWTAK, we have developed the Saudi Patient Safety Taxonomy over the past two years. The issue with adverse events reporting is that there is no standardization in reporting, and people have different interpretations. This adverse effect monitoring effort will bring us all sorts of insights to improve the healthcare sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[improvements-across-the-board]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you envision strengthening the health insurance landscape in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>CCHI's mandate is to regulate the technical aspects of the private health insurance sector in the Kingdom. We do this together with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA), which regulates the financial aspects of insurers. CCHI's remit is the technical aspects of private health insurance including coverage, access, quality, efficiency, and transparency. We aim to be a pioneer in enhancing the quality of health services by raising the efficiency of private health insurance. To achieve this, we will catalyze the private health insurance sector to the highest standards of access and care via four levers. The first is working together with SAMA to deliver a vibrant regulatory sector that focuses on outcomes, efficiency, and transparency. The second is digital transformation, and a major aspect of this will be the upcoming national private health insurance data exchange platform, formerly called Saudi Health Insurance Bus (SHIB), which will be a game changer in increasing the transparency and quality of health insurance information. The third is fostering innovation to strengthen the quality of healthcare services. This will be achieved through the drive towards value-based healthcare (VBHC), where the individual forms the center of the process, and results are the basis for performance of the health insurance system. The fourth is an internal one but just as crucial—CCHI having a thoroughly motivated and professional workforce. Our teams are our greatest asset to enable the transformation of our organization to help build the private health insurance sector to a significantly higher state of quality, transparency, and efficiency. We thus serve our key stakeholder groups—the end beneficiaries, their employers, the payers (insurance firms), and the providers who deliver the care—by encouraging and facilitating higher standards in every aspect and by ensuring a sustainable and vibrant marketplace.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the digitalization of the healthcare insurance infrastructure?</h4><p>SHIB and Saudi Arabian national electronic health records (SeHe) will form the digital unified platform. When launched, all private health insurance transactions will be on this system. The level of transparency and quality of data available will be enormously important in understanding where we need specific changes and improvements and how best to do so. More importantly, processes will move faster, with lower costs overall and greater efficiency and quality. We can also significantly reduce waste, fraud, and abuse of the private health insurance system because everything will become significantly more transparent. We can identify beneficiaries, for instance, through biometric and other digital means. In turn, this will again improve the efficiency and quality of the overall sector, which will benefit the employers and end beneficiaries.</p><h4>How do you envision consolidation in the insurance sector, and what should be the conditions for private insurance firms to operate in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The private health insurance sector in Saudi Arabia currently has a gross written premium (GWP) of around SAR20 billion annually, through around 11 million end-beneficiaries. This excludes the Umrah and Hajj pilgrims who are now covered with health insurance through their visas. Our estimates indicate that by 2030, the private health insurance sector will cover around 60 million people, including citizens, residents, pilgrims, and tourists. This will mean a GWP of around SAR60 billion annually, which shows the healthy growth potential for the sector. The payer has an important role to play in introducing innovation and products that add value to beneficiaries. SAMA is now considering allowing more international firms to enter the market, which will increase competition. We welcome this news and support this direction, because it will help build a market that is more mature, efficient, and of a higher quality. Together with SAMA, we will continue working to ensure the private health insurance sector remains healthy and sustainable for all stakeholders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Saudi cement industry witnessed a contraction of 57% in the last few years. What is your current assessment of the market?</h4><p>This is a market correction period; demand for cement will not go beyond or below this point, as we have reached the bottom line. In the cement market, like in any other, the business has a normal lifecycle. In the last few years, we were in the saturation phase, though now new projects have been announced such as NEOM and the Red Sea and Sakani projects, which will bring new demand and areas to tackle. We have several projects and megaprojects in our region that will start soon or have already started, so we will definitely benefit from those, bringing our quality and range of products to serve different demands. At the same time, the government has taken supportive measures by lifting the export fees of the cement sector, giving us the opportunity to export and capitalize on our competitive advantage in terms of production costs. There are some markets near the Saudi borders like East Africa and even Central Africa that are now growing markets in regard to cement.</p><h4>Regarding the export strategy, what is the key to gain access to these markets?</h4><p>We are trying to look around for suitable markets and have found two main areas, Africa and Southeast Asia, although we also have Bangladesh as a hub for other countries. Demand is always dynamic in the cement sector. For example, Libya is absorbing a competitive market like the Egyptian one from the export standpoint, and if Libya is open and develops aggressively, that will leave us with other countries such as Kenya, Mozambique, and others that can be supplied by the Saudi market. Iraq, Jordan, and Syria will also provide an opportunity for the northern region in Saudi Arabia, while Yemen represents an opportunity for the southern one.</p><h4>What main challenges are cement companies facing in Saudi Arabia today?</h4><p>The market is correcting itself; transportation costs are one of the main problems facing players in the industry. In the last few years, with the liberalization of the transport sector, our costs will soon be positively affected. If we have higher domestic demand, that will lead to a self-correction in the market. We have been in a survival mood for the last few years. The fuel price revision will impact the industry in general, and we should be ready for that, not by increasing the quantity of produced cement but by enhancing our cost performance. Having said that, we have a long-term strategy that started five years ago to optimize our fuel mix strategy to enhance our competitiveness and increase our autonomy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[8.7 Grams of Gold per Ton]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ron-hochstein-president-ceo-lundin-gold]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After its arrival in Ecuador in 2014, Lundin Gold has started gold production from its Fruta del Norte project in record time. What were the contributing factors to this success and the main highlights over this journey?</h4><p>Lundin Gold was able to take its Fruta del Norte project from the start of a feasibility study to construction in five years, with 4Q2019 marking the start of the production phase. A five-year cycle is not typical in the mining industry, as projects tend to take a longer time to reach the production phase from the start of a feasibility study. Our ability to bring stakeholders together was key to this achievement. Lundin Gold found efficient and constructive ways to work not only internally, but also with the government, communities, local suppliers, academia, and industry peers. We were also pleased with the skills of the Ecuadorian workforce and our ability to source a significant amount of materials for the project in Ecuador.  This is also considered a great highlight in Ecuador's history, because it is a strategic project in a country where there was no large-scale mining before. Ecuador has had mixed experience with small-scale and illegal mining that has not brought any significant benefits to the country or its people. Over the past five years, Lundin Gold has been able to demonstrate that responsible mining can happen in Ecuador with great benefits in terms of development and the highest standards in social and environmental responsibility. Moreover, the project has been able to move forward following a project financing structure, being one of the few cases in the country and serving as an example to other large projects that can take place in Ecuador in the mining industry or other strategic sectors.</p><h4>To what extent will Fruta del Norte open the door for an increasing number of industrial mining projects in Ecuador?</h4><p>Miners have to follow the highest standards of human rights, economic development and environmental protection. Lundin Gold is fully aware everyone would look at Fruta del Norte and that it could serve as a preliminary step to build a mining industry in Ecuador. We are at the forefront of this building experience, and transparency has been our mantra over the years. For example, we opened our doors to inspection of all potential candidates running in Ecuador's latest local elections. After this experience, Ecuador definitely has the capacity to increase the number of large mining projects as long as they abide by the highest standards, and this should be done in order to maximize the benefits that mining can have on the country's development.</p><h4>How would you assess the economic impact of mining compared to that of the oil industry?</h4><p>When we arrived in Ecuador in 2014, the government had one approach for all natural resources, especially when it comes to the fiscal regime; however, oil and minerals are extremely different. Oil needs large capital; however, once in operation, the taxes to the national government are significant; however, there are not  a significant number of local jobs or local procurement opportunities created. Mining generates wealth at the national level, though not at the same levels as oil, and it also generates wealth at the provincial and local levels. This is through taxes as well as employment. We currently have over 2,000 people onsite, with a total employment figure of 4,000 during peak construction. Once in operations the Company will maintain a workforce of 800-900 people on the payroll for 15 years. We have focused on local procurement and hiring as one of our key sustainability responsible mining strategies. All these have contributed to the government realizing that mining is distinct in terms of the economic impact. Oil has a significant economic impact, albeit focused in terms of revenues to the national government. Mining is much broader. While we expect to operate for 15 years, I am confident there will still be operations in that part of Ecuador for 30-40 years from now, expanding the level of opportunities locally.</p><h4>Given the concerns about water availability, what is Lundin Gold's approach to a responsible management of this resource?</h4><p>Water is vital for mining around the world, and the management of water, minimal use, and recycling is a fundamental principle of modern mining. Ecuador is to some extent a special case. There are concerns that mining has an impact on water, which is primarily related to artisanal mining. There is, therefore, a tendency to think that large-scale mining magnifies the need of water. However, protection of water sources and minimize use of water is a fundamental principle of responsible mining around the world.</p><h4>The Fruta del Norte deposit is one of the largest highest grade undeveloped gold deposit in the world. How is the level of production of gold expected to evolve over the project life span?</h4><p>Having started operations in 4Q2019, 2020 will be a ramp-up year where we will produce about 250,000-270,000 ounces of gold in 2020. The subsequent two years will have production levels closer to 400,000 ounces per year. The life of the mine averages 310,000 ounces of gold per year over 15 years. Our costs will be very low because of the mining and processing methods and the high grade of the deposit.</p><h4>How will the future of large-scale mining take shape in Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador has the potential to have similar—if not higher—percentages of government intake and GDP as neighboring Chile and Peru. The geological potential is unquestionable. However, the key is to get the permits in place in order to stimulate more exploration activity. Ecuador is blessed to have excellent infrastructure already in place, and it is now the onus of the government to manage responsible mining for the benefit of all.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Wintershall Dea come to position itself in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Wintershall Dea (Wintershall has merged with Dea as of May) has been in Abu Dhabi for almost ten years, and the decision to enter the market was driven by opportunity. At the time, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) offered us a project to drill at the Shuwaihat field. We were delighted for the opportunity, as it was an ideal moment to showcase our excellence in such a sensitive environment, especially with respect to our expertise in hydrogen sulfide. After successfully completing the drilling and appraisal of our two wells, onshore and offshore, our team was tasked to find opportunities to continue our business in the UAE. We were very grateful when the next step came in the form of the Ghasha Concession, in which Wintershall Dea has now a 10% stake participation. We are confident that this 40-year concession, covering a huge area, will bring a lot of interesting developments in the future.</p><h4>How will the recent merger of Wintershall and Dea enhance the company's work in the Middle East?</h4><h4></h4><p>This year, Wintershall and DEA completed the merger. Now, as Wintershall Dea, we are Europe's leading independent gas and oil company and are in a position to grow further. In the past, we have partnered in several projects, including our 50-50 partnership in the Mittelplate development — an artificial island in the Waddenzee, an environmentally sensitive area in northern Germany. Building on this excellent working relationship and combined knowledge, our merged company will continue to focus on developing fields in complex areas.</p><h4>What makes Wintershall Dea a unique player in Abu Dhabi's oil and gas sector?</h4><p>Wintershall Dea's differentiators include, but are not limited to, its long experience and technical expertise in the sour gas domain. Having successfully developed sour gas fields in Germany for over 50 years, Wintershall Dea is a strongly geology and geophysics (G&amp;G), and engineering-driven company. We also excel in working from exploration, over large onshore and offshore fields into brownfield developments. For Wintershall Dea, the success of a project comes from strong, collaborative partnerships, and the prospect of developing more of these in the Middle East is what has brought us here.</p><h4>How does Wintershall Dea maintain its technical edge?</h4><p>In recent years, Wintershall Dea has come up with many different ways to ensure we develop our capabilities with new technologies and expertise. We maintain skill networks around the world composed of people from diverse operational environments working across different levels, analyzing challenges and formulating solutions. If the solutions are effective, we integrate them into our best practices and guidelines and make them fit-for-purpose to apply in our core regions around the globe. We are dedicated to collaboration and durable work flows. This is what we are pursuing in our Ghasha project now. We are looking at the entire value chain in surface and subsurface. Additionally, we also use our Technology Competence Center in Germany where we are providing solutions for challenges occurring in our operations like in the chemistry arena, petrophysics or other specific required analysis. In addition, another example of our innovation is our establishment of a digital alternative to the classic and time-consuming core analysis, called Digital Rocks. It uses different techniques to generate a digital visualization of a reservoir that goes down to a scale of a single nanometer. Digital Rocks is a unique asset, and we are happy to deploy it for the benefit of our work here in Abu Dhabi. Using this digital model, we can better predict previously difficult properties of the reservoir such as relative permeability or wettability.  This will, on the one hand, help to optimize the exploitation of the existing field. On the other hand, it will significantly accelerate the evaluation time and decision-making process for how best to further develop the field. With that we will continue our long-lasting collaboration with ADNOC to improve the understanding of reservoirs. We have also developed certain EOR solutions, in close cooperation with ADNOC and our shareholder BASF for those reservoirs. For example, we have tested surfactants that are capable of withstanding harsh conditions we find here in UAE in order to mobilise additional oil from these types of reservoirs.  </p><h4>How does the Ghasha Concession compare to Wintershall's previous work in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>The Shuwaihat project showcased Wintershall Dea's experience in sour gas activities and demonstrated that we can deliver on our promises to our partners. In Ghasha, we are now involved as equity players, but we demonstrate the same expertise and cooperation by approaching the project and the partnership holistically. Ghasha involves the development of a series of different complex reservoirs and fields, and the construction of artificial islands. It is not the case that Wintershall Dea's 10% stake is targeted to a specific 10% of the project or the work involved. We are targeting the entire scope and objectives of the project. We want to set up a business here that enables all, the G&amp;G and engineering, and brings value to the development as a whole. Wintershall Dea has a great deal of expertise sitting in its Abu Dhabi office and the headquarters, and our goal is to bring in even more and to integrate it with what our partners have to offer.</p><h4>What are some of the biggest challenges you foresee in developing Ghasha?</h4><p>The reservoirs in the area are complex. We have an idea of the complications we should come across. That requires continuous updates of the reservoir models utilizing best practice expertise and latest technologies. Drilling will be a challenge, along with building the artificial islands and constructing the facilities. The reservoirs contain all types of gasses and liquids. Highest HSEQ standards with no compromises is the basis for all of it. We need to ensure that we can optimize the development for the sake of unlocking the most resources and safeguarding the investment. This is one challenge on the technical level. Another is the high level of equipment and infrastructure procurement required. We have four partners in this project, so we need to maintain a positive sense of project development with a good mutual understanding of what needs to be done and where we should not allow for any shortcuts. Other partners also bring their own ideas, expectations, and expertise to the table. This is one of the largest developments of its kind, and it is great to be a part of it.</p><h4>What steps can be taken across policymaking and industry to further develop the UAE oil and gas sector?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030 brings lot of areas for continued development into focus, one of which is technical expertise. There is also a social responsibility component to developing this area further, as it results in the overall value being kept in the country going up. Emiratization is another, related aspect. At Wintershall Dea, we believe that we have a certain responsibility as partners and guests in this country. We have to focus not only on the money we are investing, but also on contributing in the particular domains where we can. One area in which Wintershall Dea is well positioned to contribute is Industry 4.0 technology. We have developed our own 4.0 strategy, and we would like to bring the knowledge and advancements we have attained through it in other markets here to the UAE.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[chaouki-m-eid-managing-director-meirc-training-consulting]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Dubai's significance for Meirc?</h4><p>Dubai is a hub, and people come here for two reasons. The first is for ease of doing business and rule of law. Second, everyone wants to come to Dubai because of the quality of life. It offers the best of the best, and Dubai is now the benchmark in this regard. Moreover, and what I like most about Dubai, is the bar is continually raised higher and higher, and the standard keeps going up. For example, Dubai was the first in the region to introduce new technology continuously in the airport. This philosophy of never-ending development extends to the work force as well; companies in Dubai love to develop their people. More and more, companies are looking at training as an investment and people are viewed as an asset in Dubai—something that cannot be said with certainty for human talent in all other places around the globe. Dubai attracts smart people, which is something we, as Meirc, leverage. We are in a city that appreciates quality and talent.</p><h4>What has been the company's role in enabling this shift toward investing in people as assets?</h4><p>As a company, we do not entertain assignments just for the sake of it. Many times, we have declined sessions because we determined the client's need was different from the service we offer. This has strengthened our relationship with companies and helped us maintain our client-centric focus. Our main accounts back in the 1960s used to be in oil and gas; we were the partners they could rely on. Building this client base over the decades, we have seen how people have developed in recent years. Many participants who attended Meirc's courses years ago are now in very senior positions For example a former CEO of one of the top oil and gas companies in the GCC attended few training sessions' with us in the late 1960s.</p><h4>Expanding on the oil and gas sector, how is the diversifying economy changing your portfolio of clients?</h4><p>We have a diversified client base. Our main industries are energy, financial services, government, health, industrial, oil and gas, real estate, services, and telecoms. We have grown from mainly oil and gas in the 1960s to all other sectors as we have seen more demand for our services in many areas. Particularly, we are seeing demand in Saudi Arabia because of the transformation happening and we are working with several ministries. In geographic terms, outside the Middle East, we are fairly active in Africa and Southeast Asia. The only real barrier to where we work is dangerous political situations. We will not operate in any country where there is a risk for our personnel as the safety of our consultants is of the highest importance.</p><h4>With the pace of change accelerating and the transformation toward a knowledge-based economy, what does innovation look like at Meirc?</h4><p>Coming to Dubai was a great thing for Meirc because it pushed us to innovate. When I started with the company back in the 1990s, we had a limited number of accounts that we grew organically. But soon, we said this is not enough and began venturing into areas outside of our expertise and expanding our offerings. For this, we had to attract the right talent ourselves, which is a lengthy process. Because we are selective in our talent onboarding, we have a low turnover. We also recently ventured into technical hands-on training and expanded our offering by introducing specialized exam preparation courses for globally recognized finance and accounting professional qualifications like Certified Management Accountant and Certified Public Accountant. Additionally, we will soon start our online training programs. We already have the infrastructure built, and with this, the whole world will become our market. The fee structure will be slightly different, but we will reach everyone around the globe. In Meirc we ask our trainers to continuously improve their knowledge by attending trainings as well to help us stay on top of trends and be proactive. We walk the talk.</p><h4>How will Expo 2020 impact Dubai, and how will Meirc leverage this opportunity?</h4><p>We see an incredible chance for visitors to link their Expo 2020 experience with other activities Dubai has to offer. For example, people can combine business meetings or a training with visit to Expo 2020. Our business in the 4th Quarter of 2020 will boom because of Expo, as we anticipate many people will come for training and then spend a few days visiting Dubai. Our only worry is the availability of hotels as there will be millions of visitors. This is something the government is already aware of, and as a company we have already booked all our locations for 2020. We do all our training in five-star hotels and have made sure everything is booked.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for Meirc for the coming year?</h4><p>Our slogan can be summed up as sustainable growth. Having talked about innovation earlier, innovation is not without its risks, but we are taking calculated risks to ensure sustainable growth. Over the last 60 years, Meirc has never reduced its headcounts when the economy went down. We have seen many cycles. The last one was a few years ago, and we did not reduce our salaries or let anyone go. We believe in innovation; we push the envelope to stay at the top. We will not rest on our laurels and take it easy since we believe every day is a chance for improvement. Quality is the number-one area for improvement along with staff satisfaction. No improvement is made at the expense of staff satisfaction. We cannot afford to have anyone demotivated because a demotivated person will ruin the infrastructure. As more and more people realize the value in their human talent, we remain at the top of the game to provide enhanced quality and services to our clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Successful Bidder in Oil Rounds]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[successful-bidder-in-oil-rounds]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have contributed to Wayra Energy becoming a successful bidder in Ecuador's recent oil rounds?</h4><p>Wayra Energy is an Ecuadorian operating oil company. The company have two main shareholders, a Spanish company listed in the Madrid stock exchange and focused in business related with electricity, power generation, telecommunications, infrastructure and renewal energies; and a Venezuelan company specialized in infrastructure works (civil, mechanical and electrical) and oil and gas operations. In 2017 we decided to participate in the “Minor Oilfields Round", the first round launched by the current Ecuadorean government, leaded by Petroamazonas, the NOC of Ecuador. There were tendered service contracts for 15 fields and Wayra Energy was awarded a service contract for a field named Paka Norte, which is a relatively small project, requiring an investment of less than USD50 million. Our strategy was to test the country through a small project. At the end, that project gave us reason to conduct bigger projects. We successfully started operations in Paka Norte and decided to take part in another round conducted by Petroamazonas in 2018 called "Oil and Gas 2018 Round". We were awarded the development of two new oilfields, Oso and Yuralpa. Because of these two new oilfields, our total investments in Ecuador collectively near about USD300 million. Currently, we are the company with the highest level of fulfillment of committed activities of the last two rounds, producing nearly 4,000bpd. We are expecting to reach up to 6,000 bpd of production by the end of the year. On top of that, Wayra Energy has been recording major achievements since its start in Ecuador. We drilled our first well in Yuralpa field within 16 days, and our second well in just 12 days, the faster well drilled in the history of field. We are not an oil service company, but an operator. As such, Wayra Energy is specialized in the management and optimization of projects in oilfields.</p><h4>How has the Government worked on the easiness of oil companies to invest and operate in the country? </h4><p>Back in 2017, investment funds were quite reluctant to grant financing for projects in Ecuador. However, the new administration started to take steps to become more attractive for investment. Fortunately, today the situation is different. If you go to a fund in the US, they would be willing to talk to you because of those changes. The main risk previously faced in Ecuador was the capacity to collect payments, because Petroamazonas had a negative record on it. Older contracts between the country and suppliers did not provide resolution methods in the case of fluctuating prices in oil, which led to disputes. Currently, these issues are being solved. In the case of Wayra Energy, the company started producing oil in October 2018, and so far the government is filling all its commitments. International investors worldwide are now looking at Ecuador in another way, because the country is taking a new road to keeping their economy healthy.  </p><h4>How are contractual conditions for Ecuador's Petroamazonas?</h4><p>Investors first seek to have efficient ways of resolving possible conflicts using international arbitration tribunals being appointed under contractual terms. In the case of our contracts, matters could be eventually resolved at a court in Santiago de Chile. We acknowledge the efforts made by Petroamazonas to improve the conditions in its latest contracts, and that they have now a higher level of compliance with international industry standards. Additionally, Wayra Energy and other service providers are in constant talks with Petroamazonas to seek improvements that could be made in favor of the two parties. One of the recent improvements of Ecuador's government is their willingness to work hand-in-hand with the private sector. Wayra Energy is grateful for that.</p><h4>What are Wayra Energy's for upcoming bidding rounds in the country?</h4><p>We are participating in the qualification phase for the bidding process for Sacha field. The field is quite familiar to us, because several of our employees has worked on that field. The main risk previously faced by private companies in Ecuador was the capacity to collect the payments, because previous administrations had a negative record on it. Older contracts between the country and suppliers did not provide resolution methods in the case of fluctuating oil prices, which led to disputes. We are still waiting the final terms and conditions for the process of Sacha field and we will present a formal bid only if the conditions are attractive enough for us. This project will require more than USD1billion in investment, which is significantly higher than our previous investments. Apart from Ecuador, we are looking business opportunities in other regional markets in order to expand our operations, with Mexico and Colombia being our next countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the contributing factors for the international cement producer Holcim to establish operations in Ecuador?</h4><p>Holcim will turn 100 in 2021. It was an important partner since the early years and the mayor stakeholder since 1976 with the acquisition of the local company La Cemento Nacional, it arrived to develop housing and infrastructure projects. Holcim's main cement plant in Ecuador is in Guayaquil and has total installed capacity of 4.5 million tons per year, meaning it is one of the largest factories in Latin America. This capacity is complemented by another plant in Latacunga, close to Quito that can produce additional 1 million tons. Holcim has also built 11 concrete plants scattered across the country. Our accumulated investments stand at USD1 billion, with the last investment being USD400 million to revamp our plant in 2015. On top of that, we built a separate retail network named Disensa, which has about 600 selling points through franchisees across Ecuador. We take pride in this network because of its social impact. Our franchisees were small family businesses that were  committed to the goal of growing. This model started in Ecuador and has been replicated in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil, counting hundreds of Disensa franchisees across the Latin American region. Holcim is much more than a cement and concrete provider; it is an important player in the country's cohesion.</p><h4>How has Holcim taken part in Ecuador's large infrastructure projects, and what will be drivers for growth in the near future?</h4><p>The company has always been involved in many emblematic projects, in the last years including the Quito metro network, the bridges of Guayaquil, ports in Manabí­, and the deepwater port of Posorja. This was possible thanks to our technical expertise both in Ecuador and abroad. Despite these large projects, the construction sector in general is not seeing much growth at the moment; however, we expect business to pick up as the private sector becomes more active in the economy and more foreign investment enters the country. There are talks of developing new ports, railways, roads, and even the mining industry, which requires a great deal of infrastructure, so we are confident our industry will continue to grow. Also, the government plans to implement social housing projects.</p><h4>What is the role of export-driven production in the growth of Holcim's local operations?</h4><p>Holcim's initial investments were meant to support the Ecuadorean market; however, with the increased capacity of our plant in a port city like Guayaquil that recently improved its maritime infrastructure, there is a great opportunity for us to become a regular exporter from Ecuador. With the current shipping system, we can reach many markets in the world, though the ones in Latin America are positioned as the company's next natural steps, especially if we consider Ecuador's plans to join the Pacific Alliance. The more integrated Ecuador is in the world, the more economies of scale can be created, and with increasingly lower operational costs, it is possible to reach even further markets.</p><h4>How will Holcim align its operations with the demand for higher standards in terms of environmental protection?</h4><p>As a part of Holcim's global strategy, sustainability is a top priority, and we make clients, investors, and company workers part of our shift toward socially and environmentally minded practices. Our sustainable development strategy has four pillars—climate, water and nature, people and communities, and circular economy—within which we develop a whole range of initiatives. In Ecuador, for example, the company is in charge of managing the forest Cerro Blanco, one of the largest protected forests in the region. Separately, we have social corporate programs with communities around our operations and get them to participate in the country's development. Another of our goals is to have 30% of the workforce be women. On top of that, the company is clear that innovation and sustainability go hand-in-hand. As a result, we are able to build roads today with reduced CO2 emissions with a neutral carbon solution. We have implemented this technology for a project in the Galápagos islands, where we have built a 41-km road that is environmentally friendly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mariano-moritsch-managing-director-moritsch-cranes]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved since you restarted it in 2015?</h4><p>In 2015, I restarted the building industry tower cranes company that my father originally started in 1962. I was able to do this thanks to my extended experience in developing new markets for that company, which I joined in 1986. With our previous company, and thanks to our global expansion, we have built some of the highest and most famous skyscrapers worldwide, including the Shard in London and other prestigious building in the US, Dubai, Singapore, and Seoul among others. We then decided to sell our crane businesses to an American multinational. After a period of time, I realized that most of my old customers and dealers found that the approach by multinational companies in our sector was unsuitable, as contractors or rental companies need quick answers, and a dedicated product. Restarting from zero in a mature field, where there are already large players, was not that easy. The evolution in just four years has been more than expected, and the market really welcomed our approach because, through listening, we take care of our customers' needs. This is the reason for our success:  speed of response, quality/price ratio, and product knowledge. Our product range has grown a lot through huge investments, but we can grow much further, as we have just begun.</p><h4>How do you select the markets you are going to, and what markets would you like to enter?</h4><p>Having quality on our mind, natural markets for us are the US, the UK, the EU, and Australia. These are countries where technology is required, as well as sophisticated safety controls, which are not mandatory in other less developed countries. There are many other markets I know well where we are not yet present. I want to return to the Middle East. Though it is not a good market now, companies have to be there because of growing neighboring markets like Syria, Kuwait, and Oman. We will have an office in Dubai, from which we will approach the region again. I want to return to being a leader in the UK. There was a small pause this year because of Brexit, but the market is rearing up again. I want to keep an eye on Ireland; there will probably be huge demand there.</p><h4>What makes Moritsch Cranes unique?</h4><p>When we erect a crane, for example the cranes that built the Shard, we built three that were special to the building. The façade and structure were unique. We also have to be sure the quality and type of steel is right and of pure quality. Quality control is important. We buy our steel only from the EU. It has to be a certain grade and certification. We are investing large sums of money on creating a product that is safer, trustworthy, and easy to transport and erect. European manufactures can survive only if they create better and safer cranes. We have invested a lot in the technology of our cranes. We have black boxes and can conduct remote diagnostics. If there is an accident, we have all the data recorded in the computer that is driving the crane and we can determine within minutes what happened. We cannot be one of the biggest players, though we do want to be one of the top five in terms of quality, safety, and reliability of the product.</p><h4>How have your origins from Veneto affected the way the company is perceived abroad?</h4><p>In our business model today, we do not do any welding because there is no added value. There are many companies in the region that have been making these products for us since my father started. I really wanted to maintain this kind of environment. For multinational companies, if it is cheaper to make a crane somewhere, that is where they will go. They do not care about the environment; however, we do. There is a school here that really knows how to weld. It knows the procedure and what to control when it is manufacturing a certain part of a crane. Welding a crane requires one to consider the fact that people will work at a certain height on the crane as well as below the crane. It is extremely important to ensure quality and safety in such an environment. 90% of the product is made in Belluno valley, and there are many companies here that are world leaders in their field. This region is known for its quality, and it has certainly had an impact on the way we operate. As a result, we are constantly researching and developing sophisticated technologies for our products.  </p><h4>What trends are you seeing in the construction industry?</h4><p>An Italian construction company 10 years ago used to buy earth-moving machines, cranes, and pavers. It had a huge depot of machines that were used once or twice and were just aging. In some parts of the world, there is a mentality of owning a machine, making it a part of your assets. Few construction companies were buying machines and were instead renting. I felt this would become the wider approach. We have to think about products in this way: modular systems, modular tower sections, ease of maintenance and erection, and interchangeable parts. At the end of 2008, the construction business worldwide changed. We had a drop in turnover by 80% from 2008 to 2009. I believed business would never recover to its previous levels come and that 99% of my future customers would be rental companies, where the builders send their request for a suitable product for each job site. That is exactly what is happening now. A year ago, I made a crane for the US that was completely new. Even if the crane was large, I wanted it to be partially pre-assembled. In 18 months, we built a prototype and sold 10 such cranes to various rental companies. The owner of the second-largest rental company in the US, which has a turnover of USD1 billion, called and asked why we did not invite him. I told him the company was too big for us, though he said this crane was innovative and he wanted to be a distributor. I wanted to sell it on my own to all the rental companies and flew to San Francisco and had a meeting. The company eventually acquired 20% of our company's shares. We are now developing a product alongside its team of engineers that will be even more dedicated to the US.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[95% Overseas Guests]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[pascal-billard-director-general-majestic-hotel-spa-barcelona]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a background to the hotel and its evolution since being founded?</h4><p>The Majestic Hotel &amp; Spa Barcelona was founded 101 years ago, in 1918. The main difference between the Majestic and most other hotels in Barcelona is that, it is an independent family hotel affiliated with Leading Hotels of the World. The initial entrance was where the Chanel store is now. The hotel then had 150 rooms but increased its capacity after the purchase and extension by the owners (the family, Soldevila-Casals) of additional buildings. The owners are seven brothers and sisters, third generation of the same family, most of them were born in the hotel where they were living. This “emotional“ connection with the family, being part of their childhood, made and still makes a difference in how the hotel stands out in Barcelona, when it's compared it with most hotels owned by families treated simply as a real estate property. This philosophy has helped the hotel to continue growing, maturing and adapting to the new era. A great step for Barcelona was the 1992 Olympic Games, which really did put the city on the map, beyond a secondary city. This is today's challenge: to maintain its reputation &amp; positioning both for leisure and business tourism, while competing with major cities and other capitals of Europe. Around the time of the Olympics, we saw many international hotel chains arriving, bringing more high-end products and luxury along with international professionals to the sector boosting the tourism towards a higher level. Majestic followed that path, with major renovations in 1993/1994, taking the hotel from 4 to a 5 stars and 5 stars Gran Luxury; with our latest renovation, between 2009-2013, the hotel reached a new level of luxury.</p><h4>What makes a hotel a luxury hotel?</h4><p>We are lucky to benefit from the greatest location in Barcelona, a key element of a luxury experience. Then there are some tangible and intangible aspects which helps to describe our hotel. I do believe our rich history — we celebrated our 100-year Anniversary in 2018 — helps. We have received a number of heads of state, celebrities, artists, and existed through the civil war. This,  coupled with multi-generational employees from the same family working in the hotel, and recognizing our loyal clients have contributed to make Majestic Hotel &amp; Spa more than a hotel. It is a true “Icon“ in Barcelona which is an intangible strength for a luxury property, that is impossible to copy. We manage the business, focusing on the long-term plan and not solely looking at short term profits. We continue to invest in renovating and maintaining the property every year, it is not just a quick return on investment, but also how we can improve the property, the product and its services. We created an exceptional Suite, the Majestic Royal Penthouse on the 9th floor, the largest suite 3 bedroom in Barcelona with fantastic views, a private jacuzzi and a terrace per room, as well as a butler service and the best amenities and technology to match guests' high expectations. We also recently renovated our rooftop terrace, probably the terrace with the best view in Barcelona that is open to both hotel guests and locals, which recently won the prize of “Best Hotel terrace in Europe“ at the “Prix Villégiature awards“. I think these are also tangible improvements that add value to a luxury hotel. One of the trends in this business is being “multicultural-friendly.“ In our hotel, 95% of guests staying are not from the domestic market, we must adapt to the needs and desires of the Chinese or Indian market, for example. We are working more and more closely to improve our capacity to “hyper personalize“ our experiences respecting each of everyone's client's needs.</p><h4>What other hotels in Barcelona do you compete with?</h4><p>We have two different concepts in one hotel, namely organizing events and groups clients from the MICE sector (Meeting, Incentive, Conferences &amp; Exhibitions), where we compete with hotels like the W, Fairmont Rey Juan Carlos… as well as individual leisure where we compete with Mandarin Oriental, El Palace, hotel Arts, Cotton House. There are also some new hotels such as the Monument, Almanac, smaller hotels with around 80 rooms.</p><h4>What is your strategic plan in terms of expansion?</h4><p>As Majestic Hotel Group, we are dedicating our efforts into Unique Luxury and Boutique Hotels. We are currently expanding in the Iberian Peninsula through management contracts where we can truly bring value and help position or re-position a hotel from either Luxury or Boutique experience. We are trying to understand its strengths and weaknesses in order to implement the right strategy in execution from Sales &amp; Marketing, Communication, Operations and  Talent management, but without only applying brand standards as most chains would do to also serve their own purposes. If we see that we are not the right operator or we could not bring real added values, we will not pursue an opportunity. We do have a central office in Barcelona that supports each hotel. We currently have in the luxury segment, Majestic Hotel &amp; Spa, member of Leading Hotels of the World and offer support to Sant Francesc Hotel Singular, member of Small Luxury Hotels in Mallorca. In addition we have 3 Boutique hotels in Barcelona, the Murmuri, a 53-room hotel in Rambla Catalunya, the Midmost, very successfully repositioned hotel of 54 rooms and the Denit with 36 rooms, which was recently renovated, both closed to Plaza Catalunya. We expanded over the past three years through management contracts for hotels that belongs to the famous soccer players Leo Messi, creating a new brand for him MiM, we now oversee MiM Sitges, MiM Ibiza, and this year a new hotel in Mallorca, which will be branded from the next season into MiM.</p><h4>How does disruption impact your operations and the sector directly?</h4><p>External factors, such as the terrorist attacks in August 2017, and the political situation in Catalunya certainly affected us. We had also benefited in the years between 2013 and 2017, from tourism staying away from countries in conflict in North Africa and Middle East, which did reopen in 2018, thus displacing part of the business outside of Spain. Besides, considering that airport traffic data show constant increase in our areas,  I believe the Airbnb factor and the increase of apartment short term rental offering (not always well controlled) definitely makes a significant competition. We as hotel have a strict monitoring of licenses, labor and health &amp; safety regulations which the guest does not always consider when comparing the cost of a room night versus an apartment rental with nearly no rules to comply with. Therefore, it is not a fair business, but it is a reality which undermines our industry. It is our ongoing challenge to showcase our differences and keep improving our services. The Majestic Hotel &amp; Spa Barcelona consists of 271 rooms and suites, as well as 28 residential apartments located in a separate building in front which is a great asset in order to differentiate our offer responding to an increasing high demand specifically for families.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief overview of your operations over the last two years and how they have been affected by the economic uncertainty facing the Kingdom?</h4><p>USC was established in 1997 with a production capacity of 500,000 tons. Since then, several expansions have taken place to elevate our scale and cope with local and regional demand. Our current capacity is 1.3 million tons, making us one of the largest sugar refineries in the world with full integration to international future markets to secure our hedging position. Our products meet international standards, and we are proud to be a preferred supplier of many multinational companies, both in Saudi and the region. Local market sales represent 70% of our business, while exports cover the other 30%. In the past two years, we have encountered many challenges as well as opportunities. In addition to the macroeconomic factors that continue to impact the whole market, the sugar industry has an additional challenge to deal with: potential production over-capacity. To date, we are the only local supplier in the Kingdom with a capacity that exceeds the market consumption. Soon, the whole market will have to cope with the imminent start-up of two new refineries, which will potentially create a significant oversupply in the local and regional markets. On the export front, factors such as political instability, concentration of production, high insurance costs, and protectionist measures have all contributed to the creation of a tougher economic reality. However, our scale and experience in the region make us well equipped to weather such challenges, as we've done in the past 20 years.</p><h4>How do you expect demand to evolve in the medium term?</h4><p>Demand is anticipated to be under pressure, though we expect it to stabilize in the medium term. We maintain a positive view on market demand and acknowledge the overwhelming need to cut cost and elevate product offering. Sugar is a basic commodity; therefore, the demand remains generally stable and relatively predictable. Having said that, we expect the anticipated oversupply in the local market to result in strong competition, as a result of which exports will become necessary. In the local market, innovation capability, higher efficiency, and superior customer service will make the difference.</p><h4>What major challenges does the manufacturing sector in Saudi Arabia face today, and what strategies are you adopting to mitigate them?</h4><p>There is no doubt the sector is witnessing several changes. Operating costs are increasing, and we are investing heavily to mitigate the risks associated with these changes. On the labor front, in addition to our Saudization efforts, we seek to reduce our costs through automation, replacing manual work where feasible with robotics, and improving our packaging materials. On the energy side, we have major energy projects in place to reduce our fuel consumption. More initiatives are being undertaken to enhance our efficiency and regulatory compliance, pushing the operating model forward to have the best offering and the best service in the industry.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for 2019 and beyond?</h4><p>We are working to provide great offering in the market and to cut costs on all fronts. We are focused on being extremely competitive to ensure we meet our customers' demand for the highest possible standards. Furthermore, we are investing significantly on the innovation side to make sure we have up-to-date products and marketing strategies. On the B2B side, we want to have a real end-to-end operating model in place, where we are involved in all aspects of the relationship. We are working with our customers to partner with them throughout their supply and manufacturing processes, including the after-sales service. We work hard to meet our customers' needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was your performance in 2018 in terms of profits and revenue?</h4><p>Revenues and our share of the market remained the same from 2017 to 2018; however, 2018 was extremely competitive, and many new companies entered the market, so we largely consider the year a success. Profit was affected by new expenses such as increased utility and regulatory costs, which meant the bottom line fell from 15% to 18%, although sales did not decline. We also included the calorie counts of all of our products, which was expensive, though it allows us to categorize our products. There was an extra cost of SAR8 million (USD2.13 million) for our manpower compared to three years ago, and this will affect our bottom line as well. Costs continue to rise for everyone in our sector. We employ 1,300 people, and most are expatriates. We are 22-23% Saudi.</p><h4>What is the current state of the food sector in Saudi?</h4><p>The food market is booming, and there are many start-up businesses. There are firms supporting start-up businesses to build the brand, and every day there is competition with a new brand that will take some market share. The boom is affecting the sector. Perhaps after five years, the market will be stable, though today everyone believes F&amp;B is a great sector to invest in, and this affects the sector itself. This phase is like a test for businesses, and many will fail. Many companies are looking at acquisitions, so there are many opportunities in the market.</p><h4>You have expanded your franchising model. What is the future of that process?</h4><p>We are working hard, and perhaps by the end of 2019 we will have a franchise in three or four cities in Saudi Arabia. This will not add costs, so it will be easy to grow and maintain our market share. We intend to enter smaller cities and the main countries around the Middle East. We have started in the UAE and will open a franchise in Dubai in March.</p><h4>How do you use technology to reduce your costs?</h4><p>We are working on a plan for new central kitchens that allow us to minimize the space required for running the operations. This also saves on the bottom line as we build new branches and help us standardize the taste and quality and make processes efficient in rush times and low times. We cannot change the government regulations, so we have to work to enhance our bottom line. We are finished with construction and will begin operations in 2020, as it is not a small project.</p><h4>How many locations does Raydan currently own?</h4><p>We have 24 branches and plan to open eight more in 2019. We have two branches in Egypt and one in Dubai, and by the end of 2019 we will reach more than 30 branches.</p><h4>Have you seen a change in the number of orders made through applications?</h4><p>Yes, though this change is based on the support we give to this area. More than 18% of our sales come from our application, while 82% comes from dine-in customers to the restaurants or orders via phone. The costs of certain third-party applications are high, and we stopped some of them after prices increased this year. We decided to concentrate on our own application and the cheaper applications available. Currently, we need to cut costs everywhere to survive and maintain the same KPIs for the company.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Raydan in 2019?</h4><p>We will open eight branches in 2019 and increase our manpower by 10%. Our total space will also increase by 15%, and we will cover another two or three new cities to support our business with new markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SFDA introduced its Healthy Food Strategy in September 2018. Can you brief us on the main policy points and their progress over the last year?</h4><p>Improving diets is extremely important, as we implement the government's Vision 2030 in terms of improving health and business opportunities in the Kingdom. For example, there are recommendations by the WHO to eliminate industrial trans fats, prevent the use of partially hydrogenated oils in the food industry by 2023, and reduce the consumption of sugar, salt, and fat in food content in order to prevent NCDs. We have moved from hunger and a lack of food toward food security followed by food safety. Today, we are moving to healthy foods in order to prevent diseases. Furthermore, in 2018 we were able to reduce allowable levels of trans fats to around 2% in oil products and 5% in other food products with an outstanding 95% industry compliance level for both local and imported goods. Our main goal now is to reduce industrial-produced trans fats in foods to 0%, as recommended by WHO. Compliance levels are excellent; nevertheless, we are constantly improving the processes and providing guidance toward the main stakeholders and beneficiaries. By 2020, SFDA also intends to improve the food-labeling system to declare any added sugars, trans fat, and sodium. It will take years of collaborative work to achieve all these goals, though the cornerstone for this is to educate the public to select their food wisely and introduce healthier food choices to their daily intake.</p><h4>Would you tell us more about SFDA's dialogue and engagement with the private sector?</h4><p>SFDA has signed agreements with several alliances and nine major companies, encouraging them to reduce salt, sugar, and fat content and improve their products. We work closely with these companies in providing ideas for successfully promoting a healthier product and responding to their concerns over losing current or potential customers. We think about this more in terms of an open dialogue, rather than having it presented to the industry as a requirement, encouraging them to move toward healthier products as we do not intend to cut products out of the market unless they present a hazard.</p><h4>How is SFDA working with other agencies on food security and healthy consumption goals?</h4><p>We work closely with the relevant stakeholders, such as the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture (MEWA), especially in the aquaculture part. Our number-one goal is to ensure reasonable pricing for products together with MEWA. We are also working on educating the public and increasing awareness. For instance, we focus on the health benefits of consuming fish, as fish consumption is currently low in Saudi. We also have initiatives to ensure high quality standards for all imported fish. We also banned products from a number of countries due to compliance issues with SFDA's standards and regulations.</p><h4>In 2018, Saudi Arabia produced 30% of its pharmaceuticals locally, and SFDA seeks to increase this to 40% this year. What is your vision and strategy to produce more medicine locally?</h4><p>In the last few years, SFDA has activated a number of encouraging practices to boost the local production of medication. One factor is on the registration side, where we help companies register products as much as possible from here. The government entity NUPCO was established to be responsible for purchasing pharmaceuticals and medical devices on behalf of the public sector. SFDA reviews all products to ensure at least 50% of generic medication is manufactured here. We are also bringing in local manufacturing of medicines where there is a worldwide shortage, for example because manufacturers are not interested in producing a particular medication, as the price is too low. We will guarantee a price that will cover their costs with a reasonable profitability. Major companies are ready to start production again and supply the Saudi public health sector with these pharmaceutical products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do you see major potential for growth in Jeddah's tourism and entertainment sector, and what role could the city play within the country's broader strategy?</h4><p>Jeddah is in a great location, along Saudi Arabia's west coast and the Red Sea. There is a major port, bringing trade and travel from across the region and the world. Of course, there are also the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Our international airport serves as the main gateway to this region, the Hijaz, a major trading route between north and south since ancient times. Jeddah is the main tourist and economic capital of the Kingdom, home to national and international companies as well as major consulates. We are at the center of efforts to expand tourism into Saudi Arabia through the building of new entertainment facilities. After all, we are the second-largest city in the Kingdom. This is why InterContinental is so optimistic about the city and its future. </p><h4>How should high-profile hotels in Jeddah adjust in line with the expected increase in the number of international guests? </h4><p>Given the large number of national and international businesses in the city, hotels in Jeddah have been host to thousands of business travelers over the years. Part of Vision 2030 is to increase travel to the Kingdom for leisure as well as spiritual purposes. We play a key role in that plan. </p><h4>Where do you see the biggest gaps in the Saudi hospitality segment? </h4><p>Every challenge is an opportunity. We do not know the meaning of the word “gap." Any shortfall in services is an opportunity to be resourceful and think outside of the box. The growth of the hospitality sector is extremely promising, as it reflects Vision 2030 itself. We want to grow alongside Saudi Arabia. </p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for 2020? </h4><p>Our strategy is to build strong relationships and partnerships with local and international companies. By offering more entertainment services, we hope to create a demand that we will later serve. We need to make customers first before we can profit from their business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>L'azurde has become the largest gold and jewelry designer, manufacturer, and distributor in the Middle East. It is the fourth-largest jewelry manufacturer worldwide. How have you advanced in the Saudi market?</h4><p>We were launched 40 years ago in Riyadh by a Saudi entrepreneur. He invested tremendously in manufacturing capabilities and technology. This is why we have a 20,000sqm facility and make annual investments in state-of-the-art technology and machinery. The company was acquired by a private equity group in 2010, which bought 77% of L'azurde, transforming it from a family-owned business to a private-equity-owned firm. Then, in 2016, we listed the company on the Saudi Tadawul stock exchange. In 2018, L'azurde made its first-ever acquisition by taking over the Kingdom-based franchise of TOUS, a fashion jewelry brand that operates more than 800 stores around the world. Our acquisition was one of the largest M&amp;A transactions in Saudi Arabia in 2018. To add this brand, we decided to take advantage of our management skills and understanding of the Arab consumer. We were also aided by our good relationship with malls in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. As of 2Q2019, we had five straight quarters of growing revenues and net income YoY. We have two major markets, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, where 90% of our revenues come from. We have been in Egypt for more than 20 years. We operate two large factories there, employing 1,200 people. We are by far the leader in the Egyptian markets. Overall, we sell 1 million pieces of jewelry each year. Every month we launch 500 new designs. We invest significantly in innovation and design. The first thing our customers ask when they walks into a store is, “What is new?" We continue to innovate, design, and launch new collections, designed specifically for the Arab world. L'azurde has become famous because of its association with celebrities and its collections launched by top designers. There are many up-and-coming fashionistas in Saudi Arabia. We collaborate with some to support Saudi women in entrepreneurship. We want to let them contribute, rather than just being customers.</p><h4>What are some of the unique characteristics of the Saudi market? </h4><p>In 2018, we were the highest-selling premium jewelry brand in the Saudi market, in comparison to local and regional players. We are positioned as a premium brand, offering top-quality craftsmanship and designs. We do not compare ourselves to international brands. We understand and come from the region, and we custom-design high-quality premium jewelry for Arab women. We offer gold jewelry that we sell by weight to Saudi women. Gold is a great way for them to preserve the value of their investments themselves. That is an extremely important aspect of our product for Saudi women. Second, we understand the designs they desire for different occasions because of our history of selling, developing, and designing gold jewelry in Saudi.</p><h4>What are some of the specifics of supply chains in the luxury segment?</h4><p>We borrow gold through banks that hold our working capital. We do not buy or own gold. We get diamonds mainly from India, directly from suppliers we have known for many years.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and ambitions for the coming years ahead?</h4><p>We have a major opportunity with the launch of Miss L', our fashion jewelry brand. Moving forward we will fully leverage our understanding of the Middle East to grow L'azurde, TOUS, and Miss L' throughout the region. We also may potentially expand into Europe and the US. Over the next year, we will add a few additional brands to complement our current portfolio. The jewelry industry overall is fairly fragmented, and there is room for many players to target different needs and aspirations of consumers. This is why we will move from a single-brand model to a multiple “house of brands" model over the coming years. We are on track to achieve this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Almutlaq is a family-owned business with 40 years of experience. Could you tell us more about its recent transformation? </h4><p>The company was established in 1979 and we are celebrating our 40th anniversary in 2019. In early 2019, I was appointed as the first non-family CEO of the company, which indicates how the owners envision developing the company. In mid-2019, we started our anniversary campaign by offering our customers attractive deals and merchandise. Almutlaq has a deep-rooted history in Saudi Arabia and was one of the first few furniture businesses allowed to import furniture. What is interesting about Almutlaq is that it does not serve only one lifestyle. We cater to a wide range of consumers in Saudi Arabia, from young millennials to clients who prefer carved furniture from the Victorian era. We also have customers with what we call a “transitional interest." That means they want something in between classic and modern styles. We also cover a wide range of prices, from middle to mid-high and high-end furniture. With this we cover a huge spectrum of customers in Saudi Arabia. </p><h4>Can you tell us a bit about the brands you offer? </h4><p>Almutlaq has four brands. The first is Almutlaq, which is also the company's original brand. It mainly covers the classic to transitional lifestyle and caters to mid-range customers, such as government employees and small business owners. Then, we have our CityW brand, which is actually a Chinese company that started manufacturing and then decided to go into retail. It has a number of showrooms in China and Southeast Asia. CityW is focused on more transitional to contemporary style, affordable merchandise, and furniture. CityW is a high-quality brand with sleek design. Our third brand, Roomz, was the creative idea of our board's younger generation. They created Roomz because they saw a need in the market—there was no one-stop shop for a wide variety of high-end furniture. Therefore, they invested in a huge, almost 13,000-sqm, showroom that caters to mid- to high-end customers. You can find some excellent international brands there, including American and European brands. We have put a mix of lifestyles into Roomz—it has classic, transitional, and contemporary furniture under one roof. At present, we have one showroom, but we have a strategic plan to expand our Roomz portfolio to other cities in the next five years. Our fourth brand, Creative Home, is mainly focused on furniture-related accessories and accents, such as special, limited-addition furniture that you will not find anywhere else. We have one shop in Riyadh. Creative Home was only introduced a few years ago to cover another need in the market. A lot of furniture retailers here have bits and pieces of accessories and accents within their portfolio. We decided to give our customers a world of accessories under one roof where they can go, look, and make their choice. </p><h4>How do you envision the future of Saudi furniture in terms of design and manufacturing?</h4><p>We are proud to have another separate business under the umbrella of the Almutlaq family that manufactures transitional sofas. We have signed another agreement with a Saudi factory that makes attractive fitted wardrobes. It has been in the market for almost 20 years, and we decided to partner with them to support our business and the market's specific needs. The majority of the furniture we buy from the US does not come with wardrobes because walk-in closets are popular there. Everyone building a new house in Saudi wants to tailor their wardrobe to fit their needs, so fitted wardrobes are the trend at present. Almutlaq is supportive of local manufacturing companies. Having your manufacturing next door means you can get more products when you need them. When we buy from the US or China, we have to wait almost four months for delivery. Local manufacturing only takes a couple of weeks. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AEG manages a diverse portfolio of companies in the family entertainment and event sphere. Could you give us an overview?</h4><p><strong>MARK SATCHELL</strong> In 2016, Saudi Arabia introduced the General Entertainment Authority (GEA), which has done fantastic things. It has put Saudi Arabia on the map as a serious contender when it comes to international entertainment. At the same time, it has done it respectfully and has not gone too far over the line too quickly. It has been a gradual process. Thus far, there have been events like Formula E racing, with live acts like The Black Eyed Peas and David Guetta. AEG identified a significant gap in the market, as most international events were brought in together with the entire supply chain. During the buying process, we were not necessarily getting the best service that should be delivered to the people of Saudi Arabia. Next, we decided to bring in companies to form an entertainment group to assume full control over costs and, more importantly, quality. We strive to provide the best experience for ticket price. </p><p><strong>RIYADH AL ZAMIL</strong> For us, it is not just about making money, but rather about having an actual social impact and taking the opportunity to improve lives—that is what we want to be our legacy. There are many new companies in the entertainment sector, though we are truly local. We have 10-15 years of experience. We understand it is not just about the show, but also about the entire supply chain, including construction, manpower, crew, audio/visual, and food and beverage. We believe in importing expertise rather than re-inventing the wheel.</p><h4>What are your upcoming plans to create shows and events with a strong local presence?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MS </strong>Moving forward, we believe in a mix of getting shows from inside and developing local talent. We even believe we can bring a Saudi show abroad, for which we have the Saudi Orchestra performing 'Sixties until Now,' a musical with all sorts of dances and music since the 1960s. There is a conductor, several actors, as well as a narrator who brings the story together. Now, Kuwait, Dubai, and New York are asking for it. It will be the first local Saudi orchestra to go international. </p><h4>How do you create and organize your own shows and events in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MS</strong> The important thing to remember with creativity is to never squash it, as restraining creativity is a silly idea. At AEG, anyone can come to us with an idea. Sometimes, the most bizarre ideas turn into the most beautiful products and shows. That said, we are not interested in creating pure entertainment, as we would like to create something with a message and social relevance. </p><p><span></span><strong>RAZ</strong> When it comes to the supply chain, we have built up an ecosystem of sister companies to support any new initiatives. AEG is part of RAZ Group, which is essentially an empowerment company with around 90 entrepreneurs who founded and developed their company under our holding. We aim for synergies and provide mentorship and consultation where necessary. When they are up to speed, entrepreneurs can become sub-contractors, or we can partner in another way. Generally, we do not believe in competition in our sector; rather, we find ways to collaborate. </p><h4>What can we expect in the coming 18 months?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MS</strong> In terms of international content, there are some extremely famous brands that will come to Saudi, hopefully by the end of 2019. We also have a strong focus on creating more content locally that will eventually get to the outside world. The orchestra is a great example of that content, which we aim to take to the Association of Performing Arts Professionals in New York City in January 2020. If we go next year, I believe it will be the first-ever Saudi show outside the Kingdom. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[                                    <h4>How would you evaluate the company's journey and the current positioning in the market?</h4><p>Over the past 12 years, our company has evolved from Leejam 1.0 and Leejam 2.0 to Leejam 3.0. Back in 2006, when the company was formed, the owners began with opening fitness centers. This caught on rapidly, and Saudis began to include fitness as part of their lifestyle, bringing growth opportunities for the company. That was Leejam 1.0. However, as the business grew, the founders decided to take the company public. In 2013, they were advised to have a private equity partner on board to help lead the company through its next phase of growth—Leejam 2.0. At that time, we had three missions: corporate transformation, investment in senior management for business continuity, and a successful IPO. Around 75%+ of the current management was hired during this phase. Leejam went through its IPO in September 2018. It was in fact the most successful IPO in the GCC in the past couple of years, with a stock price that has increased 78% since IPO. Today, Leejam is worth well over USD1 billion and has around 4,000 employees. </p><h4>What are some of the trends in the market following the increased attention on sports under Vision 2030?</h4><p>Two things happened in Saudi Arabia, and we could not have been in a better place at a better time for our fitness business. The first major development was more opportunities for women and the approval of female gyms in Saudi Arabia. With that, the market grew overnight by 50% in 2017. Since then, we have opened 29 female fitness centers in Saudi Arabia. By the end of 2019, we will have 40 female centers, making us the largest player in this category today. Also, in 2018, we took over the Princess Noura University Fitness Center, the largest female fitness center in the world. The second major development was the Quality of Life program under Vision 2030, with great attention paid to encouraging healthy lifestyles. We work in close coordination with the government on how gyms should be operated, with male and female sections. </p><h4>How can companies benefit from Fitness Time?</h4><p>Leejam has a growing corporate wellness initiative with over 350 corporate clients/companies across the Kingdom. In some cases, we run fitness facilities exclusively for companies in their office location. We have a B2B concept, where companies buy corporate memberships at a discount for their employees as part of their employment benefits, and a B2C concept, where employees get discounts when they purchase memberships at the Fitness Time locations. Both B2B and B2C partnerships are a win-win situation for corporate clients—they not only improve employee benefits at a discounted rate, but also reduce medical insurance costs and sick days with healthier employees.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on future expansion, both within the Kingdom and in the GCC region?</h4><p>We already have a presence in the UAE with locations in four of the Emirates. There is also strong interest from Kuwait and Oman. However, when the female opportunity in the Kingdom opened up, we did not want to miss it. We have not opened up other locations in the GCC yet. In the next four to five years, we will continue to add 15 or more centers each year across all categories, focusing on our existing geographic footprint, which is Saudi Arabia and UAE, as well as expanding in the GCC.</p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SEVEN was started as the Kingdom's latest Public Investment Fund (PIF), focused on the establishment of entertainment centers. Could you tell us more about SEVEN's mission and what we can expect in the coming years? </h4><p>SEVEN has the mission to develop, invest in, and operate a number of family-friendly entertainment destinations and attractions in Saudi Arabia. We are the leading arm of the Kingdom's plan to invest USD64 billion to build an entertainment ecosystem. It has been widely quoted that Saudi Arabia will attract nearly 30 million visitors a year by 2030. Our aim is to bring visitors to Saudi Arabia, of course, but also provide meaningful entertainment and gainful employment options. Our vision is to become the leading national investor, developer, and operator of a diverse entertainment ecosystem. We are working to support and develop the entertainment sector, build capacity, and strengthen local talent by establishing a myriad of thoughtful and creative recreational projects across the country. Our vision is four fold: to launch movie theaters, recreational complexes, amusement parks, and family entertainment centers. In the coming years, you can expect to witness a sea-change in Saudi Arabia's entertainment sector. We will see a large influx of new visitors, keen to enjoy ground-breaking, world-class leisure facilities</p><h4>Saudi Arabia is relatively unknown as a tourist destination. How does SEVEN fit into the master plan to attract more foreign visitors? <br></h4><p>Our mandate is closely aligned with Vision 2030, and we are the investment arm of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund. SEVEN, as the driving force in the Kingdom's new entertainment era, is charged with implementing the vision, which includes creating a destination worthy of attracting international visitors. Attracting more tourists—and tourist dollars—centers around developing a world-class entertainment ecosystem. We are lucky in many ways to start with greenfield sites and no legacy issues. We are also fortunate to have the blessing and backing of the Saudi government and authorities in building the infrastructure. In line with Saudi culture and tradition, our focus from the outset has been on family-friendly entertainment. From providing the latest high-tech entertainment such as virtual reality and AI-based gaming and events, to exploring the best of natural wonders, Saudi Arabia presents an untapped mine of exciting new tourism opportunities. </p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our plan is ambitious, rapid, and breathtaking. It is unlike anything ever seen anywhere else in the world. When we launched in 2017, it was announced that our owners at the PIF expect the company's projects to serve more than 50 million visitors, provide more than 22,000 direct jobs, and contribute approximately SAR8 billion (USD2.1 billion) to GDP by 2030. At launch in 2017, it is on record that we had initial capital of SAR10 billion (USD2.7 billion) to invest in nationwide projects. The 2019-2020 financial year will see the rapid rollout of more family-friendly cinemas across the Kingdom. We plan to open several movie theaters this year alone. Our plans are ambitious but teaming up with AMC Group—the largest movie theatre company in the world—makes it simpler to emulate their world-leading experience across the Kingdom. We have scheduled up to 50 movie theaters, which comprise a total of 450 screens, to open by 2022. Our schedule is to open up to 20 entertainment destinations before 2030. We have already made announcements regarding our plans for the Riyadh entertainment complex, and revealed plans for the eastern province. Dammam, Al-Khobar, and Al-Ahsa will see a theme park on a 100-ha site at Al-Aziziyah, along with six cinemas and three new entertainment destinations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Starting first with the aviation sector, how is DACC building aviation expertise and driving the sector to new heights?</h4><p>Our strategy stems from the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai to make Dubai the aviation capital of the world. With this in mind, we are building an aviation ecosystem which include airports, aviation-related businesses, and learning institutions that cater to the needs of all those businesses. Dubai first started with an airport that handled five million passengers, expanding to almost 27 million passengers. General aviation has always been the center of attention within the sector which tends to overlook the key importance of business aviation. This has led us to our decision of exploring the growth potential of this segment considering there are more business aviation operations at Al Maktoum International than in Dubai International Airport and we see them continuously growing. When it comes to aviation-related businesses, there are many types of services that support general aviation such as maintenance, repair, and overhaul services (MROs), which look after the airlines' needs. Cargo and catering services are included in this segment and we have companies which have now moved to Dubai South, the Emirates Skycargo and Emirates Catering. When DACC first opened for business, we aimed at attracting the world's major aviation companies and successfully they have set up their business operations here. However, we believe that small and medium enterprises play an essential role in providing a holistic range of services for the aerospace industry. We are building that platform now for them considering their specific needs. All these businesses require talents that have high-level of qualifications and must be internationally certified due to the nature of the industry. We have partnered with the University of South Wales, which has set up their campus here to provide training dedicated only to aviation. In addition, Dubai South now hosts the Dubai Air Show which continues to witness growth. When it kicked off here, it has become the largest air show in size with the highest number of exhibitors and visitors so far and we are building on that success. This year is expected to be the biggest in all aspects. Dubai South as a home for the global aviation industry is essentially focused on providing a complete ecosystem and we are working to enable this ecosystem from multiple approaches.</p><h4>How is DACC pioneering innovation in the aviation sector?</h4><p>Going digital is highly important for the sector, however this aspect can be easily seen in the logistics industry. For the aviation sector, the priority is time, which can be addressed by going digital to hasten the processing of paper works and the like. Since the industry is involved in a chain of processes, being digitally-savvy requires that all other counterparts are in the same level and we are leading to that direction where the whole cycle is digitally connected. Moreover, going digital means increase access to facts and data which are key to good decision-making for any business. With the use of advanced digital solutions, we can increase awareness on certain cases, thus leading to a more effective and easier decision-making. Another aspect is tapping innovation and technology to advance Dubai's aviation ecosystem and we have been working with 3D companies exploring the possibilities of developing spare parts for airplanes. It is exciting to be able to provide orders on time rather than producing and then storing them in warehouses. We are still in the early stage of 3D printing and materials, however, we see this sector expanding to any spare part, whether it is for cars or computers.</p><h4>How does sustainability factor into this holistic ecosystem?</h4><p>When sustainability has a business case, then companies begin to consider them as it makes economic sense to invest in it. In the case of DACC, we operate as a fully commercial business and do not depend on the government for our operations. We generate our own income and address our costs which usually go to infrastructure and utilities. In this regard, when operational costs which include water, electricity, or gas are high, it has an impact on the bottom line. To address this, we are taking a lot of measure to generate alternative sources of energy. Dubai South has been investing in solar power generation to save energy while supplying the highest demand as well, rather than depend on gas distribution. Our approach is to show that we can do to our own facilities and then offer the system to others, which creates another good business stream. However, energy is only one aspect of our sustainability efforts and we continue to explore emerging ideas in line with our environmental responsibility agenda. For instance, Dubai South is the first community in the emirate to bring an electric bus model made in Australia and we are experimenting how it can adapt to adverse weather conditions especially during the summer. This is part of a larger plan to connect the whole of Dubai South through a form of light rail or electric bus system. Sustainability in mobility is an integral part of Dubai South's future and we are doing a lot of studies to move in this direction. Among other areas, a big part of sustainability is the proximity of people from where they live to where they work. We are working on these various aspects, the first is which is a housing system for people working in the logistics industry within the vicinity. It must be close to their work to enable them to use sustainable transport systems including bicycle. For executives, we are building a dedicated residential community on the south side of Dubai South around a golf course. On the north side of the airport, there is another residential development plan and we are inviting developers to come and build as master developers. Currently, we are looking to build 1,400 housing units in the same area to provide people working within Dubai South the opportunity to live close to where they work and save them time from commuting while contributing to environmental sustainability, including their wellness goals as they could spend more time to their health and with their family. Once it is ready, including retail facilities and schools, it will provide a model community with a high level of sustainability. From a food security perspective, we are implementing the latest innovation in modern farming to build one of the largest vertical farms and establish a joint venture for land-based fish farming. These are just some of the plans and initiatives in the pipeline and I must say that there has been a lot of thoughtful consideration which incorporates sustainability when doing the master planning for Dubai South.</p><h4>What does Dubai South mean for the Emirate, and within that, what is the vision for leveraging the legacy of Expo 2020? </h4><p>It is of great pride that Expo 2020 is taking place within the city of Dubai South. Right from the start, Dubai South has been fundamentally providing added value to Dubai's latest global initiative, the Expo 2020 — from the backend planning to ensuring the interconnectedness of all related infrastructure. From a logistics perspective, we are also working to serve the Expo's perceived needs by ensuring a seamless connection between their warehousing needs and what is taking place here. Once Expo 2020 officially opens to the world, our exhibit terminal can provide a platform to transport people, not to mention the key role of Al Maktoum International Airport for travelers and visitors coming for the Expo. During the event, we are confident that there will be a spillover of visits to include the whole Dubai South for businesses and visitors to witness firsthand what we do here. It is a mutual relationship as the global event serves as a catalyst for the future growth of the city and Dubai South works for the Expo in the same manner. At present, Dubai South is in the process of creating a niche position to deliver some key aspects of Dubai's ambitious plans and we are taking the legacy of Expo 2020 in a big way. The Emirate of Dubai has its own strategy and we work on our strategies based on how we can complement and contribute to its growth. In terms of aviation, we are building extensively to promote Dubai as a global capital for aviation as we are in the process of building the largest airport in the world. In addition to that is the Mohammed Bin Rashid Aerospace Hub, which provides the platform for many other aspects of aviation to prosper here. In terms of global trade, we are continuing the legacy of Dubai as a central focus point by further enhancing the logistics sector as a world-class system enabling emerging businesses to tap into the emirate's opportunities, as well as the UAE, the region and other neighboring regions, especially with the unprecedented growth of e-commerce in the region. We are proactively gaining ground as a global e-commerce hub, having brought Amazon for instance within Dubai South. Among other developments, technology is at the heart of our initiatives aimed at enhancing efficiency in various services. We are confident that all the activities that will transpire during Expo 2020 will bring the biggest benefits to the growth of Dubai South, being a futuristic community that will place Dubai even more visible as among the best and most sustainable places in the world to visit, work, and live.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[domingo-chinea-barrera-president-sociedad-portuaria-santa-marta]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the first trimester of 2019, around 37 million tons of products moved through all the ports in the Caribbean region. Can you tell us about the size and importance of the port of Santa Marta in this context?</h4><p>We are a multipurpose port; we operate containers, general loads, solid bulks, carbon, and liquid bulk. We are mainly an exporting port with exports comprising 64% of our activity. Our main export items are bananas, cape gooseberries, liquid loads such as palm oil, and carbon. We import cereals, general loads, and containers. We also offer specialized docking. We are one of the main public ports and the only Colombian multipurpose port that exports. We are the go-to port for Colombia's agribusiness sector.</p><h4>Aside from agriculture, what other industries are starting to export more from the port of Santa Marta?</h4><p>The export sector has the potential to become the motor of the Colombian economy. Aside from traditional exports such as bananas, carbon, and palm oil, there are other newer ones such as flowers, avocados, and cape gooseberries. Our main objective as a port is to be the agribusiness port, meaning we focus on partnering with the agriculture sector. As a country, we mostly import raw materials to manufacture products for local use. Colombia needs to focus on export-led growth in the future.</p><h4>The La Dorada-Santa Marta railroad passage was recently inaugurated. What role did the port of Santa Marta play in this, and how important will this route be?</h4><p>We have to thank the government for this effort to reactivate the railway. It is impossible to have competitive and efficient ports if the land transport networks continue to face issues. The railway has always complemented road transit, and we need to continue thinking of other alternatives to stop depending so much on road transportation. The growth of the country will depend a great deal on the growth of terrestrial transport. There should be great logistical developments that connect the ports with the great production and consumption areas like Bogotá, the coffee triangle, Medellí­n, and Barranquilla. At present, it takes about a week to get imports to their final destination; this process needs to be improved.</p><h4>What are the natural advantages of the port, and what is its growth potential?</h4><p>Santa Marta has many competitive advantages due to dry weather and low oxidation levels. We have many geographical advantages but we need to improve and work to further develop them. For example, we need to dredge to get all docks to 16.5m of draft.</p><h4>What are some of the prominent multinationals that work with the port? How important is it to increase their presence in the city?</h4><p>We work with Dole, Chiquita, Banasan, Uniban, and Daabon. We also export a great deal of mining products. The mining sector is important not only for the region, but also the country. We must give opportunities to these companies to carry out their projects, such as offshore projects and oil and gas projects. We need to continue giving guarantees. As a port and region, we have advanced significantly, though we need to keep working with companies that want to invest in the country and region. In that sense, the agriculture sector has the potential to further generate employment and attract investment.</p><h4>Can you give us examples of how you have invested in technology?</h4><p>We are working on getting all the information of the port to be electronically received, managed, and transmitted. We receive all documents via EDI for example. We invest in software, hardware, and human talent. The navy lines that come here also go to Europe and the US, and they have to receive the same services they receive anywhere in the world. Therefore, we have to provide them with the same standard of service as developed countries. We also do free non-intrusive scanning inspection of all exports, whereas other ports charge around USD200-300. That differentiates us from others and also makes us a very secure port.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2020?</h4><p>We face some challenges when it comes to investing in equipment, training, and working with exporters. We need to work with the mayor's office, the governor's office, the national government, DIAN, ICA, INVIMA, and the anti-narcotic police departments in order to realize the ports full potential. The pending issue is that we need to work on a terminal for cruise ships because we currently do not have one. Moreover, as the oldest city in Latin America, Santa Maria has great tourism potential that is not being tapped. Moreover, the city needs an international airport. The private and public sectors face different challenges but they need to work together to overcome them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Red Sea Project is among the Kingdom's most ambitious mega projects. What is your grand vision here, and how do you expect it will change Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Our grand vision for the Red Sea Project is one that is underpinned by sustainability. We are working toward a new era in sustainable luxury tourism, where every element of the development considers sustainability first and foremost. We are committed to managing visitor numbers to protect the site from over tourism and to work toward our goal of having a net-positive impact on the environment. The destination will be powered entirely by renewable energy. We plan to implement policies requiring zero waste to landfill and a total ban on single-use plastics. We are also seeking to develop new technologies and solutions to continually improve our environmental footprint. The Red Sea Project will position the Kingdom on the global tourism map and help it meet its Vision 2030 objectives. As a development, we are ideally positioned to tap into the global luxury tourism market, the fastest growing segment of the international travel and tourism industry. This presents us with the opportunity to open new areas of economic activity, and we estimate that the project is expected to contribute SAR22 billion (USD5.86 billion) per year to GDP. The project will play a vital part in economic diversification and lead the way in incorporating sustainable principles into business and development. </p><h4>The project is set to create 70,000 jobs while creating new opportunities for the local economy—including for the SME community and individual entrepreneurs. How will this happen?</h4><p>At completion, the project will directly employ around 35,000 people and will support an equivalent number of jobs in the wider community by creating opportunities for local businesses, entrepreneurs, and supporting industries. As an employer, our primary mandate is to create opportunities for Saudis, and we will be investing significantly in training, education, and development programs to foster the skills and capabilities that we need from within the Kingdom. We are working on developing various training programs to roll out in the coming years to help Saudis with an interest in the hospitality and tourism industries acquire the skills they need to build successful careers. We are committed to working toward educating and encouraging Saudis across disciplines and industries so that we can not only facilitate growth within the company, but also within society as a whole. </p><h4>The Quality of Life program seeks to enhance the standard of living in the Kingdom. How do you work within this ecosystem that strives to develop the leisure industry?</h4><p>The Red Sea Project is fully aligned with the wider Vision 2030 plan, supporting the creation of jobs and opportunities for Saudis—both direct and indirect—as a consequence of opening up the international tourism market. We are creating new opportunities for people to build promising careers and realize their personal ambitions. This is a collaborative effort in which we work closely with all the relevant government ministries to ensure that we realize our ambitions as effectively and efficiently as possible. </p><h4>What primary ambitions have you set for the first phase of the project?</h4><p>Now that the master plan has been completed, we are beginning the first phase of the project. This phase is scheduled for completion in 2022 and includes 14 luxury and hyper-luxury hotels. Phase I will provide more than 3,000 rooms across five islands and two inland resorts, as well as the development of necessary infrastructure and supporting logistics, including the new airport planned to enhance access to the destination. The Red Sea Project is a unique opportunity, and it's one we want to approach in the right way. First and foremost, we are focused on building in a sustainable way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about your vision for the Amaala project, developments thus far, and what visitors may expect in the future?</h4><p>Amaala is set to become a curator of transformative journeys, taking inspiration from the arts, wellness, and the natural wonders of the Red Sea. Amaala will redefine today's ultra-luxury travel experience and the tourism experience in its entirety. Through the provision of unique amenities and personalized services, each guest will play a leading role in shaping their own bespoke experience, as we celebrate the pillars that tie Amaala together. Catering to singles, couples, and families from across the region, as well as travelers from destinations such as China, Brazil, Russia, India, Western Europe, the US, and Japan, Amaala differentiates itself through its values and unique experiences. An immersive and interactive destination, guests will be able to indulge in customized adventures, culture, history, sports, relaxation, and one-of-a-kind retail shopping experiences. Segregated into three phrases, construction is scheduled to begin by the end of 2019, with all phases expected to reach completion by 2028.</p><h4>How does Amaala fit into the Kingdom's master plan to attract more foreign visitors? </h4><p>The tourism sector is one of the most promising parts of the Kingdom's diversification efforts to advance the tourism sector by attracting 22.1 million international visitors by 2051. Amaala, one of the projects under development along the Saudi coastline of the Red Sea, aims to tap into the flow of visitors both regionally and internationally with a view to providing an exclusive, personalized offering for its guests. Situated within the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Natural Reserve, the project will also contribute to the sustainability goals of Vision 2030 and the preservation of heritage sites. Amaala is to be built with a zero-carbon footprint as a primary goal, utilizing international sustainability standards in our operational protocols, covering everything from the use of solar power and advanced waste management technologies to sustainable farming, recycling, and much more.</p><h4>In recent years, the public ecosystem around culture, entertainment, sports, and heritage has been expanded, with various project-specific entities like Amaala, NEOM, and the Red Sea Project. Could you tell us more about the synergies between the various entities?</h4><p>Through the creation of world-class entertainment destinations, the improvement of visa issuance procedures for visitors, and the preparation and development of the country's historic and heritage sites, the Kingdom is taking great strides in the growth of its culture, entertainment, sports, and heritage. A transformative idea, Amaala is crucial to the new Red Sea destination resort portfolio, which aims to establish a unique tourism ecosystem. </p><h4>What are the opportunities for the private sector—in hospitality, entertainment, F&amp;B, leisure, and construction—to get involved in the Amaala project? </h4><p>Targeting over 2,500 hotel keys and over 800 residential villas, Amaala opens numerous opportunities within the private sector. From apartments and estate homes to high-end retail establishments, we will partner with private-sector companies, world-class operators, and market investors specialized in the hospitality sector to provide a customized experience for guests. The project will also act as a key driver of Vision 2030's objectives. </p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the year ahead, and what is the prospective timeline of development? </h4><p>With a government-approved master plan, we continue to work with world-class suppliers and contractors to bring the vision to life, while engaging with global architects and designers to develop world-class facilities in a sustainable manner and enhancing the natural landscape. Over the course of the coming year, we look forward to the official groundbreaking, as we begin to see progress unfold toward the vision unveiled in September 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most recent developments to make AlUla accessible and operational?</h4><p>For many years, the region of AlUla was a popular destination mostly because of its most famous site, Hegra (also known as Mada'in Saleh). But in 2017, RCU was established by Royal Decree under the leadership of our governor, Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Farhan Al-Saud, with a remit to develop a long-term strategy to safeguard its precious landscapes and cultural heritage for future generations and share them with the world. From the start, we were acutely aware of our responsibility to AlUla and the important role we play in conserving its timeless heritage for future generations. Our goal is to build a team of talented individuals who share our values and passion for this mission. Since 2017, our team has grown exponentially, yet our values and mission have remained constant—I believe this is what makes us truly unique as an organization. </p><h4>Is the regulatory side developing fast enough to attract international investors and meet their standards?</h4><p>Vision 2030 has facilitated several positive regulatory developments, making Saudi a more attractive market for foreign investors. At the same time, we have been working hard to develop our own regulatory framework for RCU, in line with global best practices, to meet and exceed the standards of the international investment community. </p><h4>How will you develop AlUla in an economically sustainable and environmentally sensitive way?</h4><p>At RCU, we have placed the local community at the heart of everything we do. That means that when we talk about sustainability, we are committed to developing a sustainable local economy in AlUla. To drive long-term success, we must empower the local community to play a role in the economic development of the area. That is why we have established several initiatives to help us achieve this goal under the leadership of our governor, His Highness Prince Badr. In 2018, we successfully launched the first phase of our scholarship program that gave 160 students from AlUla the opportunity to pursue degrees at academic institutions around the world in France, the UK, and the US. We are also committed to preserving and ensuring the sustainability of AlUla's natural heritage and wildlife through many initiatives, including the establishment of the Global Fund for the Arabian Leopard. We believe it is our duty to champion the revitalization of the Arabian Leopard, a critically endangered subspecies once indigenous to AlUla. We recently signed a partnership agreement with Panthera—the global big cat conservation body—committing to investing USD20 million over the next 10 years on conservation measures, as one of the first of many planned international partnerships to bring the best minds in the world together in AlUla to safeguard its natural heritage and environment.</p><h4>What will be the most noteworthy aspects of AlUla in the next 10 years?</h4><p>We are developing AlUla to be an open living museum and creating something truly unique, an experience that integrates the natural and cultural heritage as one living environment. Statistics from the World Tourism Organization show that heritage and culture tourism is one of the largest growing sectors in all travel markets. Across all income levels, there is double-digit growth in people interested in visiting and engaging with local stories and assets in new and genuine ways. Today, people want to disconnect from their chaotic mainstream lives and reconnect with nature. They want to absorb culture, engage with locals, and savor their traditions—everything we do will seek to amplify these experiences and create something unparalleled in today's world of international travel and leisure. Our work alongside the people of AlUla represents the latest chapter in a history dating back over many millennia. And we will proudly continue as the custodians of the awe-inspiring beauty of AlUla and help the world discover more about this extraordinary and yet-to-be discovered masterpiece.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the approach of GEA advanced in 2019?</h4><p>Today, we are simply putting more focus on the entertainment sector. The entertainment offering has always been a wide one across multiple categories, and the first few years have proven that these offerings are in high demand. Under our new leadership, we have more support to expand our plans and fast track many of our initiatives. One of the most vital developments was the establishment of the Saudi Seasons, a new calendar concept led by a new committee directly under the Crown Prince. Across the Kingdom, for all provinces, we have aligned the entertainment agenda in terms of these seasons to better align all events, taking into consideration our climate conditions and cultural agenda. This organizes internal tourism and will attract tourists from abroad. Additionally, we will fill these seasons with cultural, entertainment, and sporting events to create a better quality of life in the Kingdom by spreading joy and creating a vibrant society.</p><h4>How does this seasonal approach call for more alignment among all the cultural authorities?</h4><p>With anything that is new, coordination will get better over time. For example, the National Day was a well-coordinated effort across multiple authorities. Now with the creation of Seasons, different committees are focused on different aspects, such as culture, entertainment, sporting, and tourism. This allows us to adopt a holistic approach and adds a lot of demand for creating events and activities that attract tourism, both locally and internationally. We are working now to make sure we program the Seasons well in terms of location, time, and audience. We also take international occasions into consideration and aim to create events that are relevant to a global audience.</p><h4>Will the authority slowly phase out of its role as a funder and become a regulator?</h4><p>The funding initiative is currently housed under GEA since no other mandate exists for it. However, a new entity will take over this role in the future. The infrastructure will be expanded to accommodate different SME funding models. That said, we invite banks and other financial institutions to invest in entertainment, including the entire chain of private equity and private capital. In the recent years, we have proven there is demand, and now we have to prove there is a financial reward. We will then witness more funding vehicles that want to contribute. Subsidies are going to ease eventually, and it will become more sustainable through creating the right infrastructure. For example, we currently lack dedicated venues and are thus relying on existing ones such as universities, public spaces, lands, and so on. We are working to create a platform that includes a database of all available venues so we can match them with the relevant event organizers. </p><h4>What are your main priorities going forward?</h4><p>First and foremost, we will continue to align ourselves with other government entities to take a holistic view on developing the entertainment economy. The concept of seasons is also a priority that we are expanding. Tourism, culture, entertainment, and sport go hand-in-hand and will all contribute their share to the improvement of the quality of life in Saudi Arabia. Developing local content and infrastructure to facilitate growth is another strategic priority. The sector needs more local talent, and we recently organized a competition to source the available talents and train them. In more practical terms, we want to streamline our licensing process, so it becomes simpler for companies to get the necessary licensing for events. We are working on setting quality standards, developing a protocol for live events, and launching theme parks. In terms of local content, we are striving to export our own intellectual property and commercialize our offerings internationally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the essence of the Quality of Life program, launched in mid-2018 with a SAR130-billion (USD34.6 billion) budget, and how you envision funding to be allocated to achieve its goals?</h4><p><span></span>The Quality of Life Program is one of the vision realization programs (VRPs) adopted by HRH Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2016. It is based on three main pillars: a vibrant society, a thriving economy, and an ambitious nation. Vision 2030 aims to bring about a major qualitative leap on several levels including economic, social, cultural, and others. The Quality of Life program is one of the most comprehensive programs to achieve this vision and the most relevant to the lives of citizens and residents. It was originally established to enhance the quality of life in the Kingdom through improved lifestyle and infrastructure development. Second, we also aim to improve lifestyles to support the entertainment, cultural, sport, and recreational sectors and to increase the interaction of individuals and society with these sectors. The infrastructure for this includes work on transport, the urban landscape, housing, education, health, and other vital sectors of the country. Funding for the program's initiatives is through several means. Initiatives with high returns that can be accomplished quickly involve the private sector, such as cinemas, which has been revived through the program's initiatives, the implementation of the General Commission for Audiovisual Media (GCAM), and the private sector. Vital initiatives that lack financial or low-cost returns are achieved through direct government spending from the budget allocated to the program's initiatives, which are implemented by various government agencies according to their mandates, such as the General Culture Authority (GCA), the General Sport Authority (GSA), the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Housing, the Ministry of Education, and other quality-of-life partners. In total, there are 14 executive bodies for the initiatives of the program and more than 100 diverse initiatives, depending on the competencies of the partners. The program works with all these agencies to ensure that the initiatives are implemented.</p><h4>How can the Quality of Life program provide a smooth transition to an active and vibrant entertainment sector?</h4><p>Legislative initiatives occupy an important part of the program. The program works through several initiatives to change and develop legislation related to entertainment and culture and general legislation, which affect the quality of life in the Kingdom. We have initiatives with GCAM, GEA, and other sectors to remove any legislative obstacles to the growth of the sector and add incentive legislation that contributes to its growth. The legislation concerning GCAM and GEA was recently approved and is one of the main initiatives of the program to develop the general legislative environment in the Kingdom. Our organization is also well-positioned to monitor the ownership of the various programs, guide collaboration between the various authorities, and reassign certain responsibilities, if necessary. </p><h4>What primary ambitions have you set for the coming year? </h4><p>Following the approval of the organizational arrangements for the Quality of Life Program Center in November 2018, the program has now become one of our core priorities. The center will be independent and aims to support the hobbies sector, develop possible regulations and specialized competencies in quality of life, and initiate innovative creative initiatives. In 2019, we aspire to improve the quality of life in the Kingdom, move ahead with all the program's initiatives, build a broader strategy for the coming years, and come closer than ever to making the Kingdom's cities some of the leading cities in the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What construction projects is the company currently working on?</h4><p>The megaprojects, King Khalid University (KKU) Medical City and Jabal Omar Development Project, are continuing. We have four contracts at KKU worth over SAR3.5 billion, and we expect to complete them by 2019 or early 2020. The Jabal Omar project, which features luxury hotel towers and a shopping center, should be completed in 2020. We have also completed a few projects recently, including the Tabuk project for the Air Force. Saudi Baytur is proud to be the 2019 recipient of the Occupational Excellence Achievement Award and the Perfect Record Award from the USA National Safety Council for the Tabuk project. In 2018, we completed Ithra in Dhahran for Aramco, where we came in at the end to make it operational. We have a project at the Rabigh Refinery that has been ongoing since 2012 and doubled in value with additional contracts. That is at the closing stage, with all the construction and execution practically concluded. We also completed Aramco's Dammam Housing Project. We have another major project at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) that will continue until 2025. We were also awarded a new contract for NEOM airport in March, and that is in progress. That is a fast-track contract that has to be completed within 2019. The scope is to upgrade the airport to the level where it can be certified for commercial aircrafts to take off and land. At the moment, it is only authorized for use by private, charter, and military aircraft. That is an exciting project. Saudi Arabian Baytur Construction is also bidding for various other projects.</p><h4>You work on infrastructure, logistics, residential housing, and even industrial design projects. Does the company seek to position itself as a diversified solutions provider?</h4><p>We want to continue to be better at what we are doing rather than changing our base. Plus, we want to supplement certain activities, for example by bringing in facilities management services in addition to construction because that seems to be a service in demand right now. We are in housing, but not in the mass housing market because we cannot compete with the prices. We go for value-added projects. Our Aramco housing project was a special case where the high-end development could not be finished for years, and we made an offer that the client found reasonable; however, generally the prices being quoted by contractors in the mass housing market are not for us.</p><h4>What is the split between your public and private contracts?</h4><p>We do more public projects; if we take into account Aramco, SABIC, and other semi-public companies, the split is around 70% public and 30% private. We do not want to have too many private projects in our portfolio; we want to concentrate on hospitality, healthcare, education, and landmark public buildings. However, as the market is becoming difficult, we are being more aggressive in our pricing and bidding down the price of subcontractors and suppliers.</p><h4>What are your expectations for upcoming megaprojects?</h4><p>The Red Sea Coast projects are our focal point, because we have been in Tabuk for almost three years now for the Air Force project, so we know the market there. Then, on behalf of our affiliate, we managed construction in Sharma for the first initial Royal Hotel projects. We know the region, and that is where we want to concentrate. The projects there fit our expertise of high-end buildings and town centers. Sharma is the town on the Saudi Red Sea Coast that is closest to the NEOM Project. It is about a two-hour drive from Tabuk. We are also looking at the Qiddiya entertainment projects, though most of those are new to us, and we have never worked in the Riyadh region before. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk us through the company's current portfolio?</h4><p>SARED manages all the properties owned by the holding group and is structured into two divisions: development and O&amp;M. Through the development arm, we built Saudia City and are on hold for a new renovation masterplan that will be backed by feasibility studies by Colliers and JLL. Once these studies are finalized, we will present the plan to the board and engage in this new era, split into four phases to be developed in eight years. This represents our key strategic priority, although we remain active on other fronts too. Aside from Saudia City, we are currently working on a huge flight operation terminal development in Medina and the development and renovation of several buildings in Tabuk and Al Baha. Outside the Kingdom, we are working now on real estate in London where we have a headquarters and a warehouse at Heathrow Airport. </p><h4>How can the investor community regain trust in the Saudi real estate market?</h4><p>The current market conditions, especially on the residential side, offer an excellent opportunity for both developers and investors alike, as prices were reaching all-time highs both in terms of land and property. In 2020, we will witness the final correction. Some actors will exit the market, others will re-enter, and many will be willing to take advantage of the new reality. The real estate market cycle likely hit the lowest point in 2018, with many foreigners leaving the country, and is now starting to pick up. This means that this is the right time to buy because in four years we will witness another peak. These cycles are healthy for the market, and savvy investors should know how to position themselves accordingly. Saudi Arabia also provides them with the competitive advantage of a proper structure until 2030 and 2050 through the vision.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges faced by Jabal Omar in adapting to the Makkah region?</h4><p>Makkah's historical status presents several logistic and legal challenges that have historically prevented attempts to set up a development project of the scale of Jabal Omar. Meanwhile, the mountainous terrain of Makkah itself makes construction projects challenging. In some cases, a small tract of land might be owned by 200 different individuals, which means getting a unanimous decision to sell the land is difficult. Naturally, accommodating thousands of people throughout the year is a great logistical challenge, one that we have dealt with through the help of our subsidiaries. We have a safe track record with our development. </p><h4>Can you walk us through the major highlights of the new strategy for Jabal Omar Development Company? </h4><p>Within this context, the next step of our strategy is to transform the company into Saudi Arabia's top-tier real estate developer by adhering to global standards while remaining mindful of local tastes. Instead of following the old wholesale approach, we should respond to individual client demands, focusing on quality of service. We also need to deliver high-quality real estate developments and investments. In this sense, adopting the right approach in every aspect of the development project is crucial. From the planning stage, you need to gather all the required data and involve the right people on the team, while giving them appropriate incentives. We are keen to bring many components from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Makkah's heritage to the forefront, including culture, architecture, and the arts. While maintaining a focus on residential, hospitality, and retail developments, we will also be adding historical museums, culture, wellness, and entertainment-related areas so our customers spend more time in the region. </p><h4>What is your assessment of recent regulatory changes, including aspects concerning partnerships and private sector participation?</h4><p>For many years, the real estate sector in Saudi Arabia has been weighed down by a lack of regulation in development and construction; however, we are now seeing a slate of appropriate regulations falling into place. These updates are contributing to the creation of a network that incentivizes professional global and national industry players. For example, at the heart of the Saudi Vision 2030, there is an emphasis on international partnerships. There are two reasons for this. First, the power of cultural integration is important. We can benefit from best international practices while maintaining our Saudi culture. The presence of international players will lead to innovation. This is of great importance, as we lag behind in this area. Second, international cooperation is important in terms of capacity. Our vision is ambitious. It calls for a great deal of construction and renovation. To achieve that, we definitely need the help of international players. In light of these developments, the opportunities for private-sector participation are enormous. However, regulations have changed, and businesses need to adjust themselves to this new reality. This is the first time I have seen ministers and deputy ministers coming to private companies and pitching to them. The fact that these new channels of communication between the government and the private sector have opened up is an amazing development in itself. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Could you tell us more about this new avenue of funding?</h4><p>In 4Q2018, we launched our sukuk program and started to issue. At this point in time, we target the domestic market, and although the volume is rather significant, we view it as a stepping stone toward a larger presence in the capital markets and our engagement with investors. We plan to have further issuances this year, probably toward the end of the year, and we may go international after that. The sukuk issuances are part of our funding diversification agenda, for which we have other initiatives in the pipeline. This is in parallel to the increase of our balance sheet linked to the funding and liquidity we supply to the market. Thus far, we have deployed SAR1.2 billion (USD319.968 million) in funding. We recently signed the guarantee agreement with the Ministry of Finance, which was part of the original process that established SRC. This is a milestone in our refinancing program and our pursuit of optimized costs of lending for the borrower. We also work on strengthening the links with the rest of the housing ecosystem, for example with the Real Estate Development Fund (REDF) and the National Housing Company (NHC). Now that the foundations have been laid, we can fine-tune our individual proposals, and value proposition and reinforce the exchange amongst entities in the ecosystem. Further strengthening our partnerships will ultimately place us even more competitively in the global housing financing market. Already, there is a much stronger dynamic and trust at work, vindicating the initiatives that have been pushed across the board. There is traction, and the idea is to cultivate, nurture, and keep pushing this to long term.</p><h4>How do you include the changing demographics into your mid- to long-term strategy?</h4><p>First, the demographic is indeed changing, which includes a generation with a different mindset and approach to financing a house. At the ministry's level, there is a great focus on digitalization and the use of all social media to reach out to this young generation to inform them about access to home loans. At the company level, we have launched an awareness campaign about mortgages. Factoring in the demographics is an important element because of our long-term view. Second, the new generation has different ambitions and aspirations with a greater focus on careers as entrepreneur. For us, that means there must be logic and consistency in what we will offer them. Our vision is to ensure that entrepreneurs and employees in the private sector have access to an affordable mortgage. </p><h4>What will the diversification of funding look like in the coming years?</h4><p>We have a clear vision of what our ultimate goal is and what we want to reach; we have to bring liquidity to the market and contribute to shining the spotlight on the Kingdom's mortgage market for investors internationally. SRC is a bridge between the need for liquidity in the Kingdom for mortgages and the capital market. If liquidity does not come to the market, there will be a chain reaction, and we will end up with less or no mortgages or mortgages that are detrimental to borrowers. The goal eventually is to provide the right product to borrowers with the right incentive whilst matching the expectations of investors. This requires a third chapter: raising the bar, increasing transparency, and addressing the questions of investors. We will tap into the international market beyond the GCC countries. We will look into different currencies, shapes, and forms and develop different products profile. Today, we will focus on corporate bonds destined for the domestic market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[building-blocks-of-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your mandate, and what are your main strategies to achieve it?</h4><p>SCA was established in 2016 following a royal decree as a non-governmental authority working under the supervision of the Ministry of Commerce and Investment. The initial decree identified 20 objectives, though the overall objective is to improve the contracting sector capabilities and uplift its workforce skillsets. We decided to come up with a clear strategy and direction, and we identified all the key stakeholders, including constructors and contractors as well as the customer, which includes the government and entities owned by the government, as well as the private sector and citizens. We also looked into the government and the entities working in the ecosystem, such as municipalities, utility providers, and the Ministry of Finance. Our fourth category is the private sector as a suppliers of material and services needed by the contractors. We also looked into the legal system and met with other organizations, such as the Saudi Council of Engineers. We looked at their goals and coordinated with similar entities around the world, such as in Singapore and Australia. All these components have bolstered our strategy and vision, which is to build the future with confidence, something futuristic and inspiring. We went on to build our strategy and what we wanted this to be. We specified the key values that drive our day-to-day activities. One part of it was partnerships; we should partner with anyone who wants to cooperate. My role as a governor is to materialize this challenging strategy, and I am very much focused on two key factors to make this happen: making our strategy crystal-clear to everyone who has a stake in the sector and to attract the best talent in the market.</p><h4>What does the SCA membership involve?</h4><p>This is a starting point for our journey. If a contractor wants to do business, it should obtain its license from us. If one's contracting business category does not require any qualifications, we can provide the license based on the registration. If one's business category is associated with some high risks, such as something with high voltage electrical activities or high rises, then they have to be qualified in order to be granted the license. They require a safety engineer, certain departments, procedures, and prerequisites. In the event of serious violations, we may revoke a license. Once someone is licensed, they are available in our database. We make it easy for people to find contractors in specific regions. We will soon introduce features like ratings and digital contracts.</p><h4>How do you intend to manage the coming increase in business volume within the sector?</h4><p>We have 150,000 organizations that are fully capable here; capability is not the issue. We want to build in a more collaborative way. The majority of companies here are small, so we want to encourage these to merge or build alliances. We also want to attract international contractors, which we hope to achieve through several initiatives. One is a forthcoming forum that we will host for 25 entities to showcase their projects for the next three years. There will be more than 500 projects shared at the forum, and their estimated value exceeds SAR450 billion. There is a huge wave of projects coming, and this number does not even represent all of them. We are trying to help the sector, and both local and international contractors understand what is in the pipeline in the country.</p><h4>How are you working to promote a greener approach to construction?</h4><p>Green construction is something we are working on. It will be introduced in a way that will not cause impact. Until then, we are working on enhancing awareness within the sector through our communication channels and various events. For example, we hosted a workshop with many of the important players in the sector where we looked into technology for multiple purposes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your reading on the current transformation being undertaken by the government?</h4><p>In the past year and a half, Saudi Arabia has started to move steadily toward the achievement of the goals set out in Vision 2030, and the business environment is witnessing concrete changes at the public-sector level. This shows a new level of maturity, especially from the public sector point of view, as the government is proceeding at a steady pace and often acts as the pioneer in the digital revolution we are currently witnessing. Some institutions, such as the Ministry of Housing, have undergone a proper transformation thanks to digitalization. The use of technology has definitely contributed to achieving many targets laid out in Vision 2030. In addition, the Ministry of Labor has been greatly impacted by the advent of digitalization, and for the better. One substantial shift has been the way government officials and ministries are held accountable for achieving specific targets, with clear KPIs in a specific timeframe. One of the biggest issues the government has had to deal with was the constant reshuffling of ministers, which has led to a change in strategy, approach, and goals. This prevented the implementation of a long-term strategy in government ministries. Today, if a new minister is appointed, he can make changes, but the goals remain the same as those of his predecessor because a clear system of rules and boundaries has been set up. </p><h4>What aspects of IT will play a more relevant role in tomorrow's Saudi Arabia and why?</h4><p>A significant part of the transformation program as articulated in Vision 2030 is the role of technology in reshaping and advancing Saudi society, its people, and its institutions, both public and private. The Quality of Life Program, for example, is in perfect alignment with using technology to improve the quality of life of Saudi citizens. Great strides have already been made in just a few years of the transformation program, as evidenced by the level of technology absorption and integration in the day-to-day lives of people and organizations. This trend is only going to continue into the future as technology and its uses become widespread. At Innosoft, we pride ourselves on being an integral component of this social transformation, robustly deploying a range of solutions to help organizations, both public and private, to achieve more through technology in realizing their objectives and enhancing and enriching both the user and beneficiary experience. We achieve these objectives by offering our many clients in the public and private sectors a dynamic portfolio of innovative solutions. InnoSoft has been a key partner of various public-sector institutions in realizing the key strategic goals of streamlining public service provisions to ensure efficient and effective service delivery and savings. We continue to work closely with our clients to realize the goals and aspirations of Vision 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company developed over its five years of operations?</h4><p>We have developed a restaurant and retail management system, focusing mainly on the F&amp;B and hospitality sectors. We provide a cloud-based management system platform and a restaurant management system that support cashiers, POS, and wait staff with digital applications like the Kitchen Display System and other great apps and add-ons. It offers cost management, dispatch and delivery management systems, inventory and stocktaking, as well as purchasing management. Foodics was founded in 2014 in Khobar but today has offices in Riyadh, Jeddah, Dubai, and Egypt. Starting with small coffee shops, we now have a range of clients as well as bigger enterprise accounts. At present, we have more than 25,000 terminals and customers in 17 countries and more than 120 employees in five countries. We have five supporting languages: English, Arabic, Turkish, Spanish, and Italian. We have a B2B marketplace where customers can add other third-party software to Foodics to help them scale at any stage. This includes accounting, loyalty, marketing, smart payments, an online ordering platform, and business intelligence. We see value in local and flexible integrations with any application systems or cloud applications, and it's easy for clients to add anything they need with our open API. </p><h4>How are you revolutionizing the market with your restaurant management system?</h4><p>In the past, opening a restaurant meant hiring an engineer to decrypt the complex back-end system to change pricing or add items. There was a lot of manual work, and your data wasn't always safe. The heavy initial investment is one of the biggest challenges that F&amp;B owners face, which is where technology and business sense can mitigate such problems.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is SURE International Technology positioning itself within the digital transformation of the Kingdom?</h4><p>Since 2004, SURE has been acting as a system integrator, having developed more than 2,400 e-services for various government agencies, from ministries to universities and hospitals, as part of the country's digital transformation. More recently, we have entered the financial sector and are facilitating the growth and contribution of SMEs in line with government directives through new products and business units. With Vision 2030 and NTP 2.0, the government is investing a lot of capital in building a solid infrastructure. One of the main focuses in this sense has been cloud computing, and we seek to take advantage of this trend to act as a migrator for both governments and companies. At the same time, we are making considerable efforts to develop new partnerships with local and international players to introduce security products to the market. There is an urgent need to protect access to data and reduce the adverse effects because external actors constantly threaten Saudi cyber infrastructure. As far as 2019 is concerned, we expect to expand internationally, grow our business, serve a new customer base, and continue building many partnerships with vendors, suppliers, and clients.</p><h4>Within these three business units, how do you expect demand to evolve in the short to medium term, and what trends will drive this evolution?</h4><p>In the fintech arena, there is definitely a push from a regulatory perspective, with lot of focus coming from SAMA, CMA, the Saudi Fintech Initiative, and from companies interested in entering that market. The authorities are pushing banks to move toward a cashless society and embrace electronic payments, e-wallets, and digital wallets, and all these initiatives will intensify the market. At the same time, there are many efforts that seek to reduce the entrance barrier for start-ups and SMEs to ensure Saudi Arabia's standards are on par with other global markets. At SURE, there is a strong willingness to enter this market, since even the enterprise companies need to upgrade their systems to cope with new technology trends.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[what-dreams-may-come]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since launching Lebara in the Kingdom in late 2014, you have primarily targeted migrant communities with pay-as-you-go SIM cards. Can you tell us more about your positioning in the market?</h4><p>Our business model, launched in 2014, was intended to target expats and was a strategy driven by our partner Lebara. This proposition allows us to approach our target market in a better way. Any mobile service provider will focus on a segment that can give it the most revenue per user. The expat population gives us volume instead of high revenue per customer. When we started with a focused market, we had an advantage. We did not have large assets in the beginning, and this strong focus was a key reason behind our early success. Now, we have just finished our first five years of operations. This knowledge of the market has given us an ability to focus on not just expats but middle- and low-income groups of foreign nationals, both male and female. They need to manage their daily and monthly communications requirements, whether voice or data. When you give the customer control, they really enjoy it. This is exactly what we are offering to these groups of consumers.</p><h4>Middle Eastern mobile markets have relatively high entry barriers for Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO). You have, however, succeeded in capturing a significant market share. How did you succeed? </h4><p>This has not been an easy path. In the Middle East, it is difficult to launch companies such as ours. When we started our operations, the host network saw us as competition, not a partner. It was difficult to convince them, which we had to do through the growth in our business. However, we are not taking market share from them. In fact, we are helping them increase their own market share and revenue. This took a long time, and we have only managed to develop an understanding with our host providers in the last year or so. Saudi Arabia was the first in the Middle East to offer an MVNO license. Now, after five years of operations, we are seeing other GCC countries offer these licenses. They have seen the success of this model in Saudi Arabia and are interested in recreating it. </p><h4>In August 2016, you launched the first Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (MVNE) in collaboration with Huawei. How has this service advanced since then?</h4><p>This service is a real differentiator for us. There are two types of MVNO: light or full. Light MVNO is focused on sales and marketing. By having this other platform, we are able to have more control. We can manage and define the product to a much greater degree. We managed to get the system up and running in the middle of 2016. Since the implementation of this enabler, our key performance indicators have rapidly changed. When we developed this platform, we made sure we were able to do multiple MVNO services so we could connect with multiple MNOs. We are extremely dynamic now whenever there is a market opportunity and really able to shape our own future. </p><h4>What is your vision for the IT transformation of the Kingdom, and what role can Lebara play? </h4><p>Digital transformation is crucial for us and for telecoms and mobile services. We have seen many ambitious plans from the government for smart cities, traffic control, agriculture control, and security control, all of which require IoT. We plan on operating in the IoT space, but in a specific direction.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our ambitions are all driven by the goals of Vision 2030. We are working through success and survival. We can see the impact on every service provider in Saudi Arabia when it comes to technology development. Every space is being positively impacted because these new technologies reduce overhead costs. In 2019, the government approved the e-commerce law. Many businesses are either adapting to the new law or establishing new operations. Saudi Arabia's retail environment will go through dramatic changes in the next year. The introduction of 5G started in 2019, but we will really see its impact in 2020. We will also see new uses that will enable sectors we never before considered to automate some of their daily operations, which will also help different sectors—in particular, health. Elder care will change, and so will chronic disease care, and there will be many new business uses. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Maeen come to be founded, and what role does it play within the digital transformation of the Kingdom?</h4><p>In 1985, after the formation of GulfNet, we connected King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) to the Bitnet, the US research network at the time. In 1997, we first connected KACST to the internet, and then later the entire Kingdom. KACST was initially focused on the academic and research sectors, and the entire commercial segment was eventually outsourced to telecoms companies in 2006. Given the increase in traffic, we later connected the research segment to Internet2, which led to the formation of Maeen. Today, 27 universities, 20 government institutes, seven research centers, and three hospitals are connected to Maeen. This unprecedented growth gave us the scope to enable the digital transformation across the Kingdom's education, research, health, and industry sectors as part of Vision 2030.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the short-term future, and how does Maeen position itself with regards to major industry developments?</h4><p>We hope there will be a new global technology other than the internet; there are tests currently being done between GÉANT and Internet2 for a 400-GB infrastructure. There are many applications coming through the internet, and researchers do not like the noise that social and commercial applications are generating on the internet, which on the other hand are directly affecting the volume of traffic and latency required for research applications. As such, the first role of Maeen is to create a special channel for collaboration and integration that connects all research institutes, academic, and industry. Second, Maeen seeks to establish a portal that will integrate high-performance computing (HPC) together in the Kingdom, acting as an enabler of services. Third, it seeks to exploit its nature as a consortium to reduce the price of Maeen's member connectivity even further than what the research and academic sectors are getting. For this reason, telecoms companies see Maeen as a competitor, which of course is not the case. Therefore, it will take effort to demonstrate that Maeen is a national initiative with whom telecoms companies are partners in success. At the moment, we are looking to work with all telecom companies and big international vendors, including Cisco and other big names. </p><h4>What is your strategy to work with industry?</h4><p>Maeen currently seeks to address issues both on the applied research side and the fundamentals one. Regarding the latter, many research projects are not being developed because there is no integration between the research and academic sectors, on the one hand, and industry, on the other. This is why we are looking into developing the proper methodology to connect these research projects with corresponding industrial firms to turn them into products. On the other hand, industries will be able to find the suitable research or researcher to help implement their future initiatives without the need to invest in building their own R&amp;D departments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SBM was recently awarded the IBM Beacon Award for having the world's best software defined storage (SDS) solutions. Could you tell us about this? </h4><p>In 2019, SBM earned the coveted IBM Beacon Award for being the foremost solutions provider for SDS at the recent IBM Think conference in San Francisco. The award recognizes SBM's exceptional work in driving commercial business value by delivering world-class solutions via SDS. SBM succeeded in displacing one of the most competitive products used by our client by positioning IBM SDS alongside IBM ALL Flash and SVC. This helped our client better manage and provision its storage and prepare itself for digital transformation. This solution will also help our client accelerate the implementation of AI and analytics that will support its business and reduce the time to market. With this great success story, IBM is now in a strong position in the Saudi market as one of the foremost SDS solutions providers. This win is a testament of our commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your activities in the fintech space?</h4><p>We have implemented numerous important projects for the financial industry in the Kingdom, including banks, financial institutions, and SAMA. The idea is to ensure that transactions are done in a transparent way and making sure we are able to stop potentially fraudulent or improper activity as quickly as possible. We seek to help institutions integrate their systems so they can immediately understand and curb any unauthorized or improper activity in a more consistent and accurate way.</p><h4>Under the digital transformation drive of Vision 2030, there many opportunities for global and local IT companies. How are you positioning SBM to take advantage of these?</h4><p>In 2019, innovation is a major focus area for SBM; we are working hard to build solutions using emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, robotic process automation, and IoT. With our Design Thinking Workshops, we help organizations identify potential use cases and create disruptive business models. Essentially, we seek to work with technologies that make digitalization as simple as possible. This is needed to meet the ambitions of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, whose milestones will play a central role in diversifying the Saudi economy or developing public service sectors such as health, education, and tourism. Digitalization is the future, and SBM strives to be at the forefront of driving this change. </p><h4>What prospects do you see for cloud technology, hybrid clouds, and data centers in the Kingdom?</h4><p>Cloud technology is of vital importance for businesses and business solutions. In fact, it helps SMEs achieve their growth goals at a much quicker pace. By building and enhancing the private cloud solutions of our customers and clients, SBM helps organizations transform their existing applications into this new micro-services architecture. This helps our enterprise-level clients address their business challenges and implement agile solutions. Companies like IBM have started to make strides in this area even though they are not the originators of these technologies. Oracle and Microsoft are still competitors, though there are other newcomers that we also have to deal with. SBM is both following the lead of IBM while also taking its own initiatives in these areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will ICT play in shaping the country in its path toward Vision 2030, and what gaps can still be filled en-route to the country's digital transformation? </h4><p>Saudi Arabia is among the leading countries in EMEA and is set to achieve a 4.2% increase in IT spending. In a recent study published by Technavio in November 2018, the Saudi IT market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR close to 9% from 2019 to 2023. While the country's main ambitions require progress on the technology side, this has been translated by its willingness to invest in building a robust IT sector and making the journey to digital business. In its efforts to realize Vision 2030, the National Digitization Unit is ensuring the transformation to a digital society in many ways, with digital platforms at its core. There is definitely less familiarity with more advanced types of technologies in Saudi Arabia, but at the same time there is a willingness to publicly support these developments. While the primary aim of Vision 2030 is to provide better quality government-delivered services, we expect to see an increased use of cloud computing, an increased development with AI, and an increased demand for e-governance.</p><h4>What are the main features of the Saudi market, and how do you expect the business landscape to evolve in the medium term?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is the biggest market in the region; its size and population are larger than all the other markets combined. It is becoming the ICT center of technology in the region due to further investments in AI and machine learning. The needs we are witnessing lately fit into the e-government services such as employment programs, e-learning services, passports, civil affairs, traffic updates and control, online issuance of commercial registers, and online payment services, among others. In addition, we expect that demand will grow mostly in solutions related to data integration, analytics, and visualization. Big data is also important, and the key lies in seeing how we can transform these technological trends into a real promise that can benefit all people. </p><h4>What major challenges do IT companies face when dealing with data management?</h4><p>While new technologies are transforming key aspects of business, legacy systems are holding others back, limiting innovation, opportunity, and engagement. The main challenge remains in understanding and exploiting the data that existed in those legacy systems, while keeping up with new data coming from new sources. Advanced data management tools are needed to collect, cleanse, convert, segment, code, and consolidate content data from disparate content sources for a centralized aggregated “Big Data" that is then ready for analysis. Whether legacy or new data, discovering what is beyond these repositories to uncover the real information is a challenge in itself that can be addressed in two approaches. The conventional one is to migrate data to a unified repository and integrate entities, while the newer trend is to keep the data where it is but search and analyze it from a centralized place. That being said, the real data management challenge in my opinion comes in two stages: knowing what data exists and understanding it. Complex data needs complex processing. Techniques adopted include computer vision, cognitive services, intelligent recognition, and entity extraction. Other tools such as video, image, and object analysis also allow us to extract the needed information from images and videos, convert the various documents in order to render them readable, segment them in order to separate the various entities, and extract the various entities and use them as the key attributes for later indexing, linking, search, and analytics.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can T2 be a part of the Kingdom's comprehensive IT transformation? </h4><p>T2 is positioned at the heart of the digitalization process of the Saudi economy as it seeks to improve interconnectivity and the security of the IT ecosystem. In 2014, we started as a company with one clear product, RiCH, to solve the intercommunication challenge that we saw in the market, especially when it comes to reaching end customers. With RiCH, enterprises can communicate with their clients using fax, email, SMS, and voice calls in an easier and more secure way. From its first deal in 2014 worth SAR200,000, today RiCH's revenue is SAR85 million; SMS traffic went from 50 million to 6 billion in four years. Our 40-42 clients are split between government entities, banking institutions, and very large corporations. In 2016, we launched Ole5 (Olly five), a system for digital correspondence (Morasalat) to track and manage huge amounts of internal and incoming and outgoing messages and letters between large government parties with the broader goal of promoting a paperless environment and e-services to reduce the cost of operations and increase efficiencies. Our first client was one of the largest ministries, which was looking for a solution that entailed the maximum level of security. As such, we offered an almost unbreakable technological solution which was later certified by international security experts to guarantee the highest standards of security. Today, Ole5 is facilitating hundreds of thousands of e-correspondence originated from more than 100 countries, as well as Saudi Customs and the General Authority for Sports—the type of player we continue to target. Our third product is Akeed, an access control management system that works with the various security devices to manage and track entry and exit actions. Demand for traceability will rise, which we seek to exploit. Finally, we recently launched our fourth product, ReeDoo, an Arab OCR that seeks to achieve a paperless environment by scanning documents into a digital format. </p><h4>What is the best way to increase the security of the IT ecosystem in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>A proper and advanced information security ecosystem requires two factors: awareness from the client and tailored solutions according to the size and nature of the client. Both the government and private sector need to understand that we face a growing threat from the increased presence of technology in our lives. So far, we still rely on a model that pushes us to understand how important information security is only after something happens to us. This approach means that larger efforts are placed on mitigating the consequences of the damage, rather than preventing it. It should work in the opposite way. The internet and growing interconnectivity of our world are increasing the exposure of confidential and private data, and it is important to act accordingly. At the same time, delivering tailored solutions will allow the sector to grow organically. Saudi Arabia has a lot of opportunities for several IT companies, but the challenge will be to find the right segments that suit them. Positioning is key to gaining expertise and bringing value to the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the past year, what key changes have you seen in the IT sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The ICT sector in Saudi Arabia has gone through a major transformation recently. ICT is an integral part of our economy, and isolating ICT as a separate sector is not necessarily accurate today. The distinction between the ICT sector and other businesses is now becoming blurred. This is not only the case in Saudi Arabia, but a global trend. We work in many sectors. We initially started with the Ministry of Labor and Social Development but are now working with other sectors such as education and health. Tamkeen's role is to provide IT services and solutions that help government agencies solve problems in either a self-sustainable mode or at a reduced cost. Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 has an aggressive plan to reform, and technology is an integral part of this plan.</p><h4>What key areas will you focus on in the medium term? </h4><p>Our focus in 2019 will be to continue to develop the leads we generated through our PPP initiatives, and hopefully we will witness an increased adoption rate. One way to reduce the government's IT costs is to migrate hosting its IT systems such that they are hosted in country and managed by local IT service providers such as Tamkeen or to at least adopt managed IT services as an alternative to running their own data centers or hiring outsourced IT employees. The adoption and utilization of open-source technologies as an alternative to the traditional commercial software packages is another area that we will focus on in 2019. Tamkeen has developed several products to address new government issues, especially in traditional systems such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), project management, and strategy management. We have an excellent track record in deploying and customizing open-source solutions, especially for ERP systems in the private and semi-government sectors. We will focus more on that and soon provide full ERP solutions for the government sector. Currently, our ERP solution is targeted at small to medium government agencies, as a viable option to commercial products that have significantly higher capital and operational costs, especially if there is a need to integrate with either custom-built systems or systems from other vendors. Current project management tools are not fully integrated with ERP tools, so we are working on a solution that integrates tightly with our ERP systems, for which we see great demand.</p><h4>Are you seeing a change as government agencies work to achieve their KPIs for 2020?</h4><p>Most government agencies are actively working to achieve their 2020 National Transformation goals, and most heads of government organizations want tools to monitor the execution of these projects. We have developed a simple solution targeted at executives and ministers and have proposed it to some government agencies. It has been received extremely well, and in 2019, we will actively promote it to other government sectors. Since we already have prebuilt products and components, it is extremely easy and quick for us to respond to varying requests by customizing our prebuilt components to address the demands of the various government sectors. Many are approaching the deadline and realizing they are late. Everyone has deliverables, and we give them a viable option. We have a proven success story and a great reputation in the market.</p><h4>In 2019, do you expect to derive revenue from PPP and open source?</h4><p>We expect PPP will still be a significant portion of our business with managed services also expected to grow significantly. However, Tamkeen is not only in it for the financial rewards; we are a government-owned company, and our main goal is to provide high-quality jobs in the IT sector for Saudi citizens, male or female, while helping the public sector achieve its 2020 National Transformation goals and ultimately help us all achieve Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you advanced on your projects in the fields of health, education, e-commerce, and smart cities?</h4><p>For us, 2018 was a year of building up Saudi Arabia's capacities and creating the platform that we will continue in 2019. In e-commerce, we were pleased to see the concept of digital payments launched in 2018. Lead by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), there are now four players: STC Pay, HalalaH, Apple Pay, and Bayan Pay. When it comes to digital health, the Ministry of Health launched telemedicine in a number of locations, which was well received during demonstrations. Telemedicine works well for patients in rural areas who need to connect with specialists in large cities. A proof-of-concept was launched in several cities, enabling people to attend a local hospital with teleconferencing technology. This technology allows for vital information to be transmitted in real time, allowing physicians to assess patient health and provide care without requiring patients to travel long distances. This saves time and money and allows patients to receive the necessary care in a convenient way. The next step is building unified medical records, which the National Health Information Center is working on now. In the field of education, the Ministry of Education had a strong build-up of virtual schools. In 2019, it launched a program to broadcast real-time educational materials from classrooms in main cities to virtual classes in rural regions, providing high-quality learning opportunities across the country. We expect to quadruple our 2018 numbers in virtual schools. For smart cities, one of our ongoing projects is the Smart District, a district in Riyadh fully equipped with the latest IoT advancements. Lastly, we inked a new agreement with the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program in January 2019. </p><h4>How are you positioning yourself to collaborate within the field, for example, with Yesser?</h4><p>We collaborate with Yesser mainly in the field of e-government, but our mandate is wider. We worked with Yesser and the National Information Center in 2018 to connect 40 government agencies and ended up connecting 69 government entities with a Single Sign-On (SSO) through the National e-Government Portal. Our aim to reach 100 connected entities by the end of 2019 is a major step to ease the login process for individuals to access government services across every sector. Yesser has large and ambitious projects, and we play the role of facilitator and coordinator. We hope to see many of these projects launched in 2019. We are pushing to utilize the Government Service Bus for government entities to make their data available for other government entities, which will link the entire government. We made progress in 2018 by unifying portals, and in 2019 that remains a major target. We want to unify areas such as visas, licensing, education, and employment. We have established the governance for this and hope to launch it in 2019. The new entities we developed are meant to ensure that governance can be effectively implemented. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you envision as your role within the sector?</h4><p>As our nation embarks on a journey to realize unprecedented levels of digitization with a digital government, smart city initiatives, and a more perfect harnessing of data, citizens are increasingly expecting digital experiences that are more citizen-centric. As such, we are working to develop this digital ecosystem, which is currently helping the government navigate the digital transformation. Our focus remains on unifying digitization efforts across the government and ensuring every entity strives to work towards one shared purpose for the betterment of our nation. We are also collaborating with representatives from all ministries to streamline their respective digital strategies. Our core aim through the creation of this digital ecosystem is to ensure that citizens are satisfied in terms of IT efficiency and the public functions-related digital services that improve their quality of life. The goal of this is to build a digital public sector worthy of the Kingdom's future.</p><h4>What new technologies will that entail?</h4><p>We plan to create a culture of innovation in our organization and across the entire public sector that will help resolve government problems, increase efficiency, and better serve the populace. To do this, we will shortly launch an innovation platform to help bring the best ideas beyond their conceptual phase. This will include working on robots and AI.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for the year ahead, apart from your immediate priorities?</h4><p>To create a digitally enabled public sector of the future, we must focus on five critical areas. The first includes an enhanced customer experience in which we make it easier for citizens to use government services. Today's citizens expect public services to be as personalized and responsive as the services they get from the private sector. So we need to reimagine how digital can be used to enhance the citizen's end-to-end experience. This requires the adoption of a 'citizen-first' culture and mindset in designing policies and delivering services. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of service, promote transparent and efficient interaction, enhance the level of public trust in government, and drive better citizen outcomes. Acknowledging the fact that the Kingdom is home to a young population with high social media usage, we will work with government entities to embrace our social media culture and leverage it for greater transparency and collaboration between government and citizens. Here, we will also continue our efforts to increase our ranking in the UN e-Government Survey to the top 30 by 2020. We will also focus on optimizing the return on public investment and find sustainable ways to finance public services and infrastructure. Digital technologies create opportunities to explore new models for providing services, improve management of resources through smarter spending, and link the money invested in programs and services to the outcomes they produce for citizens, boosting accountability and trust in the process. Our efforts will focus on the use of emerging technology to deliver better public value. Our third area of focus will revolve around open data. We have a refreshed second version of our Open Data Portal, which now hosts around 5,000 datasets from across different categories including health, social services, education, and more. Fourthly, a digital government could lead to greater vulnerability of cyber attacks. We will work with ministries and the National Cybersecurity Authority to enable and support the government in protecting critical citizen data and securely grow our digital government through preventative cybersecurity and privacy measures. We will ensure that entities prioritize the privacy and security of all our citizens and the sensitive data we exchange to build a safe digital Kingdom. Finally, Yesser will continue its efforts through the national office established to govern IT deployment and support government entities in building standards, measurements, practices, and architecture to deploy IT effectively and efficiently within their respective EA functions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does TAQNIA ETS fit within the TAQNIA group of companies, and what is your primary expertise?</h4><p>The Saudi Technology Development and Investment Company (TAQNIA) was established in 2011 with a clear mission to transfer advanced technologies to Saudi Arabia, commercialize the outputs and resources of national R&amp;D centers, contribute to the diversification of the national economy, and build the capabilities of local talent in emerging technologies. Over the years, and through analyzing the local market and demand in the context of its mission, TAQNIA has incorporated several subsidiaries, each to operate in a unique domain, and TAQNIA ETS is one such subsidiary. Working predominantly in the field of geospatial information, TAQNIA ETS is one of a few Saudi companies that provides an extensive portfolio of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing services that cover but are not limited to data extraction, data analysis and interpretation, capacity building, shared services, and other geospatial-related services. Geospatial technologies can provide an abundance of data and are an unparalleled tool in supporting strategic planning and decision-making processes in fields ranging from urban planning, environmental activities, infrastructure projects, agricultural development and natural resources management, to road safety and emergency response forces. The number of companies working in Saudi is insufficient to meet the local demand for geospatial services. Also, because we work in partnerships with R&amp;D institutions both locally and internationally, we have unprecedented access to cutting-edge technical capabilities and resources. Also, while we are expected to generate profit, we are not necessarily driven by it, as we are a government-owned company. Our role is to not only deliver projects at the highest standards, but to also advise our clients, the majority of them government organizations, on the optimal services and solutions. All of the above means we can provide vast geospatial services that are not only effective, but also cost-saving.</p><h4>Vision 2030 strives for the Kingdom to become a knowledge-based economy and build up local capacities through technology transfer. How do you envision TAQNIA ETS to play a leading role?</h4><p>When TAQNIA ETS began to provide geospatial services, there was still a significant percentage of organizations in Saudi, both public and private, that did not have a dedicated GIS department, even though they could benefit greatly from it. However, in recent years we have witnessed in influx in attention to the value that geospatial technologies can provide. Virtually every other industry is posed to benefit from geospatial technologies, and as the science is continuously evolving at accelerated rates so does the potential for enhanced data extraction and analysis. As a result, the probability of informed decision-making and effective strategic planning becomes evidently clear to stakeholders; they possess much better insight in what is happening on the ground. The true value of geospatial technologies is the accuracy, efficiency and effectiveness of the information it delivers, and such information is an invaluable commodity in a knowledge-based economy.</p><h4>As you are building up local capacity and centralizing GIS expertise, what are your next ambitions; do you envision regional expansion?</h4><p>In the last few years, we have worked with the majority of government bodies in Saudi Arabia and several private corporations, on projects of national and local strategic significance. Currently, we manage a portfolio of projects worth over SAR1.2 billion for over 40 clients operating in urban and rural areas nationwide. However, for the near future we look forward to expanding our operations to the MENA region as we have already begun negotiations with several clients in the Gulf who have taken keen interest in our collective capabilities and accumulated expertise within the field of GIS and remote sensing. We are also committed to continue fulfilling TAQNIA's mission of localizing innovative technologies in Saudi by increasing our efforts in developing innovative tools, applications and methodologies in the field of GIS and remote sensing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Dawiyat Integrated play in the Saudi ICT sector?</h4><p>Dawiyat Integrated Telecommunication Company holds the only license in Saudi Arabia as an independent wholesale service provider. We provide telecoms infrastructure and access to every licensed telecommunication company as a wholesale and neutral network. This model allows us to build the telecoms infrastructure first and sell it several times, giving telecommunications companies the benefit of cutting off capital investments and focusing on services and VAS, which is an efficient way to deploy capital, especially in extensive projects like the roll-out of 5G. We are fully owned by the Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) and monetize the government's substantial investment by providing electricity to more than 13,000 villages and cities across Saudi Arabia. Within this scope, SEC is building an extremely large, 75,000-km fiber-optic network. Overall, Dawiyat Integrated will enable not only significant growth into the telecommunications sector, but also significant growth and the enablement of huge creative projects like smart networks for electricity, smart water meters, and smart city initiatives. In 2019, we look forward to connecting close to 300,000 additional homes by fiber, while maintaining a focus on strategic partnerships and substantial investments that will place Dawiyat Integrated on the regional map.</p><h4>What will be the main implications of the roll-out of 5G?</h4><p>5G is an extremely important technology that will significantly change in every economic sector. SEC has built and connected towers, and with our wholesale license, we will be able to offer bundled services to licensed providers. The market will enter into even higher competition, though hopefully our activity will encourage companies to spend on the customer experience and creative services, while at the same time reducing the cost for end-users. When 5G comes, more towers will be needed, as well as more fiber, data centers, and connectivity, so that we can leverage company assets and invest in building up the infrastructure that will be shared by others.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the Kingdom's digital transformation?</h4><p>We are building state-of-the-art infrastructure all over the kingdom. In each city this will be opened up to all the service providers on an equal basis so that they can compete based on offerings without infrastructural over development. These are aligned with the Kingdom's digital transformation, which will propel the Saudi economy and increase its competitiveness in substantial ways across different sectors. In the medium term, and in alignment with our strategic telecom partners, we seek to bring substantial international OTT players to establish their hub and services here to help co-invest in major network connectivity. Long term, the future is extremely bright, especially in terms of human capacity. Human development will also rapidly increase because of the demographic structure of the Kingdom. Around 60% of the population is under the age of 30; these are all creative young men and women who will come up with businesses and business models that we never dreamed possible.</p><h4>What role can the Saudi private sector play in this digital transformation?</h4><p>SMEs will have access to fiber and high-speed internet, which will enable them to buy creative services from cloud-service providers, erasing the need for expensive computing equipment. This is a major enabler for SMEs, as they can get all the business support for a fraction of the price. They can manage their accounts, recruit people, and have access to the latest and greatest technologies, enabling them to link with whoever they want worldwide. This will change competitiveness and the competitive forces: companies with limited budgets will have access to the latest and greatest resources in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

SABIC is the second-largest global petrochemical company that makes the innovative material that goes into smartphones. Saudi Arabia is transforming at the speed of light, leveraging its factor-based economy and leadership as the 18th-largest economy to leapfrog into the future powered by digital and our global and regional partners. This started with the announcement of Vision 2030, the most audacious, once-in-a-lifetime journey of transforming a nation that is the heart of the Arab and the Muslim world and an investment powerhouse.</p><p>Already USD100 billion has been committed to the Vision Fund, making it the largest tech fund in the world. Our ambition to create a thriving and dynamic economy is underpinned by a national digital agenda that will empower women and fulfill lives. Only by empowering and engaging people in healthcare, education, and smart cities can our nation, region, and planet remain prosperous. Secondly, it is about how a digital economy can supercharge the existing one and leapfrog it into the future. 10% of global trade is now digital, and Saudi is one of the fastest-growing opportunities for digital commerce and trade. Last but not least is a digital government—and how we move from red tape to red carpet.</p><p>We are moving at light speed, and here are some examples. The first is close to my, and everyone's, heart: healthcare. In 2018, we leveraged a new business model with a mobile app called My Health—Sehha. In 2018 alone, this app delivered 1.4 million virtual consultations, reduced waiting times for doctors from months to days, and, the cherry on top, reduced human-related errors by up to 90%. In 2019, we have started in partnership with you—global innovators, telecom operators, and national digital champions in collaboration with local entrepreneurs—to leverage connectivity, big data, and AI, and have found some surprising things. 50% of all doctor visits can be delivered virtually, out of which 50% can be delivered by a physician and 50% by machine or AI. Delivering healthcare by machine, data, and AI, we managed to reduce the cost of healthcare from USD100 to USD15-30, and in some cases to USD1 for medical consultations delivered by machines.</p><p>We are also one of the top-10 fastest-growing nations in e-commerce, growing at 35% and recently crossing the USD7.5 billion-threshold. We are projected to cross the USD10 billion-mark by 2020. When it comes to moving from red tape to red carpet, in the Kingdom today, one can hand over power of attorney digitally in less than 10 minutes via smartphone, obtain a trade license in a day, or get their passport within 24 hours.</p><p>All these are underpinned by a National Digital Agenda whose foundation we are doubling down on—a foundation powered by you: the local, regional, and global players that are changing the world. In a USD24-billion market, where everywhere else is stagnant or declining by single digits, the Kingdom is growing by double digits and fast tracking into an ICT market that is the largest by a mile in MENA, at USD12 billion.</p><p>Extracted from speech delivered at MWC Barcelona in February 2019.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you walk us through the milestones since Infinity Aviation Academy's establishment in 2010?</h4><p>When Alpha Star was established, it had government contracts to support the public sector, and all its customers came through the government. By 2015, when we started expanding, the decision was made to maintain Alpha Star to support the government. When we won a government helicopter maintenance contract with the Saudi Ministry of Interior (MoI), we questioned why we did not pursue a contract for the entire support role, which included training. It had been sending its pilots to the US for training, with all the difficulties that go along with that, such as visas, logistics, and availability. We put forward a proposal to accommodate the flight simulator here and provide all the required training. Currently, we have an ongoing agreement with MoI for training. For services we do not offer here, we arrange it elsewhere. We have a great relationship with other training centers around the world and sometimes send people overseas for training and claim the cost from the government later. All training programs are delivered in-house, and all our materials and instructors are certified by General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA). For new customers, we go through a process to determine their training requirements and customize our standard curriculum.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your accreditation to conduct training courses?</h4><p>No aviation company can work without a training department, because that department makes sure everyone meets the requirements of the various authorities, such as GACA. When the authorities issue the certificate for the business, they give the company the requirements for their pilots, mechanics, cabin crew, and other staff. To maintain their certificates and perform their duties, the company and its staff have to meet these requirements. The training department is in charge of ensuring that this happens. This means creating a training schedule and systems to evaluate and monitor, in addition to conducting the training required by GACA in-house. When we expanded and established Infinity Aviation Academy, we created another core business teaching non-employees. Now, we have agreements with certain governments to teach their pilots. They send their pilots to Infinity Aviation Academy for initial, ongoing, or advanced courses, and we do this for both the commercial aviation industry and the military. We have been certified as the first training center for rotary wing aircrafts, which requires going through many processes with GACA with full success.</p><h4>Which direction is Infinity Aviation Academy heading toward in line with the latest trends in demand for aviation training?</h4><p>The first step we do is a study of the potential business in the market we work in. In an aviation study, we calculate the figures and come up with the advantages or disadvantages of a business line. Infinity Aviation Academy is owned by PIF, and we are looking for growth on a smooth trajectory. Once we build up our name and introduce our services such that everyone knows the quality we offer, our market share will increase. In addition, we do a great deal of consultation work for MoI about how to build its training for technicians, pilots, and crew. It trusts us, and we take this workload off its shoulders. Today, we receive numerous requests from companies around the world that want to work with us. Setting up a training facility takes a great deal of time, including at least 18 months for the factory to deliver the simulator units, another month for installation and testing, and a year to get certified if there are no issues. At the end of 2019, we should host three simulators. We base our workload on the number of airplanes and pilots in the Kingdom because these figures control the feasibility of the business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do you expect air freight and cargo to play within the broader National Industrial Development and Logistic Plan? </h4><p>The Kingdom is strategically well positioned to serve every key market connecting to and from the Middle East. Saudi Arabia currently has 28 airports, of which six are international. Of those, three are among the busiest in the GCC, connecting the country to 81 international airports within 45 countries across the globe. The government is rapidly modernizing its airports and expanding its air cargo facilities with the goal of increasing the total air cargo capacity in the Kingdom from 1 million tons a year to 6 million by 2030. Within this framework, Saudia Cargo invested SAR1.2 billion in 2018 to rejuvenate its cargo stations in Jeddah and Riyadh, aiming to double the current cargo capacity, enhancing our logistical capabilities in support of Vision 2030, which aims to establish Saudi Arabia as a global logistics hub. We also expect the air freight industry to play a crucial role by increasing employment and enhancing our national logistical capabilities. Saudia Cargo recently celebrated the graduation and employment of the first batch of cargo future cadres program, which aims to empower Saudi youth in logistics and supply chain.</p><h4>What is your assessment on the provision of PPP and concession contract opportunities for the development and operation of air freight facilities?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is unique in terms of engaging the private sector, having stakes in major projects across the country regardless of its financial capabilities to undertake those commitments on its own. The PPP and concession contract opportunities are extremely positive because they provide checks, balances, and accountability on the part of stakeholders, thus ensuring the projects' completion and sustainability. GACA has announced that all 28 airports around the Kingdom should be privatized by 2020 in order to enhance revenues, improve the customer experience, encourage best-in-class international operators, and increase private-sector investments. Partnerships and opportunities in the construction of new airports and aviation infrastructure, including air freight facilities, are immense. We are supportive of the model and positive drive and remain open to this philosophy. As such, we will further explore opportunities and partnerships in the future. Saudia Cargo has signed a joint agreement with King Abdullah Port at King Abdullah Economic City to enhance collaboration opportunities and establish a secure logistical operations zone. This agreement establishes an air-sea-air cargo corridor with the surrounding airports to ensure a smooth flow of cargo to the port and re-export by air.</p><h4>What are some of the key international players and markets that Saudia Cargo is looking to foster partnerships with?</h4><p>Bridging the gap between the east and west and beyond has always been the goal for Saudia Cargo. We continue to further strengthen our key markets in Africa, South Asia, Europe, and Latin and North America through new interline partnerships and alliances with major international players to bridge the world with a dedicated freighter fleet. In April, Saudia Cargo officially became the 12th member of SkyTeam Cargo, which counts as its long-time members Aeroflot Cargo, Aerolineas Argentinas Cargo, Aeromexico Cargo, Air France Cargo, Alitalia Cargo, China Airlines Cargo, China Cargo Airlines, Czech Airlines Cargo, Delta Cargo, KLM Cargo, and Korean Air Cargo. Our membership will give our customers access to a global network covering over 900 destinations in more than 175 countries. In return for that unparalleled access to a growing worldwide network, our company will extend SkyTeam Cargo's reach across the Middle East, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent via our hubs in Jeddah and Riyadh, which was nonexistent prior to our joining SkyTeam. Such partnerships are crucial in an industry where global connectivity is paramount. Our strength lies in covering a wide route network, and we believe in trade liberalization. We are ready to expand our wings domestically, regionally, and internationally wherever there are opportunities and the need for our air cargo services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk us through the history of PSAA since its founding 60 years ago?</h4><p>When it opened, PSAA was the only place in the Middle East to offer commercial aviation training. Today, we have moved away from being a training center only for Saudi Arabian Airlines to a strategic business unit. The government's goal is to have us at the highest level of training possible, with a focus on safety and quality. Looking back, we have achieved great progress, keeping up with the latest advances in technology with state-of-the-art full flight simulators that create situations as close to reality as possible. As part of our considerable investments in technology, we have developed our distance-learning program to support our customers by lowering their training costs. Indeed, we have pilots and flight attendants who need to take time off work and travel here to Jeddah in order to undergo training. To accommodate their needs, we have been approved to do distance learning.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the current transition in the Saudi aviation sector, as the reforms of Vision 2030 reach implementation phase?</h4><p>In order to sustain future development, we need to have an aviation industry in sync with projected economic growth and diversification. Saudi Arabian Airlines has a long-term plan to cope with that, which includes expansion. In fact, one of the major items that will be a turning point for the industry will be the opening of the new King Abdulaziz International Airport, which is the base for Saudia Arabian Airlines. Moreover, with the opening of e-visas and by turning our location into a transit hub, Saudi Arabia will grow. The sector will see growth in the next 10 to 15 years. Though it may not happen in the next year or two, there will be a spurt of growth, which will level out later. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have SANS' operations evolved to adjust to the increased demand for traveling and traffic management services?</h4><p>2019 was a successful year in which we established solid foundations that helped us fulfill our transformation strategy journey and plan. In addition, we defined five strategic pillars to support our strategy: safe operations, efficiency, human capital, people-focused financial effectiveness, and strategic partnerships. We obtained the first-ever Air Navigation Service Certificate in Saudi Arabia from GACA and moved ahead with our safety maturity level to meet international standards. By 2020, we will have achieved huge enhancements in our operations through our new ATM system and surveillance and communication systems. At an employee level, we have invested considerably to ensure our air traffic controllers, technicians, engineers, and leaders received multiple certifications to guarantee the quality of our staff remains at the highest levels. From a financial aspect, we focused on cost effectiveness as well as starting to diversify our revenue income beyond the traditional navigation fees. We contracted our first project, NEOM airport, which includes installing and commissioning navigation systems. We look forward to expanding our operations in system installation, project management, maintenance, technology, and navigation design services in order to diversify our revenues. Finally, we were recognized as the first ANSP in the region to establish a CRM system to improve customer relations, allowing all our customers to easily share their comments and concerns. 2020 will see us continue our journey with a focus on optimization and how we can take our services to the next level through safe operations, more efficiency, and adding value to our customers.</p><h4>What is the current status of the aviation industry in Saudi Arabia, and what does the future hold?</h4><p>We look forward to transforming Saudi Arabia into a true hub for the region and ensuring efficient cooperation and communication among all the stakeholders involved in the aviation industry. The new terminal at King Abdulaziz International Airport will play out as a new operation ground for all aviation players to come together to accommodate growing traffic at the safest and most efficient operational level. As well, a healthy balance between skilled people, capital, and advanced technology will complete the circle. While air traffic control will still be needed, navigation technology will force a new set of skills to be adopted by our controllers, for example, virtual and digital capabilities and skills. Infrastructural technology changes will require talents and skill changes, which is why our training department is working closely with our engineering department to predict the direction and scope of technology in the next five to 10 years and adjust the hiring and training process accordingly.</p><h4>What emerging technologies are shaping the field of air navigation systems, and how should Saudi Arabia position itself with regard to localizing technology?</h4><p>Digital/virtual towers and drone systems are shaping the conversation in the aviation industry, though implementing these new technologies with the appropriate safety and standardized practices presents both an operational and regulatory challenge. However, this challenge can be also seen as an area for growth, and finding the right balance to ensure this growth remains sustainable in the long-term is crucial. Large government entities like SAMI are working on localizing technologies to deliver long-term sustainable growth of the aviation industry and the overall economy, though some advanced technologies may prove too costly to be developed locally. In this sense, partnerships, especially small ones, are critical for future technologies to be implemented in operations. There is great appetite for foreign players to invest in the country, and Saudi Arabia can handle a great deal of that externally induced growth to then transfer it internally over the years. All the factors are aligned for the aerospace industry to grow. </p>]]></richbody0content>

How did this partnership come about, and what were the main objectives of joining forces?</h4><p>In order to develop a world-class facility and build the Kingdom's first-ever rigs and ships, Aramco knew it needed to join forces with the right and reputable partners and engaged HHI, LEL, and Bahri to form IMI as a JV. Saudi Aramco wanted to combine the strength of four industry leaders that would bring decades of experience in the construction, maintenance, repair, and overhaul of vessels and rigs. The success of IMI would be built on the collaboration of these renowned industry leaders with a proven track record of successfully operating commercial yards around the world. HHI and LEL bring the technical know-how in ship and rig building, and Bahri brings valuable knowledge of operations. With the power of these four partners, IMI represents a truly viable business that will transform the maritime manufacturing industry in the Kingdom for years to come.</p><h4>How do you envision developing your product and service range?</h4><p>IMI will focus on the manufacturing of jack-up rigs, vessels, and offshore support vessels (OSVs) along with the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services of these products. IMI has been working closely with the Saudi government to create and enable an environment that will make the yard globally competitive. In February 2018, two offtake master agreements were signed. The first one was with Bahri, which ensured that IMI would receive Bahri's new vessel orders and MRO on vessels. New build work is estimated to reach 52 vessels within a 10-year period. The other agreement is with ARO, ensuring that IMI will receive orders for 20 new-build jack-up rigs over the same period of 10 years. This guaranteed work is a significant milestone for IMI as it guarantees that at least 40% of its capacity will be utilized from its opening date, ensuring IMI can attract key supply chains to set up in Kingdom and develop IMI's technical capabilities over the duration of the offtake work. IMI will have the perfect platform to build a track record that will allow it to be competitive in the global market and attract international operators to the Kingdom to ensure IMI operates at full capacity.</p><h4>What is your approach toward innovation and R&amp;D, and what trends in maritime technology are you incorporating?</h4><p>IMI will deploy the latest international technological innovations to deliver a competitive advantage, including big data analytics, virtual reality, additive manufacturing, process automation, and a diverse range of robotics and software integration. IMI will be in a position to establish collaborations with key suppliers and direct R&amp;D activities toward innovative solutions for customers, making it more competitive in executing equipment management services and therefore improving the lifecycle costs of clients' assets. This strategy will be implemented in three phases; the first will focus on establishing a market presence and introducing asset life cycle management as a service. During the second phase, IMI will grow its market presence and start using data to introduce new offerings. Finally, as IMI becomes recognized in the market, it will expand its unique offerings to improve manufacturing and cost efficiencies for its customers.</p><h4>The Kingdom strives to be an instrumental logistics hub at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa. What role do you see for IMI here?</h4><p>The maritime industry in Saudi Arabia has advantages that support its growth. If we look at the current level of activity from local players such as Saudi Aramco and Bahri, there is approximately 500 million tons of seaborn trade out of the Kingdom, more than 100 ships, 50 offshore rigs, 400 offshore platforms, 350 OSVs, and more than 2,000 calls on Aramco export terminals. The localization of the maritime industry has great significance to the Kingdom, the region, and world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the country's main ocean carrier, what role do you envision for Bahri?</h4><p>Bahri has been playing a leading role in materializing the Kingdom's logistics and transportation ambitions through continuously enhancing its services, strengthening its market presence, and opening new trade routes for greater access to global destinations. We have aligned our long-term strategy with Vision 2030, which envisages transforming the country into a pre-eminent global maritime hub. Accordingly, we have been exploring new avenues to take this vision forward. Looking ahead, furthering the depth and breadth of its product offerings will continue to be a key area of focus for Bahri for the remainder of the year and beyond. Our immediate priority will be to enhance our logistics services portfolio to enable Bahri to weather cyclical challenges in the shipping business and capitalize on new opportunities in the market. We also have plans to enter the third-party logistics (3PL) and fourth-party logistics (4PL) business. Our aim is to provide door-to-door services and a complete solution for our customers. Effective and mutually benefitting partnerships have been a key driver of sustained success, and we place significant emphasis on finding the right partner before venturing into these new products and services. Our collaboration with Bolloré Logistics, one of the top 10 logistics companies in the world, to establish our JV, BahriBolloré Logistics, is a perfect example of such strategic partnerships. With this JV, Bahri has been able to provide end-to-end logistics and supply chain management solutions to local and international firms operating in the Kingdom via air, land, and sea transportation. </p><h4>For Bahri, oil and chemicals are still the primary cargo. How do you envision developing your portfolio?</h4><p>In addition to our strategy to increase the scope of our logistics services, we have laid out plans to further enhance our transportation solutions by strengthening our credentials in oil transportation. We are also keen on diversifying our business with a view to increasing shareholder value and boosting our contribution to the Kingdom's endeavors aimed at maximizing local content. With the objective of developing an indigenous shipbuilding industry in the country, Bahri has established International Marine Industries (IMI) in partnership with Saudi Aramco, Lamprell, and Hyundai Heavy Industries. The JV maritime yard project is currently underway in Ras Al-Khair and is tipped to be the largest full-service maritime facility in the Middle East and North Africa. Major production operations are expected to commence in 2019, with the facility reaching its full production capacity by 2022. Similarly, gas transportation is a key component of our product portfolio. We have a 30% share of Petredec Limited, a company specializing in the trade, transportation, storage, and distribution of LPG. </p><h4>How are you advancing in integrating more technology and innovation into your operations?</h4><p>Technology and innovation are at the heart of Bahri's DNA. We have adopted technology-enabled systems and processes in every aspect of our operations. Marine ERP software PAL and Oracle have been instrumental in driving efficiency across the company. We also place importance on data analysis, which is extremely important in the transportation industry. This is why we have integrated big data into our business processes. We are increasingly leveraging insights hidden in the massive amounts of data to enable smarter and faster decision-making in order to improve operational performance and efficiency. Data intelligence also comes handy in managing our large, state-of-the-art fleet, boosting the safety of our vessels and crew, and improving the quality of our offerings, in addition to increasing customer satisfaction. Similarly, one of the main operational costs associated with the transportation industry is fuel, and we do a great deal of data analysis when it comes to planning, optimization, scheduling, and routing. Due to the significance of the extra value that data brings to the maritime business, shipping companies are increasingly partnering with IT companies to develop data-driven solutions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk us through the evolution of your operations over the past few years?</h4><p>MJC is responsible for implementing the Jeddah Public Transportation Program (JPTP), an essential and important transportation and city development initiative for Jeddah. It focuses on developing mass rapid transit as a core mobility option in a multi-modal transportation system that will help Jeddah continue to grow. JPTP's components includes metro lines, LRT, the Corniche tramway, a bus network, ferries, Obhur Creek Bridge, and a multimodal station. MJC seeks to implement JPTP via the PPP procurement approach. Currently, we are working with our transaction advisors to complete four transactions vis-í -vis the Bus Network Project Phase 1, Obhur Creek Bridge, water taxis, and the development of the Corniche tram. These four transactions will be rolled out to the market in the same order. JPTP has the potential to transform the urban landscape of Jeddah and provide vastly improved transportation to a substantial population to come for decades.</p><h4>Why are you starting with the bus package, and what are the operational implications following the tender announcement?</h4><p>We are using the incremental delivery of benefits approach and the bus public transportation component as initial stage of the long-term public transportation strategy for Jeddah. The bus network project is an initial step in developing a sustainable urban transport outcome for a city that has sufficient travel demand and overall public market share to merit the project. Also, the bus network project is more than just a physical investment; it is transformative and meets the needs of Jeddah's residents. It also requires less initial CAPEX and allows faster delivery of initial public transport enhancement for the city. We will face similar challenges for modal shifts (mode share) like other global public transportation systems during the early days of commercial operations, but these challenges will be overcome by introducing policies to encourage the use of public transport.</p><h4>What are the salient technological aspects of this masterplan?</h4><p>JPTP is an integrated, multimodal public transportation system, and its design and implementation are based on technological aspects such as concurrent engineering, EDMS, 3D BIM modeling, and intelligent transport systems (ITS). The multimodal transportation modes are coordinated through an integrated travel network management and integrated operations control center and include an integrated and automated fare collection system, applications for travel planning, and real-time travel updates. JPTP uses technology that features a uniform brand and symbol for easy recognition by travelers. In addition, during the planning and design phases, MJC is keen to discuss updated technological solutions available in the market or expected to evolve in the future.</p><h4>What financial aspects need to be considered when financing a transportation project?</h4><p>Financing a public transportation system is challenging, and availability of funds is vital to developing any public transportation project. Several factors need to be considered while financing transportation infrastructure, including project-specific business cases and models, sources of funding, financial instruments, avoiding capital cost subsidies, the size of subsidies, keeping capital and operational costs minimal, the age of assets, avoiding preferential treatment for few financial investors, and regulatory policies.</p><h4>What is needed to overcome the challenge of overreliance on direct revenue generation to approve a project's financial model?</h4><p>A project's financial model output is used in cost-benefit analysis, to determine the economic feasibility of a project, or in performing financial analyses. Besides depending on the generation of revenue (direct and indirect) in approving the financial model of a project, the assessor or interrogator of said financial model must look into inputs such as capital, operating, service, and finance costs, escalation rates, and general assumptions made in the model. Additionally, government guarantees, tax exemptions or reductions, the certainty of revenue streams, termination compensation, incentives for new market penetration, and subsidies play an important role in a project's financial model. As a guide, a project's financial model can be approved if it can demonstrate it covers the operating costs and debt service expenses over the tenure of a debt. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What synergies do you strive for within the rail, land transport, and maritime sectors?</h4><p>Under the Vision 2030 objectives to become the number-one logistic hub in the region, it is essential that our transportation divisions are aligned. For this, transportation must become more integrated and efficient. Logistics are beyond transportation; however, they also play a major role. Another key component of our operations is strategy, development, and planning. That is also to reinforce intermodality between the three modes of transport. If we have a train station, we need to make sure it can be connected to a bus, taxi, and metro. We need to plan accordingly to make sure the journeys are as smooth as possible for people and goods. Internationally, these modes are often regulated independently, though we can achieve the highest level of integration through our structure.</p><h4>An important test case for integration is the Riyadh Metro. Could you tell us more about the role TGA plays in this?</h4><p>The Riyadh Metro will have 84 stations and is already integrated with various train stations. We have a logistics strategy put together by the logistics committee and headed by the Minister of Transport, which includes TGA, Saudi Customs, and various other entities. Because we are under its umbrella, we made sure this strategy is as coherent as possible. One of the more important components in the strategy is to make sure all systems are compatible with one another. People sometimes overlook this in the short term, and because of the greenfield nature of this project, we are able to overcome these challenges and integrate them from the beginning.</p><h4>The Haramain High-Speed Railway opened a year ago. How would you evaluate its performance?</h4><p>The Haramain High-Speed Rail is the fastest and largest high-speed railway in the region. The line connects the two most important cities for Muslims in the world, and since we started operations in 2018, there has been extremely high demand. What makes it different from other high-speed lines is that demand is symmetric; demand in Medina is the same as in Mecca as people travel back and forth. It is generally difficult to pioneer such projects, though we saw demand coming immediately and are now considering other projects. We aim to eventually connect Medina to the central region and then to Riyadh with a high-speed line.</p><h4>How are you incorporating technology and innovation to make operations safer and more efficient?</h4><p>Because Saudi Arabia is so large and it is difficult to physically monitor transportation, we are focusing heavily on technology. The main objective is to ensure everything that moves abides by the rules and regulations. We have built and implemented four new platforms: Wasl, which is Arabic for connection and functions as a tracking platform; Bayan for cargo and goods tracking; Naql for licensing; and Hafilat for bus transport. On the back end, we are connected to other relevant government entities, including customs and the Ministry of Interior. On the front end, we are tracking all the trucks we regulate. Truck owners have to install tracking technology and weight sensors. Our requirements stipulate that drivers must take a rest every four hours, and if they do not stop and rest for 45 minutes, we will fine them. The idea is to use technology to make business easier and more efficient. The Logistics Performance Index measures the capabilities of a country in logistics. We use these measurements to ensure we provide the proper services to people in manufacturing, retail, and transshipment. We do the same thing for trucks, buses, taxis, and everything else we regulate. That includes regulations for ride-hailing applications like Uber and Careem, for which we authorize and monitor the drivers as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your current projects to improve efficiency and capacity at Saudi ports?</h4><p>As an integral part of the Saudi transportation system and one of the key enablers of Vision 2030, we work continuously to improve and enhance our efficiency and capacity. We have launched several projects and initiatives focused on infrastructure, superstructure, systems, and maritime regulations to enable Saudi ports to provide a more flexible and competitive service. We are also exploring opportunities to deploy new technologies such as digital and Internet of Things (IoT) to help provide a seamless service to all our customers and key stakeholders. For example, working in close coordination with our partners via the Port Community System and utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we managed to reduce the average dwell time of containers in Saudi Ports from 14 days to five in 2018. Also, in close partnership with Saudi Customs, we launched a “24-hour container clearance initiative," which had great impact on our service levels on end users and capacity levels for the ports. This is part of an ongoing effort to reduce the average container dwell time at Saudi Ports to three days or less by 2020. We also launched a new initiative for truck management to reduce the time spent inside the port from the current average of three hours to 25 minutes. Lastly, we have successfully launched the integration of ports' capacity at a coastal level using both land and marine feeder lines. Upon completion of this phase of the integration, we aim to integrate the capacity of both Saudi coasts on the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf, which will help position Saudi Arabia as the marine gateway of the region and realize its vision of becoming a leading global logistics hub.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for direct investment in Saudi ports?</h4><p>In line with the NTP's initiatives, Mawani looks at direct investment not only as an opportunity to attract investments, but also as an opportunity to adopt global best practices and operate at a best-in-class level as well. Hence, we continue to work with our partners at the SAGIA and other key stakeholders on regulatory reforms that help attract and retain the confidence of foreign investors and global talent. For example, in 2019 we issued licenses to four out the largest 10 global shipping lines to operate their own local agencies in Saudi Arabia under 100% ownership. Furthermore, the coming 24 months will present more opportunities for interested parties both locally and globally, as we prepare to offer more concession agreements for terminal operations, marine operations, and port support services for public bidding, in addition to increasing the number of the bonded areas and re-export zones at Saudi ports.</p><h4>What are the strategic priorities to develop Saudi ports to the next level?</h4><p>In 2018, Saudi ports handled more than 267 million tons of cargo, including over 6 million containers. While the growth in volumes is in line with Saudi economy, it represents approximately 40% of the total capacity of Saudi ports. Therefore, while we continue to invest in enhancing our efficiency and improving our infrastructure, the immediate strategic priority is to place Saudi ports in a position to utilize its existing capacity and unlock its untapped potential. Working with our key stakeholders in the public and private sectors, we piloted, launched, and deployed several initiatives to that end. We seek to attract more transshipment business to Saudi ports in addition to exploring new business opportunities. For example, by increasing the number of bonded areas and re-export zones, we anticipate additional value-added activities to be deployed to attract more cargo movement through Saudi ports. Furthermore, we are keenly observing new developments in the industry and global platforms with the aim of taking the lead in adopting new technology and best practices. Earlier this year, we participated in the first shipment using full blockchain documentation in partnership with Saudi Customs and a global shipping line.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you envision further privatization of the ports in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The ports operations in the Kingdom have been privatized for over 20 years with long-term concession agreements. DP World, Hutchinson, and PSA, under a JV with PIF, have been in a PPP for over 20 years. We also have BOT relationships in Jeddah and Dammam, so the private sector has clearly been invested in the ports for a long time in the Kingdom. The difference is only the amount of allocated investment. </p><h4>How do you plan to divide the centers of gravity more equally throughout the Kingdom, especially utilizing logistics and infrastructure investments? </h4><p>The corridor from Jeddah through Riyadh to Dammam has always been the main center of gravity, simply because most of the population lives there and the national consumption is the highest there. The transportation of goods will obviously occur primarily in those three locations. That said, we see a lot of exports in the eastern province of Jubail. On the west coast, we see a lot more imports and transshipment due to the natural geographic location, as well as centers of consumption, industry, and development. </p><h4>What can you tell us about the enlargements of the rail system and the announcement of the land bridge?</h4><p>These will be key projects for us to execute in the next few years. For the land bridge, we have signed an MoU with the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) and a Saudi company to look at how to develop it. It is still in the early days of negotiations, and the investments in railroad infrastructure are continuous. </p><h4>What is the projected impact of the National Industrial Development and Logistics Plan (NIDLP), and what role will the transport sector play here?</h4><p>We are one of the 13 programs launched by the Kingdom as part of its Vision 2030. NIDLP hosts most of the initiatives that the transport and logistics sectors will implement. The success, movement, and development of both sectors is contingent on the success of that program. NIDLP integrates industry with logistics to ensure the latter also has a competitive advantage for development within the Kingdom. </p><h4>How do you expect e-commerce to affect the Saudi transport sector? </h4><p>We see a huge increase in e-commerce that will affect last-mile delivery. We are also seeing more interest from Fedex, Aero Max, and UPS in the Kingdom and encourage them to invest in major consumption areas. Finally, we are seeing more of the goods being centered here and are in discussion with competitors in logistics and warehousing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Science Technology play in the Saudi economy?</h4><p>Science Technology was established in line with the vision of transforming Saudi Arabia through industrial diversification with a major focus on military technology, which also has applications in other sectors. We started as a defense company involved in trade in 2010, since which time we have increased our revenues by around 30% YoY. With innovation at the core of our model, one of the most important aspects of our business is building JVs and partnerships: we fund R&amp;D for new products with select countries; we have intellectual property partnerships with international companies and joint projects that use our own engineers; and invest in technology abroad as well as bring our own to market. We also invest in think tanks to better comprehend risk factors. Based on this, we decide on which technology to invest in and create the necessary partnerships and infrastructure. In that way, when political decisions are made, we are prepared. </p><h4>What are the top three threats to Saudi Arabia in terms of cybersecurity?</h4><p>Threats do not necessarily come from countries per se, but from assets within those countries. Saudi Arabia is always in a tough position. As the land of the Two Holy Mosques, it will always receive criticism, either from the Islamic community or the liberal-Western one. Thus, the unique nature of the Kingdom constantly requires key political decisions to be made, but more recently we have witnessed greater attention to the cost/benefit analysis with regard to every aspect of the state, including defense. This leads to more tailored approaches for any security issue we might encounter. We have a huge border, which requires appropriate defenses for national security, and the constant monitoring of many variables both within and beyond our country. Unsurprisingly perhaps, cybersecurity, having long been neglected, is an area where we are now heavily engaged. </p><h4>What are the greatest opportunities available to JVs in the country, and what is your assessment of localizing the supply-chains of different industrial and military assets?</h4><p>For the past 50-60 years, Saudi Arabia has predominantly been a consumer economy. As such, in terms of what area to invest in, we might well answer 'anywhere,' as no area thus far is saturated. Even food and beverages, a highly mature market, still shows some room for growth and for new players to enter, as demand remains huge. The defense industry, in this sense, is greenfield in nature. From an investment perspective, our scope is broad, although sometimes we need to think strategically in terms of how much a localization program would cost us in terms of time and money: for certain assets, such as jet fighters, it will always be cheaper simply to purchase from international companies. Some customers want an aircraft, a destroyer on the water, or a tank, without realizing that the world has changed, and that their thinking is outdated. Part of our job and innovation is to be ahead of the curve, and to help with the transformation of others. </p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for 2019?</h4><p>Within the numerous confidential projects that we are working on, our focus mainly remains on those related to capability transfer, which remains the most important aspect of our business. An example of this is our munitions technology, where we are working on enhancing precision and accuracy, rather than focusing on sheer quantity. We are also looking at equipment and tools concerning the security and defense segment, as well as drones, anti-drones, and remote-controlled turret systems.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your recent MoA with Hanwha and the acquisition of AACC embody your strategy, and what do they mean for your future plans?</h4><p>At SAMI, we are pursuing ambitious business strategies in line with our objective to build a sustainable and self-sufficient military sector that would significantly contribute to Saudi Arabia's economy and provide job opportunities to its citizens. Accordingly, our business is being built on two pillars: the consolidation of national industry and finding companies that we would like to take under the SAMI umbrella. We have already acquired two companies; Advanced Electronics Company (AEC) and Aircraft Accessories and Components Company (AACC) and are in the final stages of acquiring two others before the end of 2019. This will be complemented by a set of greenfield company joint ventures that will we enter into with foreign partners to bring new technologies into the Kingdom. What is more, we have already signed agreements with 28 companies. Over the next 12 months, we will announce more of them, and by the end of this year, we will have completed all of our collaborations. We will then cover all the product domains from aviation to naval activities so that SAMI will be engaged not only in aircraft building but also the entire range of defense activities. Hanwha will continue to be one of our key partners in several domains. </p><h4>What is your preferred format for JVs?</h4><p>Our joint ventures are built on the 51:49 equity structure, where SAMI owns the majority ownership interest and the remaining 49% is owned by its foreign partners. We have an understanding with all our partners that every major decision be consensus-based. We guarantee to protect the business interest of our foreign partners and in return require them to bring their technology, skill set, and know-how to the Kingdom. They will not only gain access to the local market, but also to several export markets. Given the complexity of the products and the broad spectrum of activities, we are modest enough to say we cannot do it on our own and want our foreign partners to stay here to ensure the company is sustainable and successful many years from now. </p><h4>What is unique about this market and the current approach that allows you to attract so many partners?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia presents enormous opportunities for military-industrial companies. The Kingdom has the fourth-largest defense budget in the world, and the budgets of the Ministry of Interior, the Presidency of State Security, and the Saudi Arabian National Guard add up to more than USD100 billion.</p><h4>Will you make any changes to the local companies you have acquired?</h4><p>We have a plan to set up a large aviation cluster at King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah where we will combine commercial and military aviation. This cluster will not only focus on system-level activities but also encompass a few companies working on subsystem and component levels, both in production and maintenance, repair, and operations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role is the Industrial Valley of King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC) playing in the industrial revolution of Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The first and most important initiative to achieve KAEC's vision of becoming a regional industrial and logistics hub is King Abdullah Port, which seeks to capitalize on 13% of world trade passing through the Red Sea. Having one of the deepest ports creates new opportunities, either through industries or a logistics hub. This provides global conglomerates the opportunity to do things more efficiently by saving time and gaining accessibility. Naturally, specialization is key to providing the maximum benefit to current and potential clients, which is why we decided to focus on light industries such as pharmaceuticals, which recorded 18% growth last year, and FMCGs. Our strategy is to attract players across the whole value chain, not only manufacturers, a goal in which we are supported by the single window regulator of the Economic Cities Authority. When international companies come, they want to deal with one government agency, not several. Moreover, we built the ecosystem to work on financing by launching the Industrial Export Incentive Initiative. We also brought together three government agencies that support industry acceleration and signed an MoU for land and loans in which the Industrial Valley offers the land, the Economic Cities Authority provides the license, and the Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF) provides the investor financing facility to start development.</p><h4>What operational measures must be taken to attract international investors to Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>There must be a comprehensive, focused approach to attract players across the whole value chain from certain industries. For example, we do not focus only on pharma manufacturing companies, but we also have packaging companies that can serve other industries too. As such, the next step will be building three specialized zones: a gas zone; a technology park to attract top data center providers; and a bonded and re-export zone valley to make high-end plastics used in automotive, biomedical, construction, and food-packaging industries. The idea is to be proactive in implementing energy services within the industrial zone, since companies usually come with specific requirements in terms of power, storm drainage, and access to logistics services, for example. </p><h4>What is your assessment of the National Industrial and Logistics Development Plan, and what is the key to ensuring Saudi Arabia remains an attractive investment location?</h4><p>It re-emphasizes the need for the country to leverage its location. Indeed, integration between industry and logistics is always necessary to then focus on the sectors that the country really needs and has a competitive advantage in. This approach helps investors know where to invest and comforts the players on the supply side. Technology will continue to have a crucial role in keeping these facilities up to date with international standards through the use of robotics and advanced, technology-driven logistics practices in warehouses. Naturally, growing a city of this size and ambition implies challenges, but if we attract the right business and the right talent, we will keep moving forward and start tackling other areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Dow Saudi position itself as an innovator in the material science sector, and what role does Saudi Arabia play in its portfolio?</h4><p>In April 2019, Dow completed the spin off from Dow-DuPont, positioning itself as a leading materials science company with the ambition of becoming the most innovative, customer-centric, inclusive, and sustainable materials science company in the world. That being said, our focus on continued and sustained growth at a global level also applies to the regional and local level. In Saudi Arabia, through Sadara Chemical Company, a USD-20 billion JV with Saudi Aramco, we have introduced products being launched in the Kingdom for the first time. Moreover, we have Dow Middle East Innovation Center (MEIC), which has Dow's R&amp;D facilities and the Digital Marketplace Center capabilities for the region. Through MEIC, we provide application development and technical services focused on oil and gas technology solutions, sustainable coating and construction solutions, and industrial chemicals for a variety of applications relevant to Saudi Arabia and the broader region. However, the most invaluable investment in any country is human capital, and Dow has successfully done that by giving many young Saudis the opportunity to develop their skillset and careers, having trained them so that they can come back and contribute to Saudi Arabia's economy. </p><h4>What was the driver behind choosing Saudi Arabia as the location for the second digital center within Dow's portfolio? What are the center's main goals?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia has been at the forefront of investing in its youth. Its population not only provides a huge pipeline, but also offers talented students. As such, we continue to recruit young Saudis who work in MEIC at Thuwal, on digital market solutions such as data visualization, social listening, finding solutions for customers, and addressing today's challenges. Indeed, today, the digitalization of the entire commercial process has become particularly relevant. Business is not just defined by a buyer-seller relationship, but through close partnership and collaboration. Chemical companies realize the need to facilitate business for their customers and stakeholders in Saudi Arabia. This can happen through tracking developments, providing innovative solutions, reducing overall costs, and engaging closely with customers.</p><h4>How do Dow Saudi Arabia's plans to invest in coatings reflect opportunities in the local petrochemical sector, and what are other attractive areas for international investors to engage in?</h4><p>The downstream industry, especially through value parks, achieves many of the goals set by Vision 2030. First, there is a multiplier effect in terms of job creation; second, the farther downstream we go, the more we can substitute imports for local manufacturing; third, it serves as a diversification of the economy, and it should only really happen to serve a local market. The Saudi market is the largest in the GCC. It has the largest number of consumers, most infrastructure, and the biggest construction base in the region. The coatings plant we are building serves the construction industry with many government projects coming up, and the construction sector will pick up and require more solutions, which represents an opportunity for players seeking to do business in Saudi Arabia. Construction chemicals is another area where we expect to see more demand, as well as oil fields to meet Aramco's significant infrastructure investment in gas and its goal to increase gas capacity. Finally, insulation materials will be in high demand, since the pick-up of the construction industry will require well-built insulation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk us through the company's current portfolio?</h4><p>SARED manages all the properties owned by the holding group and is structured into two divisions: development and O&amp;M. Through the development arm, we built Saudia City and are on hold for a new renovation masterplan that will be backed by feasibility studies by Colliers and JLL. Once these studies are finalized, we will present the plan to the board and engage in this new era, split into four phases to be developed in eight years. This represents our key strategic priority, although we remain active on other fronts too. Aside from Saudia City, we are currently working on a huge flight operation terminal development in Medina and the development and renovation of several buildings in Tabuk and Al Baha. Outside the Kingdom, we are working now on real estate in London where we have a headquarters and a warehouse at Heathrow Airport. </p><h4>How can the investor community regain trust in the Saudi real estate market?</h4><p>The current market conditions, especially on the residential side, offer an excellent opportunity for both developers and investors alike, as prices were reaching all-time highs both in terms of land and property. In 2020, we will witness the final correction. Some actors will exit the market, others will re-enter, and many will be willing to take advantage of the new reality. The real estate market cycle likely hit the lowest point in 2018, with many foreigners leaving the country, and is now starting to pick up. This means that this is the right time to buy because in four years we will witness another peak. These cycles are healthy for the market, and savvy investors should know how to position themselves accordingly. Saudi Arabia also provides them with the competitive advantage of a proper structure until 2030 and 2050 through the vision.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Saudi IP Authority]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[abdulaziz-m-alswailem-ceo-saudi-authority-intellectual-property-saip]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When SAIP was established, patents, trademarks, copyrights, and industrial design came together under one organization. Could you tell us more about the process of bringing these IP responsibilities together?</h4><p>IP is a key factor for the future development of Saudi Arabia's economy, and Vision 2030 stipulates targets that are directly enabled by IP. In line with this, Council of Ministers Resolution 410 set forth new governance for IP in the Kingdom in the shape of SAIP. IP is internationally regulated by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which leads the growth of a balanced and effective international IP system that promotes innovation and creativity for the benefit of its member states. The IP system, however, differs from country to country. Saudi Arabia decided to bring all IP fields under one unified authority, and SAIP was established as one of the initiatives of the trade and investment ecosystem to facilitate business, support the national economy, encourage investment, and boost the Kingdom's ranking on the World Competitiveness Index. Bringing these IP responsibilities together helps us to see the whole picture, making it easier to revise and draft laws and regulations. </p><h4>What approach should companies or individuals wanting to register IP take?</h4><p>IP assets play a growing role as the importance of a knowledge-based economy develops in Saudi Arabia. Companies or individuals wanting to register their IP should first identify which type of IPs they have. In this context, SAIP launched “What is your IP?“ an electronic tool at the SAIP Website (saip.gov.sa) that helps applicants identify the type of their IP. In the current situation, we have an electronic platform for filing patent applications. All the processes of a patent filing are electronic; Saudi Arabia is among the first countries that started to file patents electronically. Our first initiative is to revise all our processes to increase efficiency. The second initiative is to translate all these processes into an IT system that is not off the shelf. The third initiative is to ensure we have the proper infrastructure to implement all these processes. Currently, 75% of our services are done electronically, and we are working hard to convert the other 25%.</p><h4>Can you walk us through your international affiliations?</h4><p>Our vision is to be a hub in the MENA region, and to do this we extended our collaboration with international affiliates. We have signed an agreement with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), and Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO). We have started collaborating with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore and have an agreement with the European Patent Office. Those agreements are focused on the exchange of expertise and capacity building, which is crucial to become an excellent IP office or authority. Second is the exchange of data, and while there is a fast track of patent offices, we seek to sign Patent Prosecution Highway agreements with those offices to exchange our examination reports, which will increase the speed of finalizing patents and reduce the backlog in our office. Third is to share our policies and guidelines with other international offices in order to align with international best practices. </p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for the coming years?</h4><p>The short-term target is to revise our national laws and policies and work toward standardization. The second target is to increase the number of international treaties related to IP treaties joined by Saudi Arabia from six to 13 in 2020. The third target is to prepare an IP national strategy and set implementation plans and timeline in coordination with related entities. Lastly, we seek to move on with e-services in all our activities and set a strategy for backlog applications.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Benefits of Medical Cannabis]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-julio-cesar-aldana-bula-general-director-invima]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Invima seek to reduce waiting times and procedures in the medical sector through technology?</h4><p>Digital transformation is also a tool to fight corruption, to be more transparent and efficient. Part of that digital transformation affects our six regional offices. As a result of digital transformation and a restructuring of all these regional offices, we seek to ensure these valuable entrepreneurs in the regions can access the sanitary registry through tools. Additionally, we need to generate alliances with the academy and other state institutions such as chambers of commerce. Hence, we are working in all regions doing workshops to build the health status. They consist of training people because we have valuable entrepreneurs in several regions of the country with wonderful business plans, though they have no knowledge of the relevance that complying with sanitary standards has on public health.</p><h4>How does Invima plan to continue increasing scientific rigor and vigilance, particularly in the field of medical and cosmetic cannabis?</h4><p>Invima does not have the nature of promoting entrepreneurship, economic development, or anything similar. Invima is a health authority, though health interests do not have to collide with business interests. Many times they can be reconciled when the interests are legitimate, and we agree on the purpose of promoting public health. In this government, we have a clear and defined policy regarding the use of medical cannabis. We respect the autonomy of nations that have accepted the use of recreational cannabis, though in Colombia, the use of cannabis is restricted to medicinal use. That does not prevent us from moving forward, for example, in something that the industry demands. In fact, we have already done it in the cosmetics sector, where there are more than 300 health records. Compared to other countries, such as Canada, Colombia has made great efforts. There are certain business developments that we cannot ignore as long as we have a single roadmap based on scientific rigor. With science, we can define specific uses and a timely development of cannabis around the needs in the world of medicine, for example, pain and inflammation, insomnia, anxiety, muscle spasticity in some specific diseases, issues of refractory epilepsy in specific syndromes, and so on. Colombia must hold on to scientific rigor to boost that industry. The country is a pioneer in regulatory matters in the region. People perceive Invima as one of the most problematic organizations, but I want to ensure serious quality standards of safety and efficacy, in order to strengthen public health which is my primary purpose. Though when the industrial and business interest are legitimate it doesn't have to clash with health interest.</p><h4>How is Invima facilitating the success of the medical cannabis business, and what are your short and medium-term expectations about its role in the face of a rapidly developing market?</h4><p>I only see Invima in its role as health authority. Moreover, we have a standard that has advanced and cannot be stagnant. Colombia has to move ahead in issuing excellent manufacturing practices to make the market for master products a reality. Also, we have to keep moving forward so that there is more transformation, more physiotherapeutic products, so that there are more products based on chemical synthesis, but all done with scientific rigor. There are many instances of the government seeing how to promote this without neglecting public health interests.</p><h4>How does Colombia stand in comparison to the region in terms of medical cannabis? </h4><p>I see Invima focused on health issues, quality, safety, efficiency, and good manufacturing practices, so that products can access international markets. However, there is a road traveled by investors already settled in the medical cannabis industry. A large part of the establishments I visited in Canada are from investors present in Colombia, so there is transparency of knowledge and technology that gives us peace of mind as a health authority. When one sees the developments of many of those industries in Colombia, they realize many industries are allied with those that already have an important path. That gives us peace of mind in health matters. The rigor I saw in Canada around production is extremely high.</p><h4>As one the most important authorities in Colombia, what is your outlook for 2020? </h4><p>Essentially, we seek to build prestige. To have prestige, society must recognize it. We are the health authority that promotes and protects the public's health through the surveillance of a universe of very important products that people use and consume on daily basis. This recognition is the most important and is achieved through transparency, efficiency, and hygienic conditions. We have advanced significantly in the area of food, cosmetics, and medical devices. We have facilitated procedures and eliminated some. The pharmaceutical issue has cost us greatly. It has been more difficult to move forward. It will take us more time but we will do it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of your major ongoing projects in the Kingdom?</h4><p><strong>TURKI AL </strong><strong>SHEHRI </strong>ENGIE is globally renowned. It is the number-one private power and water producer in the GCC. It executed its first projects in the Kingdom in 2012 with a focus on power and water generation. Moving forward, ENGIE reinforced its presence in the Kingdom with four large power and water plants, which represented roughly 10% of KSA's capacity. As a result of this, it is also on the verge of opening a permanent office in Riyadh. ENGIE is globally shifting its focus to renewable energy, cogeneration, and green hydrogen, for which we are in talks with the ministries of energy, industry, and mineral resources. Green hydrogen is the future and is already the fuel being used by space shuttles. Saudi's strength is that it has extremely cheap renewables; the country has great solar radiation and a great wind profile. In terms of green hydrogen, the electrolysis system will come through renewables. Even though it is extremely difficult to compete with gas-based hydrogen or gray hydrogen, the idea is to create a new energy using ENGIE's technologies. We want to ensure Saudi leads the green hydrogen era on a global scale. Even though Saudi has oil and gas, which will remain its strength for decades to come, this is another opportunity to create a new energy that does not currently exist anywhere else in the world. </p><p><strong>JESíšS SANCHO </strong>ACCIONA Agua was delighted to be awarded with this relevant desalination plant by the Saudi Water Partnership Company (SWPC), along with our top-tier co-developers. This is a key project for Saudi Arabia as part of its Vision 2030. It is also a large project and will entail a 450MLD or 100MIGD seawater reverse osmosis desalination facility. To be launched by as an independent water project (IWP), the SWPC will develop, design, build, operate, and maintain the plant for a period of 25 years. It will consist of a marine works, SWRO plant, 380Kv electrical substation, high-voltage overhead transmission line, product water tanks, and a connection with a nearby pumping station. The goal is to provide potable water to the city of Abha. ACCIONA Agua is committed to serving the country to the best of its ability in its quest for the National Transformation Program, and we are proud to be part of the second-largest SWRO plant under a PPP scheme and the third-largest single facility of its kind in Saudi Arabia. </p><h4>How do you help invest in local infrastructure, whether human or physical? </h4><p><span></span><strong>TAS ENGIE</strong> took a huge leap in leading the private sector to operate differently in Saudi. To date, foreign company executives always came from the company's home country. By hiring a Saudi as its CEO to represent Saudi Arabia, ENGIE took a significant step forward. This will guide us on how to better use our expertise because a local understands exactly what the country needs and where the focus should be. ENGIE has a global impact—we currently have operations in 70 countries—and at the same time a local presence in every country it operates. In our communications with the government, rather than trying to sell, we look at providing actual value. For example, jobs are the number-one objective of everything we do here. We will not simply continue to hire a greater percentage of local staff each year but also want to provide training to young Saudis and kick start their careers by providing them with training programs. This can be a continuous pipeline insofar as we are constantly contributing to the country. This is where having a local actually leading the strategy for a foreign company makes a huge difference in terms of adding wider value.</p><p><span></span><strong>JS</strong> ACCIONA has set up several permanent establishments here in the last five years. We have offices in Riyadh and Jeddah from where we attend to the Saudi market. ACCIONA is a worldwide developer of infrastructure, be it transportation, water treatment, renewable and conventional power, or hydraulic energy. We are also experts in those public services that can improve the quality of life in the countries and cities where we operate. We aim to replicate the success achieved in more than 30 countries in the KSA and in as many verticals as possible. This is the reason why we have decided to have a permanent a long-lasting presence in the Kingdom. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you tell us about Miahona's positioning in the market and its primary expertise?</h4><p>Miahona is the water and wastewater vertical of Vision Invest focused on developing and operating in municipal, commercial, and industrial segments. We cover the entire water value chain, from water extraction to production and distribution, including metering, billing, customer sales, collection and treatment of wastewater, selling recycled water for non-potable uses, and sludge disposal. Miahona's focus business model is PPP structured projects that bring value to the client and shareholders. As a developer, we seek bankable, guaranteed off-take structure as our main driver, though we do have ongoing businesses where we take a market risk, especially when a project is driven by a strategic partnership or long-term objectives. Presently, Miahona's key targets are municipal wastewater BOTs, municipal and industrial distribution concessions, and strategic giga projects. We have ongoing water and wastewater concessions in Jeddah, Dammam, and Al Ahsa industrial cities through our subsidiary, Industrial Cities Development and Operating Company (ICDOC). This is a real success story for Miahona because we have been serving the industrial cities for close to 20 years and have proven our reliability and strong commitment to our customers.</p><h4>How are you expanding your operations into the municipal and commercial sectors?</h4><p>We currently target the recently announced wastewater independent sewage treatment plant projects being tendered by Saudi Water Partnership Company (SWPC). It is a core business focus, and we are here to support the government's vision and privatization program. In the water distribution business, Miahona is keen to participate in NWC's distribution privatization program that will commence with the upcoming management, operation, and maintenance contracts for the six regional clusters of the Kingdom. We have formalized our partnership with strong international players, namely Saur and Manila Water. Our three-party consortium brings extensive and varied experience in water management in developed countries as well as emerging countries in addition to Miahona's know-how of the water sector in the Kingdom.</p><h4>What is your approach to technological innovation to stay competitive?</h4><p>It is all about providing the right service and the right quality at a competitive price. We particularly have to consider the reliability of the technology we adopt, so it is not easy to introduce any un-commercialized or unproven technology. One of the main drivers of successful project delivery is proper risk allocation, which is demonstrated by proven technology, references, and by convincing the lenders that there is a well-structured bid that makes the developer competitive. We are not an EPC contractor or a technology provider that is keen to commercialize a specific technology. We combine technology innovation with high-quality service delivery and adherence to the client's requirements and the contractual obligations, thus adding value to our stakeholders. </p><h4>What are your expectations of the announced megaprojects in the water treatment sector?</h4><p>We have a strong focus on the announced giga projects within our group. In the municipal water sphere, we have operated the city of Jeddah for nearly 10 years as a management contractor in a JV with an international partner, managing complete distribution system and wastewater treatment serving more than 5 million inhabitants. Our subsidiary company, Jazzirah Environmental Company (JECO), is the biggest private-sector operator for the standalone sewage treatment plants with a combined capacity of more than 500,000cbm per day. The management contracts and distribution initiatives today are not new activities for Miahona, as it has been engaged in this segment for the last 10 years. Looking at the giga projects, these are similar in structure to the industrial city projects we have done. It is all about who the regulator is for a particular project. We are already delivering at a higher quality with more constraints under our existing contracts. We are also treating more complex industrial waste compared to municipal waste. With a proven track record and years of experience, Miahona is well positioned to deliver the water and wastewater infrastructure in these projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief overview of 2018's major highlights in the offtake segment of the water and electricity sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>2018 was a great and challenging year. It started with four calls for proposals being sent to the market with new mandates to cap energy usage and the addition of a local content requirement, according to which 40-50% of one's spending during the construction phase has to be done in Saudi Arabia. That bracket jumps to 50-70% during the operations and maintenance phases. Our first project was Rabigh 3 IWP, a 600,000cbm per day desalination plant to supply the Mecca region. After receiving 55 proposals, five consortiums eventually submitted firm bids. Big international names, such as ACWA Power, Marubeni, and Veolia, most of them in partnership with Saudi players, submitted strong, competitive bids with a winning price of SAR1.99 per cbm. At the time, it was the lowest price ever recorded worldwide for desalinated water. In the broader context of the Saudi market, where energy is subsidized, this process highlights a breakthrough that will change the industry, lowering prices by 30%.</p><h4>What is your strategy for 2019 and beyond?</h4><p>We are currently giving an opportunity to new bidders that want to enter the market. By mid-2019, we plan to have three more independent water projects (IWP). Moreover, we have received submissions in response to our request for qualifications with respect to the development of a new independent sewage treatment plant (ISTP) in Taif. Our market analysis of long-term capacity planning based on demand and supply gaps clearly identifies a growing need for desalination plants, and we have listed more than 10 plants that need to come online before 2025. At the same time, we have another 10 sewage treatment plants and strategic tanks that need to be launched into the market. We will announce these new projects in 2019 and 2020. We are also assessing the feasibility of the PPP model for small STPs and water transmission pipelines.</p><h4>What opportunities does the market offer in the water management and power generation sectors?</h4><p>We have a huge pipeline of projects that continues to grow, which means the market offers many opportunities for different types of investors. The market is bound to become more competitive, given the recent 30-40% price reduction, which will also lead to greater efficiency in the equity versus debt financing structure. Moreover, the National Center of Privatization has developed manuals and guidelines for private-sector participation, which will make the process faster and attract more foreign players. The current focus on transparency gives the Saudi environment greater credibility, and we expect this to attract an even higher number of players in the future.</p><h4>What technological progress has been made in the water and energy nexus?</h4><p>From an energy standpoint, sewage plant energy consumption is limited, and the impact of energy on the price of treated water is less than 10%. For seawater, however, the energy needed for reverse osmosis makes up more than 35-40% of the operating costs, which is fairly substantial. As a result, people are starting to look toward mixing water and renewable energy. The competitive nature of the market will force developers to consider new ways to reduce the cost of energy. What we will be considering in future projects is encouraging the developer to include renewable energy options at the plant; this will have the effect of reducing overall production costs even further.</p><h4>What are your priorities moving forward?</h4><p>Our overall priority is to meet the Kingdom's demand for water while working in partnership with the private sector. We are now at an implementation phase whereby all stakeholders need to be aligned. Privatization is crucial to our success, and it will be based on our long-term supply plans that we develop with direction from the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>During the Water Forum in March 2019, NWC invited citizens to support the National Program for Water Conservation (Qatrah) to preserve water as a non-renewable national resource. Could you tell us more about this initiative?</h4><p>Qatrah is an initiative by the water distribution sector to preserve water as a non-renewable national resource in line with Saudi Vision 2030. Qatrah comes at a time when Saudi Arabia is among the highest per capita water-consuming countries around the world, which is not consistent with its water sources. The average per capita water consumption in the Kingdom is 263 liters per day. According to the national strategy for water that we are working on via Qatrah and a wide range of other awareness programs and conservation solutions in cooperation with providers of conservation tools, that average is expected to come down to 200 liters per day by 2020 and 150 liters by 2030. The Saudi Standards, Metrology, and Quality Organization (SASO) has approved the labeling for the efficiency of water rationing tools, stating that suppliers should provide the local market with approved products only and that unapproved tools must be removed from the market. The national program will boost the optimal use of water and raise awareness of the importance of conservation and the necessity to change consumption behaviors. It will effectively reduce consumption, assist in sustaining water resources, and achieve optimal investment of water resources by conserving and preserving water. The collective nature of Qatrah requires everyone in the community, including individuals, to interact so that we can conserve water. NWC has signed agreements with numerous private entities to begin implementing the initiative, which will reduce domestic water leaks and cut consumption in private and governmental buildings. Leakage is one of the major reasons for high consumption and expensive bills. Notably, several leak detection methods are available that customers can use by themselves or via specialized companies.</p><h4>What are the current avenues for privatization of water and wastewater treatment assets, and what synergies do you strive for between NWC, SWCC, and the Saudi Water Partnership Company?</h4><p>We intend to do privatization in two stages, where stage one entails issuing management contracts, followed by a concession of 25-30 years. The management contract means the contractor will take over the region or city for three to five years, depending on the complexity of the area. The contractor will evaluate the asset, manage the whole operation, and oversee all the manpower. During this period, the contractor will decide and vocalize the investment requirements so as to ensure the efficiency of the operation. We will provide all of the CAPEX required during this period of time. Once we move from a management contract to a concession, the contractor will take over completely. It will be responsible for the manpower and investing in CAPEX to manage the master plan. The contractor will, therefore, become the supervisor and operator. The benefit of having this model comes from the private sector, which has the expertise to run the water sector. It will level the efficiency of the sector and do a better job than what we are doing today. We could do what the private sector is doing, but it might take 20 years to get there, while we expect the private sector to do the same work in 10 years. Finally, we will pay the private contractor based on a unit rate according to each cubic meter of water supplied or the wastewater being discharged. The other benefit of privatization is that all the CAPEX can be deferred. We will not require any funding from the government. The private contractor will fund all the expansions and upgrades for brown- and greenfield projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[bridging-funding-gaps]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the strategic priorities of multilateral development banks (MDB) when addressing challenges in the private sector of developing Islamic countries?</h4><p>Within the challenging economic environment that the private sector of Islamic countries operates in, development institutions like ICD need to maintain a focus on three main themes: development of SMEs and competitiveness, supporting countries affected by conflict, and boosting financial inclusion. It is very important to work together with the governments of member countries to ensure our actions are aligned with national programs and priorities. Second, ICD's responsibility is to help mitigate the financial risks associated with investments in infrastructure, SMEs, agribusiness, and other industries, especially in difficult markets and unstable geographies. We realize this effort either through the support of tailored programs such as BRAVE in Yemen, or through a range of financial tools such as sukuk issuances, equity capital market transactions, or lines of finance through local financial partners.</p><h4>What projects can the combination of technology and Islamic finance produce in the long term?</h4><p>Islamic finance can be applied to all sharia-compliant sectors, and since many of the markets we cover are underdeveloped, it also makes it easier to apply fintech as a greenfield project. We are reliant on mobile phones and the internet in these environments as a means of reaching out to the ultimate beneficiaries. Furthermore, there is the possibility of connecting blockchain with sukuk and capital markets products. Given the high cost of lending, investors are increasingly turning to capital markets to raise capital, with the issuance of a bond/sukuk allowing them to raise significant sums of money over long tenures. These sukuk issuances play a crucial role in bridging the gap between available financial resources from development institutions and the required development needs, which stand at almost USD4 trillion, according to some estimates. Member countries are increasingly demanding socially responsible investment opportunities and have expressed a strong appetite for green sukuk. Moving forward, a substantial amount of investment will be required to finance renewable energy projects, particularly in developing and frontier markets. The market is growing, and having a structured green sukuk using a developed blockchain platform could facilitate the processes and streamline the negotiation timeframes.</p><h4>What is the key to balancing the tendency of governments in Islamic countries to develop megaprojects to attract international investors?</h4><p>Green projects are growing exponentially and will continue to attract investors to finance large-scale projects. As part of the broader focus on SMEs, development institutions should concentrate their efforts on ensuring smaller players are part of these projects as sub-contractors. These efforts help grow and stabilize the market and ensure there is a reliable and inclusive economy where everyone can play a role. At the same time, we need to ensure SMEs have strong financial foundations to perform those projects, which is why institutions like ICD play an equally important role in providing funds to SMEs. This financial support will likely witness a major upgrade through our fintech focus, as ICD seeks to get crowdfunding into play and support the related services with big data and AI.</p><h4>How does urbanization impact ICD's programs and operations?</h4><p>Urbanization is a global trend that every development institution should adjust to. As such, our role should be dual: help the integration of new players into urban dwellings through our focus on SMEs and support financial inclusion through fintech tools. This dual effort should be inserted in a blended financing program through which the government provides the initial funding, and we provide both financial and training support to young businesses. That being said, development institutions should have an equal focus on urban and rural areas, seeing them as part of the same picture. Indeed, investors rate fintech and agritech as the hottest sectors. Agritech businesses have a fundamental role to play in overcoming productivity issues, and fintech businesses offer new and innovative ways of accessing finance and marketplaces. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do the changes to regulations in the Saudi insurance industry mean for the overall sector?</h4><p>The government promotes the insurance industry to keep the financial sector in general and the insurance sector in particular healthy and ensure sustainable, profitable conditions. These strategic efforts, driven by Vision 2030, aim to increase the sector's overall contribution to GDP. Government regulators are laying down proper operating conditions and infrastructure for insurance companies while promoting customer-centric principles that bring sustainable protection for citizens. As insurance companies, we must encourage more product diversification and awareness in support of the same purpose. The regulator wants to see increased levels of customer satisfaction and efficient settlement of claims as these will contribute to boosting confidence in the sector.</p><h4>Is the sector bound to witness more mergers and acquisitions or is it a premature trend given the low penetration?</h4><p>"Horizontal mergers" help newly constituted firms increase their economies of scale, thus better positioning the organization's ability to cover insurance risks. These merged insurance entities will have a larger combined portfolio with increased capabilities to handle and sustain varied products, and their market share will increase as a result. Hence, mergers will serve the economic goals that both regulators and the government hope to achieve.</p><h4>How has UCA's risk appetite evolved in the last few years, and how does this evolution reflect the trends in the local insurance market?</h4><p>Supported by the government's regulations and the enactment of compulsory medical and motor insurance, the market has expanded exponentially. According to the regulator, the measures implemented to date have resulted in excellent growth rates. The sector's volume has increased from SAR5 billion to around SAR36 billion, and the number of people employed in the insurance sector has increased from 5,000 to 11,000. Moreover, the nation's promising macroeconomic environment has helped enhance the maturity and technical capabilities of participating firms. UCA's risk appetite has further evolved to better insure risks with higher capacity due to its demonstrated lengthy experience in engineering and motor TPL products, as well as its extensive partnership with expert reinsurers in the last 40 years.</p><h4>To what extent is Saudi Arabia a price-driven market, and what is the key to increasing the insurance penetration rate?</h4><p>The Saudi insurance sector is price driven at this stage. Unfortunately, there is a knock-on effect in response to insurance products being defined as compulsory. In such a situation, insurance companies tend to pay less attention to awareness and marketing as well as diversifying and differentiating their products and services from those offered by their competitors. Consequently, consumers start focusing on price as a key differentiator. However, clients today now place greater value on service delivery as awareness levels increase. Insurance companies have a great responsibility to diversify and differentiate their products by re-thinking their marketing activities.</p><h4>To what extent can Vision 2030 support the growth of relatively subdued insurance lines?</h4><p>Vision 2030's ambitious goals are promising for the insurance industry, as they aim to stimulate investment in previously nonexistent new sectors, entertainment being a prime example. The challenge is for insurance companies to embark on a transformation program to promote agility in innovation. A key focus is digital transformation, which is no longer an option. Insurance companies must be able to respond faster and stay ahead of the curve by developing and marketing products that appeal to consumers in this nascent market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about Moody's National Scale Ratings (NSR) in Saudi Arabia, and how it would complement your offering in the Kingdom?</h4><p><strong>MAHMOUD TOTONJI</strong> One of the strategic priorities of the Kingdom is to develop the debt capital market. This is a strategic focus of numerous governmental agencies, private institutions, and organizations that have described creating a deep and liquid debt capital market as a central component of Vision 2030 and is extremely important for the growth of the country and numerous local markets. Moody's provides independent credit opinions for both cross-border and local investors; moreover, it developed the Global Scale Ratings (GSR) for all investors. For local investors, Moody's has announced its intention to offer NSR, which is typically mapped from the GSR. This NSR mapping is designed to enhance the credit differentiation among local credits. So far, Moody's has introduced NSRs in around 17 countries. NSRs are not intended for credit comparisons across geographical borders, but rather within countries. The NSR scale for Saudi Arabia helps local currency investors understand and assess credit investment opportunities within the Kingdom.<br>What has been Bayan's impact in its three years of operations?</p><p><strong>AHMED S. AL MAJED</strong> Bayan has advanced rapidly in terms of contracting banks and financial institutions (FIs). Currently, all local banks and FIs are covered, and we expect to integrate with most of them before 2020. In addition, we cover around 75% of FIs in the country. We also target the mega traders in the market that cover more than 40% of the market and register the receivables. This is a completely new service in the country. Bayan is the exclusive provider of Qawaem, an MCI program that curates audited financial statements. In March 2019, we launched a new product called Bayan Indices, adding great value to all financial entities by helping them guide their planning and budgeting for the coming years. We have an opportunity to create a new engine that will collaborate all financials, or about 130,000 audited financial statements in the Kingdom. Using this engine, one can analyze and divide them according to sectors and sub-sectors, and then display indicators. Bayan Indices has 250 financial indicators and ratios for each sector and sub-sector. The source of this is not only listed companies, but non-listed ones as well.</p><h4>How do you use market parameters to assess your credit ratings for Saudi Arabia as a whole?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MT</strong> We opened our office in Saudi Arabia in 2018, but have had a credit rating presence in Saudi Arabia for 13 years. Our understanding of the economy and corporates and strong relationships with market participants are our major strengths. The impact of Saudi Arabia is huge on many local and regional levels. At present, the country is going through extremely exciting times. It announced its Vision 2030 in 2016, and we have seen how rapidly the economy has transformed. Additionally, the transformations are comprehensive, ranging from education and finance to health and industry. Given Moody's historical presence and deep understanding of the Saudi market, we will continue to take a significant interest in this transformation. We anticipate that part of this economic and social transformation is an expanding capital market. For example, one thing the government is focused on is diversifying its economy away from oil. Achieving this objective will require a great deal of investments in different sectors from both local and international investors. Through its independent credit opinions and research, Moody's helps the international investor community better understand and assess credit risk in the Saudi market. Our credit ratings coverage is diverse, though our deepest coverage comes in the banking sector, where we cover 11 out of 12 banks. We cover the large corporations as well as infrastructure and insurance, and see a great deal of potential and interest in expanding our corporate-sector coverage.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and ambitions for the next two years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ASAM</strong> Having the data of more than 1 million CRs in the Kingdom and the information of more than 200 million companies worldwide, our first strategic target is to provide the market with this data in the form of organized and easy-to-read reports, and most importantly create processes that protect consumer data. Being updated on the data provided in reports is also one of our priorities; having members from both financial and B2B trade companies is necessary to stay as the standard in the market. Ultimately, we should be able to cover each and every credit transaction on the market. As a future plan, we plan to cover every fintech player as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about your primary expertise, and how you have advanced in recent years? </h4><p>Our expertise focuses on two components; financial content, similar to Reuters or Bloomberg Terminal, and fintech. We are the pioneers in the financial content industry in Saudi Arabia, being the first to introduce subscription-based content to retail masses. In fintech, we work in a specialized domain, providing software technology. We provide brokerage management systems, asset management systems, custody management systems, and client relationship management (CRM) tailored to the investment management industry and anti-money-laundering systems. The latest innovation are robo-advisors, which help bring investment management into a retail framework.</p><h4>How important is continuous innovation, and to what extent do you develop technologies in-house? </h4><p>Continuous innovation is key to maintaining market leadership and growth, both vertically and horizontally. If companies like ours slow down innovation, we risk losing our standing or getting stuck in a stagnant position. Our company was based on a game-changing innovation. All we do comes from value-based innovation. In 2005, we expanded into market information. When Tadawul had an economic slowdown, investors started inquiring about debt analyzing, and we included that. Our screens became more mature, incorporating more analytics. Starting from a purely B2C model, we became a B2B platform. All banks and brokers started to use our platform, which is the case for the majority today. Next, we developed our brokerage management system for which we are overhauling our complete system, a process we call legacy modernization. User experience is the most important for us. Although we had a first-mover advantage with our screens, we needed to adjust to new realities. Our focus has expanded throughout all emerging and frontier markets, from Morocco to the Philippines. Our main offices are in Riyadh, Dubai, and Cairo, and our secondary offices are in Kuwait, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk us through HyperPay's core business model and how it facilitates online transactions?</h4><p>In the beginning, we defined ourselves as a payment gateway to process both online payments through card schemes, such as Visa and Mastercard, and local payment systems such as Sadad and Mada. At present, our system works between banks, the card scheme, the merchant, and the end user. When the end user reaches the point of payment via credit card and submits the payment form, we process the information and run a due diligence check on the card details, which includes a 120-point fraud check. We then pass on the information to the acquiring bank; that response is sent to the card scheme to confirm and process the purchase. The merchant and the purchaser are also informed of the purchase confirmation or rejection. Remarkably, all of this is done in two seconds. </p><h4>What products do you have in the pipeline, and how do they fit into your growth strategy going forward?</h4><p>We work with nine out of 11 banks engaged in acquiring; we will soon sign with the other two banks and represent the entire banking network in Saudi Arabia, a feat we have already achieved in Jordan. Our next plan is to expand into Egypt. Moreover, with our network of banks, which we call solutions network, we will begin to launch new products. While we continue to develop APIs to easily connect merchants on payment gateways and enhance our anti-fraud system, we are developing new invoicing system to tap into the large market of Instagram shopping in Saudi Arabia. We also created a mobile application that helps merchants track transactions and sales. In terms of clients, we have developed a customized solution for hotel invoicing in Jordan, where we usually test products before launching them into other markets, which in this case would be the UAE and Saudi Arabia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was DCI established, and what payment solutions have you developed?</h4><p>DCI started in 2015, when we were working with the Central Bank of Jordan on various payment initiatives. At the time, DCI was attending the Digital Transformation Committee meetings after being invited by the Central Bank of Jordan. We attended workshops with the WTO, the Central Bank of Jordan, representatives of the German government, and other entities. The main focus was financial inclusion for Jordan, including helping the refugees in Jordan with a low-cost remittance solution. That is when DCI was established. Thereafter we decided to create our own platform because financial inclusion was not our type of software. We did not want to depend on someone else for the technology because then we lose our agility.</p><h4>How did DCI enter the Saudi market?</h4><p>DCI was formed to be the vehicle to sell digital solutions in Saudi Arabia. DCI started its activities in the Saudi market in partnership with the Alsubeaei family, the major shareholders of Albilad Bank, amongst many other businesses and banks outside the Kingdom. As bankers, they knew the challenges facing the banking industry and were convinced that digital money was the future. Thus, the partnership made sense, and we transferred our technology to Saudi Arabia and nationalized it. It was truly the biggest catalyst of our success. We received two licenses from the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) with the cooperation of our partner, the Arab National Bank.</p><h4>What is your experience and perspective on SAMA's more open and evolving approach to licensing of financial players here?</h4><p>SAMA is evolving, though it is strict in the anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) areas, and we understand why. SAMA has a tough mission because it wants to promote agility and digitization, but at the same time does not want to compromise on the AML and KYC rules. Digital solutions are vulnerable to hacking, and SAMA wants to make sure those solutions provided to the market are low risk to protect consumers and the market. If we look at all these elements and considerations, we can see SAMA is doing a great job. It is truly pushing for a digital market.</p><h4>How does DCI plan to grow its business in the coming years?</h4><p>DCI is currently introducing a specialized marketplace just for e-commerce promotions for its regular clients. We are signing with major merchants and retailers, who will use our digital promotion tools, and will report back to them on the demography of their users and where they saw their advertising. Ours is a completely cashless system from end to end. If we had not addressed all the different stakeholders in the cash system, we would not have succeeded. This is why through its platform DCI is addressing merchants, retailers, SAMA, banks, and consumers. We want to show the market that one can build many offerings on our platform, for example, a specialized marketplace, digital promotions, or connections with Uber or other third parties. Retailers have to react to e-commerce, as do banks. Banks will not disappear, though they must address the fintech rush.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your strategy to create an innovative fintech hub and align all the stakeholders?</h4><p>Technology has disrupted every sector, including the financial services industry. The Saudi fintech initiative is diversifying the sources through which we manage financial transactions, and devising a strategy to move toward a cashless society. The ecosystem in Saudi Arabia is rather unconnected, with many players navigating on their own. The Fintech Saudi program was launched in April 2018 to enhance, innovate, and connect the system and better understand the market and prevailing opportunities. We need to build infrastructure and see how to connect the dots between start-ups, investors, and traditional financial players. This will help diversify the economy and develop a better ecosystem for entrepreneurs.</p><h4>What other initiatives are shaping the fintech industry?</h4><p>When we consider the retail and telecommunication industries, both the fundamental dynamics and consumer behavior are changing. This demands a diversity of new services on various platforms. We understand that STC Pay, Halalah, and other fintechs will help customers manage their transactions and foster diversification. Initiatives such as the central bank's sandbox initiative and the fintech initiative are involved in navigating the ecosystem to better create a pipeline in the market. Then there is the Capital Market Authority's Fintech Lab initiative, which is geared at regulating its services into arrangement, custody and stocks, bonds, and crowd funding. We are considering supportive and responsible fintechs and endorsing safe environments with a view to better understand what regulators need to introduce. The sandbox and Fintech Lab are the “test bed" where fintechs can enter for 12 to 18 months before graduating. We are also using these testing environments to regulate services in the market for new fintechs to navigate the market without having to go through the full testing cycle for the same service. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[paying-it-forward]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you position American Express as a global payment operator in the financial landscape in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Unlike other credit card issuers, American Express only issues credit cards. We are the only monoline card company in the Kingdom. We do credit cards better because our total focus is on the customer and their card. If one wants a credit card that suits their needs with extraordinary customer service, then American Express is the answer. If a company is looking at a co-brand partner for cards, American Express with its global experience is the best company to partner with. We are more focused on cards because that is our primary business. We partner with banks when we see the synergy can add value to the customer. In the commercial space, we manage the SAIB and SABB corporate card portfolio in addition to providing our own standalone corporate solutions. This enables banks to obtain a state-of-the-art turnkey corporate card and payment solution and provides American Express with a wider distribution channel.</p><h4>How do you position yourself in the market, and how do you envision growing your position through partnerships with entities?</h4><p>We are witnessing a shift away from cash payments which, historically, we have regarded as a major competitor. There are several new actors in the market in competition with cash. This is driven largely by the growth of fintech payment operators. Especially among young people, which form the majority of the Saudi population, there is a major shift from cash to non-cash payments. There are many countries where people leave the house and have no cash on them, where they rely on their card or mobile phone. Previously in Saudi Arabia, this practice was unheard of, though that is now changing. More people are open to going cashless, creating a great opportunity for American Express. There are more cashless slices in a larger pie. Many of the new payment solutions, including Apple Pay and STC Pay, are backed by credit cards. That is why we consider them partners and not competitors. These partnerships expand our reach making the pie bigger.</p><h4>How do you plan on growing engagement of your credit cards with a younger generation?</h4><p>In the past, we were working with older clients, because our product was geared toward high-net-worth individuals and corporations. Now, we pitch to youth and the mass affluent customers and cannot use the same distribution channels. We use social media, such as Instagram and Facebook. The second piece of the puzzle is tailoring the product so that it has offerings that suit the youth and mass affluent base. The distribution and communication is now done digitally. We have revamped our mobile app so that it is more interactive and provides customers with all the information they need or want about their payments and account. Young people tend to do more of their shopping online. Their first card is to support digital payments and daily transactions. People spend differently now, and so the products that we sell need to cater to that. The interaction they have with the company is different as well, which is why we are working on new communication channels. </p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for American Express in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We are optimistic for the future, and we are following the demographics of Saudi Arabia, ready to partner in the Kingdom's Vision 2030. We are looking at growing and providing services to entrepreneurs as well as companies created in the new economy providing solutions that make payments transparent. E-commerce is seeing unprecedented growth in the Kingdom. Customers, in general, are more price conscious, and e-commerce supports this trend. Another major pick up will be contactless payment, especially for public transport. Tapping a card issued on an open platform, as in London and other places, will make the process much easier for both locals and visiting foreign guests once the metro starts. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[financial-inclusion-for-all]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you advanced in your approach to finance SMEs and entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>SMEs constitute the highest risk of all asset classes. They do not fit into a typical credit profile, and each has its own specific needs. Typically, this is why banks shy away from this asset class as their system and procedures are standardized and the exceptions too costly. Technology is at the forefront of AlRaedah's business model. AlRaedah invested in bringing an automated machine learning and AI platform into the fold (DataRobot) in 2017. The company is running more than 100 different models, assessing more than 78 data points on each client. This definitely is an advantage compared to our competitors' manual process, and allows us to identify patterns in the data in minutes. Notably, Alraedah Finance is 100% focused on SME financing, which is an advantage since we are embedded into the SME culture of the country. All the innovations and products we launch are directed toward SMEs, and 100% of our resources are focused on SMEs.</p><h4>To what extent do you still need to work with the banks?</h4><p>There will be a need to work with banks for the foreseeable future. Banks keep their distance from most SMEs. We use banks to provide some of the company's liquidity to fund our current SME portfolio. </p><h4>What is the basis of your collaboration with Monsha'at?</h4><p>Monsha'at has many initiatives to support SMEs and start-ups, and the speed and agility with which it has been able to bring these programs into existence are impressive. We are part of one of its programs, which is called the Indirect Lending (IDL) initiative. This program provides liquidity to 15 different financing companies to lend to existing SMEs in the market. There are restrictions on the sectors that are part of the program. The benefit that Alraedah Finance and the other participating companies in the program receive is lower cost of funding. In return for that benefit, there is a limit on the profit rate that we can charge SMEs, so the benefits are mutual. The risk of default remains with the companies, and therefore the qualification conditions are that of the companies that are participating in the program. The companies are obligated to repay the financing facility based on predetermined terms. The program has increased the options that SMEs can get financing through. The increased competition has made it a better environment for SMEs. We are excited to see the launch of other initiatives from Monsha'at in the future.</p><h4>What are the barriers for entrepreneurs to start a company?</h4><p>The country and the responsible ministries have made significant progress in a short amount of time to support those interested in starting their own business. We have also seen an increase in venture capital investments in the country and region. Equally important, a growing number of young people are opting to start businesses.</p><h4>What can be done to increase financial inclusion in the SME sector?</h4><p>Significant progress has been made in regard to financial inclusion for many different entities in both private and public sectors. In my opinion, specifically for SMEs, ability to get financing comes down to one thing: data. It has gotten better in the past few years with Ebsher, Bayan Credit, and SIMAH increasing the amount of data that is provided. However, the costs of these products to new entrants in the financing market are prohibitive. The next step is to get into the "open Banking" movement, which is a significant step toward financial inclusion. The amount of data that banks hold is tremendous and will open doors for entities to provide products that SMEs require. This will also increase competition among banks, further benefiting SMEs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Burhan Almarifa is a platform for information and knowledge transfer. Could you tell us more about the organization?</h4><p>Burhan Almarifa has two business pillars: transfer of knowledge and consultancy, the purpose of which is to develop initiatives and programs that will support and advance legal professionals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This will eventually promote specializations and expertise within the legal sector, whether in business law, intellectual property law, international humanitarian law, healthcare law, or environmental law, to name a few. One such initiative is SLC, which was inaugurated last year. We are also developing different training programs, publications, and digitalization projects for both the private and public sectors to promote cross-sector collaboration. This eventually extended to developing consultancy services that range from benchmarking and advising on regulations drafting to global strategic positioning of different initiatives. In order to fulfill our mission, we started establishing the “Burhan Network," which forms working partnerships with companies that are leaders in their fields both internationally and locally.</p><h4>What do you envision for SLC in the next 10 years?</h4><p>SLC positions itself as a platform for the transfer of knowledge from worldwide and national experts to our community on the key topics of the moment. The more important aspect of SLC, however, is the discussions that take place during the conference and recommendations that stem from those discussions. This is the first professional platform in the Kingdom that brings together policymakers, judges, lawyers, the private sector, and students to debate and discuss matters pertaining to their profession. In 10 years, I hope SLC is viewed internationally as the platform to gain knowledge on the legal trends of the year, that those discussions are led by Saudi experts, and that the recommendations SLC generates are substantive, practical, and effective to help develop the rule of law and truly elevate the legal profession, both nationally and internationally.</p><h4>Why are IP and fintech the themes of SLC 2019?</h4><p>The overarching theme of SLC is “Reinforcing a sustainable and inclusive business environment." With Saudi Arabia being party to a large number of IP international agreements and conventions, its obligations as a WTO member, the massive boom in new businesses and the influx of foreign investment into the Kingdom, protection of IP rights is a major topic of concern. Fintech, on the other hand, is a highly specialized, yet massively used, sector that is developing far quicker than the regulations that would regulate it, not just in the Kingdom, but internationally. Fintech is thought of as an independent sector, when in practice it touches upon almost every other sector. It is important to understand the issues that surround regulating this field, as we need to find the fine balance between too much regulation that may hinder future development and enough regulation to protect the consumer, whether individual, entity, or state.</p><h4>What do you seek to achieve via Burhan Almarifa's vision to “elevate the legal profession"?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is a distinctive market in terms of the rate at which the number of lawyers is growing, which gives us a competitive advantage of having a relatively large young working force that is technologically savvy and has the potential to be leaders and experts in their respective fields. Burhan Almarifa strongly advocates specializing within the field. We believe that transferring international expertise to our legal practitioners will in the long run ensure the effectiveness, efficiency, stability and development of the legal sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-different-era]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have digitization services affected banking services in the Kingdom, and how is Bank AlBilad positioning itself?</h4><p>Among the four things Bank AlBilad has been focusing on, first and foremost is digital transformation. Saudi Arabia is one the leading countries globally in terms of accessing information through technology, and the banking sector is at the forefront of this. As such, we have reorganized our resources internally to implement an agile model to accelerate the delivery of our products, helping us to better position ourselves in the market. We were one of the first banks to launch a digital bank account in the Middle East, and our clients are now authenticated through our integration with the Ministry of Interior portal. The digitialization of banking services has significantly changed the way people conduct business, with disruption coming from many different players, even small ones. We will look at different players in the market for integration that can add further value. Introducing technology is necessary to reduce costs and generate more margins, though customers should not feel left out. We had to really revamp our customer experience to increase our engagement with clients and make sure they are served in a professional, personalized, and prompt manner. We now have a 24/7 social media engagement team in addition to our traditional call center.</p><h4>What role can the banking sector play to increase access to affordable housing?</h4><p>Supporting the government's initiatives to increase home ownership is also one of our top priorities. We have launched nearly 20 products with the Ministry of Housing and Real Estate Development Fund. Different people have different risk profiles and needs, and we have been raising awareness on savings and financial management, which is still not at the required levels. As such, we have launched several products that will help the national savings initiative. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) has changed the way it looks at certain ratios in banks' balance sheets to support these efforts. For instance, deposits through long-term saving schemes are given higher weight, improving the loan-deposit ratio and giving banks some liquidity relief.</p><h4>How can Saudi Arabia position itself as a destination for international investors and funds, and how can the banking sector benefit from the opportunities being created?</h4><p>The scale and the number of reforms that have taken place in Saudi Arabia, along with the importance of implementing them, are significant. However, we will not see the benefits of these changes immediately, as some hurdles and interruptions could occur along the way. In light of the new economic agenda and reforms, rating agencies have confirmed the robustness of the Saudi economy. Notably, the government recently announced the highest budget in the history of Saudi Arabia. We are truly in a different era, and the new government projects and initiatives will spur demand for credit and foreign equity investments.</p><h4>What challenges do you expect to encounter, and what is your strategy to turn them into opportunities?</h4><p>The main challenge lies in the implementation, especially from a human resources point of view, because the huge number of initiatives and strict KPIs require skilled talent. Entities, private and public alike, will have to invest a great deal of time and money on training. Bank AlBilad has tripled its training budget for this purpose, placing human resources at the heart of its work.</p><h4>With Tadawul upgrading to MSCI status, how do you see the financial sector evolving?</h4><p>Some government initiatives will give corporations opportunities to move away from traditional banking relationships. One of the key government initiatives is fast tracking the establishment of a debt management office and the appointment of primary dealers, because without a government benchmark, the capital market will never develop. The government is also moving toward sharia-compliant securities and sukuk. We have also seen different forms of financing, and this will increase the diversity of capital, finance, and liquidity for companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pioneering-financial-services]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on SIJIL's main activities and the rationale behind its inception?</h4><p>The primary role of SIJIL with the support of SAMA and ecosystem stakeholders is to address most of the challenges in the financial leasing market by enhancing enforceability and ensuring transparency. The current mandate focuses on serving the financial leasing contracts across its lifecycle, from digitizing the contract registration to contract closure or enforcement in the event of default. The company will maintain records of the contract progress and reflect all amend-ments, enabling it to eventually provide a wide set on inquiry and analytical services to financial institutions. SIJIL was incepted to solve the issues and limitations in the financial leasing ecosystem such as the misuse of ownership rights, the lack of repossession policies and procedures, unclear enforcement mechanisms, and a lack of data and transparency.</p><h4>What companies and organizations do you tailor your financial lease registration services to, and what types of leased assets are the most common?</h4><p>SIJIL designed its services for all banks and fi¬nancing companies that provide financial leasing products. The most common products are vehi¬cles, representing more than 80% of existing con-tracts. We also focus on real estate as well as ma¬chinery, heavy equipment, medical equipment, and other assets.</p><h4>What are the main trends in the leasing market, and how does the Saudi market compare regionally?</h4><p>The Saudi leasing market is underpenetrated in comparison to its regional counterparts and ma-ture markets. Forecasted growth for the coming five years is 5%. In 2019 alone, the annual growth in residential loans exceeded 110%, where Ijarah real estate financing represented around 30% of total loans, which provided a conformation of the  market's potential to promptly recover and grow.</p><h4>Where does SIJIL fit into the plans to increase home ownership and make home financing more accessible?</h4><p>SIJIL is an enabler of the Housing Vision Realization Program. The services we provide con¬tribute to developing innovative housing finance products, giving lessors access to verifiable data to facilitate decision making in product develop¬ments. Furthermore, increasing the level of secu¬rity and assurance for the financial transactions will attract further investment. We will soon offer opportunities for securitization and transfer of rights in the local and international debt markets subject to regulatory approvals, which will help new market players like the Saudi Real Estate Re-finance Company (SRC) and other investors to expand their coverage.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and ambitions for the coming year?</h4><p>SIJIL aims to become a pioneer within the financial industry in the use of innovation and technology. SIJIL's strategy is in line with Vision 2030, National Trans¬formation Program (NTP), Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP), ISKAN program, and the challenges faced by the financial lease ecosystem. Our goal is to provide automated registry services that reduce human errors and the unwanted consequences. Also, SIJIL's services will help limit the flow of lawsuits to courts and allow asset repossession through a non-judicial approach, further reducing the burden on courts. All these will help debt collector companies, lessors, and refinancing companies save substantial amounts per asset repossession cycle. Moving forward, SIJIL will offer a set of unprecedented value-added services which will boost the financial leasing market and provide access to data and analytics about the market. We look forward to working closely with SAMA, the Ministry of Justice, financial institutions, and the wider ecosystem to realize this vision. In the end, we seek to become the source of information for general inquiries, reports, and financial analysis for the financial leasing market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[going-cashless]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Saudi Payments is a merger of SADAD and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency's (SAMA) General Department of Payment Systems. Could you tell us more about the organization's inception?</h4><p>Saudi Payments might be a new organization in its name and branding, but its legacy goes back to 1985, when SAMA was founded with the establishment of the banking technology department. This department focused on developing a shared payments infrastructure. SAMA's forward-looking vision for the need of a shared infrastructure was the impetus behind the center. The journey started in 1990 with the introduction of the national payment system, mada, formerly known as SPAN. In 1997, Saudi Arabia became one of the first countries to introduce electronic real-time gross settlement system (RTGS). In 2003, we introduced our electronic payment platform, SADAD, in addition to other smaller-sized projects in between. In 2018, Saudi Payments was established with the mandate to continue that legacy by developing a national payment infrastructure, serving banks and fintechs equally, and creating a level playing field. In short, we work on standardization, interoperability, and security, linking everyone and providing infrastructure. Other countries have similar setups, and global institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the G20 Committee have recognized that interoperability and shared infrastructure are the key enablers of fintech. Without these, the barriers for entry are simply too high; it would potentially lead to mega players coming in and eating up the entire market. Our main KPI is not revenue-based; rather it is based on increasing the number of cashless payments.</p><h4>What strategies do you have in place to achieve the vision of having a 70% cashless society by 2030?</h4><p>To grow from 20% to 70% in one decade is an ambitious objective. From our global benchmarking, even the UK is only about 50%, and it is fairly advanced in digital payments. The most advanced societies are Sweden and Norway. That said, with the financial infrastructure in place, together with high rates of technology adoption, paints a promising picture. The pick-up of near-field communication (NFC) payments in 2018 was phenomenal, reaching 40% of all contactless transactions. Within one year, we are close to reaching western European levels. In addition, mobile payment adoption is high compared to other countries, and it was only introduced in late 2018. There are still some missing pieces, like a faster payments platform. A faster payments platform is our next megaproject and should be up and running by 2020. The nature of this program will require large changes to banking systems; we will adopt ISO20022. People are moving away from the old SWIFT messaging standard to that new ISO standard. The new systems have proven to reduce cash transfers and unleash a wave of innovation for fintechs in the UK, Singapore, and US.</p><h4>How do you consider your role working with both banks and fintechs?</h4><p>This is challenging because banks have long regarded us as their main deliverer, which we still are. From a regulatory perspective, our objective is to serve everyone. Banks realize that the ecosystem is changing, and they are taking different approaches. Some have already established technology departments to find suitable fintech partners, either directly through capital investment or through partnership or extending bank services to those fintechs. Luckily, the pie is large, and there is room for all banks and fintechs with a customer-centered approach.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>We are focusing on achieving the Financial Sector Development Program targets set by SAMA and the Ministry of Finance. Aside from financial inclusion—which currently stands at 74% according to the World Bank—and the cashless transactions objectives, we are also working on an e-invoicing platform. Operationally, we aim to finalize the internal carve out from SAMA and be an independent organization. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you rebranded your organization, and how do you continue to offer your services?</h4><p>Najm has been around since 2007, doing accident reporting, insurance policy reconciliation, and serving as hub for the insurance industry. In March 2019, we unveiled a new corporate identity to change the community's perceptions, as we change the way we provide our services. Today, Najm is keen to become more customer focused and sales driven, rather than just being an actively operational organization. Najm's approach is aligned with Vision 2030 in regard to full automation, AI, IoT, and machine-to-machine communications. We have successfully accomplished the automation of all our services. We also want to have innovative solutions like “scenarios creation" for accidents, because we sometimes have trouble determining liability among the parties involved in an accident. Najm is on track to becoming a big data company and intends to use that to improve quality of life for people in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How do you envision using the data you collect for policy recommendations to improve road safety?</h4><p>Najm provides what we call “non-organic growth." Our new strategy goes through other agencies as well, making Najm similar to a critic bureau style. We try to estimate the insured's likelihood for risk, which helps insurance companies give the insured a no-claim discount based on the insured's track. This is a big boost for us, because we have helped many customers get lower rates. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) is the biggest driver behind Najm, in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior. It truly enables Najm, as we are the only organization providing such services. On another level, we are making fraud protection a priority and working to raise the awareness of fraud. We are also engaging in strategic links with the leader companies in IT market to utilize their solutions to improve road safety and increase efficiency. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your expectations for consolidation in the insurance landscape following the new regulations issued by SAMA?</h4><p>We hope to increase the depth of the insurance sector. Compared to other countries, the insurance sector in Saudi Arabia is smaller than it should be. At present, it makes up only 1.5% of GDP, while the global levels of this sector are much higher. We do not have an exact figure in mind, but we benchmark this with peer countries. Increased activity in the sector will ultimately better serve the Saudi economy. We strive for a broadening of insurance offerings, and our regulations are intended for that. Consolidation will also make the insurance industry stronger and ultimately better serve the Saudi economy. Thus far, four companies have approached us for a merger approval. One is at an advanced stage, while the others are still in the exploratory phase. Although we have issued more stringent regulations for companies operating in the insurance spheres, not all have responded to our suggestion of exploring possible mergers to strengthen their financial positions. Therefore, we are now considering raising the capital requirements for individual companies.</p><h4>What is your approach to combating insurance fraud, and what role can SAMA play?</h4><p>Insurance fraud is present in every country. The health and vehicle insurance activities are the most widespread, representing almost 85% of insurance fraud. We work with the insurance companies to combat this, hoping that we will strengthen coordination with law enforcement bodies to eliminate or mitigate such fraud. It ultimately weakens the sector's competitiveness, reduces sector confidence, and weakens the sector's credibility. That also means higher prices for customers.</p><h4>How many international banks have applied to SAMA to open branches in the Kingdom?</h4><p>We recently issued a license to a British bank. We have also provided our recommendation for another one, as well as to a foreign bank, as the final approval is issued by the King. We also have two requests for national banks, but these are still in the initial stages.</p><h4>What is your strategy to strengthen or stimulate the insurance sector?</h4><p>We are working on a financial sector development program to strengthen the insurance sector by increasing the number of insurance products. Compared to the much higher rates in many other countries, our production and saving programs are still weak. We need to promote awareness and the importance of saving and protection. We want to encourage people to take out insurance on properties, in particular.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about SAMA's approach to funding and capacity building, including the launch of a sandbox?</h4><p>The purpose of the sandbox is to strengthen the work on financial technologies, giving all business people, in particular small businesses, the chance to enter the financial services arena. We have many participants in this field. But, more importantly, the sandbox is a place to learn and exchange experiences for the academic, government and private sectors, and the business community. Some of them may soon graduate and become entrepreneurs in the financial services industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of cooperation between the private and public sectors?</h4><p>Since its foundation, Saudi Arabia has always believed in a free economy. The Saudi economy is still driven by oil, though the leadership is working hard to diversify it. However, this will take time, as the world is still, to a large extent, dependent on fossil fuels. Oil revenues have traditionally been reinjected into the country in the form of megaprojects, which in turn lift the rest of the economy. Moving forward, this has to include a step-by-step approach in order to build a more sustainable economy and develop our industries. In order to become a sustainable country, we need success stories based on mutual cooperation between the public and private sectors, such as King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC). Although KAEC is far from completion, it is a successful model of how to work out a effective public-private structure. At present, KAEC is home to more than 100 factories, and the port is set to become the real game-changer in the whole region.</p><h4>What role can small and medium enterprises play in the next economic cycles?</h4><p>SMEs hold the key to increasing employment rates across the Kingdom. The government has dedicated significant amounts of capital to SMEs, and the SME authority needs to look at the economy and segment it, placing every SME in a segment as part of the supply chain. We need a realistic assessment of how a large company can contribute compared to a small one and tailor solutions accordingly. Both the government and private sector must guide SMEs and help them with themed industrial clusters such as automotive or renewable energy and facilitate their outsourcing of accounting, HR, legal, and other services to specialized companies, allowing SMEs to focus on production. We want SMEs to be innovators and not turn into copycats. Specialization will ensure they do not lose out to bigger players.</p><h4>For international investors, where do the major opportunities for JVs and partnerships lie in the next five years?</h4><p>Transparency, streamlined regulations, and rule of law are three key aspects that attract international investors to a country. At present, any international investor can set up a company in three days online and engage in investment opportunities posted by the Saudi Arabian General Investments Authority (SAGIA). One needs to look realistically at the market to see whether it is convenient to start a venture from zero or invest in an international business, with the idea of bringing technology to Saudi Arabia. I can identify three main areas for investment: mining, education, and healthcare. Mining is an area of growth; education and training can build and hone the skills and capabilities of our Saudi youth; and investment in healthcare is required to increase the number of all sorts of healthcare providers. Tourism and entertainment are other areas that can lead to attractive returns in the long run.</p><h4>What role do you expect technology to play in the Saudi business landscape? </h4><p>Undoubtedly, technological innovation will continue to play an increasingly important role in all sectors. However, for the time being, technology's value lies in improving efficiencies. OMACO, for example, has installed sensors to achieve power savings. Energy has become more expensive because of the removal of electricity and fuel subsidies, so power savings is a crucial area that can witness some concrete improvements. Overall, technology is starting to be seen as a powerful tool to reduce energy wastage. For example, running a machine at full capacity is not efficient, and programmable controls like scanners can help regulate energy use. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your strategic priorities for the medium-term?</h4><p>SEDCO's strategic priorities for the medium-term, namely education, hospitality, and healthcare, are perfectly in line with Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program, which have provided a clear roadmap to transform the economy from being heavily dependent on government spending and oil to one based more on the private sector and less dependent on hydrocarbon. Habits are changing, and the young are much more equipped to take advantage of this. Since Saudi Arabia has a rather young population, we expect this transformation to move at a faster pace. The whole market will witness different speeds and different needs. </p><h4>What business opportunities does the hospitality sector offer? </h4><p>One of the main pillars of Vision 2030 is to grow the number of Umrah and Hajj pilgrims from 8 to 30 million by 2030. There are a number of initiatives in this regard, and we have picked up where we see exciting trends and businesses we can build on. Hajj and Umrah services, hospitality, and F&amp;B cater to the same offering. At the same time, non-religious tourism is an area that is becoming increasingly exciting and with promising growth potential. The example set by Al-Ula city showcases the potential this country has to offer. Abha and the Assir region, with their beautiful nature, nice weather, and multiple topographies, are two areas with immense potential.</p><h4>How can Saudi Arabia's economy strike a balance between the growth of SMEs and its consolidation across different sectors?</h4><p>There is significant focus on SMEs, and, although the market usually creates its own balance, it is our duty to prepare youth for the future. In order to do so, we need to identify what the opportunities are, simplify them, and give training and budgets to address them. This way, young entrepreneurs can start their own businesses, while bigger groups monitor them until they can take off. Monsha'at and other government agencies have been developing strong programs to facilitate and fund SMEs; however, it would be great if a bureau was set up to help entrepreneurs use these programs.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the price adjustment witnessed by the real estate market in Saudi Arabia in recent years?</h4><p>Even if prices have been rightly reduced, the Saudi real estate sector offers opportunities. In the long term, it is important to create affordability and sustainability for families and individuals by setting realistic prices. Once the market really stabilizes, it will flourish, and a new balance will be created. In the past, it used to be about a big piece of land and a big house, but now the conversation is more about convenience, practicality, affordability, and sustainability.</p><h4>What major opportunities lie within the different financial asset classes?</h4><p>As a sharia-compliant investment group, we are in multiple asset classes: listed equities, private equity, sukuks, and real estate. We avoid projects and companies that adopt excessive leverage, as we want the financing to be structured in a way that builds long-term businesses. Already there is a lot of excitement about the upgrade of Tadawul, and since the beginning of the year, SAR6 billion has been invested into the market. More investments will follow with the inclusion process, especially from passive emerging market funds; the Saudi market will ultimately represent 2.4% of the assets in the emerging market index.</p><h4>What is your approach with regards to the healthcare sector?</h4><p>SEDCO Holding is active in the pharmaceutical sector and is one of the major shareholders in one of the leading hospital chains in Egypt. We are also looking to get involved in rehabilitation centers, specialized centers, and primary and secondary care.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[adapt-and-grow]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your analysis of the significance of Vision 2030 for the economy? </h4><p>Vision 2030 will bring major changes across the whole economic spectrum, from how businesses will be conducted to how the government will be run, and even to how international investors will look at the country. This shift has concrete and impactful consequences, as we are starting to see a more modern and dynamic economy that is also able to look at the challenges it meets on its way and deal with them. Within this push for modernization, the government is adopting an even-more proactive stance compared to the private sector, while at the same time laying the foundations for a long-term perspective. </p><h4>What does this mean for family businesses in Saudi Arabia, and where do you see the greatest potential?</h4><p>Family businesses are faced with unique challenges and need to adapt. Some sectors will no longer exist while others will gain importance. As such, government programs and global trends are the key to remaining profitable and competitive. One of the main programs is the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program (NIDLP), which will allow the country to capture the opportunity and synergies between some of the most important sectors, such as energy mining, industry, and logistics, and tap its potential.</p><h4>What does this economic transition mean for Alkhorayef and ARASCO? </h4><p>This atmosphere is helping companies like Alkhorayef and ARASCO to see the future in a more visible way. Alkhorayef is a 62-year-old company; we started in agriculture and moved to other sectors gradually. Our first phase was agriculture, the second was diversification, the third is to focus, and the fourth and current phase consists of looking for investments. That is why we decided to have a separate company for operating businesses, while always trying to look at the business from a family point of view, which is why we are focusing on ARASCO as an investment. We see potential in the tourism, entertainment, healthcare, education, and infrastructure sectors. Our existing businesses are aligned with what is going on in the country's oil, water, energy, and industrial spaces. We are in the right place at the right time; we just need to make sure we are addressing the market in the right way with the right products. ARASCO's growth is due to its ability to address the changing needs of the economy. ARASCO has always worked hard to build a sustainable model for food security with animal feed, its main product, poultry feed, and other food products. For the last four to five years, we have invested about SAR2 billion in different projects in the manufacturing and logistics sectors. The next step will probably be setting up an independent logistics arm; we have great potential in the logistics sector, and with the announcement of NIDLP, we are ready to capture the opportunity and add value across the whole supply-chain. </p><h4>What role does technology play in maintaining competitiveness?</h4><p>It is safe to say that Saudis are among the most avid users of all the latest technologies. New laws and regulations—in the spirit of these modern times—are propelling people to automatize more extensively. Cheap labor used to compete with automation, but labor is getting more and more expensive. The clients are always asking for automation, too, and the Saudi government has put in place very encouraging policies to increase investment in new technologies, especially in the manufacturing sector. At Alkhorayef, we are investing heavily in automation and smart business solutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize AECOM's operations in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>AECOM is a global business with a local presence, which is our defining characteristic. We have centers of excellence around the world that focus on various parts of infrastructure. AECOM employs 87,000 people worldwide, allowing it to cover significant ground. In Saudi Arabia, we deal primarily with large infrastructure projects. One of the transformational projects we have delivered is the Jeddah Storm Water Drainage Program. This project enabled us to showcase our large project delivery capabilities and demonstrate our commitment to the Kingdom. Currently, we are delivering transformative projects related to project management organizations for various Saudi ministries, overarching management and front-end services for the megacities, and supporting the aviation industry to prepare for explosive growth in passenger numbers. We are also leading the digital transformation charge within the country. Some of that work is being performed on projects in the holy sites with an emphasis on enhancing the experience in transportation mobility, urban planning, and urban economics. Within AECOM, we have a high-level corporate commitment to Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, we have a truly diverse employee base and are committed to creating as many opportunities as possible for Saudi's young talent. We strongly advocate for an increase in female participation in the workforce and have signed an agreement with Princess Nourah University to recruit more female Saudi engineering graduates.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia has announced a range of megaprojects. How is AECOM involved in these?</h4><p>There are so many projects that it is impossible to be involved in all of them, so we must be selective. We are already involved in some capacity in most of the announced megaprojects, be it through the delivery of environmental impact assessments, master plans, or project management. These projects are moving on accelerated schedules, requiring us to be constantly flexible and innovative to meet our clients' demands.</p><h4>How can AECOM play a role in Saudi Arabia's digital transformation?</h4><p>At AECOM, we place a huge value on innovation, and this emphasis differentiates us. We are not in the engineering commodity business but in the thought leadership and delivery excellence business. In Saudi Arabia, we focus a great deal on innovative techniques and methods for the early phases of projects. We deploy 5D modeling, AR and VR tools, digitally enabled and 5G-ready infrastructure, and cybersecurity solutions. We are also pioneering AECOM's 3D-printed housing concepts. We are a leader in environmentally responsible and sustainable urban planning and resilient infrastructure solutions. Many of the areas being developed are greenfield sites, meaning they aren't encumbered by the usual constraints that cities typically face. We have a blank slate, and we can do everything right from the outset. We can build future-proof infrastructure that meets the demands of Saudi's young and growing population.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for the coming years?</h4><p>AECOM is essentially an infrastructure consultancy. Whatever one can imagine to be part of the broader forms of infrastructure, we are engaged in. We are doing front-end design and detailed design, as well as providing consultancy services while also being engaged in operations and maintenance. The future of the AECOM business in Saudi Arabia can be broadly described as supporting the project set-up phase. This encompasses front-end studies, process design, and master planning. To meet the demands and schedules of Vision 2030, we will also need to get ready for the detailed engineering and construction phases. Saudi's ambitious growth plans are challenging the engineering and construction industry, particularly in terms of the talent required to support large-scale project delivery. To that end, we are developing a generation of young Saudi professionals who can support their country's efforts to build for the future. We are treated as partners within the country, meaning we must deliver a model for a sustainable and professional workforce. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major changes in the way the government interacts with the private sector?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia's rapid changes have impacted companies operating in the Kingdom down to the employee level. Human resource departments have had to rapidly adapt to implement these changes. There have been updates to many regulations, including Saudization, the National Labor Gateway (Taqat), General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI), and block visas, in recent years. Although there are challenges, many of these changes have had a positive impact. The introduction of e-services in the Kingdom has made government services more efficient by reducing delays as a result of manual processing. Some of the recently introduced e-services include employee contract registrations, e-approval of sick leave, and a profession amendment e-service. E-services and online portals store data that companies need, such as contracts, employee data, and wages, giving them access to more reliable, transparent, and accurate information and increasing trust between the private sector and the government. Moreover, governmental updates to improve the business environment for foreign investors in the Kingdom make it increasingly easy for companies to operate here.</p><h4>How have you advanced in business process outsourcing and shared services, and how would you evaluate the uptake of digitalization in public services?</h4><p>The market leaders of today understand the need for a fully integrated organization that can seamlessly connect with customers, suppliers, and multi-site company locations worldwide. Along with the private sector, governments are also looking to increase operational productivity as they look for ways to improve services and reduce overhead. Shared services are becoming an essential factor for businesses spanning multiple locations. By centralizing administrative functions, companies can see significant cost savings, greater flexibility, and the standardization of processes; however, many organizations struggle to fully embrace it as a delivery model and are not able to maximize the returns on their investments. Proven provides operational consultation, outsourcing capabilities, and cost management support in order to enhance clients' market competitiveness through quality, productivity, and improved operational facilities. We operate as trusted business consultants and provide our clients with an objective assessment of their requirements, our recommendations, and bespoke solutions to help them reach their goals. </p><h4>What primary services do you provide to clients?</h4><p>Proven SA provides business support solutions to clients in four main areas: corporate immigration, business process outsourcing, business process management, and process automation. We provide a full spectrum of solutions supporting both local and foreign businesses to navigate the Saudi market in the above areas. In the past 10 years, we have built an extensive knowledge base, and our team of consultants strives to stay on top of the ever-changing local regulatory environment. We enable our clients to focus on their core competencies, while Proven takes care of non-core functions. </p><h4>What are your key recommendations for companies interested in setting up operations in the Kingdom?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is the single-biggest market in the GCC. There are strong and vibrant sectors opening up that offer immense potential. Any company wanting to diversify its income portfolio from the MENA region needs to conduct a serious feasibility exercise into the Saudi market. Having the right information regarding the market, processes, and regulations is critical. Solid local partners and on-the-ground research are also essential. Our advice is to ensure companies filter through the noise and really analyze their respective sectors thoroughly.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the coming years?</h4><p>Proven SA seeks to increase local solutions geared specifically to the requirements of clients. We look to scale up our service delivery capacity in a manner that allows us to maintain high levels of quality whilst also increasing the number of companies we can support. In addition, we look to attract offshore businesses to do business in Saudi. Our aim is to continue to bridge the gap between local supply and client demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the main mandate and activities of PPA?</h4><p><span></span><strong>M</strong><strong>AJED H. AL SAADI </strong>Since its formation, PPO has been able to stimulate the private sector by facilitating the implementation of 18 strategic projects that have a substantial socioeconomic impact and are expected to play a major role in stimulating the national economy. The contribution of these projects during the 2018-2023 period may reach SAR26 billion in investment, leading to the creation of around 10,000 temporary jobs and 7,000 direct, sustainable jobs. We forecast this to boost Saudi exports and reduce our dependence on imports. Equally important, foreign investors will bring with them technology and know-how, lifting the local industry and supporting strategic sectors. PPO operates in a fast-paced environment; our team receives, evaluates, and resolves cases within a timely manner. We complement all governmental entities, meaning we do not attract investment or issue licenses. We look at issues and consider the most appropriate way to present them to the public sector so that they can be resolved in the most effective and efficient manner. We have made a name for ourselves by helping the government solve landmark cases involving multiple ministries. We work hand-in-hand with investors to resolve their major issues.</p><h4>What role do the economic cities play in Saudi Arabia's transformation?</h4><p><span></span><strong>IMAD HASHEM</strong> When the project was announced in 2005, the economic cities were meant to contribute to the acceleration of the socioeconomic development of Saudi Arabia by attracting investment, creating jobs, and improving the quality of life and business standards. Moreover, diversifying the economy and establishing strategic cluster sectors are at the center of the economic cities plan, especially in the development of the Kingdom as a key global logistics hub. The government is clear about pushing, supporting, and further developing economic cities and special economic zones, and this is visible through the announcement of new megaprojects. The size and structure of such projects are different, but these are well defined zones that will enjoy specific regulatory or financial advantages compared to the base economy. </p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and ambitions, and what is your message to global investors?</h4><p><span></span>MHAS Within a short time, we have gained the maturity that gave us a view of what needs to be done to support the private sector. We consider ourselves a trusted entity that can advise other public-sector entities on the necessary adjustments or new regulations covering certain areas, for example in the digital sphere. In the coming years, the public and private sectors will collaborate on several megaprojects; this is where we come in at the forefront to provide concierge services. We seek to assure foreign and international companies that with Vision 2030, everyone will get the treatment they should and deserve, and there is a team of experts serving investors to remove obstacles so they can proceed with their investments. By listening to more problems, we will be able to find more great solutions.</p><h4>Why should investors invest in King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC)?</h4><p><span></span>IH KAEC is a mega, well-equipped platform that serves the local Saudi market and neighboring countries. King Abdullah Port, the second-largest in Saudi Arabia and one of the fastest-growing ports in the world, the Haramain High-Speed Railway station, and the wide highways network form the core of the project's value proposition. Moreover, educational institutions such as Prince Mohammad Bin Salman College, Tayaran, and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology complement the value proposition by building of a diversified pool of human capital. Notably, KAEC has established infrastructure as a result of SAR42 billion in investments from the private sector. Everything one needs to establish a business or factory is here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major highlights in the past year, and what will be the strategic focus of the PPA for 2019?</h4><p>2018's main highlight was the establishment of a new entity, Al Raidah, focused on the real estate sector. The new team is working on an aggressive strategy, seeking partnerships with international property management companies. There are 7,000 units ready for rent in the central, western, and eastern regions, along with 2,500 units scheduled for completion in 1Q2019. In Jeddah, we have around 74 buildings that will be released gradually by contractors in 4Q2019. Our focus for 2019 will be register returns on investment to capitalize on the set of initiatives undertaken in the past year. Indeed, we recently restructured and engineered the whole company with new asset allocation, and our efforts have been recognized by the international security organization in Geneva with two awards. So far, we have achieved 90% of our objectives in terms of investments, as witnessed by the 10 KPIs we recently released, with another 10 ready to be released as well. From a technology and services point of view, we have achieved 60% of our targets, and by the end of 2019 we will implement 80-85% of our overall strategy. </p><h4>How are you restructuring the work done for the government?</h4><p>Undoubtedly, in 2018 we saw a great deal of progress. At present, we have many development programs, such as the association program with the Institute of Public Administration (IPA) through which we have hired and trained more than 50 female workers for a wide variety of jobs that require high skills, such as law, finance, and technology. We are also proud of managing IDC, which we have been working on for the past four to five years. We also opened the Crown Plaza Hotel in Al Raidah Digital City, whose rooms are fully occupied.</p><h4>What trends have you observed in Saudi Arabia's economy, and what do you foresee for 2019?</h4><p>PPA has a great opportunity to become one of the main investors in PPPs. We hope the government will come up with more PPPs over the years so we can bid and win some of them. We are interested in utility companies and the evolutions they are undergoing, as it is an area of focus. In the healthcare sector, we are looking to build a medical city in Jeddah through Al Raidah, which is currently reviewing the proposals that we are looking at. Modern government projects increase investors' appetite, both foreign and local. This market has a great future with the inclusion of more entrants in the capital markets, whether through an active or passive approach, and for 2019, we foresee many changes when it comes to the size and shape of capital investments. We are the biggest pension agency in the region, and we look forward to where the country is going. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will digitization play in growing the SME segment's contribution to the Saudi economy?</h4><p>Digitalization is an increasingly important aspect that has gained even greater relevance as a trend, acting as a disruptive force across different sectors of the economy. Take the retail segment, for example, where e-commerce has brought major changes, revolutionizing interactions with clients and, more generally, the way business is conducted. Even the concept of asset-ownership has witnessed a meaningful change. Uber is a successful example of a leader in the car-sharing logistics segment without owning transport vehicles; in a similar way, Airbnb has disrupted the hospitality segment without owning any property. These stories tell us digital is already there, impacting business models and setting new trends even in Saudi Arabia. As such, SMEs need to ensure they remain ahead of the innovation curve and fully exploit the various competitive advantages of the digital economy.</p><h4>What are Monsha'at's strategic priorities and expectations for 2019, and what is the main driver behind them?</h4><p>Looking at the SME ecosystem in Saudi Arabia, we are in the early stages, especially when looking at the development of entrepreneurship. Indeed, we recently started to set up the necessary infrastructure conducive to a sustainable environment and to meeting the goals set by Saudi Vision 2030. As such, we need to look at the broader spectrum and implement and support programs and projects aimed at developing and growing SMEs within their different stages and requirements. On the venture capital side, we launched a SAR2.8-billion government VC fund targeting start-ups, aiming at bridging the investment gap and spurring more SME investments. When it comes to business enablement, we have created and supported through official licenses, a series of hubs, and co-working spaces to nurture young companies and provide them with the right environment. Finally, we have announced many accelerators to ensure start-ups grow organically into businesses that provide the right type of services to the market. </p><h4>How can the government increase the attractiveness of entrepreneurship in the eyes of young Saudi nationals?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia's start-up environment is in its nascent phase, with many different young companies in their early phase being led by young entrepreneurs. As such, the whole country is heavily reliant on the success of these business propositions and young minds, which is why we need to provide all the necessary support to make them succeed. Naturally, this will also have to come through a certain proposition of incentives, which is why we recognize the best start-ups with appropriate awards. This initiative provides the entire ecosystem with positive, healthy competition and seeks to spur all players to progress in their endeavors despite the natural challenges that they will encounter along the way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When SAIP was established, patents, trademarks, copyrights, and industrial design came together under one organization. Could you tell us more about the process of bringing these IP responsibilities together?</h4><p>IP is a key factor for the future development of Saudi Arabia's economy, and Vision 2030 stipulates targets that are directly enabled by IP. In line with this, Council of Ministers Resolution 410 set forth new governance for IP in the Kingdom in the shape of SAIP. IP is internationally regulated by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which leads the growth of a balanced and effective international IP system that promotes innovation and creativity for the benefit of its member states. The IP system, however, differs from country to country. Saudi Arabia decided to bring all IP fields under one unified authority, and SAIP was established as one of the initiatives of the trade and investment ecosystem to facilitate business, support the national economy, encourage investment, and boost the Kingdom's ranking on the World Competitiveness Index. Bringing these IP responsibilities together helps us to see the whole picture, making it easier to revise and draft laws and regulations.</p><h4>What approach should companies or individuals wanting to register IP take?</h4><p><span></span>IP assets play a growing role as the importance of a knowledge-based economy develops in Saudi Arabia. Companies or individuals wanting to register their IP should first identify which type of IPs they have. In this context, SAIP launched “What is your IP?" an electronic tool at the SAIP Website (saip.gov.sa) that helps applicants identify the type of their IP. In the current situation, we have an electronic platform for filing patent applications. All the processes of a patent filing are electronic; Saudi Arabia is among the first countries that started to file patents electronically. Our first initiative is to revise all our processes to increase efficiency. The second initiative is to translate all these processes into an IT system that is not off the shelf. The third initiative is to ensure we have the proper infrastructure to implement all these processes. Currently, 75% of our services are done electronically, and we are working hard to convert the other 25%.</p><h4>Can you walk us through your international affiliations?</h4><p>Our vision is to be a hub in the MENA region, and to do this we extended our collaboration with international affiliates. We have signed an agreement with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), and Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO). We have started collaborating with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore and have an agreement with the European Patent Office. Those agreements are focused on the exchange of expertise and capacity building, which is crucial to become an excellent IP office or authority. Second is the exchange of data, and while there is a fast track of patent offices, we seek to sign Patent Prosecution Highway agreements with those offices to exchange our examination reports, which will increase the speed of finalizing patents and reduce the backlog in our office. Third is to share our policies and guidelines with other international offices in order to align with international best practices. </p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for the coming years?</h4><p>The short-term target is to revise our national laws and policies and work toward standardization. The second target is to increase the number of international treaties related to IP treaties joined by Saudi Arabia from six to 13 in 2020. The third target is to prepare an IP national strategy and set implementation plans and timeline in coordination with related entities. Lastly, we seek to move on with e-services in all our activities and set a strategy for backlog applications.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>NIDLP was established with a wide-ranging mandate to attract USD453 billion in FDI by 2030. Can you further detail your mandate and main strategies? </h4><p>NIDLP seeks to transform Saudi Arabia into a leading industrial powerhouse and a global logistics hub in promising growth sectors with a focus on Industry 4.0. There are 34 governmental entities working together with NIDLP to implement more than 300 initiatives. We also seek to improve the competitive environment by providing the necessary enablers such as better policies and regulations, financial enablement, infrastructure and industrial land development, special economic zones, R&amp;D support, and export development. NIDLP also aims to leverage the country's unexploited natural resources, which are estimated at around USD1.33 trillion, take advantage of demand in the region to stimulate new industries, and transform the economy into a model based on PPPs. When we designed our initiatives and strategies, we took into consideration the geographic diversity and human and natural resources distribution of the country to make our program an effective tool in field planning and ensuring balanced development between the different regions. </p><h4>NIDLP has four priority sectors: industry, mining, energy, and logistics. Can you elaborate on the rationale behind the selection of these industries?</h4><p>NIDLP aims to achieve inclusive development of the industrial sector, including developing promising and competitive industries and increasing their share of GDP and the job market. In terms of mining, NIDLP aims to develop the sector and increase its contribution to the national economy. The program covers all stages of the value chain, from exploration to mining and intermediate industries. Saudi Arabia has well over USD1.3 trillion of untapped potential that can be activated with USD120 billion of investment in the mining value chain. In the energy sector, NIDLP aims to enhance power supplies and prices, with the ultimate objective being achieving fiscal balance while maintaining the Saudi economy's competitiveness and improving the competitiveness of the electricity sector through restructuring and exploring power exportation opportunities. In addition, we aim to increase the share of renewable energy. For logistics, NIDLP seeks to position the Kingdom as a global logistics hub, focusing on three key components: creating an export platform, developing a regional distribution platform, and establishing an efficient internal distribution network to enable industry and service supply chains. All those components aim to improve infrastructure, transport networks, and logistics standards in order to develop freight and passenger services, turning KSA into an international logistics hub capable of leveraging its geographical location. Our plan to improve our transportation and logistics infrastructure is backed by USD35 billion in investments. Overall, by 2030, NIDLP targets to add some USD453 billion in private-sector investment, contribute USD320 billion to GDP, add 1.6 million new jobs, and generate USD266 billion growth in exports and re-exports.</p><h4>How do you envision moving toward Industry 4.0?</h4><p>To accelerate the adoption of Industry 4.0 in the manufacturing sector, a comprehensive program has been launched with a total capital of around USD1.4 billion. The program covers different initiatives, including building the enabling network and connectivity, establishing capability centers for Industry 4.0, funding and developing factories to become model factories for Industry 4.0, and supporting R&amp;D and entrepreneurship in Industry 4.0 technologies. Our strategy is based on six pillars: providing financial incentives to support and encourage investors to adopt Industry 4.0; allocating a funding program of approximately USD800 million to accelerate the adoption of Industry 4.0; establishing Industry 4.0 capacity centers that will hold training and capacity development and collaborating with universities and colleges to standardize expertise and the transfer of knowledge; promoting education and training the local workforce with advanced skills; conducting awareness campaigns for all sectors of NIDLP; and providing a new legal framework, appropriate infrastructure, and adequate standards for cybersecurity and other axes to ensure the stability and continuity of the transformation toward Industry 4.0. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Riyadh's role in guiding urban development in the Kingdom? </h4><p>Vision 2030 formulated a broad range of objectives, improvements, and projects to increase the standard of living in Saudi Arabia. Riyadh, as the capital, is a fundamental part of this vision. Within the chamber of commerce, there are 170,000 registered commercial entities; we provide them with information, contacts, and other support services, as well as the opportunity to participate in our various committee meetings. It is important that our members voice their concerns and challenges so we can improve the business environment together. Riyadh is currently under a visibly rapid transformation. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been focused on transforming Saudi Arabia in the next 20 years. In the next five, the economy and many aspects of life in the Kingdom will fundamentally change. The cabinet and other government entities are changing their way of working, and there are clear KPIs now. The pace of transformation reminds me of a marathon, and it is exciting to see people coming together and working together to achieve great things. With such a commitment, we will truly see improvements over the coming five to 10 years.</p><h4>There are major developments in the field of entertainment, culture, and sports. Do you foresee economic growth potential in this trend?</h4><p>In the entertainment industry, we are starting from scratch, as it was largely absent in the Kingdom to date. There is huge potential to build this industry and, as a government, provide opportunities for the private sector to start new businesses. The Riyadh Chamber welcomes this new development, and it is establishing a dedicated entertainment committee to monitor these developments and provide a platform for industry players to discuss how we can improve the investment climate. Sport is another major sector, albeit not entirely new. Football has always been popular in the Kingdom, as well as other sports. The difference is that we are now seeing new sports, such as racing, gaining popularity. In December 2018, we held the Formula E race in historic Diriyah; there are also other racing classes in the Kingdom. These are great developments as they give us the unique opportunity to put Riyadh on the international map, while presenting new opportunities to the local business community.</p><h4>How is the chamber assisting industrial companies to move up the value chain as part of Vision 2030?</h4><p>Supporting traditional industries is still one of the core activities of the Riyadh chamber, and we have a well-established network of committees and subject matter experts to build expertise and industry dialogue. Moving up the value chain is an important objective, especially for local manufacturing industries. It will reduce import dependency and increase export capacity. Another key objective of the Riyadh chamber is supporting SMEs; these are the true engines of jobs in the Kingdom, and this segment of the market is only set to grow even further. Around 70% of the Saudi population is under 30 years old, and many recent graduates are choosing jobs outside the public sector and traditional industries. We have internal committees as well as strong partnerships with various ministries and other organizations that underline SME growth.</p><h4>What is your message to foreign investors, and why is Riyadh a destination for investment and partnerships?</h4><p>In Riyadh, there is an active government working hard to assist investors. The majority of Riyadh's 7.5-million population is young, which means there is a strong market for a broad range of products and services. The leisure and hospitality industries are currently in exponential growth, for example. The financial infrastructure is extremely advanced, and there are many banks and financial institutions to team up with. Riyadh is an active city for businesses and has a number of real estate development projects underway; there is no market saturation in sight.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In your current role, how are you able to drive the agenda of sustainable development and promote female leadership?</h4><p>When I joined the Permanent Delegation of Saudi Arabia to the UN, the UN 2030 Agenda was still being negotiated, so I participated in the negotiations on behalf of Saudi Arabia. The focus of the UN 2030 Agenda is to address the root causes of poverty and eliminate it by 2030. The UN 2030 Agenda has three dimensions—social, economic, and environmental—and these are all interconnected, because one cannot address one without addressing the others. We have formulated 17 goals, and number five is about gender equality. Each goal has a specific set of targets, and these have a specific set of indicators or KPIs to determine what we have actually achieved. If we want to thrive as a people and a planet by 2030, we should all work together to do the best that we can.</p><h4>How do you assess the changes in Saudi Arabia in recent years when it comes to your agenda, and what are your main advocacy points in terms of more female leadership and equality?</h4><p>Allowing women to drive was definitively something that had to happen, because there is no way we could have grown as a nation and as people with half of society marginalized and not even being able to drive. Allowing women to drive and securing safer public transportation boosts the economy and allows women to take control of their lives and contribute as full members of society. A great deal of work has been done in terms of providing job opportunities for women in Saudi. Under Vision 2030, 450,000 jobs have been created for women, and female labor force participation has increased from 12% in 2009 to 80% in 2017. One thing I would like to see change—not only in Saudi Arabia but everywhere else in the world—is meaningful employment for women. Most women end up working in low-skilled jobs that do not have a career path. In terms of policy, there has to be a focus on equal opportunities for both men and women. Whatever is perceived as traditional jobs for men or women is being questioned because in Saudi Arabia there are more women with higher education than men. This says a great deal about the jobs they would like to end up pursuing. Therefore, investing in women's career development and providing the necessary training and equal job opportunities for them to also have a career is important.</p><h4>What would be your message to young female graduates entering the labor market?</h4><p>First, because of the family structure in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East in general, the male leader of the house usually provides for everyone. Most of the time, men and women start seeking job opportunities after they graduate. However, I would suggest getting the necessary skills even before graduating because this will help them understand the labor market and its needs and the career path they might want to choose or switch to. Second, my message to women is to not be afraid to communicate your needs. Many times, women are afraid to say they are not feeling well. In North America, some companies offer mental health days, so you can ask for a day off simply because you are tired or need a break. I also notice in my work environment that women take on dead-end tasks, such as getting the coffee, typing, or writing emails without necessarily doing anything that can intellectually contribute to the job or the conversation. My message would be to not be afraid to say no and be choosy about your career path and what you want from your work. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk us through the evolution of the Future Institute of Higher Education and Training since it was founded?</h4><p>Since its foundation in 1991, this institute has constantly played a crucial role in empowering young Saudis, constantly expanding in terms of geographical presence, clients' profile, courses offering and accreditation. Our dual goal is to increase the employment rate among skilled Saudis and ensure a higher rate of competent and qualified Saudis enter the workforce. In order to achieve these objectives, the institute had to undergo a constant process of innovation to adapt to a dynamic, changing business environment, especially since the announcement of Vision 2030. The changes and progress within the organization are clear. From being a center, it became an institute offering recognized diplomas; from offering courses just in Jeddah, we are now present in other cities such as Riyadh and Medina; from training only women, it now trains both female and male workers; from being known for its training in creative development, it now offers courses in over 65 different areas; and from being mainly focused on B2C channels, it is establishing a more thorough B2B avenue that offers over 50 programs for companies within different sectors can benefit from. The institute never stopped advancing and improving to raise the standards of the broader education segment of the country.</p><h4>What helped the institute to remain active and adjust to the rapid changes in the education and work environment?</h4><p>Over its 28-year history, the Future Institute has become so much more than an education facility, developing into a vital tool for helping women enter a wide range of the country's workforce. We have pioneered courses for women in a range of areas, recognizing and forecasting areas in which women would soon be permitted to work. This foresight has enabled Future to grow into the market leader for educating women. <br></p><h4>What assessment methods does the institute provide?</h4><p>For our B2C segment, we have a benchmark that serves as a general standard, but we work with people in a hands-on way in order to ensure their personal development. At times, different candidates need different instructions based on what you are trying to teach and depending on their learning styles. Our main body of students are working professionals or entrepreneurs, but we do have some university students who come here to complement their knowledge, so clearly there has to be a specialized approach to each one of them. With regard to our B2B channel, we work closely with companies to understand what exactly their employees need to have learned at the end of the course. </p><h4>Looking at the medium term, what are your strategic priorities, and how do you seek to achieve them?</h4><p>Our strategy remains focused on expanding regardless of the status of the economy. The country will always need qualified workforce, and our duty is to maintain a constant supply of skilled candidates. As such, we are trying to break into the B2G training space, an area traditionally difficult to gain a foothold in. I have worked with the Ministry of Education in the past, but even if you have developed a relationship with various ministries, there is a tendency in the government to hire people from abroad. This is an pattern that we would like to change, since there is a great deal of potential in our local training firms. We need to see the government tap into these local resources more. On the industry side, hospitality is an area we are interested in, because of its size and growth projections. As such, we are planning to add professional hospitality training to our offerings.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do the changes to regulations in the Saudi insurance industry mean for the overall sector?</h4><p>The government promotes the insurance industry to keep the financial sector in general and the insurance sector in particular healthy and ensure sustainable, profitable conditions. These strategic efforts, driven by Vision 2030, aim to increase the sector's overall contribution to GDP. Government regulators are laying down proper operating conditions and infrastructure for insurance companies while promoting customer-centric principles that bring sustainable protection for citizens. As insurance companies, we must encourage more product diversification and awareness in support of the same purpose. The regulator wants to see increased levels of customer satisfaction and efficient settlement of claims as these will contribute to boosting confidence in the sector. Is the sector bound to witness more mergers and acquisitions or is it a premature trend given the low penetration? "Horizontal mergers" help newly constituted firms increase their economies of scale, thus better positioning the organization's ability to cover insurance risks. These merged insurance entities will have a larger combined portfolio with increased capabilities to handle and sustain varied products, and their market share will increase as a result. Hence, mergers will serve the economic goals that both regulators and the government hope to achieve.</p><h4>How has UCA's risk appetite evolved in the last few years, and how does this evolution reflect the trends in the local insurance market?</h4><p>Supported by the government's regulations and the enactment of compulsory medical and motor insurance, the market has expanded exponentially. According to the regulator, the measures implemented to date have resulted in excellent growth rates. The sector's volume has increased from SAR5 billion to around SAR36 billion, and the number of people employed in the insurance sector has increased from 5,000 to 11,000. Moreover, the nation's promising macroeconomic environment has helped enhance the maturity and technical capabilities of participating firms. UCA's risk appetite has further evolved to better insure risks with higher capacity due to its demonstrated lengthy experience in engineering and motor TPL products, as well as its extensive partnership with expert reinsurers in the last 40 years.</p><h4>To what extent is Saudi Arabia a price-driven market, and what is the key to increasing the insurance penetration rate?</h4><p>The Saudi insurance sector is price driven at this stage. Unfortunately, there is a knock-on effect in response to insurance products being defined as compulsory. In such a situation, insurance companies tend to pay less attention to awareness and marketing as well as diversifying and differentiating their products and services from those offered by their competitors. Consequently, consumers start focusing on price as a key differentiator. However, clients today now place greater value on service delivery as awareness levels increase. Insurance companies have a great responsibility to diversify and differentiate their products by re-thinking their marketing activities.</p><h4>To what extent can Vision 2030 support the growth of relatively subdued insurance lines?</h4><p>Vision 2030's ambitious goals are promising for the insurance industry, as they aim to stimulate investment in previously nonexistent new sectors, entertainment being a prime example. The challenge is for insurance companies to embark on a transformation program to promote agility in innovation. A key focus is digital transformation, which is no longer an option. Insurance companies must be able to respond faster and stay ahead of the curve by developing and marketing products that appeal to consumers in this nascent market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about Dubai Refreshment Company's presence in the UAE, and how the company has positioned itself here to work across markets?</h4><p>Dubai Refreshment is one of the oldest manufacturing companies in the UAE. It was established in 1959, and we signed a contract with PepsiCo in 1962 to become the exclusive bottler, manufacturer, and distributor for beverages. At the time the contract covered the Trucial States of Oman, which was before the establishment of the UAE. One of the reasons for the company's success was its establishment as a joint stock company, meaning from the beginning we had many shareholders and most of the established trading families in Dubai were represented in the company. They continue to be shareholders to this day, with some of the shares passing to younger generations. We first had 32 shareholders and now we have over 100. We focused for the first 50 years on soft drinks, and we also launched Aquafina water in association with PepsiCo. Eight years ago, we made the decision to expand the facilities, finishing this factory in 2016. We moved here, and the idea was to expand the capacity to diversify the product portfolio and use it as a stepping stone to expand the business into other categories of beverages and snacks. It also allowed us to start expanding geographically and expand our relationships. We have identified comparative strengths in manufacturing and distribution, in addition to a good reputation and strong relationships with customers. We have good cash flow to venture into other product categories, either through organic growth or through acquisitions or mergers, and we have already begun this Journey. We believe one of the great things about our business is stability; however, after we have built this factory and made this large investment, we were surprised by an excise tax that targeted cigarettes, energy drinks, and carbonated soft drinks. Because the tax was targeted at very narrow group of products, the rate turned out to be is extremely high. The tax is about five times the global average, it is 50% of retail price.</p><h4>Do your operations here serve only the UAE or GCC market?</h4><p>Our contract with Pepsi is for Dubai and the northern Emirates, we have what we call an exclusive bottling appointment. We are also exporting products to several neighboring countries. They are usually countries that do not have a Pepsi operation, and we sell to traders who supply them. We also occasionally supply other PepsiCo bottlers with products or packages that they do not produce themselves.</p><h4>What is your strategy for the export market and use Dubai as an export base?</h4><p>Export for us cannot be a substitute for the local business, it is opportunistic sales from our point of view. We leverage the unique UAE location and significant shipping and export infrastructure advantage to drive exports to neighboring countries. Buyers come to the UAE because of minimal regulations, ease of doing business, connectivity, quick exporting procedures, and stable currency. Recent developments with VAT and increased regulations has made exports more difficult however, once people get used to the new system and once some of the new barriers are ironed out, I expect the UAE to regain its position in exports.</p><h4>How is your solar project evolving?</h4><p>The solar power generation project was completed in March 2019. The new building has 50,000sqm roof, and was designed from the beginning to carry solar panels. UAE Energy Strategy target to generate 44% of the country energy needs from clean sources by 2050. It is quite an ambitious goal, and the government is translating that vision into specific programs. One of the programs that they made available for industry is the Shams Program. It allows Solar installations to connect to the grid and receive credit for power generated. Users do not have to invest in batteries to store the energy, and that makes the project viable. The positive effects on our margins of this project were immediate. Our entire factory here is Silver LEED certified, largely due to the substantial efforts we make in electricity and water conservation and reuse. This is excellent for the environment, but it is also profitable for us. We are now generating about 35% of our energy needs from our rooftop solar plant.</p><h4>Over the next decade, what is the most important step that DRC has to make to maintain its long-term financial sustainability and market position?</h4><p>We have to do two things that are critical. First, we have to expand our geographical footprint in the GCC and the Middle East in general. There are too many beverage manufacturers, particularly in soft drinks, so I expect there will be some consolidation. It is important to benefit from maximizing the use of this new facility and expanding geographically will help generate efficiencies and will increase our ability to withstand shocks. It will allow us to also expand the portfolio more easily. In addition we need to expand beyond the beverage portfolio and create new verticals. The beverage business is more mature now, so unless we find growth opportunities in new verticals, our growth will be limited.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where is Houbara situated within the UAE's defense sector? Furthermore, as a joint venture between QinetiQ and Middle-East General Enterprises (MGE), what technological and scientific synergies are created between these organizations?</h4><p>Houbara was formed in 2017 and is based primarily in the Tawazun Industrial Park. Our core business is providing target services to the UAE Armed Forces. We intend to bring QinetiQ's unique portfolio of products and services to the UAE, primarily for the benefit of the armed forces as well as some security agencies. The synergy with MGE dates back to when we first established an office in Abu Dhabi; they were initially our sponsors and are now our Joint Venture partners. We initiated the joint venture once we were confident of a sustainable business stream. MGE has a diverse portfolio; however, they are relatively new to the defense sector. They are a reputable partner that can support us in several different capacities, with logistics arguably being the most important. As long-term partners of DHL Express, MGE have substantial logistics and warehousing capabilities.</p><h4>Could you highlight how your current suite of products is fulfilling the requirements of military operators?</h4><p>Essentially, we help our customers by providing representation of different types of threats. That representation can vary; for example, it can be a fast jet, a missile, or a fast attack vessel. Targets provide a configurable platform to create different signatures, be they visual, radar or thermal (IR). The target payloads are tailored as appropriate for testing or training a crew or platform, or a particular sensor or weapons system. We work closely with our customers to identify their requirements. Our ambition is to provide these services and products regionally. Consequently, our investment in the facility at Tawazun Industrial Park gives us the scope to support our targets supply chain across the region. As threats evolve, we are continually looking at new ways to innovate and develop our threat representation. For example, we will shortly bring to the market new products that will address specific threats related to drones, ballistic missiles and anti-ship missiles. Aerial targets and maritime surface targets are the foundation business, and we are interested in developing this offering further. Moreover, we are also in discussions with new customers on how to bring elements of our autonomy and robotics expertise from targets to bear on other areas of the military market.</p><h4>What do you see as some of the most interesting developments regarding innovative technology within the defense sector?</h4><p>This is a broad subject area. Regarding autonomy and robotics, it offers some important new capabilities for the UAE as it has the potential to deliver a force multiplier effect. The UAE Armed Forces are highly capable but numerically small.  Their operational effectiveness can be multiplied by using systems that increase mass, agility and visibility of the battlespace. This allows for the application of force with greater precision and improves their ability to operate in a challenging and demanding environment. While this opportunity is not unique to the UAE, it is a major area of interest. There are significant commercial and civil use cases as well, making a natural adjunct. Improving survivability is another element - these systems help reduce exposure in high-risk scenarios. It is encouraging that our customers here want to understand this technology better, not simply as a consumer but in a collaborative way to help develop these capabilities. There is therefore a strong desire to participate in international programs and partnerships related to these technologies. This is an area where QinetiQ has a particularly strong track record, and through Houbara, we are looking to bring this expertise to the UAE. Philosophically, we see a step-change in the way people approach the adoption of these disruptive technologies, reflecting recent operational experiences. When confronted with asymmetric threats, where the adversary can exploit technology faster, conventional militaries quickly become frustrated with their ability to procure and capitalize on what new technologies can deliver. There is an increasing appetite to take risks earlier, rather than waiting for systems to mature and be comprehensively tested and evaluated. This needs to happen in an informed and measured way - so that commanders deploying these technologies have realistic expectations and manage the risks in a balanced way.</p><h4>What is your estimation of 'prototype warfare,' and what are some of the practical advantages of this concept? How can this radically change the dynamics of defense industrial production processes as well as military procurement?</h4><p>In the Cold War, there was substantial R&amp;D investment from governments, which cascaded down to industry. Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a rebalancing of funding for defense research. The emphasis is increasingly on industry to generate ideas and absorb the costs associated with development. Industry has a real hunger for gaining operational insights that their customers obtain from using their technology. So, we advocate bringing industry and the military closer together earlier in a process we have termed 'prototype warfare'. This leads naturally to a spiral development path that can rapidly adapt the technology to deliver tangible benefits. This also shares the costs between government and industry, who are encouraged to invest more deeply when they can put immature products into the hands of the user and gather appropriate feedback. The investment risk is rebalanced in this scenario. But it needs to be a rigorous and thorough process, following a deliberate and measured approach. As a result, a product at a lower Technology Readiness Level (TRL) can be fielded significantly earlier, which gives the warfighter an incremental improvement in his capability — not perfect but a significant improvement. The traditional acquisition systems are no longer fit for purpose, so we have no choice but to adapt. We are encouraged that the UAE is receptive to Prototype Warfare, and we hope that, over time, it will become embedded in the UAE's defense industrial strategy. We expect to witness a progressive shift away from a traditional transactional approach to a much more collaborative one. The key is to allow the UAE's defense industry to become a knowledge-based, value-added industry through investment in human capital. QinetiQ is committed to contributing to this process through the JV.</p><h4>What is your perspective on Tawazun Industrial Park (TIP) and the role it serves in helping to build an indigenous defense sector?</h4><p>Being based in TIP is commercially beneficial and makes sense, strategically. We are investing in a UAE defense cluster where our proximity to other stakeholders will create opportunities for collaboration. We believe that, over time, we will be able to introduce other prominent engineering and technology services from QinetiQ. That will help support other aspects of the UAE's defense industry. The UAE's defense industry has been through significant restructuring and this is going to continue this year after which we hope that planning for the wider eco-system will be re-energized. From initial spot investments in specific manufacturing areas, there is now a need to bring additional elements into the supply chain. An example is the gap in facilities for test, evaluation and certification. These are all typical components of a more mature defense industrial base. I should add that there is an appetite for the private sector to invest in filling these gaps, but this will take time and require initiation at a federal level.</p><h4>Houbara is evidence of UK/UAE strategic collaboration within the defense sector. Looking more broadly at this relationship, how can UK companies contribute to the UAE's defense sector?</h4><p>The UK has a long, and profound relationship with the UAE, one that has always been underpinned by a solid mutual commitment to defense and security. Where I think the UK has a real interest in the UAE is around the area of sharing and developing knowledge. The UK remains a leading powerhouse for research and development in diverse fields, including defense and security. There is certainly potential for the two countries to collaborate more deeply through joint programs and partnerships. We are excited because we are seeing international interest in our programs being run for the UK Ministry of Defense, through organizations such as Defense Solution Center - the DSC. I think there is also a strong feeling in academia here that the UK is an important research hub that can contribute more to UAE. We have to create the right environment for this to mature, and it will probably start through bottom-up initiatives. Overall, we are optimistic about the future and very much see the UAE's defense sector heading in the right direction.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of value-based healthcare for Medtronic?</h4><p>Medtronic is one of the first companies to explore value-based healthcare, taking it further into collaborating with academic entities around the globe to structure it and bring it into a process thought leadership. This resulted in enabling HC system to turn into an outcome- or value-based healthcare system. The main change if a patient goes to a value-based healthcare center is that fee will be connected in many ways to the outcome, and the better the outcome, the higher the fee can be. Value-based healthcare also shifts focus to utilizing innovation to align value across the entire patient-care continuum. Thus, aspects like patient flow, recovery times, and even inventory management will become more efficient and better outcomes can be delivered without increasing infrastructures' overall costs. In this way, we can enhance global patient-care by increasing accessibility and economic value in emerging markets where resources are already scarce.  </p><h4>How can Medtronic help raise the healthcare standards in Dubai and the UAE and make it more accessible?</h4><p>Medtronic is working and collaborating in different ways to transform healthcare systems. The Netherlands Obesity Clinic launched Dubai and Abu Dhabi for its first expansion outside of the Netherlands. It opened two clinics, and we are starting to see patients go through our systems. We have been exploring areas such as expanding remote support to cardiac patients and have done pilots as well. We have also been successful in building up relationships that provide physicians with training, to contribute to  the outcome-based learning and take a step forward in addressing the issue of physician scarcity in the UAE. We are proud to serve close to 3 million patients around the region every year. There is still more to serve, as the Middle East and Africa  region has about 1.5 billion people, and many are underserved. In many countries in Africa, patients still cannot access affordable healthcare due to the limited infrastructure or healthcare professional s. Dubai has made it easier for us to access these markets and through collaborations with capital funds organizations, we are able to support to enhance access.</p><h4>How fast is the use of AI being deployed in your world, and what are the more recent implementations worth celebrating?</h4><p>The shift from pay-for-service models to outcomes-based models intersects directly with advances in technology, like AI. Data and measured outcomes will help drive value and accountability across the system. AI can be deployed in a way that enables technologies to be remotely administered, help physicians that are new to the therapy develop the knowledge, or allow us to deliver a better outcome to patients. One of our achievements in this area is the AI-powered Sugar.IQ diabetes assistant which empower patients to control their blood glucose levels more effectively. There's no doubt that data analytics will continue to increase and evolve over time. But today, the biggest opportunity we have is to give physicians both clinical and behavioral data to work with. The combination of those two will help providers make informed decisions and more effectively treat patients.</p><h4>How would you assess the R&amp;D spending and ventures across the region?</h4><p>We have had discussions with some of the large governments around the region about specific programs that would result in products that respond to the specific needs of the population of that country. Our region, however, is still working on finding the regulatory and funding framework and determining the role of the academic institute and government. We have many parts that would strengthen the local R&amp;D function in the region, and the country that can bring it all together first will likely be able to benefit from R&amp;D function faster. There are many commonalities in what we do; we can use platforms from one therapy for another and so on.</p><h4>What was the reasoning behind your recent acquisitions of Mazor Robotics and Abraaj Group Healthcare?</h4><p>Our strategy has three main components: quality, accessibility, and cost. The first involves innovation to improve quality and outcomes, the second involves globalization to increase access, and the final one involves economic value. Mazor and Abraaj fit in perfectly with these three strategic pillars because Mazor is an innovative product that makes it easier for physicians to utilize the surgery space, makes the surgery faster, and allows for better recovery. Abraaj was more about addressing accessibility, especially in terms of all of the investments Abraaj has made. It is now called Evercare in Pakistan, India, and Africa, areas where infrastructure has yet to be built and accessibility is still an issue.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your partnership with the UN on non-communicable diseases (NCDs)?</h4><p>In underserved communities, NCDs are on the rise, and those affected often face major barriers to care. We have developed community-based care systems around the world to strengthen these care systems and help populations take control of their health. We are engaging in partnerships across sector to accelerate responses to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), universal health coverage (UHC), and health worker shortages worldwide. As a collaborator in this response, we believe that progress can be leveraged when we listen to our partners and distill key lessons from their views and the results achieved.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[EUR74.3 million profit in 2018]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jaime-real-de-asua-president-elecnor]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Elecnor was founded in 1958. How has the company developed since then? </h4><p>Elecnor has transformed significantly over the years, venturing into sectors such as energy infrastructure, renewable energy, and new technologies. The company has also expanded its international presence over the years and is a listed company in the Spanish stock market. In 2018, Spain made up approximately 45% of our turnover, with the rest coming from international markets. At this time, we have a presence in 55 countries and the order book also shows the relevance of the international business for us. Thus, in the first half year, 78% of the orders came from non-domestic markets. It means that the backlog amount of this international portfolio was above 1.700 million euro in this period.</p><h4>In 2018, you reported almost EUR74.3 million in net profits. What is your strategy to grow further?</h4><p>We have two areas that complement and strengthen each other. Firstly, Elecnor has evolved into a world leader with the capacity and determination to develop, create and operate energy infrastructures, as well as becoming a leading provider of specialised engineering services for industry. We have a strong culture of service that serves to build strong, trusting relationships with our long-term customers. The second part is the concession business in the renewable and transmission lines sectors. Our first subsidiary was launched in Venezuela, back in the 60s. We lead international expansion and we have decades of experience in America and Africa. As a result, we have a deep knowledge and experience of the countries we work in. Elecnor will keep opening new markets, always driven by criterion of prudence. In this sense, we strongly believe that it is crucial to analyze all the details of a potential new market, as well as studying the competitive environment and evaluating our strengths over competitors. In keeping with this strategy, profits have registered increases for the last three years around 4% per year. Thus, in 2016 net benefit was EUR68.5million, in 2017 EUR71.2 million and last year EUR74.3 million. In the first six months of 2019, net benefit also has increased by 5% as for the same period of 2018.</p><h4>Do you work with local partners in countries such as Brazil, Chile, and México? </h4><p>Indeed, consolidating and positioning the company in these markets has taken many years of work, and involved collaborating with and learning from local private and public sector partners. We enter a country alone or by forming temporary unions. Depending on the potential of the country, and whether there are real possibilities of long-term success, we establish a branch or a subsidiary. The three countries that you mentioned are an example of this. We have been working there consistently for several decades. Thanks to our solid 35-year history in the country, Brazil is the second most important market for Elecnor after Spain. Notable projects include the wind farm in Rio Grande do Sul, one of the largest in the southern hemisphere, and building more than 8,000 kilometres of power transmission lines. Elecnor first began operations in Chile in the 1980s. By 1994 we had already overcome a great challenge: building two hydroelectric power plants on the River Duqueco. Elecnor now plays a crucial role in energy development in the country, in terms of transmitting power, developing non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE) and ensuring efficient energy use in installations. Mexico is also a key market for Elecnor. This is the result of an extensive 25-year history in the country, evidenced by remarkable projects such as the construction of 65 electrical substations with a total of 7,000 MVA of installed power; and the laying of 1,100 kilometres of transmission lines and 255 kilometres of optical fibre, without forgetting our EPC's in combined cycle plants.</p><h4>You mentioned the importance of Brazil, Chile, and México. Is the company focusing on Latin America?</h4><p>The Latin American market was our first international market, but Elecnor is a global company and we are present on all five continents. In America, we are also working in countries as competitive as the US and Canada. We have a stable presence in Africa, particularly in key markets such as Cameroon, Angola and Ghana. In Asia, we work in Middle Eastern countries such as Oman and Jordan. Australia is as a very interesting market and indeed we have undertaken some ambitious wind and solar projects. But in particular, I would like to highlight the international expansion that we have achieved in Europe in recent years. We are able to be competitive and win unique projects over large local companies in countries such as the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal and Norway. For example, we have been deploying fiber optics in Italy for two years.</p><h4>How much do you invest in R&amp;D and what importance does that hold?</h4><p>We are committed with R&amp;D and in fact, we are increasing our budget in this field. We work in a global market increasingly challenging and in this context, it is needed to make a difference with our competitors. I am convinced that in the coming years, those companies with no added value to offer will not survive. Given our activity, we pay very close attention to Occupational Health and Safety. Our preventive culture has been firmly implanted in all areas of the company to continuously improve safety levels, with a target of zero accidents and zero tolerance of non-compliance. A few years ago we launched an ambitious initiative: our Excellence in Safety project. This was launched in collaboration with Dupont, which continuously evaluates all of our preventive actions and implements a steady stream of improvements to reduce accidents. We must continue improving each day to prevent all workplace accidents within our company.</p><h4>What strategy do you follow to find and retain human talent?</h4><p>Elecnor is a large group that works in many countries and according to 2018 data, the company employs 13,800 employees. We transmit and develop the Elecnor culture to encourage people to feel a special bond with the group. The level of permanence of the personnel in the company is long, and the workforce of the company is young; 53% of the workforce is made up of people that are less than 40 years old. We have employees of 55 different nationalities and 36% of those work outside of Spain. The most remarkable aspect of working for Elecnor is the Elecnor culture, and we improve and encourage it at all times.</p><h4>What is the role of the public sector in the sector? </h4><p>Infrastructures are on the base of the economic growth in any country or region and if this investment is made in the correct way it can have a relevant impact on GPD growth. Elecnor is aware of this point and has a leading role in the energy development of the countries where we manage projects, both in the generation and transmission of energy, as well as in the development of NCRE and in the application of energy saving installations. Our relationship with the public sector has always been close; we get along well with the public sector as well as the private sector. The regulatory frameworks and political stability are what makes a country attractive for investment, so when these bases are covered, there is no doubt that economy will thrive.</p><h4>The technology is not yet modern enough to deal with the volume and geography that energy transportation requires. What are the biggest challenges in this context?</h4><p>We are all aware about the recent blackouts in New York, Argentina, Uruguay, and the rest of the world; these incidents show how vital the issue of interconnections is. In a globalized world, the transport of energy also has to be global. For example, regardless of whether the UK leaves the EU or not, interconnections between the UK and the EU must be developed.</p><h4>What are some of the recent innovative projects that the company has undertaken?</h4><p>After 20 years in operation, the Malpica wind farm in Galicia, northwest region in Spain, has been fully upgraded, a process which involved the replacement of its 69 wind turbines featuring now obsolete technology with 7 modern turbines with an annual output of 66 GWh. This is twice that of the replaced turbines. The new wind farm also has a far smaller environmental and landscape impact, with a reduced footprint and a reduction in the number of turbines. Notably, the modern wind and solar technologies are completely different than the technology of 10 years ago. We are very proud of the renewable projects that we are building, operating and maintaining in such an interesting market as Australia. Bungala Solar, located north of Port Augusta in the state of South Australia, is the largest PV project developed to date in Australia. The complex will boast a capacity of 374 MWp and will be rolled out in three phases. The first two, Bungala One and Bungala Two, have an installed capacity of 137 MWp each. The remaining 100 MWp are in development.</p><h4>What are the company's objectives for 2020?</h4><p>Elecnor's objective is to grow solidly, together with its clients and shareholders. In addition to that, we will try to increase the remuneration for our shareholders. On the client side, our primary goal is to provide the best service at both the national and international levels. Internationally, we aim to form new partnerships. In 2018, Elecnor has been awarded UNE-ISO 37001 certification. Elecnor is the first company in its sector in Spain to achieve certification under this standard. The award of this certification is simply a further illustration of Elecnor's longstanding and ongoing commitment to strengthening and consolidating the ethical commitment of its employees and stakeholders in all areas of our activity. The Group carries out its activity with a clear commitment to sustainability and the environment as well as the objective of creating value in the environments in which it operates.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[EOR techniques in Qatar]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[laurent-wolffsheim-managing-director-total-ep-qatar-country-chair-total]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Qatar benefiting of Total's new recovery techniques and technologies?</h4><p>Total and Qatar Petroleum are partners in two oil producing assets in Qatar: Al Shaheen field, operated by the North Oil Company (NOC) since July 2017, and Al-Khalij Field, located on Block 6, operated by Total. In 2014, we renewed the contract for operatorship of Al-Khalij field for a further 25 years, and despite being a complex field, it still has potential for production growth. We expect to tap into this potential notably thanks to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques, while being leaner in our operations. For EOR, we are notably supported by our research team in QSTP - the Total Research Center — Qatar (TRC-Q). Besides, we believe that the industry is changing for the better through digitalization — and this is a strong catalyst for a safer and more efficient operating model. The first step in digitalization is through data analytics, but drones and robotics are potential next steps that promise to be exciting. New technologies will also help to improve safety in the workplace, optimize the maintenance policies, and save costs. Being an operator in Qatar is therefore both a privilege and a responsibility; we must continuously demonstrate our operational excellence, and the added value that we bring to the state of Qatar.</p><h4>How will Total continue to develop the Al-Shaheen field?</h4><p>Al-Shaheen field has potential for production growth. As an equity partner, Total is supporting NOC in becoming a world class offshore operator — notably through our specialized teams of geoscientists and development planners. Production at Al-Shaheen field is currently close to 300 kboepd, and we have conducted pilots for EOR techniques. What is key for Al-Shaheen is to keep drilling to increase production potential, which means we need new well head platforms. Last year, we sanctioned the first development project, and by the end of this year we should have made a decision for additional well head platforms. We are also working to optimize the export scheme. Overall, there is quite a significant amount of capital expenditure associated with the development of the field, and we are aligned with Qatar Petroleum on the key targets and development plan.</p><h4>What is the future of the LNG sector here in Qatar?</h4><p>Total has integrated its overall strategy with the expected changes in the global energy mix, going in line with the Paris Climate Agreement objectives. Accordingly, we foresee an increase in the demand for gas, as it is a clean and reliable source of energy for power production, which limits greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. To accompany the growth in the gas market, you have to strategically position yourself to where you think LNG will be the most cost effective. Qatar's advantage is that it's geographically well placed, and has reliability and efficiency in operations to scale. Total already has already a strong footprint in the global LNG market, especially since we acquired the LNG business from Engie last year. Today, Total's portfolio is close to 40 million tons of LNG, which is quite significant as it has placed us in the 2nd position in the market. We have been developing strong LNG optimization and trading projects we have around the world, and we hope to be able to add North Field Expansion project in Qatar to our portfolio if we are selected as a partner.</p><h4>How will Total transition toward renewable energies?</h4><p>We are one of the bidders for the Kahramaa solar project here in Qatar. Globally, Total already has built a significant footprint in the solar market, and through this project, we could showcase our expertise. It makes perfect sense for Qatar to embark on this project to diversify its energy mix, and prove their commitment to reducing emissions.<br></p><h4>What is your plan to help Qatar in the expansion of its downstream operations?</h4><p>Total and QP have recently made studies to optimize operations in condensate refineries. Generally, in the downstream business, you need to optimize your assets all the time and finding ways to make sure you improve availability and energy efficiency. That is also the case for polymer production, as the idea is to keep improving processes and introduce new sets of polymers. This is well in line with Qatar National Vision 2030, to make sure that Qatar is extracting the best value out of its natural resources.</p><h4>What other sustainability projects are you involved in the near future?</h4><p>We are excited about the Tawteen project led by Qatar Petroleum, which started in February 2019. Different investment opportunities are being evaluated now; and this is a game changer and a good opportunity to mutualize operations for all of us in the energy sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[paul-maya-ceo-mexico-atos]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes North America your largest global business unit (GBU), and what role does Mexico play within that unit?</h4><p>Based on business volume, a GBU can be a country like France or Germany. In the Americas, our business is split into two regions: North America—which includes Canada, the US, Mexico, and Central America, and South America- which includes Colombia, Brazil, and the rest of the South cone. From a business perspective, North America is the largest GBU for the group from an external revenue perspective. Mexico holds strategic value as we have hybrid operations. We operate as a global delivery center (GDC) based in Monterrey, supporting US contracts along with some other global contracts based in Europe. We also support our contracts based in Mexico. North America is the largest GBU in good part, as the US is the largest IT consumer market in the world with the majority of the Fortune 500 corporation headquarters. Our strategy in Mexico is to support US contracts, optimizing operation costs on a constant basis. These are the main advantages versus other countries with offshore operations like India and Malaysia.</p><h4>How did Mexico become a leader in terms of incorporating cloud systems in Latin America?</h4><p>Mexico's geographical location has several advantages. One of them is having the largest foreign investor as a neighbor: the US. Moreover, both countries have a similar business culture. If a cloud or hybrid cloud project becomes a major trend in the US, Mexico is next in line. We are likely the leader in Latin America in terms of incorporating the latest technologies. Brazil is also fairly successful, though it has strict regulations for doing business outside of Brazil, which makes it more complicated. Another item that separates Mexico from the rest of Latin America is the number and variety of trade agreements, as there are several signed with different countries and blocks. Overall, Mexico leads the use and adoption of cloud systems in Latin America.</p><h4>What is your current market share in Mexico, and what strategies do you have to increase it?</h4><p>Our current market share is very low at the moment because the sector is still niche. Our plan is to grow as much as possible and compete with those with a large market share. One of our main objectives is to rapidly develop our Industry 4.0 capabilities, and we are working on digital transformation and Internet of Things (IoT) POVs and projects already with some major corporations. We plan to move faster with our hybrid cloud project, IoT, cybersecurity and digital workplace. These are the four areas we are using to trigger growth in Mexico. One differentiator is our global presence. We can support global corporations based in the US or Europe to understand the market in Mexico and help them adapt solutions to any local regulations or requirements. Another key advantage is our large footprint in Mexico, which includes our large group of engineers and subject matter experts.</p><h4>Regarding the digital transformation, what are the most important elements every company should invest in?</h4><p>Every C-level of our client base wants to increase revenue and improve operating margins or cash flow. If an IoT project can help in any of those three areas, they should pay attention to it. Basically, an IoT project connects things via the internet to an advanced analytics machine or appliance that can detect the interactions and give recommendations according to the process in real time. If companies use the right approach to analyze the data, it can help improve delivery cycles, parts, and logistics, all for proactive procurement and maintenance. For example, an IoT project can help reduce maintenance budgets by up to 20 percent, which is a good number for a large manufacturing facility.</p><h4>What are some of the main projects you are working on in Mexico, and which companies are you collaborating with?</h4><p>One of our main sectors in Mexico is manufacturing. Within manufacturing, the automotive segment is one that has been growing the most. Some of our main projects include infrastructure projects, digital workplaces, service desk capabilities, transformation of the service desks, global SAP roll-outs, aligning local operations with global headquarters guidelines or standards. In addition, we support hybrid cloud projects that help clients transform legacy infrastructure into public or private clouds. The main way to achieve the efficiencies that each industry needs is through IoT projects of predictive analytics, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). We can talk about manufacturing, but the financial sector is also advancing, with fintech initiatives for example. Some say it represents a risk to a well-established bank, though some of the major banks are already transforming into fintechs in some areas. Eventually, that will be the future. Fintech is a financial service someone can get without human intervention. For example, a user will log on to a website and provide information in order to apply for a car loan, home loan, investment or mortgage without having to see anyone in person. More traditional banks are offering such tools and services already with very low or zero human intervention.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[lars-richter-managing-director-julius-berger]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major projects is Julius Berger currently involved in?</h4><p>Julius Berger is one of the largest construction companies in Nigeria. We offer services covering the complete construction and development value chain. Our portfolio includes a range of projects in the building, infrastructure and industrial sector, including oil and gas industry and power projects.  Julius Berger can tackle just about any project, but we have the strongest edge when it comes to large scale or technically challenging works, or projects with accelerated timelines. Therefore, we have been awarded several priority projects by the Federal Government, one of which is the Second Niger Bridge linking Asaba in Delta State with Onitsha in Anambra State. We commenced works in 2018 and have finished the piling structure. Works on the substructure, such as the sand filling and dredging works, as well as works for the super structure are ongoing. Everything is on track according to our schedule, and we expect to finish on time in 2022. This is a priority project by the Nigerian federal government under the umbrella of the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF). Our client is the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing together with the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), which is providing the funds. We expect this key project to be a success story for the government, linking the southern and western part of Nigeria and becoming a key part of West Africa's road network.  We believe that our structure, being a 100% Nigerian company with a subsidiary in Germany through which we can transfer state-of-the-art technologies, coupled with our backwards integration and domestic production capacities provides for a unique model - that guarantees quality, reliably and innovation are prioritized for our clients' benefit.</p><h4>Julius Berger is known as a first choice contractor for infrastructure projects. As such, you seem maintain a high level of Federal Government projects. Do you intend to maintain this strategy over the long term, or are there plans to diversify the company's clientele?</h4><p>According to our company's strategy, infrastructure is one part of our core business in the construction sector, and we want to maintain and even increase our strength in this field. The Federal Government is therefore a very key client for Julius Berger, as the biggest contracts, such as the Second Niger Bridge, Abuja-Kano Road, and Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, are priority projects funded by NSIA and PIDF. Therefore, they are one large part of our construction pillar and strategy. However, our portfolio is dynamic and close to half of our client mix is made up of other clients, including private clients and investors. As well, we have some contracts with state governments and parastatal agencies. Still, diversification is a main theme and focus for Julius Berger. Considering the ups and downs in the Nigerian construction business due to economic and financial parameters, we see diversification as a key tactic to protect ourselves from this volatility. Our plan for the future is to grow a second pillar to our business, made up of new opportunities, some of which are currently under development. Since I transitioned into the role as Managing Director, in 2018, the company's focus has been diversification.</p><h4>What is the business sentiment and investment climate like in the construction sector now?</h4><p>The recession is behind us, and there is slight growth in the country now, in construction and even in different business sectors. But still, the construction sector is suffering because most of the major infrastructure projects are federal government projects, and funding has been limited. In 2018, we managed to grow slightly, and in 2019 we made a significant step in our turnover. This comes from the priority projects as well as from more investors coming into the Nigerian market. We believe that our growth and forward progress is also reflective of the sector as a whole. The sentiment is more positive, and it seems that the entire industry is hopeful for 2020 and for more international investors to return because we also need many more construction projects in the private sector, including in the oil and gas industry. The biggest project on the horizon is train seven at the Bonny Island LNG facility, which has been a long time coming. We are focused on tendering for such jobs and hope to win some of those bids in order to participate in this big project. Such awards would be wonderful in celebration of our 50th Anniversary since incorporation in Nigeria, which we are commemorating in 2020.</p><h4>What has delayed narrowing the infrastructure gap in Nigeria?</h4><p>Nigeria is a large country with tremendous population growth and therefore growing needs in terms of infrastructure, here we are not only talking about roads, but also the provision of power, rail lines, harbors, deep sea ports, and so on. The overall responsibility for the provision of this infrastructure rests mainly with the Federal Government, as does the financial responsibility. Meanwhile, private investors can get involved through mechanisms such as PPP models, but infrastructure development at this scale cannot be done solely by private investors. We have some PPP models in Nigeria, though only for some minor projects, and the frameworks and financial models for PPP in Nigeria are yet to be fully developed. President Buhari's administration is focused on infrastructure, and road infrastructure is a must along with power. Yet there remains a need for greater volume of continued intense investment by the federal government to cover the gap between the existing and ever-growing demand and what is actually on the ground.</p><h4>While there is a 17 million housing deficit, there also seems to be an oversupply of high-end properties. What is your take on this?</h4><p>Prior to the recession, Nigeria saw a continued growth and urbanization, with a rising middle and upper-middle class. At the time there were strong cases for investment in higher-end real estate, both residential and commercial offices, with a number of investors who invested in such buildings, and then the recession came, and there was insufficient demand to occupy all these new homes and offices. At the moment, the market has stabilized, companies are scaling back up, and imports are increasing. These are the first sign that the economy is getting back on track. It can be assumed that international investors will soon return, and that all these developments will continue to support local companies to grow and start employing more people.  Hopefully from there, the luxury or high-end development market will bounce back. I am positive about 2020 as a year for rebound.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Mastering the niche]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[tomas-alonso-ceo-gaggenau]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide an overview of the Gaggenau brand, its current portfolio, and how this fits into the broader BSH organization?</h4><p>The Gaggenau portfolio of home appliances includes ovens, refrigerators, surface inductions, wine coolers, and other prominent luxury kitchen products. Gaggenau has an exciting approach to the market with a unique portfolio of products. The BSH company, thanks to its brands Gaggenau, Siemens, and Bosch is able to cover the luxury, premium, and added value categories all in one go. This gives us an advantage over our competitors and allows us to match our brands with consumers' needs. Our strategy is to play with the three brands in different parts of the market. Gaggenau occupies the luxury segment, a niche part of the market. We foresee great potential within this niche, as our products are for consumers who value luxury goods. Our Siemens range is intended for consumers in the premium segment of the market, while the Bosch brand covers the added value segment. Premium &amp; added value consumers tend to be fresher, more modern, urban consumers who can spend money but want practical products. We cover the entire kitchen spectrum with this umbrella of brands, from small domestic appliances such as vacuum cleaners, food processors, and coffee machines to major household appliances such as ovens, hobs, hoods, refrigerators, and washing machines.</p><h4>What key features differentiate these brands from some of your major competitors?</h4><p>Collectively, our brands have been in the market for a long time. Gaggenau has more than 330 years' experience in the field, Siemens has over 150, and Bosch has 135-plus. Consumers in the market recognize quality German products and technologies; however, this involves more than product quality; the brand and image are equally integral. This is also why people pay for such appliances. Our brands resonate with consumers. We offer more than 400 products in the market through our three brands. With such an extensive portfolio, we can cover all a consumer's needs and necessities. While some of our competitors have fantastic brands, they are not able to cover the niches that we do and have nowhere near the same quantity of products.</p><h4>In what ways is the UAE market unique compared to Gaggenau's other markets globally? How has this affected your approach to the UAE market?</h4><p>Luxe is normally a niche market worldwide. In the UAE, this is a broader niche market, with a population that is ready and able to spend money. However, people will only pay a substantial amount of money if you provide something different. Gaggenau's motto is: “The difference is Gaggenau." There are many excellent brands in the market, though when we talk about luxury, then there is only one: Gaggenau. Opening a Gaggenau oven or fridge, you feel the difference. This difference between brands is fundamental to the consumer and also justifies the money they pay. It is not possible to compare this brand with any other in-home appliances in the UAE market. Luxury means differentiation, exclusivity, materials, heritage, and quality, and only Gaggenau can provide this in the UAE. Bosch and Siemens are fantastic brands playing in a completely different price and consumer segment, with other competitors in a similar segment-market. UAE consumers like the Gaggenau look and brand, and they need to feel that the brand they put in their homes is unique.</p><h4>How do you work alongside architects, interior designers, and your consumers to create this luxury kitchen concept and design experience?</h4><p>Gaggenau is certainly not new in this market; it has been working in the UAE for some time now. We wanted to make the brand more visible and approachable, and two years ago, we decided to invest in a Galleria for Gaggenau. This Galleria has an area of more than 300sqm in the business bay area, which is an upscale part of Dubai. It allows consumers to interact with the brand and visualize what it would be like to have Gaggenau appliances in their own homes. We can invite clients such as architects, interior designers, and high-end kitchen dealers to this custom showroom. We aim to capture the attention of our niche target audience and introduce them to Gaggenau. Having this base allows us to amplify the Gaggenau story.</p><h4>What areas exhibit the greatest growth potential over the next five years, and what are Gaggenau's specific objectives for the UAE market here?</h4><p>Gaggenau has ambitious targets, and the idea is to focus on our investments. If we split our future investment between the different countries we cover today in this region, this will likely have a limited impact. Therefore, our primary strategy is to invest in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. From 2023, we aim to move into collateral markets where we expect to succeed, such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Our current focus is the UAE, which is partly because we are currently involved in luxury construction projects in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Second, repositioning is imminent in kitchen design. Consumers will renovate or replace their old kitchens, and we need to give them the option to use luxury brands when they do so. We have two angles: the construction project business and residential kitchen refits. Dubai and Abu Dhabi both exhibit the most opportunity for this work, and this is where we want to base our growth for the coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[15 Stations, 22km]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[15-stations-22km]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the first subway project in Ecuador, how will the metro help create a metro culture among citizens and reduce traffic congestion?</h4><p>With a 22km line and 15 stations, Quito's transport system is taking the first step toward a large-capacity integrated system, making a great leap forward with the construction of its first metro line. Since the 2000s, the number of vehicles has grown around 15-20% annually, making the roads increasingly congested. The population has also been growing, and the city has been expanding into the surrounding valleys such that there is no delineation with other neighboring municipalities such as Mejí­a or Rumiñahuí­. In order to approach public transport in a more holistic way, Quito and nearby cities came together to create an integrated entity. The first line will be followed by planned extensions, maintenance work, and integration with other means of transports; hence, the need for an entity overseeing all this activity. We are working on instilling the metro culture in people following the example of successful cities in LATAM such as Medellí­n. In order to achieve this, we are making efforts to have a seemingless integration of systems and stations. Buses, trolleybuses, and the subway will be connected using strategic points, and there will be a single fare, meaning passengers will have to pay only once.</p><h4>How would you assess the impact of having a city like Quito equipped with metro?</h4><p>The construction work cost USD1.54 billion, and about USD500 million represented feasibility studies and environmental assessment. The most direct benefit of a metro line is the reduction of travel times within the city and the integration of systems so that one can travel across Quito via public transportation. We are assessing how to extend the line to Calderón and Carapungo, where there are more than 850,000 people who lack a structured public transport system. The first line will be complemented by a second line connecting the Pomasqui sector or Mitad del Mundo. Public transport investment tends to be measured by the social return. In the case of LATAM, 70% of people travel by public transport, so there needs to be public transport infrastructure that allows their mobilization. The equitable distribution of the transport infrastructure investment makes the public transport systems have an extremely high social NPV, and this will be the case in Quito when the metro starts working in 2020.</p><h4>What partners have been involved in the project to make it a reality by 2020?</h4><p>We have brought in experienced stakeholders so that there can be knowledge and skills transfer. The construction was assigned to Acciona, and we are also working with different metro operators from different major cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Santiago de Chile, and Medellí­n. Over the first years of operations, the metro line will be operated by another metro company with expertise in this kind of business. The cooperation with the Medellí­n subway has been extremely fruitful, and we seek to follow some of its initiatives to create a similar metro culture in Quito and integrate our different transportation means into one system.</p><h4>What is the metro's approach to issues such as accessibility and environmental protection?</h4><p>This project was conceived from the beginning with such issues and others in mind to make sure the metro that we are building today will still be a modern network in the coming decades. Regarding accessibility, proper signaling was installed from the mouth of the station to inside the trains. We propose generating a subway zone around the mouth of the station where the same concept of citizen culture can be used in terms of quality, facility, and accessibility for people with reduced mobility or any other physical limitation. With regard to environmental concerns, the Quito subway has established a reference case in Latam by transforming an anti technical modified mine into an ecological farm. We relocated more than 1.3cbm of soil to a mine on the outskirts of Quito. This mine today has been transformed into a farm that supplies meat, eggs, and milk to the area. Another point we have paid extra attention to was mobility and the passenger experience so that people are more encouraged to use the metro. There will be no independent card; anyone with a bank card with national or international contactless system will be able to use the metro directly. For those without a bank card, we have been working with financial institutions to generate metro cards that are supported by Visa or MasterCard, so apart from being used to access the metro, these cards could be used at point of sales. Additionally, the idea is to stop using cards by 2022 and replace them with telephone payments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ayman-al-wadi-group-executive-chairman-al-wadi-holding]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide more details on the company's operations?</h4><p>We are experienced since 1997 in this industry, and due to the market need and the lack of professional standards in the Debt Management Industry, Al Wadi Holding was born. Today we are proud to state that Al Wadi Holding will celebrate its 10-year anniversary in 2019. We decided to bring different companies under one umbrella in 2009. We started to provide debt management, which includes several solutions. Initially we were providing B2B &amp; B2C services.  However, we noticed that there was a huge demand for B2B and since we are experts in this field, we decided to have more focus. We provide solutions through direct and indirect partners in 194 countries. Under Al Wadi Debt Management, we have domestic &amp; Cross Border where we provide collections, skip tracing, consultation, training and outsource. We provide Legal Debt Collection through our associate lawyers.   We have Al Wadi Business Advisory &amp; Risk Management and Al Wadi Translation Services. This allows us to provide 360-degree business support and corporate excellence to our valued clients and partners. Our main goal in providing legal debt collection, was to have a one stop corporate solution which is not only the unique product that we created but which also adds tremendous value to the economy at large. This service involves debt collection through litigation, and it has been extremely successful. Both these arms have local and international clients, and we define ourselves as “Glocal.“ We are a recognized partner with FENCA (Federation of European National Collection Associations), IACC (The American International Association of Commercial Collectors) and many other associations worldwide.  Most of these members depend on us  to handle their debt collection in GCC &amp; MENA region. Likewise, we also avail their services in the respective regions.</p><h4>Where do most of your clients come from?</h4><p>Over the past years we have had clients from most of the regions. However, the major clientele apart from our Local Hub ranges from Europe, China &amp; America, which includes major corporates in most of the industries.</p><h4>How would you compare the debt collection environment in Dubai to other parts of the world?</h4><p>Debt Management Industry which is greatly linked to the backbone of the economy has to be more regulated when compared to some regions of the world. One of our goals is to upgrade our standards. There is no association for debt management in the entire MENA region. We are working closely with the international associations and global authorities to build a Debt Management Association in this region.</p><h4>Before the 100% foreign ownership law, you were advising clients on the local partnership side of starting a business here. How has this law impacted your operations?</h4><p>The vision of our wise leaders was to adapt to the needs of businesses. There were other changes that came with this, such as the 10-year visa. Overall, more flexibility was introduced. This was a leap here; no other country in the region had done this before, and UAE was the leader. Our core business was not affected. There are many instances of a foreign company with an amazing business model that wants to come to UAE, and our Business Advisory &amp; Risk Management goes through every aspect of their business plan to ensure that the regulations are complied with, the type of credit to provide, and how to mitigate the risk. We advise these companies on whether it is better to establish in the free zone, or mainland in any Emirates. Even the most successful foreign companies have a learning curve to go through when establishing in UAE.</p><h4>Where do you see the biggest potential for your foreign clients?</h4><p>We have direct and indirect partners in 194 countries. we are receiving business partners regularly from different countries, looking at the infrastructure, easy government regulation to do business, the advanced legal system and high security in the UAE; they plan to settle, build their own business and purchase properties. A common question we receive is “How can I acquire a trading license here?“ Such questions show that companies are seriously thinking about having a presence here. Due to our expertise and long experience in the region we are instrumental in helping them to achieve this goal. This is a sign that global investors' interest across all areas of the economy is high.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2020?</h4><p>Expo 2020 will be an outstanding achievement. It was a challenge to be accepted and is an exceptional achievement.  Though the EXPO will last for six months, in all realities the Leaders have a long- term plan which is looking beyond the six months of the EXPO. We are having a ripple effect of new technologies for the Expo. The economic impact will be positive on all levels. For AL WADI Holding, we will continue with our long-term plans for advisory on risk, business management, debt management, and legal debt Management solutions. Our vision for 2020 is also to expand and extend extensively our solutions into Saudi Arabia due to the market demand that we have noticed in the recent year. We have a positive outlook for the future, although we are aware of the challenges ahead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Insuring 50% of Mexico Truck Fleets]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jose-antonio-correa-etchegaray-ceo-qualitas-seguros]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Qualitas responding to the low penetration rate for auto insurance in Mexico?</h4><p>First of all, our penetration in the Mexican market is around 30%. This means we still have about 70% of the market that is up for grabs. So how can the car industry and auto insurance continue to grow? It depends on consumers' purchasing power. The country has an opportunity to increase the purchasing power of people, and we believe that will be developing over time. That means that even though penetration is relatively low now, if you take the right actions and develop the right product, people will buy more. We also have something called ODQ, which is a project we started in 2011 to put small offices in small towns. We have increased coverage in that way. With that, business grows. When you do this kind of business, it does not matter how big the market is, but what you do with that market. In addition, it is expanding. The coverage we are doing will also increase participation. The market is not going to come to you. You have to go to the market. We also insure 50% of the truck fleets around the country. In that area, we know that we are much better prepared to provide services to large fleets around the country.</p><h4>How is the shared economy affecting your business, and how are you adapting to these kinds of trends?</h4><p>In the end, someone has to purchase the car and insure it, whether its a personal car or a car meant to be used in applications for transportation. We do not see these kinds of apps replacing the entire automotive market any time soon. Millennials may not buy cars, but they will probably use these applications for sharing cars. In terms of mobility, as long as there is a need for drivers or cars, we will be there providing the market with insurance. The model may be changing, but there will always be a need for cars. I am sometimes asked about autonomous vehicles, but I always say I am not that concerned about them for Mexico, at least in the next five to 10 years. There is still a lot of infrastructure needed. The cost of driverless technology is expensive. In order to switch, there will be huge costs, and market penetration is not going to be very big. It is something that I am sure will happen, but it is not close so we are not concerned yet. I have seen studies that say the premium for car insurance will shrink because autonomous driving cars will be less likely to have accidents. Still, this kind of technology will not be widespread in Mexico in the next 10 years.</p><h4>In what ways do your subsidiaries compliment your business strategy?</h4><p>The creation of subsidiaries is tied to our low-cost strategy. By having them, we believe we have been able to control costs better than our competitors. We have Cristafácil, Easy Car Glass, Outlet de refacciones, and many more. As long as they are aligned to our basic strategy of low cost, we will continue investing in those types of companies. It allows us to maintain the right cost structure in our business and have lower costs overall. All of our subsidiaries have proven themselves in fulfilling that objective.</p><h4>What are your main priorities when it comes to the company's international expansion over the medium term?</h4><p>In March 2019, we acquired an insurance company in Peru, and we are going to be looking at opportunities there as they appear. We are not taking an active role, but if they are presented to us we will certainly consider more. Central America is relatively small and is not of much significance in terms of volume. However, we are servicing the border with the US and three of the four states along it, California, Texas, and Arizona. We are not intending to compete with big players there, but instead focusing on the market of people who live in those states and commute across the border frequently. That market has grown nicely, and so has our subsidiary along with it. Peru is our newest market. It is interesting because its comparable to the Mexican market. It also has more potential in terms of market size. Penetration rates also sit around 30%. We are putting all the business in place to see how far we can go with the model that we have in Mexico in Peru and South America. We will continue checking out opportunities as they arise to see if we can replicate our model successfully. In the US, we have created a totally different model to comply with the specifications of the US market, which is highly regulated. There are different regulations there, compared to other countries. There are limits as to what you can and cannot do. Still, we maintain our focus on service, costs, centralization, and specialization. We are happy with what we have seen so far with our expansion outside Mexico.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for the rest of 2019 and 2020?</h4><p>Our target is to make sure we have top-notch services. As long as that is the case, we will attract more business. My strategy is to empower the company to make sure we can maintain that target. We are technologically advanced, too. We have a new automated model for customer service as well as tracking vehicles for drivers. We are also testing three or four new technologies in these areas. We believe we have the best technology already. Our customers always tell us that, especially when it comes to the big fleets. We want to make sure we keep pace with anything new that comes to our industry. We are not limiting ourselves. If customers want to buy through an agent, they buy through an agent. If they want to buy through an office, they can buy through an office. If they want to buy online, that is okay too. We have to be sure to do the basics and do them well. In this way, we will continue to be successful, and I have no doubt about that at all. The important thing is to be close to the customers and understand their needs. As long as we can fulfill their demands, we know we can succeed. Every person who works for Qualitas is geared toward that, and, in this way, we can outdo our competitors. I suggested that the best way we can celebrate our 25th year is not by having a big party, but by having a record year. We had a record year in 2018 and, to me, that is the best celebration we could have. If you ask me what is going to happen in 2019, I would tell you that we will break that record by far. So far, 1H2019 is already showing that we can set a new record. As long as we keep working in this way, we are going to achieve even more success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ricardo-plata-economic-development-director-ricardo-vives-director-urban-projects-city-intelligence-puerta-de-oro]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important has Puerta de Oro been in promoting the business community and attracting new businesses?</h4><p>Ricardo Vives: Since 2008, Barranquilla has undergone a massive transformation process in terms of financial growth and urban development. Over the last 12 years, Barranquilla has transformed from a city with a budget of COP700 million to one with over COP3 billion. In that sense, the role of Puerta de Oro has been fundamental in providing the city with a long-term vision and developing and structuring important projects.</p><p>Ricardo Plata: As for the role of Puerta de Oro as the city´s convention center I would argue the it has allowed Barranquilla to host important trade fairs, including major agricultural, gastronomic, and automobile trade fairs, that have positioned the city as an attractive option in the greater Caribbean basin. These events have been possible because of our state-of-the-art infrastructure and the collaboration from the complete local tourism value chain. In summary, Puerta de Oro has been a critical catalyst in the success of the local private sector growth.</p><h4>What is your relationship with the Barranquilla Chamber of Commerce like, and what other important partnerships are you currently working with?</h4><p>RP: The chamber of commerce is a key part of the city's social and financial structures as well as to the Puerta de Oro economic development corporation. As such, the chamber provides critical insight and analysis on the evolution of clusters, high impact enterprises, exports which are important for public policy decisions regarding economic development. Additionally, it provides guidance and mentorship to new and existing businesses and investors.</p><h4>How important has the relationship been with the chamber of commerce and the Corferias Group?</h4><p>RV: Our first project was the construction of the Puerta de Oro Convention Center. At the beginning of the project it was clear that the city could benefit from an external professional operator such as the Corferias Group, which is based in Bogotá. This group chose to establish its first offsite operation in Barranquilla, so we agreed on a contract to operate the convention center. With this partnership, we have been able to attract several organizations and associations, partnering with some of the biggest industrial, construction, real estate events, among others. Another important actor in this relation and the overall development of the city is ProBarranquilla, an investment promotion agency that has led the promotion and visibility of the city for the past 25 years.</p><h4>How do you foster market conditions to keep attracting businesses at a faster rate?</h4><p>RP: Some of the key sectors are industry, commerce, energy, and professional services. Moving forward, we aim to leverage the city's geographical location to attract export businesses. We are at the north peak of South America with direct connection to Central America, the US, and the Caribbean. Equally important, the quality of human talent in Barranquilla is top notch, which has a lot to do with the city having one of the best education sectors in the Caribbean and Central America. Our strong institutional growth helps businesses solve the operational bottlenecks and reduce the time it takes to start a business. If you look at the indicators over the last 12 years, all of them are in an uptrend, giving investors more reasons to invest in Barranquilla.</p><h4>What is your vision behind the designs of the urban planning projects?</h4><p>RV: Puerta de Oro is a company with people at the center of every project. We measure our success in terms of the number of people using our project and our key performance indicators always include social metrics. One of our business units in Puerta de Oro is always working on programming and generating demand for every project. For example, Gran Malecon, our river boardwalk project, is more than just a boardwalk. The design is meant to promote casual encounters, making it the most visited public space in Colombia with over 7 million visitors over the last two and a half years. There is a unit dedicated to curating weekly live cultural events featuring break dancers, singers, and orchestra, to name a few. We have also been measuring the impact of every entity in order to find what value chains are positively impacted by these public spaces and how to make future investments more efficient.</p><h4>What is your pitch to attract investors and business to Barranquilla?</h4><p>RP: Barranquilla is a city of the future. Since its conception, it has been a creative and global-minded city, with immigrants from all over the world. We have some of the best local-level infrastructure in education, health, and public spaces developed with the help of public-private ventures that have transformed the city. Colombia is growing faster than Peru, Chile, and every Latin American country, and, notably, no other Colombian city has grown faster than Barranquilla. We have reduced poverty rates from 43% to 21% in the last 10 years and have grown household incomes 1.7 times during the same period. We are motivated as a city to welcome all kinds of investors and businesses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[maria-jose-vengoechea-executive-president-chamber-commerce-barranquilla]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you please summarize what are the primary sources of economic growth seen in Barranquilla, and how they differ to other regions of the country?</h4><p>In our region, the four growth pillars are consumer confidence, the high rate of new business growth, the increase in hotel occupancy, and the highest levels of per capita public investment in the country. The Barranquilla Chamber of Commerce has always promoted the importance of having an attractive business ecosystem in both Barranquilla and the Atlantic Province. In terms of statistical business growth, we have witnessed in Barranquilla the opening of 17,642 new business units in 2018. This represented a significant increase of 14.3% from 2017, when there were 15,430 new business units. This figure far exceeds the statistics recorded in the same period in Bogotá (4.9%), Antioquia (1%), Valle (7.5%), Santander (-4.5%), and the national rate of 0.8%.</p><h4>Which services and support programs offered by the Barranquilla Chamber of Commerce are most in demand by national and international companies looking to open operations in Barranquilla? </h4><p>Our portfolio contains a selection of products and services segmented for our entrepreneurs according to their needs and the needs of their businesses. I specifically want to mention our “cluster“ strategy, which personalizes our approach with each industry and sector. In this context, our chamber has developed 36 projects during the last eight years. We have helped over 700 companies and invested both our own and third-party resources with more than COP18 billion (USD5.3 million) in business projects. We offer our clients different training and consulting programs with global firms such as IDOM, Cluster Development, Competitiveness, IKEI, Dinalog, STC, and others. Finally, we are in constant collaboration with partners from relevant ecosystems such as universities, local and national government entities, and international organizations such as the IDB and CAF.</p><h4>How have partnerships helped CCB attract new investments to Barranquilla?</h4><p>With Innpulsa Colombia, we are assisting our “logistics“ clusters to vertically integrate with their supply chains as a strategy to pursue international markets. With the program “Productive Colombia,“ we have launched the “Fabricas de Productividad“ program, which benefits 150 companies in the Caribbean. We are working with city hall, the governor of Atlántico, Procolombia, and other institutions to promote the city as a destination of foreign capital. In 1Q2019, we secured 12 new installation projects representing USD92.2 million in investments and 350 formal jobs, according to statistics from ProBarranquilla.</p><h4>In 2019, over 270,000 companies were assisted by the 57 Chambers of Commerce in Colombia. Could you elaborate specifically on the numbers for the Barranquilla Chamber and how they balance between national companies and international companies? </h4><p>We strive to offer strategic advice to facilitate the challenges that entrepreneurs face. Some of our achievements from 2018 include making 1400 contacts during the global entrepreneur week; holding 75 professional workshops; assisting 467 businesses; advising 876 executives; and founding 78 accelerated ventures. We also saw an overall growth of 17% in sales and 38% increase in employment.  We carry out activities abroad to study different commercial opportunities together with 24 partner companies and eight export destinations.</p><h4>Earlier in 2019, the chamber announced a partnership called “Pactos de Innovacion“ with COLCIENCIAS. The partnership is meant to promote technology and innovation. What is the importance of attracting technology companies to Barranquilla and what is the outlook for this industry here?</h4><p>The “Pactos de Innovacion“ program has been part of the Barranquilla Chamber of Commerce since 2015. It has helped 150 companies since its inception. Furthermore, over 850 companies have signed the pact for innovation, which gives them access to an infrastructure that allows them to test launch their new products and services. Here in the Atlántico province, we have developed a strategy dedicated to pushing economic growth through innovation, a strategy that has been highlighted with our innovation district called Atlanticonnect. With this project the energy, industrial agriculture, and digital health markets have been prioritized as key industries moving forward. It is through this focus on innovation that we continue to attract top human capital to our region and promote the development of academia, new business development, and the continued participation of a forward-thinking public sector that works hand in hand with the private sector.</p><h4>What are the main goals for the chamber as we end 2019 and start 2020?</h4><p>In Colombia, we count with over 57 chambers of commerce, all of which share similar challenges on a regional and wider scale. To stay attuned with the global macro dynamics, we have made a series of strategic bets. We want to develop the use of information and data as a primary tool for local market competitiveness. We want to oversee the development of a new pilot program focusing on blockchain technology. We are interested in the development of a diagnostic platform for enterprise solvency, which will allow us to support local companies with analytics. Through our initiative called “Camaras 2050,“ we have started to promote value added services that will act as forums for user empowerment, information sharing, economies of scale, and networking models. Overall, we want to continue to remain relevant to our business community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Dr. Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty
Founder and Chairman, BRS Ventures

Dr. B R Shetty arrived in the United Arab Emirates in 1973 and has since established BRS Ventures; one of the leading and premium business houses in the country with a global presence and numerous successful acquisitions. He started his innings in 1974 with the launch of NMC Healthcare, the first private healthcare facility in the United Arab Emirates. His commitment to provide state-of-the-art facilities enabled NMC to be listed on the London Stock Exchange and included as a part of the coveted FTSE100 index. With the growth of the UAE’s expatriate population, he identified the need for a smart exchange solution to serve the money transfer and currency exchange market. He then ventured into the remittance and foreign exchange sectors, where he launched UAE Exchange and acquired Travelex, which have become global leading brands and are part of Finablr, a holding company listed on the London Stock Exchange. In 2003, he set up Neopharma, a state-of-the-art pharmaceuticals manufacturing facility with collaborations with multinational companies such as Pfizer, Merck, Abbot Laboratories, Hetero Pharmaceuticals and Biocon among others.
Diversified business interests led Dr. Shetty to open quality institutions in the education, hospitality and environment sectors. He acquired the Assam Tea Company in India, and established BR Life, a leading healthcare services brand headquartered in Bengaluru, India. Dr. Shetty currently operates multi-specialty healthcare facilities in India, Nepal, Africa and the Middle East. His many business accomplishments and social work earned him a medal from the Abu Dhabi Awards, the highest civilian honor bestowed by the government of Abu Dhabi, and the Padma Shri award, one of the highest civilian awards bestowed by the government of India. The late Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, former president of India, conferred upon Dr. Shetty the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award for his outstanding contribution towards the betterment of the NRI (Non-Resident Indian) community.]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the vision behind BRS Ventures, and how has your current portfolio developed into one that has a significant global presence?</h4><p>BRS Ventures is a holding company with diversified business operations across several strategic sectors that include Healthcare, Financial Services, Pharmaceuticals, Education, Vegetable Oil, Hospitality, Tea and Environment. The organization is headquartered in Abu Dhabi, although it has now established a global presence. NMC Healthcare, UAE Exchange, Travelex, Unimoni, Neopharma, BR Life, and Assam Tea Company, are all well-known brands. You will note, that many of my business ventures render a service to the public. This has allowed me to expand and explore opportunities in developing countries and engage in sustainable philanthropy.</p><h4>Addressing a gap in the provision of services to the community has been a central theme and philosophy behind your businesses. As your portfolio broadens, how does this theme remain constant?</h4><p>If you have quality, affordability, and are ethical in life, then money will follow. This is my lifetime mantra. Healthcare has always been a mainstay of my business ventures. We aim to provide a quality and affordable service in the most ethical manner. We acquired a 100-bed hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. We have expanded it to 650 beds. With proper management, systems, and discipline, we can develop further. Our staff have been instrumental in this growth. Moreover, we assist countries experiencing crisis. We have gone to Afghanistan, Nepal, and Iraq. Looking forward, these are countries that also exhibit growth opportunities. I am currently building a maternity and children's hospital as there is demand for these in developing regions. I make these decisions based on my intuition. I learned these lessons through market studies. Consequently, it is all about how you think. Either you are optimistic or pessimistic. This comes with experience. I believe that the human touch must always remain constant, placing humanity before everything else has always been my philosophy.  </p><h4>What would your advice be for entrepreneurs and foreign investors who wish to become successful in the UAE?</h4><p>Entrepreneurs should be like an elephant. They should be strong enough to stand on their own legs. They should have a long nose to sniff out what is going on. They should have small eyes to see what is happening and big ears to listen. They should remain quiet then roar. Elephants protect each other. Originality is the key for any promising entrepreneurs. They must have a unique concept in mind. Expo 2020 is not far off. This should deliver a major sentiment boost across the whole economy. The UAE is one of the most open and business-friendly nations in the world. This is complemented by world-class infrastructure.</p><h4>Can you explain the listing of Neopharma in relation to the growth trajectory of your ventures? What is your outlook for the next decade?</h4><p>It is our plan to list Neopharma in 2022. It would join NMC Health and Finablr which are already listed on the London Stock Exchange. I want to share my success with others and gain resources to invest in facilities. The London Stock Exchange is the preferred exchange for these activities due to liquidity and also my credibility. We are one of the only two home-grown companies from the region to list on London Stock Exchange. We are the first in the FTSE 100 index. We see healthcare and education as the key areas of development. Education has the power to improve the lives of people. If you educate the people, this will make the difference. I want to provide education online. Online education will help in India where I intend to start a medical college. When I came to the UAE, I did not have much. The opportunities I have had to become successful are thanks to the UAE's benevolent rulers, royal family encouragement, the government's initiatives, support, and presence. This is why I have decided to give back, by sharing my success with those in need. Abu Dhabi will continue to flourish as a hub for innovation and creativity. We are fortunate to live in a society such as the UAE's.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Almost 400 Clients in Mexico]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[gabriel-aparicio-country-manager-kelly-services]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of Mexico in the global business strategy of the company?</h4><p>Mexico is extremely important to the company; the country's operations are ranked between fifth and seventh of the group's global business. Mexico is among the first 10 countries for Kelly and is an important operation for Kelly globally. We are celebrating 30 years in Mexico, have a presence in 17 industries, and are extremely diversified. There is no industry we do not work in. The industries with the greatest investment in the country are the automotive, aerospace, high technology, science, natural resources, and financial industries. We work in these six industries, which is why we have over 12,000 employees in Mexico. It is practically the whole country. We do not have physical facilities throughout the country, but representatives. We have operations on site, and this sets us apart. Since we are close to our clients, we can understand first-hand the needs of the client and how the service we offer should evolve.</p><h4>How does the new labor reform affect the industries where you have a presence?</h4><p>The labor reform has extremely positive benefits. There was no reform of the Federal Labor Law of these dimensions for a long time. More than 500 articles mainly related to labor justice and freedom of association were reformed. This is a consequence of the USMCA, the trade agreement between Mexico,  US, and Canada. It was important to modify the labor laws in order to ensure similar circumstances for negotiations between the three countries. Mexico has had a high level of manufacturing for many years. Freedom of association puts all three players on equal footing and allows them to compete with other regions of the world in better conditions.</p><h4>What is the next step for Kelly in Mexico when it comes to human resources?</h4><p>The world of work is changing, and Kelly gets it; this is something important that we have to consider if we want to remain successful. After 73 years, Kelly Services seeks to identify the way people want to work today. Kelly Services is rebranding accordingly. Kelly is looking for a situation in which talent is more empowered than ever. In Kelly we believe in promoting independent work and non-traditional working styles to match the new workforce dynamic. The world of work is evolving toward independent workers. Workers are not looking to stay at one organization for many years, in contrast with previous generations. The talent today is searching for experiences, knowledge, and a company whose values match theirs. We must accept that today's talent is much more qualified. Talent seeks to enter the world of work but also wants a good work-life balance. The new generations does not live to work but work to live. This concept is changing the dynamics of work. A worker can even contribute to more than one organization at a time.</p><h4>What has been the response of national and international companies in Mexico to non-traditional work structures?</h4><p>The independent work scheme is different to the flexible work scheme. Independent work in Mexico has certain limitations because it is not regulated. One of the reasons why organizations do not adopt independent work styles is that they are afraid of falling into non-compliance. On the other hand, they have not understood it culturally, and subsequently have not developed processes that help them in its implementation either. Independent/ Non traditional work is not opposed to traditional work, it is complementary. In Mexico, organizations seek to take the first step. First, they seek to promote formal work and then move toward non-traditional work styles. Non-traditional work means flexible schedules and home office situations. Mexico has already taken the first step as a country. Article 311 of the Federal Labor Law already considers telecommuting or home office options. We are evolving in that direction, though we cannot promote independent work until it is properly legislated for. We are behind in comparison to other places, but we are on the way there. Kelly Services surveyed more than 200 decision-makers in different industries globally in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa (MEA), Asia Pacific, and America. The results showed that 65% of those decision-makers already use independent workers. Asia Pacific is the most developed region in this field, followed by EMEA and then Latin America. Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico are more developed than the US alone in this regard. Today, one-third of the world's workers are freelancers. According to statistics, in the next five years, work on demand will grow by almost 20%. Workers do not want to be in organizations for a long time anymore; they want to invest in their training and development and look for work-life balance while developing a bright future for their careers.</p><h4>What plans and goals for growth does Kelly MX have for 2020?</h4><p>The growth of the economy was 0.1% in 1Q2019 but 0.3% in 4Q2018. 2019 did not represent a growth in sales, but a growth in productivity and efficiency. We see better results, and this is extremely positive. Next year, we will not grow by double digits. We will have conservative growth with less than one digit, but we expect that. We hope the stability generated by the actions taken by the government will be reflected in the coming years. We have high hopes that we will see positive things. The Mexican business sector supports the government, and the government is keen to maintain a dialog with the sector nationally and globally. We must get to work; such periods in the economy are always opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[eng-abdullah-aldubaikhi-ceo-bahri]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Kingdom strives to be a key logistics hub on the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. As the country's main ocean carrier, what role do you envision for Bahri here?</h4><p>As the flag-bearer of Saudi Arabia's fast-growing maritime commerce sector, Bahri has been playing a leading role in materializing the Kingdom's logistics and transportation ambitions through continuously enhancing its services, strengthening its market presence, and opening new trade routes for greater access to global destinations. We have aligned our long-term strategy with the Saudi Vision 2030, which envisages transforming the country into a pre-eminent maritime hub in the world. Accordingly, we have been exploring new avenues of opportunities to take this vision forward. Looking ahead, furthering the depth and breadth of its product offerings will continue to be a key area of focus for Bahri for the remainder of the year and beyond. Our immediate priority will be to enhance our logistics services portfolio to enable Bahri to weather cyclicality challenges in the shipping business and capitalize on new opportunities in the market. We have plans to enter the third-party logistics (3PL) and fourth-party logistics (4PL) business. Our aim is to provide door-to-door services and a complete solution for our customers. Effective and mutually benefiting partnerships have been a key driver of sustained success, and therefore, we place significant emphasis on finding the right partner before venturing into these new products and services. Our collaboration with Bolloré Logistics, one of the top 10 logistics companies in the world, to establish our joint venture, BahriBolloré Logistics, is a perfect example of such strategic partnerships. With this JV, Bahri has been able to provide end-to-end logistics and supply chain management solutions to local and international firms operating in the Kingdom via air, land, and sea transportation.</p><h4>For Bahri, oil and chemicals are still the primary cargo. How do you envision developing your portfolio?</h4><p>In addition to the strategy to increase the scope of our logistics services, we have laid out plans to further enhance our transportation solutions by strengthening our credentials in oil transportation. We are also keen on diversifying our business with a view to increasing shareholder value and boosting our contribution to the Kingdom's endeavors aimed at maximizing local content. With the objective of developing an indigenous shipbuilding industry in the country, Bahri has established International Marine Industries (IMI) in partnership with Saudi Aramco, Lamprell, and Hyundai Heavy Industries. The joint venture maritime yard project is currently underway in Ras Al-Khair and is tipped to be the largest full-service maritime facility in the Middle East and North Africa with a capacity to manufacture annually four offshore rigs, over 40 vessels including three VLCCs, and service over 260 maritime products. It is aimed at promoting the logistics and transportation sector, creating thousands of new and sustainable job opportunities. Major production operations are expected to commence in 2019, with the facility reaching its full production capacity by 2022. Similarly, gas transportation is a key component of our product portfolio. We have a 30% share of Petredec Limited, a company specializing in the trade, transportation, storage, and distribution of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).</p><h4>How are you advancing on integrating more technology and innovation operations?</h4><p>Technology and innovation are at the heart of Bahri's DNA. We have adopted technology-enabled systems and processes in every aspect of our operations. Marine ERP software PAL and Oracle have been instrumental in driving efficiency across the company. We also place importance on data analysis, which is extremely important in the transportation industry. For instance, if we reduce the speed of one of our vessels by 5%, we will reduce fuel consumption by 10%. If we arrive three days ahead of schedule, we will waste three days waiting for our slot to load or unload. This is why we have integrated Big Data into our business processes. We are increasingly leveraging insights hidden inside the massive data to enable smarter and faster decision-making in order to improve operational performance and efficiency. Data intelligence also comes handy in managing our large, state-of-the-art fleet, boosting the safety of our vessels and crew, improving the quality of our offerings, in addition to increasing customer satisfaction. Similarly, one of the main operational costs associated with the transportation industry is fuel, and we do a great deal of data analysis when it comes to planning, optimization, scheduling, and routing. Due to the significance of the extra value that data brings the maritime business, shipping companies are increasingly partnering with IT companies to develop data-driven solutions.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for 2019?</h4><p>At Bahri, our aim is to become a total solutions company that caters to the varying needs of our customers. In line with this goal, we are currently working on a number of partnerships and projects, which we will announce soon. In fact, we have already been chartering airplanes and using trucks for shipments. Also, we are pushing ahead with our strategy with great emphasis on the sustained expansion of our market footprint and the diversification of our business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AECOM has a longstanding presence in the Kingdom with a portfolio consisting of high profile and landscape-defining projects like the development of the Jeddah Stormwater Drainage Program and the modernization of King Khalid International Airport. How would you characterize AECOM's experience and expertise in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>AECOM is a global business with a local presence, which is our defining characteristic. We have centers of excellence around the world that focus on various parts of infrastructure. At the same time, we are trusted partners in various geographical locations. AECOM employs 87,000 people worldwide, allowing us to cover significant ground. Here in Saudi Arabia we deal primarily with large infrastructure projects. One of the transformational projects we've delivered is the Jeddah Storm Water Drainage Program, which has alleviated many of the flooding issues the city struggled with for a long time. This project really enabled us to showcase our large project delivery capabilities and demonstrate our commitment to the Kingdom. Currently, we are delivering transformative projects related to project management organizations for various Saudi ministries, overarching management and front-end services for the mega cities, and are supporting the aviation industry to prepare for explosive growth in passenger numbers. We also lead the digital transformation charge within the country. Some of that work is being performed on projects in the holy sites with an emphasis on enhancing the experience in transportation mobility, urban planning, and urban economics. Overall, we support the efforts of transformational change within the country. Within AECOM, we have high-level corporate commitment to Saudi Arabia, and we have defined the country as one of our key growth markets globally. Our chairman and CEO has made it clear that all the resources needed to support our clients in the Kingdom will be made available. Furthermore, we have a truly diverse employee base and we are committed to creating as many opportunities as possible for Saudi's young talent to contribute to their country's transformation. We strongly advocate for an increase in female participation in the workforce and have signed an agreement with Princess Nourah University to recruit more female Saudi engineering graduates. This is a great example of knowledge transfer and our focus on gender diversity.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia has announced a range of mega projects, aimed at housing, leisure, entertainment, and also complete new city. What is your vision for AECOM to be involved in upcoming megaprojects?</h4><p>There are so many projects that it is impossible to be involved in every single one. We must be selective and determine where we can bring the best value to our clients and where the best fit for AECOM is. Based on this logic, we are already involved in some capacity in most of the announced mega-projects, be it through the delivery of environmental impact assessments, master plans or project management. These projects are moving on accelerated schedules, requiring us to be constantly flexible and innovative to meet our clients' demands.</p><h4>How can AECOM play a role in Saudi Arabia's digital transformation agenda?</h4><p>At AECOM, we place huge value on innovation, and this emphasis on innovation differentiates us. We are not in the engineering commodity business but in the thought leadership and delivery excellence business. We also want to be on the transformative end of infrastructure services. In Saudi Arabia, we focus a great deal on innovative techniques and methods for the early phases of projects. We deploy 5D modeling, AR and VR tools, digitally-enabled and 5G-ready infrastructure, and cybersecurity solutions. We are also pioneering AECOM's 3D-printed housing concepts. We are a leader in environmentally responsible and sustainable urban planning and resilient infrastructure solutions. Clients here demand the best; they seek thought leaders and transformative technologies. Many of the areas being developed are greenfield sites meaning they aren't encumbered by the usual constraints that cities typically face. We have a blank slate, and we can do everything right from the outset. We can build future-proof infrastructure that meets the demands of Saudi's young and growing population. From this standpoint, there are no limits to what clients here will consider. They are extremely open-minded and keen to explore cutting-edge technologies. On the concept and delivery side, AECOM has a great deal to offer.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for the coming years?</h4><p>AECOM is essentially an infrastructure consultancy. Whatever one can imagine to be part of the broader forms of infrastructure, we are engaged in it. We are doing front-end design and detailed design, as well as providing consultancy services while also being engaged in operations and maintenance. The future of the AECOM business in Saudi Arabia this year and the next can be broadly described as supporting the project set-up phase. This encompasses front-end studies, process design, and master planning. To meet the demands and schedules of Vision 2030, we will also need to get ready for the detailed engineering and construction phases. Some of the mega projects will start to break ground this year and move into the construction phase, further underlining the speed of changes in the Kingdom. We are also seeing major opportunities in supporting the aviation sector. In the next three to five years, we will see the work currently in the set-up phase, transform into real capital projects being delivered in the field. Saudi's ambitious growth plans are challenging the engineering and construction industry, particularly in terms of the talent required to support large project delivery. For AECOM, resourcing involves our global workforce, but it also engages the universities in the Kingdom. We are developing a generation of young Saudi professionals, who can support their country's efforts to build for the future. We are being treated as partners within in the country, and this means we must deliver a model for a sustainable and professional workforce.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[riyadh-al-zamil-chairman-mark-satchell-group-coo-all-entertainment-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>All Entertainment Group (AEG) manages a diverse portfolio of companies in the family entertainment and event sphere. Could you give us an overview?</h4><p>MARK SATCHELL: In 2016, Saudi Arabia introduced the General Entertainment Authority (GEA), which has done fantastic things. It has put Saudi Arabia on the map and made it a serious contender when it comes to international entertainment content. At the same time, it has done it respectfully and has not gone too far over the line too quickly, as it has been a gradual process. Thus far, there have been events like the Formula E, with live acts like The Black Eyed Peas and David Guetta. AEG identified a big gap in the market, as most international events were bought in together with the entire supply chain. During the buying process, we were not necessarily getting the best service that we should be delivering to the people of Saudi Arabia. Next, we decided to bring in companies to form an entertainment group to assume full control over costs and, more importantly, quality. We strive to provide the best value for money experience. We are trying to build an industry from within; we do not want to continue to bring loads of international acts over that could already be done here with young Saudis. Illuminate, as an example, is an LED dance show from New York, though we already have two Saudi LED dance shows up and running. These are of great standard, though perhaps they do not command the fee they deserve because they are not international. Our mission is to bring them up to the international level and ultimately have them perform abroad on all the main stages. We are aiming to creating an industry both within and outside of the Kingdom.</p><p>RIYADH AL ZAMIL: For us, it is not just about making money, but rather about having an actual social impact and taking the opportunity to improve lives—that is what we want to be our legacy. There are many new companies in the entertainment sector, though we are truly local and have 10-15 years of experience. We understand it is not just about the show, but also about the entire supply chain, including construction, manpower, crew, AV, and F&amp;B. We believe in importing expertise rather than re-inventing the wheel, so we wanted to play the role of mediator between international knowledge and local talent. This was aimed at creating the right mix to serve this market and build the supply chain that has international standards with a local feel. Localization is part of what we dream of and, fortunately, we were able to establish a joint venture with many unique international concepts. We were amongst the first companies to move into the entertainment sector long before it was on the government's agenda. Our first company was an entertainment agency that focused on corporate events, and we have a great story with SABB Bank that got us started. Other companies realized that such events are part of the social fabric within a successful organization and followed suit. We were able to introduce corporate entertainment to Saudi Arabia, and our next mission was to activate areas for entertainment-urban activation. Grenada Mall was the first entity to sign with us to handle all its entertainment.</p><h4>What are your upcoming plans to create shows and events with a strong local presence?</h4><p>MS: Moving forward, we believe in a mix of getting shows from inside and developing local talent. We even believe we can bring a Saudi show abroad, for which we have the Saudi Orchestra called 'Sixties until Now,' a musical with all sorts of dances and music since the 1960s with a conductor, several actors, and a narrator who brings the story together. Now, Kuwait, Dubai, and New York are asking for it, so it will be the first local orchestra that will go international. Squares Events is another company under AEG that is focused on concept development, and a range of international shows. The company is almost entirely staffed by Saudis who are enthusiastic to create entertainment for their peers. Our task as management is to help them turn their dreams into reality with investments and seed funding. The common factor of AEG is that although we have separate companies, we are all connected through management and exchange of ideas. That said, the teams have a great deal of freedom, which is essential in the entertainment world.</p><h4>How do you create and organize your own shows and events in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>MS: The important thing to remember with any form of creativity is to never squash it, as restraining creativity is a silly idea. At AEG, anyone can come to us with an idea. Sometimes, the most bizarre idea turns into the most beautiful products and shows. That said, we are not interested in creating pure entertainment, as we would like to create something with a message and a social experience. For the National Day 2017 celebrations, we created an event called Saudi Glow, which basically started as a brainstorm in the boardroom and became an amalgamation of all the different ideas. Instead of organizing it in the main cities, we brought the event to Hafr Al Batin, Abha, and Unayzah, and in each city we had 15,000 attend every single day. By the end of the weekend, we had reached out to 90,000 people. People who were possibly to western eyes religious people were dancing and celebrating, which is what the beauty of entertainment is. Rather than pure entertainment, there was a message of celebrating Saudi traditions. The responses to these shows have been incredibly positive, and people are grateful that they do not have to travel to see them. We love to create positive memories, whether it is through visual performances, sports, interactivity like breakout rooms, or edu-tainment, with concepts like Mad Science.</p><p>RAZ: When it comes to the supply chain, we have built up an ecosystem of sister companies to support any new initiatives. AEG is part of RAZ Group, which is essentially an empowerment company with around 90 entrepreneurs who founded and developed their company under our holding. We aim for synergies and jump in for mentorship and consultation where necessary. When they are up to speed, they can become sub-contractors or we can partner in another way. Generally, we do not believe in competition in our sector; rather, we find ways to collaborate. We were the first to invest in Grenada Square, which was just desert at the time, and we activated it into an entertainment zone. When Time Entertainment had the opportunity to bring Cirque De Soleil, we offered them our land, which benefited us as well as it increased the value of our property.</p><h4>In recent years, the public ecosystem around culture, entertainment, and sports has expanded, with GEA, GSA, and a range of megaprojects. What is your assessment of these developments, and how do you interact?</h4><p>MS: We have an extremely positive relationship with the government. I have absolutely no qualms that AEG will work with Qiddiya, Diriyah Gate, Red Sea Project, and NEOM; it is only a matter of time. At this time, however, there is a great deal of their focus on large international companies, which I completely get and support. It should be our task to make sure they know about us and that it is though our responsibility as a Saudi company is to reach out to them and show them our capabilities, which we will do.</p><p>RAZ: Vision 2030 strives to promote Saudi businesses and engage with the youth. We have a Saudi company that is driven by the youth. We were the first, and we are here to stay. Things are moving fast, and one should be nimble to move as the first. Since we started, we have focused to be a family entertainment group, and our success factor has been that grandfathers and grandchildren can come together. We have special activities for those in retirement homes and orphanages to have a broad social impact.</p><h4>What can we expect in the coming 18 months?</h4><p>MS: In terms of international content, there are some extremely famous brands that will come to Saudi, hopefully by the end of 2019. We also have a strong focus on creating more content locally here that will eventually go to the outside world. The orchestra is a great example of that, which we aim to take to APAP in New York this January, and which is the main meeting point to trade shows. If we go the coming year, I believe it will be the first-ever Saudi show on sale to the rest of the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the University of Birmingham's role in Dubai's higher education ecosystem and broader economy?</h4><p>DE: The University of Birmingham is the first UK Russell Group university to establish a campus in the UAE, and the first Top 100-ranked institution to open in Dubai. As a research-led university, our vision and ambition for our academic mission is complementary to the UAE and Dubai's vision for the future development of the knowledge economy. We chose Dubai to establish our first international campus because we recognized Dubai as a place that supports the kind of academic endeavors that we pursue, because of its intersections with the rest of the world and because the Dubai government's mission aligned with ours.  We hope that our commitment to Dubai will act as a catalyst for other institutions of our quality and ranking to see Dubai in this way in order to start the next tier of quality, credibility, and support of the Higher Education environment. The UAE knows it needs to build its own research capacity in order to tackle underlying challenges facing the region and its people. To realize Vision 2021, Vision 2030, and Vision 2071, the advances that need to happen in scientific understanding and in the knowledge economy are fundamental.   Attracting more research-led universities of Birmingham's calibre will help Dubai to tackle these big challenges by bringing more specialist knowledge and expertise to work together and focus on the challenges and opportunities facing the country, the region, and its strategic partners. As a global university with a civic outlook, the University of Birmingham is committed to playing our part in supporting the UAE as we drive economic progress through knowledge and innovation, whilst contributing to the development of a growing international education hub in Dubai.  Our commitment to the region is perhaps best demonstrated by work underway to create a purpose-built, 50,000m2 campus in Academic City.  Set to complete in 2021, it is designed to encourage collaboration across all academic disciplines, with flexible learning spaces and formal teaching spaces ensuring teaching and research can work in tandem to benefit students and the wider society. There will be a 300-seat lecture theater, a similarly sized auditorium and three laboratories accommodating 200 students, along with seminar and tutorial rooms. The innovative and iconic buildings have been designed by Hopkins Architects, and will be located opposite the city's first purpose-built student housing community.</p><h4>What unique contributions does the Dubai campus bring to the University of Birmingham's global operations?</h4><p>DE: The University of Birmingham is a global University.   We have been delivering teaching internationally for many years, particularly in China and Singapore and have welcomed international students to our UK campus since we were founded in 1900.  While our primary competitive base is in the UK, increasingly we are looking at our global competitiveness in developing our academic mission.  The establishment of our first large-scale and fully rounded university campus (teaching and research) in Dubai cements this global ambition. As a research-intensive university, the volume, scale, and level of our research means we can contribute to advancing knowledge on big global challenges whilst enhancing our reputation, improving our metrics, and continuing to compete in a global landscape. It is strategically important for us to ensure that the University of Birmingham continues to grow our international influence and reputation in developing and delivering on our academic mission.</p><h4>How did you decide to enter Dubai's higher education landscape?</h4><p>GW: The University of Birmingham already has a global reach through research partnerships and teaching happening in different parts of the world. However, it has never had a physical footprint outside the UK. For us, this was the right time to take this next step for a number of reasons. Significantly, we cannot underestimate the extent to which this is both a business decision and an academic mission decision. We wanted to go where our impact would be maximised. Dubai, and the UAE more broadly, have an approach centred around diversification and developing a knowledge economy. In addition, Dubai offers a strong credible educational hub and is well positioned for us to reach out to our key strategic recruitment markets. The UAE and Dubai show strong long-term market growth potential, as well as offering a safe and attractive location for students to study. It is interesting that since our entry into the market, a number of other UK universities have also begun to actively look at the UAE as a possible destination. This gives us confidence about our early thinking.  </p><h4>How does your proposition differentiate you from other universities?</h4><p>GW: The University of Birmingham Dubai is 100% owned and managed by the University of Birmingham. This offers us a level of autonomy over the academic mission, and over the student experience that we create, that we would not have if we had gone with a partner. It also gives our stakeholders confidence that they are dealing with the University of Birmingham, and not a franchise partner. Second to that is our research focus. The University of Birmingham is renowned for research excellence. Since being founded in1900, 11 Nobel Prize recipients have walked through our doors. Five of the winners have received their award since 2001. We have established our research excellence in a wide range of different fields, from pioneering organ transplants, to playing a significant role in the detection of gravitational waves, to improving our understanding of Shakespeare (through the work of our Shakespeare Institute back in Stratford-upon-Avon). Our commitment to research forms the foundation of everything we do. Finally, there is the quality of our educational offer. We were very clear when we decided to set up our Dubai campus that we would not compromise on quality. For this reason, the standard entry criteria for the two campuses is the same. We teach the same programs, with the same modules. Often, it is the same academics teaching on both sites. This is important for maintaining the credibility of our offer. Essentially, this is the first time that students living in and around the Dubai have been able to access a Russell Group education from a UK campus based in the UAE.</p><h4>How does University of Birmingham leverage the research-led approach to enhance collaborations?</h4><p>GW: All research-intensive universities collaborate, whether it is with government, industry, the third sector, or other universities. It is how we deliver against our core mission. It is how we deliver our big discoveries and how we make our contribution to the societies in which we are embedded. During the first phase of our operation, many of the early collaborations are likely to involve our home campus. We also have a tremendous amount of research capability in Birmingham and many research interests in the region match well with areas of our expertise. In fact, many areas of the UAE's vision for 2021 and beyond are aligned with aspects of the University's research endeavour. Already, a number of academic colleagues from the UK campus have been over to the UAE to explore opportunities to collaborate. We have been assessing the possibilities and a number of discussions have developed in key areas, some at the more advanced stages. However, research takes longer to establish—in building the partnerships and the funding streams—to build impact, and we are therefore looking carefully at how we grow our in-country research capacity as well as draw on our expertise from our UK base. A key part of the vision for the Dubai campus centers on developing our local research capacity.  Even though the year-one priority for the Dubai campus was the successful launch of our new programs, we have also been focused on growing our research capability. For example, we recruit someone we are not just looking at their teaching experience but also their academic track-record, including their research pedigree. We want to understand what problems have they been working on? How do they plan to develop their scholarship going forward? How do they plan to generate those networks that are so important for the evolution of their disciplines and for making that broader social contribution?</p><h4>What are the University of Birmingham Dubai's plans for growth?</h4><p>GW: We have made a long-term commitment to Dubai—our ambition is to develop at scale and comprehensively in terms of our education, research and civic contribution to the region. In our first year, we recruited at least as strongly as any new international branch campus in Dubai, but we are not complacent. It is year two and we are focused on growing our student numbers. This ambition to grow is not just about maintaining our financial sustainability. Universities thrive on their student body; having vibrant cohorts make for a dynamic and exciting student experience. We are investing sensibly to grow from a relatively small scale at an aggressive pace but to do so in line with a managed plan in order to deliver a sustainable business result. To support this growth we are investing in our people and our physical infrastructure. We started with 11 programs and have already extended that to 18 for the coming academic year. We are delivering programs all the way from Foundation level to Masters' level to postgraduate talks and programs. Over the next few years, we want to develop our reputation in four key areas: engineering and the physical sciences; business, management and law; healthcare and well-being; and, of course, education. We are keen to make sure we offer the brightest and the best all the opportunities available, no matter their level. Meeting the University of Birmingham's mission and ambition of building a Russell Group university at scale in Dubai, expanding and developing our research base informed by the needs of the region, and making a civic contribution that is connected to the UAE, is equally as important as the role of the campus in continuing to grow our global impact and influence. We are actively pursuing Ministry of Education accreditation. This is important to us as a civic university and if we embed the University in the fabric of the place in which we are working, we are far more likely to be successful. Ministry accreditation is important part of this process and opens up the possibility of government research funding to work in partnership on some of the challenges here. In order to be a driver and engine of an economy, the research and academic endeavor is coupled with the funding and the innovation of industry and the policy context of government in order to make the advances that the nation needs on its policy direction. This is the influence strand of our work, as we seek to be that partner to government and industry to create longer-term, harder-won innovation. That civic part of what we do is an incredibly important part of our mission, and when our Vice-Chancellor talks about the 30-year lease on our new building, we are already communicating our length of investment and commitment. We are not only looking at Vision 2030 but also aligning ourselves with the UAE's Vision 2071.</p><h4>Why do more students from the region choose Dubai over other international universities?</h4><p>GW: Some of it has to be to do with quality, and some of it will be to do with the environment. For example, we have seen some students who previously only considered going overseas but, for a whole host of reasons, have found the idea of living and studying outside the region challenging. They now can access the highest quality overseas education in a GCC country. The other factor is the Ministry of Education and accreditation, which would mean Emirati, Saudi and other GCC students can use scholarships in order to study, which is an attractive proposition—as is the Dubai lifestyle. A postgraduate student can spend the weekend in Dubai studying International Business or International Commercial Law, and then return to work for the rest of the week. This is a great mix, which many students are keen to take advantage of.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Acıbadem digitized its patient information systems across all of its group hospitals. How did this improve patient care services, and how do you ensure the security of this system?</h4><p>Acıbadem follows and applies the latest innovations in the digital world. In addition, Acıbadem transforms the know-how in this field into the products. We have Turkey's first and only integrated system on digital pathology. We are the first healthcare group to provide digital radiology and paperless processes. These are only a few of the firsts we provided in this field of work. Our doctors can record all the treatment processes relating to their patients on the system. With this, we create a faultless and traceable digital process between the physician, the nurse, and the pharmacy. Thanks to our digital recording system, all healthcare professionals, especially our physicians, can manage the diagnosis and treatment processes more quickly and efficiently. This helps increase the satisfaction of patients and their relatives. With this digital system, protecting the privacy of patients is of the utmost importance. For this purpose, we have developed advanced security systems. On the other hand we have developed the practices that have received prestigious awards in the international arena such as arranging appointments from digital media and accessing health records via our online system. In addition our own digital medicine management system, Astore is a computer operated drawer structure works integrated with our hospital software. In this way it prevents confusion for the patients which are staying in the hospital by providing them with the correct drug to be taken out of the store and applied to the patient.</p><h4>Acıbadem also operates internationally. What are the greatest challenges in operating in countries that have different legal arrangements and health systems?</h4><p>Acıbadem has been serving outpatients from 21 hospitals in four countries; we have a total of 14 medical centers and 30 representation offices in 18 different countries. We provide direct health services in Bulgaria, Macedonia, and the Netherlands other than Turkey. Each of these has different systems and dynamics in relation to each other. An interesting aspect of the health sector is that although one may operate in different regions, the fundamental problems they face are similar around the world. For example, we operate in 10 countries as IHH, though the problems we discuss on our board of directors are usually the same. We encounter the lack of qualified health personnel, growing costs, ways of using efficient work models against raising costs, as well as the impact of health policy and practices on the private sector. When making investments in a country, it is important to understand the relationship between the private and public sectors, as well as the payment system in the country. In some countries, we have a strong and sound foundation of general health insurance, while in another country we have the exact opposite. In addition, the health sector is subject to a high degree of regulation from many different angles. Because of that, one has to provide the best service by prioritizing both patient safety and patient health. In the meantime, you plan and expect to earn the return you desire. This is not an easy task.</p><h4>Acıbadem's entry into Bulgarian and Macedonian markets was through acquisition, whereas in the Netherlands it began its operations independently. Why were these separate models selected? Which model will Acıbadem use in its international growth in the coming future?</h4><p>When you enter a country, you evaluate market entry options from many different angles, and many different factors can play an important role. For example, both Bulgaria's and Macedonia's health sectors are among the growing countries and are way behind in terms of regulations in comparison to Turkey. In such cases, the fact that there are already profitable elements within a certain quality of service makes it a reason for buying. Besides, it is crucial to have local partners, especially in acquisitions, that understand both the country and the health sector well. The presence of partners who live there and are familiar with the dynamics of the country is an important catalyst for one's goals. The Netherlands has a relatively highly developed socioeconomic structure, and its health insurance system is fairly developed. Using this structure in the Netherlands as a guide, we wanted to test ourselves by investing in an already developed country for the first time. In summary, we took our model to both Bulgaria and Macedonia. Within the framework of our growth strategy, we prefer to move forward with both new hospital construction projects and possible acquisition projects. I foresee that our growth strategy abroad will continue on these foundations. This will vary slightly depending on the country and the conditions in which we aim to enter into. Our growth strategy focuses on regions close to the areas where Acıbadem operates, rather than focusing on certain countries. In this context we can count the Balkans, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, and North Africa.</p><h4>In addition to technology, Acıbadem's employment policy and working culture have played important roles in the establishment of the same standard of service in all of its group hospitals. How has Acıbadem University contributed to the group's employment policy?</h4><p>Acıbadem is working very hard to provide the best, the highest quality service with the best managers in the field of healthcare. We are a group which does not deny the importance of teamwork is behind success; so we have worked to build our team with the spirit of teamwork in every aspect of our company. This enabled all our employees to feel part of a whole and it strengthened their sense that they belong with us. As a result, today we are training our own managers. Some of our nurses that we trained during 2000 are now working directors in our largest hospitals. Similarly our employees who come from different functions such as quality management, patient services, budget planning and internal audit are currently working as hospital directors. This shows that an employee who starts at the lowest level in an institution can work on the highest level of management positions. This creates role models in the organization and ultimately increases the motivation of the staff. There are no “turnovers“ in the senior management and we do not lose managers. In this way we transfer the history and the traditions of the institute to the new generations and emphasize the importance of corporate culture that we show to our employees. Acıbadem University, which provides education in the field of health sciences and reflects our pioneering and holistic perspective in the health sector, is my social responsibility project. With a capacity of more than 4,000 students and with a 100.000 square meters of indoor space, it operates only as a health sciences oriented university. It educates health professionals of the future with its world class academic and technological infrastructure. In this sense, Acıbadem University has a very important function in the terms of training qualified human resources which can race against rest of the world. Young people that are graduated from different faculties are not only doctors, but they are also nurses, health technicians and administrators. As a result, individuals blended with Acıbadem culture at the start of their educational lives continue to be a part of our family. In this respect, I can say that Acıbadem University has a serious complementary power.</p><h4>What is the role of Acıbadem University in educating doctors in the region and in Turkey?</h4><p>Acıbadem University is one of the best health science universities in the whole world. In addition to our strong academic staff, we also have our CASE Clinical Simulation and Advanced Endoscopic and Robotic Surgery Training Center, one of the most advanced medical simulation training centers in the world. We demonstrate our difference with our advanced technology student laboratories that offer practical training in the associate and undergraduate programs. CASE, our center of clinical simulation, is accredited by Europe and the US. It is also one of the two centers in the world that has a certificate of excellence. One of them is Acıbadem University and the other one is University of Toledo in US. In four years, more than 15,000 specialists from abroad have been trained in this simulation center. Acıbadem University's School of Medicine is the medical school you need the highest test scores to apply to.</p><h4>Over the next 12 months, what are Acıbadem's primary objectives?</h4><p>2018 was a difficult year for our country as a result of the economic fluctuation and the devaluation of the lira in the second half of the year. Nevertheless, we managed to increase our revenues by 32%. The volatility in foreign exchange had a negative impact on our foreign currency debt. Nevertheless, Acıbadem has always been succeeded in getting out of crisis. In 2019, we are taking important steps to reduce our foreign currency debt and strengthen our balance. Probably in a short period of time, through the refinancing of our loans and through capital increase in the company, we plan to minimize our risks by reducing both our foreign currency debts and our remaining debts in more favorable conditions. Thus, Acıbadem will be ready to make significant progress in the near future as a strong balance sheet and cash generating company. We have two hospital investments in Istanbul, and we continue to work on them. We are doing it slowly to see what is ahead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the goals of your new warranty platform and what it offers?</h4><p>The Latin American market is currently being oversupplied by Chinese steel. Acesco has been successful in offering the highest quality steel to supply the industry for the last 49 years. The trade war between the US and China has created a price war, with China pushing down prices for a product that looks similar to ours but is a different quality standard based on the amount of zinc it blends in the steel. Our new warranty program “Telo Garantiza“ sets out to help the market identify the huge difference between a high-quality product and what we currently see coming into Colombia. We are the first warranty program specifically for the steel industry in Colombia, with a warranty scope of up to 25 years being offered in all our products, including our popular roofing and painting products. The program is a great effort from Acesco to teach the market the difference, protect our brand, and outline the importance of high-quality steel.</p><h4>What are the benefits of the transportation management system (TMS) program and the mission of transparency and innovation?</h4><p>The logistic infrastructure in Colombia is 20 years behind the standard in Mexico or Brazil, so logistics here are a complicated issue. 90% of the fleet is owned by small owners who go through transport companies, which is different to Mexico, where companies own fleets. In Colombia, it is a very informal sector, which makes it challenging from a transparency perspective. Our logistics team sought to improve the visibility of our trucking operations by creating a TMS platform that offers timely arrival updates, checkpoint documentation, pictures of how the merchandise was loaded, direct access to the driver, and a platform to register any complaints. We are the only company in Colombia that hires only one transport company with its own logistical TMS platform, and as such we have reduced delivery times by 50% and improve our service coverage by 20-basis points.</p><h4>What was the inspiration behind the Ozone Generation project, and how is Acesco making it a priority?</h4><p>This is one of our brand programs for the future that we launched in early 2019, and we are taking great steps to grow in that business model. Colombia recently approved the Asbestos Law; the country currently has around 600 million sqm of asbestos roofing, which accounts for 50% of the market. This asbestos roofing must be handled by a specialized company, since it is a toxic material. Most of this roofing was made 30-40 years ago, when structural laws were different. Most distribution centers and factories with asbestos roofing also need structural renovations since they do not meet the regulations. We are leading a coalition of companies to work together and offer a packaged service that includes the uninstallation of this hazardous material and the redesign of the roofing structure with a bioclimatic technique using our best products. We are designing the roof to allow for solar panels, and we are also offering service financing products with very attractive interest rates. This is being led by Acesco in partnership with other companies.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the main drivers of growth in the local economy, specifically for Acesco's industry in Barranquilla?</h4><p>In 1980, Acesco was located in Bogotá, and our founders decided to move strategically and expand. At the time, Barranquilla was still small with no big industry though it had potential due to its proximity to the sea and Magdalena River, which makes Barranquilla the port of entry for merchandising. The other reason is for exports, as Barranquilla is the closest place in Colombia with a reach to the US and Caribbean markets. Though the recent laws from the US have closed its market to us, traditionally 10-20% of our production is for export. This also applies to the industry in general. Barranquilla is one of the few cities in Colombia that has the land and territory to grow by three times. The government is conducting a study to determine the best way to develop the city in the next 50 years. All these initiatives will take Barranquilla from potential to reality as the best place to locate one's industry.</p><h4>What does your recent Arquitectura Prix Award for the Edgar Renteria Stadium mean for the company, and what exciting projects are in the pipeline for 2020?</h4><p>We are extremely proud to have participated in this project with structural products and roofing. The attraction is the roofing because that project was one of the first where we used our new painting technology. The stadium will look new for the next 25 years, and this is our guarantee. We did not expect to win this award, as it is a small stadium though it complies with all the specifications of Major League Baseball. When we talk to any construction company, we always say their project should be iconic. This project was financed by a Colombian group hired by the same company that built the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Regular Automobile Insurance 25% of Peru Market]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[rodolfo-garcia-solorzano-director-qualitas-seguros-peru]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What areas of opportunity in the Peruvian market motivated Quálitas to acquire HDI Seguros?</h4><p>We were already looking to expand to South America when HDI Seguros called our board president to talk about the opportunity to sell their company in Perú, so we went to have a look at the company. Establishing a company from scratch in Peru takes a couple of years because you have to obtain a complex number of permits. Considering this, we decided it was better to acquire an existing company. This marked the first time Quálitas bought a company to enter a market. We are already present in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, and the US, but we have always grown organically in other markets. In that sense, this is a different model and way of managing our entry into a new market. What motivated us to enter Peru is that there were no specialized insurances companies. All the companies in Peru that sell motor vehicle insurance also sell property, casualty, life, and health insurance. Therefore, we think that establishing a company focused only in automobile insurance would have a good start and be able to improve the market. Another factor is that Peru has a compulsory personal injury/traffic accident insurance. Equally significant, regular automobile insurance only makes up 25% of the market, meaning we can work to obtain that remaining 75% uninsured market share. This means we can sell a lot of new motor insurance policies.</p><h4>What differentiated the Peruvian market from the Mexican market?</h4><p>First, in Peru people see car insurance as a commodity, because all the companies have the same product.. Second, insurance companies in Peru do not have all the service structure that we provide. In Mexico we have our own adjusters and call center, on the other side, mechanics, car companies, and so on are all third parties. With all that we can make a difference. Nowadays, people look at the price and not the service, that's the reason why . Therefore, if we provide a better service we can take a bigger share of the market . Our business philosophy in Mexico are costs control and excellent service and we are trying to replicate this in the Peruvian market.</p><h4>Will Quálitas replicate the acquisition model again to enter more countries?</h4><p>Yes. We are not planning any acquisitions soon, but we might do it if we have an opportunity in the future. For now, we want to focus on the markets we are already in.</p><h4>Through what kind of strategies does Quálitas plan to become number one in Peru?</h4><p>We are currently ranked fifth and plan to become the number-one automobile insurance company in the medium term. We expect to have 2% of the total market share in 2020. Moving forward, we will be growing faster because part of our strategy is to have a lot of offices. We want to begin establishing more offices in Peru in 2020. Lima represents 30% of Peru's automobile insurance market so naturally we aim to establish more branches there. Moreover, we want to increase our presence in other important cities as well as smaller cities, as we have done in Mexico. We have 400 offices in Mexico and in Peru we plan to establish around 30 branches within the next five years. We want to be close to our clients because in that way we can manage their insurance and solve their problems swiftly. This approach is one of the key factors behind our success.</p><h4>What is your overall impression of the company's first year in Peru?</h4><p>The majority of Mexican companies aim to expand into big markets such as the US, Asia, or Europe. We are happy to be in Peru. This is our first time in a South American market and it is completely different. In Peru, 75% of the car market does not have insurance, which means we don't have to fight with our competitors to gain market share. Quálitas has entered Peru to grow the Peruvian insurance market. We do not want people to switch insurers; we aim to encourage higher insurance sales and open new markets here. We need to make people aware that insurance companies are there to pay claims. We want consumers to know exactly when we pay out and why. We also want to help to promote safer driving in Peru as we do in Mexico. Outside Africa, Peru is one of the countries with moredeaths from car accidents. The government is keen to address this issue and we are willing to help them. Unlike other insurers we do not increase our premiums based on age or sex of the driver. Moreover, we are targeting university students to encourage them to buy car insurance because they are going to be the leaders of the future. We want them to remember that Quálitas Seguros Peru was there for them when they began driving.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Burhan Almarifa is a platform for information and knowledge transfer. Could you tell us more about the organization?</h4><p>Burhan Almarifa was established in 2014 with a vision to elevate the legal profession in the Kingdom. Initially, as with all passion projects, there was a specific project in mind. Naturally, as we gained experience and insight into the sector, we started to understand that the needs of the legal sector are far bigger than what the original project was. Burhan Almarifa has two business pillars: transfer of knowledge and consultancy, the purpose of which is to develop initiatives and programs that will support and advance legal professionals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This will eventually promote specializations and expertise within the legal sector, whether in business law, intellectual property law, international humanitarian law, healthcare law, or environmental law, to name a few. One such initiative is SLC, which was inaugurated last year. We are also developing different training programs, publications, and digitalization projects for both the private and public sectors to promote cross-sector collaboration. This eventually extended to developing consultancy services that range from benchmarking and advising on regulations drafting to global strategic positioning of different initiatives. In order to fulfill our mission, we started establishing the Burhan Network, which forms working partnerships with companies that are leaders in their fields both internationally and locally.</p><h4>What do you envision for SLC in the next 10 years?</h4><p>SLC positions itself as a platform for the transfer of knowledge from worldwide and national experts to our community on the key topics of the moment. The more important aspect of SLC, however, is the discussions that take place during the conference and recommendations that stem from those discussions. This is the first professional platform in the Kingdom that brings together policymakers, judges, lawyers, the private sector, and students to debate and discuss matters pertaining to their profession. In 10 years, I hope SLC is viewed internationally as the platform to gain knowledge on the legal trends of the year, that those discussions are led by Saudi experts, and that the recommendations SLC generates are substantive, practical, and effective to help develop the rule of law and truly elevate the legal profession, both nationally and internationally.</p><h4>Why are IP and fintech the themes of SLC 2019?</h4><p>The overarching theme of SLC is “Reinforcing a sustainable and inclusive business environment." With Saudi Arabia being party to a large number of IP international agreements and conventions, its obligations as a WTO member, the massive boom in new businesses and the influx of foreign investment into the Kingdom, protection of IP rights is a major topic of concern. Fintech, on the other hand, is a highly specialized, yet massively used, sector that is developing far quicker than the regulations that would regulate it, not just in the Kingdom, but internationally. Fintech is thought of as an independent sector, when in practice it touches upon almost every other sector. It is important to understand the issues that surround regulating this field, as we need to find the fine balance between too much regulation that may hinder future development and enough regulation to protect the consumer, whether individual, entity, or state.</p><h4>When you say Burhan Almarifa's vision is “to elevate the legal profession," what do you mean by that?</h4><p>Worldwide, every sector is unique, and every market is unique. The Kingdom is no different. We are, however, distinctive in the rate of which the number of lawyers is growing. This gives us a competitive advantage in the sense that we have a relatively large young working force that is technologically savvy and has the potential to be leaders and experts in their respective fields. At Burhan Almarifa, we strongly advocate specializing within the field. We believe that transferring international expertise to our legal practitioners will ensure the effectiveness, efficiency, stability and development of the legal sector in the long run.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Clear Strategy]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[armando-donazzan-president-orange1-holding]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies have been put in place to ensure Orange1 Holding is the leading European manufacturer of electric motors, foundry, and turning parts?</h4><p>From the beginning, the strategy was to be the best player in the market and have a complete range of products for the business. In the first phase, from 1998 to 2008, we tried to grow internally. However, it was difficult to do this because the market where we are is competitive. We acquired CEG in 2009 and another two competitors in our market, Unielectric and Elprom, in 2011. With them, we reached EUR80 million in turnover. The strategy was clear: to acquire competitors and look at different segments so that we could offer a full portfolio to our customers. In 2014, we had the chance to acquire a company in a different sector, the die-casting business, and the first one was called Metalpres, which had a plant each in Romania and Italy. We are a one-stop shop—our main customers in the electric motors business also use die-casting parts. At the same time, during this period we bought other two companies in die-casting, and we now have four companies. We also acquired other three companies in the business of electric motors, and thanks to these companies, we arrived at EUR120 million. In the business of electric motors, we produce we produce motors from domestic applications up to wind generators and we are specialized in customized products. In the die-casting parts, we are both in the business of industrial as well as automotive, where we produce for many customers such as FCA, Renault, BMW, and Daimler with a turnover of 90 million euros. Our last division is turning parts, and we acquired a company in 2015 in order to produce precision-turning parts for different kinds of applications such as hydraulic and water pumps. That is a company that will have a turnover of EUR10 million this year.</p><h4>How do you see your acquisitions evolving in the future?</h4><p>We have acquired 17 companies over the past 20 years, and the next step is to reduce the number of production plants from 15 to a maximum of 7/8 in 2020 and to consolidate. We have to be quick in terms of new technology and provide great service; this means we need to meet customers' demands. Mainly, we prefer to stay with medium to small customers. We need to work on constant stock and predict what we will need as some products require eight weeks' notice. We need to be strong and efficient in such a situation.</p><h4>What markets are the most important for you, and where do you want to be present?</h4><p>The most important market for us is Europe, mainly Italy and Germany. Other than that, we are strong in the US, though we also deliver all over the world. In the future, we want to be more focused on other countries, but Germany and the US will remain major markets for us. These are the two countries where we want to push hard to offer our products.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the company's journey toward reducing its impact on the environment?</h4><p>For a company like ours, sustainability is the future. There are of course some limitations on the products we are doing because they are custom-made. We have the technology and we offer the best products that we can with high efficiency, though sometimes the main driver is still the price.  We are launching new high-quality motors, I4 and I5, and this is because we want to be ready.</p><h4>What roles do digital transformation and technology innovation play for Orange1 Holding?</h4><p>In electric motors, we do not see any possibility in such innovation. We are still looking in the business of die-casting because there are many possibilities preparing prototypes. The strategy is to have such digital equipment to be faster in terms of developing the prototype for this business, though it is not possible for electric motors because there are some materials at the moment that are impossible to remove.</p><h4>How have your origins in Veneto influenced your international profile and performance?</h4><p>Veneto is an amazing area because there is a huge culture here in terms of work. Veneto is a great place not only for owners but also for the employees, who remain close to the company. Veneto is an excellent place to conduct business as one can find anything they need.</p><h4>What can we expect from Orange1 in 2020?</h4><p>2020 will see consolidation. I prefer to have a better EBITDA, so consolidation in 2019 and 2020 will give us a strong base to launch a new program. From 2021, we will be ready to acquire more competitors and we'll start evaluating the possibility to open our capital to new partners and within 2025 to place the company on the Milano's stock exchange. What is important for us is the marketing strategy we have done in the last four years. When we acquired many companies, we had a different name. However, we created the brand Orange1 because we felt the need to introduce the brand in the market. We worked hard on marketing and linked our brand to Lamborghini.  We are one to its main partners. We are proud to say Orange1 won many important races such as 24h Daytona twice, Sebring, BlancPain European Championship. We won against all the biggest automotive players like Mercedes, Ferrari, Audi, BMW and are extremely proud of the partnership with Lamborghini. In August, Lamborghini produced 36 new HURACAN cars in the USA that were launched with our livery. This was amazing as it is a tribute of our partnership.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is Mexico for Chiesi's overall business strategy?</h4><p>Mexico is one of the most important countries in Latin America for Chiesi in terms of potential and evolution of the market and environment. Mexico can be a great opportunity for Chiesi Group. We started in Mexico almost seven years ago, and our portfolio in the respiratory line is now complete, including several products mainly for asthma and COPD.</p><h4>What are the main opportunities in the local health market?</h4><p>The key opportunities are bringing innovative products into the market. Many products have been approved by US or EU medical authorities. They are innovative products that can truly change the lives of patients, including new combinations of existing drugs as new formulations. Chiesi can contribute to improving the Mexican healthcare system by being listed among government institutions, while also working with private markets to increase coverage and to reach the highest number of patients. Rare diseases also represent a recent strategy for Chiesi Group. Chiesi made several acquisitions of companies over the last seven years in order to establish this pillar. Many of these programs are approved and are on the European market. In Mexico, we need to conclude our regulatory exercises with COFEPRIS in order to finalize the registration in Mexico and hopefully to bring in rare disease products. Unfortunately, every country has its own regulatory flaws, and the new procedures in Mexico could take months or years to develop.</p><h4>What kinds of rare diseases is Chiesi focusing on?</h4><p>We have several products for diseases that are unfortunately not well known and, therefore, do not have any treatment options available in the market right now. By working on rare diseases, we want to improve and save the lives of patients all around the world. The key aspect of our business is figuring out how to help institutional payers to reimburse these treatments.</p><h4>What is your perception of the health regulatory system, and how can it be more efficient?</h4><p>We are in a kind of transition year right now, between the old government institutions and the new ones. Many things have changed in the last nine months. The new government had many ideas on how to reform or restructure healthcare. We need to have a new panel of stakeholders in COFEPRIS, as well as in the key governmental institutions. But the situation is still in progress. We do not have the final picture yet. Many changes have been necessary. COFEPRIS is an internationally recognized institution, with peculiar agreements with American, Japanese, and European FDA. This is an advantage because, in many cases, it allows us a regulatory fast track for innovative products already approved in Europe or the US. In terms of changes in the way the government is buying products, this is becoming more complicated than in the past. We need more experience and time to understand the new dynamics, which are moving in the direction of having a more transparent system with fewer complicated procedures. Pharmaceutical companies have a significantly higher level of exposure than in the past complicated by day-to-day work, tenders, distribution, and collection of credit. If you cannot collect cash, it will hurt your business.</p><h4>What is the breakdown of your business between the public and private sectors?</h4><p>Chiesi Mexico does almost 70% of its business with governmental institutions. Amid the changes happening in the government procurement processes and the delays in tender publications, we are trying to involve ourselves in the new dynamics. It is more complicated than in the past to be involved. The risks can be much higher now, so the companies will have to revise internal procedures and flows to comply with new tender relations.</p><h4>How is the government's prioritization of social needs affecting Chiesi in Mexico?</h4><p>What we can comment on is the way access is generated now, which is expected to be different than in the past, with the deceleration of the universal healthcare system. This is something that still needs to change. The universalization of the healthcare system is not yet there. The provision of social security to 20 million uninsured Mexicans is not yet there. There are still processes to go through. It is going to be a long reform. We have a long way to go still. However, there has been a change in procurement activities and the way the government buys from pharma companies. We do not have an impact from prioritization, but we are affected by the way products are required. For example, the new law is centralizing procurement by the government, which means someone else has to take care of distribution. In a big country like Mexico, special logistics are needed to bring a product from one point of the country to another. This is not easy, and there are specialized distributors with the know-how and logistics instruments to do that. The next logistics flow expected by the new procurement procedures does not include all these unique elements to the industry.</p><h4>Why did Chiesi launch its triple treatment therapy for COPD first in Mexico?</h4><p>We had the honor of launching TRIMBOW® in Mexico for the first time outside Europe thanks to COFEPRIS agreement with the European Medicines Authority (EMA). The product, already approved by EMA, was immediately recognized by COFEPRIS, which allowed us to complete all regulations in a timely fashion. It has been a benefit for Mexican scientific community but, moreover, for patients. If you suffer from a common but severe disease like COPD and you are not satisfied by existing drugs, you want a new product to be available as soon as possible.</p><h4>What new products and services are you planning to launch in Mexico in the coming months?</h4><p>We will launch the first of our rare disease products, after sorting out the regulatory procedures. This will be the first milestone for Chiesi Mexico in rare disease and will hopefully be the first of a long series of launches over the coming years. We want to make our products available where they were not previously available. Mexico is a complicated country in terms of patient access to medicines. We hope to work together with the government to develop sustainable access models. I wish for the new government to understand the real concept of buying pharmaceutical products. The cost of treating a patient using the most innovative products in the world may sometimes be more expensive but can help the total cost of treatment. All in all, it is a completely new approach based on patient's benefit: the real savings for institutions comes after getting a complete view of the entire treatment cost.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[20 Years in Italy]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[carlos-manuel-veloso-dos-santos-director-general-amorim-cork-italia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Amorim Cork is the world's largest producer of cork stoppers and 2019 marks the company's 20th anniversary in Italy. Would you give us a brief overview of your operations in Italy?</h4><p>The Amorim Group was established in 1870 and will be 150 years old in 2020. Amorim Cork Italia has been in Italy since 1999, when I founded the company with a local partner. Since then, we have taken a long road to become market leaders by a long margin, with our biggest competitor's revenue being around 50% of our turnover. We have sold more than 600 million corks in Italy, a market of around 2 billion corks. Amorim Cork Italia is growing every year, partly by acquiring its competitors' market share but also by absorbing part of our growth in certain segments of the Italian wine market, such as Prosecco, which represents around 550 million bottles. Amorim acts globally but operates locally. Amorim Cork Italia is a good example of this because 40% of what we are selling in the Italian market is produced in Conegliano. The rest 60% goes directly from our parent company to our customers. This mix allows us to serve both big and SME customers.</p><h4>The cork stopper industry has been threatened by the arrival of alternative stoppers made of plastic and aluminum. What are the competitive advantages of corks?</h4><p>Single-use plastic stoppers are no longer a threat because the market has gradually rejected it. The consumption of plastic stoppers has been decreasing over the last 11 years. At present, the market consumes around 1.8 billion plastic stoppers compared to 12 billion cork stoppers and 5 billion screw caps. Our primary competitor is the screw cap segment. Screw caps are an easy-to-use commodity, but do not give value to the wine, whereas cork gives a great deal of value. For the basic wine segment, which falls below the USD30-mark, a study published in the US found that cork stopper is the key factor in a customer deciding to buy a particular bottle. For customers with little knowledge about wines, the cork is an indicator of the quality of the product. Another factor is sustainability. A normal cork retains more than 300g of CO2 during its lifespan, so by purchasing a wine bottle with a cork means you compensate for the CO2 contamination resulting from wine production.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on why cork is an example of circular economy and tell us about Amorim Cork Italia's sustainability efforts?</h4><p>Cork is a good example of circular economy because it results in no waste. We use all the waste to produce products for the construction, automotive, space, and shipping industries. For example, cork is used to make pavements; even the dust we create during production is used to generate energy. In 2011, we decided to collect used corks and give them a second life. For example, we have created a new furniture collection made with used corks. This will be a kind of revolution in the concept of cork recycling because today in Italy more than 1 billion corks are thrown away annually. We can use these corks to make many things, including insulation panels. We want to prove that you can produce high-value, well-designed items with corks. We aim to commercialize these products and establish a new system of circular economy.</p><h4>Amorim has offices in 22 countries. What is the particular importance of Amorim Cork Italia to the Amorim group?</h4><p>We are by far the largest branch of Amorim outside of Portugal and probably the third-largest company in the global cork industry. This success is firstly because we are located in the biggest wine producing country in the world. However, Italy is not the biggest bottler; it sells around 30% of its wine in bulk. On the contrary, France sells less wine in bulk and more bottles. However, each year Italy is moving the balance in favor of bottled wine. So probably in the next few years Italy will become not only the biggest producer of wine, but also the biggest bottler of wine. Amorim Cork Italia is working together with the local wine industry to develop new services to be able to assist with this. Unfortunately, with the situations unfolding globally, such as Brexit and the US-China trade disruptions, wineries cannot make predictions about production and future trends. They need a partner who can adapt and provide service on short notice. In line with this, we are trying to become more specialized and offer just-in-place and just-in-time services to the local wine industry.</p><h4>What makes the Veneto region unique as an investment destination?</h4><p>The Veneto region is very rich in terms of production, but probably less so in terms of market entrance. One example is the Prosecco phenomenon. Prosecco sells in three main markets—the US, the UK, and Germany—though this is a product that is so interesting for so many other countries. Investors are now coming to buy wineries and develop businesses, but I think more investors could do this because it is a great market with a product that works very well. We are talking about a product that has the potential to reach 1 billion bottles. There are many opportunities, but mostly for people with a global view. Overall, there is still an agriculture-based approach but moving forward, the industry should adopt a more global vision and promote the product in a different way.</p><h4>In July 2019, the Conegliano-Valdobbiadene Hills were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list. How will this impact the Prosecco wine sector in the region, and how is Amorim Cork Italia able to capitalize on this?</h4><p>The sector needs to learn how to live with this UNESCO classification because we do not have the structures in place for tourists to visit the region's wine producers. For comparison, the Champagne region has not that attractive vines, but the wineries there steal the show. In our region, the vines are fantastic but the wineries are just warehouses with bottling plants. There needs to be a change in mentality in approaching this because the tourism potential is huge. Moreover, the region is located close to Venice, which is basically a tourist magnet. Amorim Cork Italia is ready to play its part in building the region's future. We are only using 70% of our capacity in Conegliano and are willing to invest more. We are interested in continuing to invest not only in the Veneto region but in other parts of Italy as well. We sell our products throughout the country with a distribution network of 50 agents.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2020?</h4><p>We will continue to grow. Amorim Cork Italia will close 2019 with around EUR70 million turnover, and in the next five or six years we can reach an annual turnover of EUR100 million. So far in 2019 we are growing by 11%. This will continue in 2020 because we are looking at a great harvest. Italy is highly competitive in foreign markets so we will perform well. We will continue our success together with the success of the Italian wine industry. Based on all this, Amorim Cork Italia has a great future in Italy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Gewan Island to Be Completed by 2022]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[turki-bin-mohammed-al-khater-chairman-united-development-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>UDC is one of the leading public shareholding companies in Qatar. What are your main areas of activity and key milestones in recent years?</h4><p>Since its inception 20 years ago, our company has sought to play a key role in the development of the State of Qatar across a variety of industries. Our activities span numerous fields, including real estate development, property management, infrastructure, and utilities, as well as maritime and hospitality related businesses. Across these various industries, we have focused on investing in long-term projects that contribute to Qatar's growth and provide positive shareholder value, such as The Pearl — Qatar. In recent years, the Island has been the focus of numerous development projects that feature residential units, office spaces, retail outlets, entertainment facilities, award-winning marinas and beaches. More than 350 retail brands are currently operational on the Island, occupying more than 115,000sqm of leased retail spaces. By the end of 2021, we expect to accommodate close to 50,000 residents. UDC has recently completed numerous milestones in the ongoing development of the Island. These include the construction of Al Mutahidah Towers,' the completion of construction, and the delivery of 10 villas in Giardino Village. We have also seen to gated compounds in Floresta Gardens and Giardino Village, as well as the awarding of operator and construction works for “United School International.“ These developments, among others, have been coupled with the expansion of our offerings across the Island. They help serve a fast-growing population and an influx of tourists, all while initiating the development of our latest venture, Gewan Island, which will span across 400,000sqm. Once completed, this new island, with its 712 units, including apartments and different kinds of villas, will accommodate 3,500 residents and 3,000 daily visitors. The Island includes a golf course, an air-conditioned outdoor Crystal Walkway, which acts like the Island's spine, green parks, retail areas that will attract new brands to Doha, entertainment facilities, a sports club, and a mosque.</p><h4>What is the role of your company in developing the State of Qatar?</h4><p>Since its establishment, UDC has been committed to advancing the objectives of Qatar National Vision 2030; a commitment that is reflected in our core values of developing sustainable projects that contribute to the diversification of our national economy and in our diverse activities to promote Qatar's tourism industry. The development of The Pearl-Qatar, our flagship sustainable island, which grew into a local and regional business and tourism destination, helps the whole country. It is a prime example of our contribution to positioning the State of Qatar on the regional and global map of outstanding real estate ventures. Our success in this regard is evident in the large number of awards we have accumulated over the years as well as the accolades recognizing The Pearl-Qatar as the go-to destination of modern living, business, and entertainment. In this context, our focus is to attract an increasing number of visitors to The Pearl-Qatar through our annual events, as well as our efforts to grow the number of retail outlets and brands on the Island. Our investment in the provision of public and private services to the Island's residents and businesses through dedicated directorate. Our various subsidiaries are also contributing to advancing this objective. At the same time, we have launched our newest project next to The Pearl-Qatar; our 400,000sqm Gewan Island. This island will add a new destination to Qatar's tourism sites and attractions. It will also attract businesses to invest in the country, which is a pillar of our Vision 2030.</p><h4>Diversification remains at the core of the business strategy of your company, as well as in the objectives of Qatar National Vision 2030. What are the most appealing sectors to continue diversifying your business portfolio, and how does UDC plan to penetrate them? </h4><p>UDC owns a number of subsidiaries that form synergistic businesses, particularly when it comes to the real estate market. These companies have expanded their operations in recent years to offer our clients top quality services that continue to attract new residents and retail investors. These subsidiaries are Madinainova, which serves the needs of property owners and residents of The Pearl-Qatar as a community manager, facilities manager and registry services provider. Then there is The Pearl Owners Corporation (TPOC), which acts as the manager of the Co-Owners Associations, which was established by UDC. Third, the Hospitality Development Company grows, owns, and operates world-class hospitality businesses on the Island. Finally, Ronautica Middle East operates Porto Arabia Marina at The Pearl-Qatar. This is the largest marina facility in the Middle East, with a capacity of up to 891 berths.</p><h4>Qatar will be hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2022, which will require a strong investment in real estate, and will attract numerous visitors, creating a strong tourism sector. How is UDC contributing to the development of the country in that direction, enabling it to cope with the demands required?</h4><p>At UDC, we believe that Qatar represents an attractive investment destination, particularly when it comes to the real estate sector. Qatar's attractive business environment, emerging tourism sector, and growing expat communities are fueling demand in the country's property market. All of these preparations are driven by a diversified economy and USD200 billion worth of investments in infrastructure projects in preparation for the FIFA World Cup 2022. The Pearl is going to be the same Pearl as it is now; however, there will be other hotels coming, so that means more places to have restaurants and have fun. The Hilton has been completed and there will be other hotels going up. We currently have Marsa Malaz Kempinski and we have a number of hotel apartments already available. We will host a large number of visitors to the World Cup, so we are providing many units here. We need to work with the committee to hammer out the details, but we are ready to host, and we have enough facilities to do that. UDC is also contributing to the promotion of the State of Qatar as a leading regional tourism destination. Our successes include annual events at The Pearl-Qatar and attracting over 350 retail brands to set up shop on the Island. These locations feature some of the world's most luxurious dining outlets and leading hotels such as the Marsa Malaz Kempinski, which offers 281 rooms and the development of a new, luxurious hotel in Marsa Arabia. These developments are all attracting a growing population of visitors from the region. Having said that, I should note that we plan to finish Gewan Island before 2022. On Gewan Island, there will be some additional retail shops and restaurants, as well as some recreational opportunities also, including a golf course and branded apartments. There will be Crystal Walkway, where there will be some restaurants as well as apartments and retail shops. It will be air-conditioned, and it is shaded, but it is not fully shaded. There will be residential villas and most of them are already sold. There are private islands and they have also been sold. Villas are being sold for QAR 45 million (USD 12 million), which is high. But the problem remains a lack of supply for villas.</p><h4>What has been the international recognition of the project?</h4><p>In 2018, The Pearl-Qatar was named the 2018-2019 “Best Mixed-Use Development“ by the prestigious Arabian Property Awards. While the London-based International Finance Magazine named UDC as the Best Real Estate Development Company in Qatar in 2018. In 2019, we added two prestigious new accolades to our list of honors at The International Property Awards. These include the “Best Mixed-Use Development Award“ for The Pearl-Qatar and the “Commercial High-Rise Development Award“ for UDC Tower. This is within the Qatar vision, and one of the economic pillars in the vision is to provide a project that is in an area that has something for everybody. What we are doing at the Pearl-Qatar we are doing in a smaller scale in Gewan Island, with some additions.</p><h4>What are your plans for the year ahead?</h4><p>In 2019, we will pursue our development projects across The Pearl to further enhance the ambiance of the Island and attract new investors, residents, retailers and visitors. These projects include the construction of “United School International“ in Giardino Village precinct. This school will help meet the needs of the community at The Pearl-Qatar and its surroundings. We are also going forward with the development of Floresta Gardens precinct, which will include residential towers, villas, and a shopping center. Finally, we are seeing to the development of Giardino Mall. It will be home to international brands as well as luxury residential development projects. UDC will also continue with the development of Gewan Island.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the effective welcome and farewell committee to nearly every visitor to Dubai, how do you manage this task, and how does your approach align with Dubai's brand?</h4><p>From the beginning, DDF has always had the dual mission of promoting the Dubai brand and the DDF brand. We are delighted to have established our brand identity from the early days, and DDF is now synonymous with quality, choice, service, ambiance, and value. We currently operate a total of over 40,000sqm of retail space at Dubai International Airport and Al Maktoum International Airport and employ over 6,100 staff, who are the best trained staff in the world, serving 89 million passengers in 2018. We have been, and continue to be, committed to investing in a wide-reaching marketing campaign that is aimed ultimately at “Turning Flyers into Buyers." In 2018, as the operation celebrated its 35th anniversary, 2.5% of its turnover was dedicated to its marketing campaign. And over the past year, DDF has continued to invest in a communication strategy that covers event management, sports sponsorship, industry sponsorship, advertising, public relations, media relations, promotions, and community projects that give DDF and Dubai the exposure that will put us on the map.</p><h4>How is DDF looking to expand collaborations beyond the airport, and what does innovation look like for DDF?</h4><p>While the successful running of the shop floor is our major focus, we also promote Dubai to a global audience and, along with many other entities, aim to retain Dubai's reputation as a leading business, leisure, and sporting capital. In terms of sports sponsorship, one of the highlights was the DDF Tennis Championships, which has been running for 27 years and is owned and organized by DDF. 2019's tournament saw Roger Federer claim his eighth Dubai title and 100th Association of Tennis Professionals singles career title, which resulted in massive worldwide coverage. Media analysis show that the two-week tournament generated an estimated USD1.3 billion worth of TV exposure for Dubai, of which USD445 million is for the DDF brand alone. We also support international horseracing events and paid two visits this year to Newbury Racecourse in the UK in April and September, as well as Ascot for the DDF Shergar Cup in August. June also saw the 12th DDF Irish Derby, which was held at the newly renovated Curragh Racecourse in Ireland. Also in Ireland, we attended the fifth DDF Irish Open at Lahinch Golf Club in County Clare.</p><h4>How does DDF continuously surpass expectations to create meaningful retail experiences, and how do you anticipate retail to evolve in Dubai?</h4><p>As the leading retail experience in Dubai, we have consistently looked at ways to improve our retail offerings to an increasingly diverse passenger mix. We have collaborated more with our suppliers and partners to ensure we deliver the right products at the right prices in the right location. This combined with a series of strategic promotions, both in the physical stores and online, has seen an increase in sales in core categories. Also, with the increased presence of e-commerce, our customers value individual service and staff with in-depth product knowledge who are able to make recommendations based on their requirements and communicate with them in their language. This is especially important for younger travelers who expect convenience and an individual experience. This includes an expectation to offer a fast and convenient check out experience, and we now offer a wide choice of payment options including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and AliPay. As our customers are constantly connected and thus comparing prices and product availability, we are conscious of offering great value and a wide selection of merchandise and relevant brands. DDF also launched a major digital marketing initiative in June as part of its 'Road to USD3 billion' vision. This initiative will see us invest in both people and technology to increase digital reach and improve our customer engagement and service, connecting with the airports' nearly 90 million passengers in a more effective and personalized way.</p><h4>With a 25-million-person surge expected due to Expo 2020, how is DDF gearing up for the unprecedented event?</h4><p>We are all excited about Expo 2020 and the site will truly be a fantastic event. Such figures of inbound travelers provide us with a fantastic opportunity to reach a global audience, and we are working with Expo on merchandising opportunities as well as other areas. We will have an Irish Village at Expo 2020, and that will be close to the Ireland Pavilion, so we can expect some collaboration there.</p><h4>Looking beyond 2020, what are your strategic priorities for growth in a dynamic sector?</h4><p>With the number of international travelers forecast to reach 1.8 billion by 2030, we are well placed as an industry to benefit. It is predicted that retailers will increasingly engage with customers online, for example via video content and augmented reality, perhaps as a preliminary way of visiting a physical store. However, we need to stay ahead of retail trends, engage with these travelers, particularly millennial ones, and ensure we have the right products at the right prices for an increasingly sophisticated shopper. From a sales point of view, Chinese passengers continue to be number one for us, accounting for almost 18% of sales. This is followed by India and Saudi Arabia, with a 13% and 7% sales contribution, respectively. There are 16 flights a day out of Dubai airport to cities in China, and providing that traffic continues, sales will continue to grow. The rising growth of millennials is influencing our communication as well as the range of products we carry. We have become more social media-savvy. E-commerce has been a game changer that we embraced several years ago. Now, we are investing greatly in redefining the online offer and introducing a number of marketing systems whereby we can interact much more with our customers before they travel and while they are in the airport. Our investment in digital technology over the past year will result in greater engagement with our customers, and we are looking forward to building on that in the year ahead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In September 2017, you were recognized among Africa's top business leaders. What is your advice and encouragement to your industry peers to be successful abroad?</h4><p>I was honored by the AfricanAmerican Institute with the award for Outstanding Business Leadership and my pioneering success in the establishment of Zenith Bank as well as the philanthropic work through the Jim Ovia Scholarship and ICT Entrepreneurs Program. Though the recognition is good, I have never done anything for the accolades. What I do, especially in the area of philanthropy, I simply do it for the uplifting and betterment of mankind. Most of my peers are all doing extremely well, so they do not need any further advice. I would like to encourage  them,  however,  as there is a serious need for more cooperation between us. Entrepreneurs in Nigeria are committed, dedicated, and focused on their business, and I encourage them to continue to display a high level of integrity and endeavor to promote governance and superior business ethics. On top of this, as businesspersons, we must respect and trust the regulatory agencies.</p><h4>In 2017, Zenith Bank overtook FBN as Nigeria's largest bank. What do you think was the key to last year's excellent performance?</h4><p>We are currently the largest bank in West Africa and one of the largest in the continent in terms of shareholders' funds and total asset base, which currently stand at NGN807 billion (USD2.64 billion), and NGN5.5 trillion (USD18 billion), respectively. We were also recently ranked 430th out of 1,000 top banks in the world by The Banker magazine. We have been able to leverage technology to boost our efficiency while striving continuously to exceed industry standards. I must also give credit to the enabling environment. Nigeria is very favorable for business success. The success of banks, and their profitability, is the measure of the success of any country's economy. If banks are not doing well, they will not be in the position to support industries or the economy. They will not be in the position to support economic growth or even manufacturing companies. Banks should be encouraged by government and regulatory authorities to continue to do well. It is a sign and a measurement of the progress of the economy of that particular country. There is general agreement that banks have an enormous role to play in the recovery of the economy.</p><h4>How would you describe the impact of Zenith Bank's operations on the Nigerian economy?</h4><p>Banks all over the world are catalysts that encourage the private sector as engines of growth in their role in providing support and financing. Zenith Bank is well entrenched within the fabric of the economy of this country. Our operations in and outside Nigeria have facilitated a whole lot of commerce across the globe, which has directly contributed to the economy. As a trusted financial institution and reliable brand looked up to by both local and foreign businesses, Zenith Bank has impacted the lives of so many people in Nigeria. The bank's reputation and excellent customer service has also contributed immensely to boosting confidence in the banking sector. This has resulted in more people engaging in formal financial services, in turn further building the economy.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Nigeria in 2018?</h4><p>We are all pleased that Nigeria has fully recovered from the recession and that the economy is now on track for growth. I am very bullish on Nigeria's macroeconomic outlook for 2018 for the following reasons: the global oil price has exceeded USD60 per barrel in the past several weeks, CBN has announced that foreign reserves have hit almost USD40 billion, and the employment rate has also begun to rise. These are all positive indicators that suggest a bright outlook for the nation in 2018. There is tremendous opportunity in Nigeria. It is arguably one of the best countries in which to do business and succeed. The economy is exciting; therefore, I will use this opportunity to invite and welcome prospective investors to do business in Nigeria.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do you expect air freight/cargo to play within the broader National Industrial Development and Logistic Plan and what are the key areas of focus for the aviation industry to position KSA as an efficient export platform and regional logistics hub?    </h4><p>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is strategically well positioned to serve and reach all key markets connecting to and from the Middle East. On a national scale, the urgency for change is mirrored and emphasized even more as we all align with the Saudi Vision 2030. We see air freight and logistics combined getting an ever more important profile in order to realize the Saudi government's long-term vision of diversifying its economy in variant ways that do not rely heavily on the oil sector. Saudi Arabia currently has 28 airports of which six are international. Out of the six, three are among the busiest in the GCC region, connecting the country to 81 international airports within 45 countries across the globe. The Saudi Arabian Government is rapidly modernizing its airports and expanding its air cargo facilities with the goal of increasing the total air cargo capacity in the Kingdom from circa 1 million tons a year to 6 million tons/year by 2030 and within this framework last year, Saudia Cargo invested SAR1.2 billion to rejuvenate its cargo stations in Jeddah and Riyadh, aiming to double the current cargo capacity,  enhancing our logistical capabilities in support to the Saudi Vision 2030 that aims to establish Saudi Arabia as a global logistics hub. Official statistics which were produced by General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) recorded the number of passengers that have passed through the Kingdom's airports in 2018, with 99.86 million passengers on 771,829 flights, through the Kingdom's international and domestic airports. In addition, we expect the air freight industry to play a crucial role on the broader National Industrial Development through increasing employment &amp; enhancing the national logistical capabilities. Saudia Cargo recently celebrated the graduation and the employment of the first batch of Cargo Future Cadres program which aims to empower Saudi youth in logistics &amp; supply chain sectors. </p><h4>As Vision 2030 seeks to achieve air cargo capacity liberalization, what is your assessment on the provision of PPP and concession contract opportunities for the development and operation of air freight facilities and where do the major opportunities for this type of engagements lie?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is unique in terms of engaging the private sector having stakes in major projects across the country irrespective of its financial capabilities to undertake those commitments on its own. The PPP (Private Placement Programs) and concession contract opportunities are very positive because it provides checks, balances, and accountability on the part of stakeholders, thus, ensuring the success of the projects' completion and sustainability. Given the future scenario of an increasing population in the region and more dynamic business activities, under the guidance of the Saudi Arabian Government, the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) has announced that all 28 airports around the kingdom should be privatized by 2020 in order to enhance revenues, improve customer experience as well as encouraging the best in class international operators, and increased private sector investments. Partnerships and opportunities in the construction of new airports and aviation infrastructure, including air freight facilities are immense. We are supportive of the model and positive drive and remain open to this philosophy and as such will further explore opportunities and partnerships in the future. In the framework of Public-Private Partnership (PPP), Saudia Cargo has signed a joint agreement with King Abdullah Port at King Abdullah Economic City, 90 kilometers north of Jeddah, to enhance collaboration opportunities &amp; establish a secure logistical operations zone. This agreement establishes an Air-Sea-Air cargo corridor with the surrounding airports to ensure a smooth flow of cargo to the port and re-export it by air in line with the Saudi Vision 2030 aiming to turn the Kingdom into an international logistics hub.</p><h4>Given the broad and interconnected scope of the air freight industry and Saudi Arabia's position between Asia, Africa, and Europe, what are some of the key international players and markets that Saudi Arabia, through Saudia Cargo, is looking at with growing interest to foster partnerships and why?</h4><p>Bridging the gap between the East and the West and beyond had always been the goal for Saudia Cargo. We continue to further strengthen our key markets in Africa, South Asia, Europe, Latin &amp; North America through new Interline partnerships and alliances with major international players aiming at bridging the world with a dedicated freighter fleet. In April, Saudia Cargo officially became the 12th member of SkyTeam Cargo which counts as its long-time members— Aeroflot Cargo, Aerolineas Argentinas Cargo, Aeromexico Cargo, Air France Cargo, Alitalia Cargo, China Airlines Cargo, China Cargo Airlines, Czech Airlines Cargo, Delta Cargo, KLM Cargo, and Korean Air Cargo. Our membership will give our customers access to a global network covering over 900 destinations in more than 175 countries. In return for that unparalleled access to a growing worldwide network, our company will extend SkyTeam Cargo's reach across the Middle East, Africa and the Indian subcontinent via our hubs in Jeddah and Riyadh, which was nonexistent prior to our joining SkyTeam. Such partnerships are very crucial in this industry where global connectivity is paramount today. Customer experience is of utmost importance to the industry and the customer is searching for reliability and timely delivery of their goods hence enhanced connectivity's will ensure meeting their expectations. Our strength lies in covering a wide route network and we believe in trade liberalization. We're ready to expand our wings domestically, regionally and internationally wherever there are opportunities and the need for our air cargo services.</p><h4>What are the major trends impacting the global air cargo industry and how are they incorporated in driving your strategic priorities for 2019?</h4><p>The world is fast changing and part of that rapid change is going digital. We believe that digitalization holds the key to growing the air cargo industry in order to speed up and streamline the process in the best possible way hence meeting and exceeding customer expectations. Many air freight carriers have formed partnerships with digital start-up platforms to give customers access to real-time quotes, a wide range of information about products and services and to easily track and monitor their shipment status. Saudia Cargo strives to enhance &amp; foster its capabilities thus last year the company represented Fly Pharma product to meet the growing demand for the efficient transportation of pharmaceuticals, moreover the company launched Fly Express service, &amp; invested in its infrastructure at Jeddah &amp; Riyadh Cargo stations in order to provide state of the art Ground Handling services in the Kingdom. This is something that we would like to explore further in the future as the air freight and logistics industry in Saudi Arabia grows. Speed and efficiency would dictate transactions of the future. Blockchain technology is another area that the industry might want to tap into. This financial tech method is already in use in many industries and is something that we could also benefit from in order to speed up the process and offer more transparency in a secure environment. We are also focusing on Back 2 Basics principles of simplicity and sustainability. Less complex instructions and SOPs and more aligned practical performance criteria ensuring the stability of performance controls and easy to use practices in order to deliver consistency, compliance, and reliability. We are of course re-emphasizing training and coaching of our people in order to build a solid platform for the future.</p><h4>An efficient transfer and localization of logistics technologies is a key requirement to drive economic growth in the Saudi air cargo industry. Looking at Saudia Cargo, where have technological upgrades brought the highest impact on your business model and what are other areas you expect to be affected the most?</h4><p>We're proud to say that Saudia Cargo was among the first in the region to embrace technology to promote business. We have embraced the electronic-airway bill, improved various other platforms like our new website and improvements and upgrades in our IT systems. We have also initiated a blog-spot where the latest developments and news about the air freight industry in the Kingdom and beyond are highlighted in addition to launching our new website providing our clients access to their shipment tracking through the E-Services section. We're strongly investing in this area because we believe the future lies in digitalization. By upgrading our technology and coping with the country's e-government 2030 vision, Saudia Cargo has managed to integrate internal and external parties as well as national and international stakeholders to drive more transparency, traceability and better data quality within the global supply chain throughout the shipment journey. Going digital and eliminating paperwork leads to expediting the shipment process, thus, positively impacts the economy. We are, however, fully embracing these targets and working closely with stakeholders to drive efficiencies in all areas and will continue to support all positive changes. Within digitizing efforts Saudia Cargo has fully gone cashless and announced that cash is no longer accepted at its stations, the company urged clients to use digital channels and different banking payment methods such as ATMs, SADDAD, Points of Sale (POS) and bank transfers. The going-cashless decision aims to give customers more flexible settlement options, save their time and improve the quality of services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some major highlights and changes in recent years?</h4><p>Last time we talked, we were still a start-up and had only been on the market for four years. We were just breaking even and growing our workforce to cater to the increasing demand for events on the market. We are now in our sixth year of operations and have grown to a profitable stage. We have been catering almost 400 events per year, mostly corporate and social events. Each year we welcome some 150,000 satisfied clients. Our diversification is around 70% social and 30% corporate. We were created to fill a gap in the market for a venue that offers comprehensive solutions, be they weddings, engagements, or graduation ceremonies. Later, we also realized that we could contribute to the corporate sector. We have been gaining the confidence of the government and the private sector. Many organizations have hosted forums, product launches, exhibitions, and press releases here. We have expanded to outside catering as well and are catering to all of the UAE. We have signed year-long contracts for catering with some clients and are in the final stages of selecting an operator for a hotel that will stand right next to the convention center. We have also been expanding our own host of events. We realized there was a gap in the market for corporate events, such as iftar meals during Ramadan: there were simply no venues large enough to host large numbers. We also organize and construct master classes. This is why we research the market and try to build something for which there is demand. So far, we have done cooking master classes, table etiquette, table setting, and much more. These attract around 20-30 participants over a few days. It is important for us to continue growing the expertise of our culinary team. We have over 50 chefs that work in-house. We constantly push them to compete in local and international competitions. Each year they bring back around 50 medals. What's more, our executive pastry chef is a permanent member of the UAE's national culinary team.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the hospitality sector in Sharjah?</h4><p>This is one of the best times for the hospitality sector in Sharjah. The Emirate has always been a pioneer in the fields of culture and education. The beauty of the Emirate has been well received by tourists and has opened up doors to investing in a whole new field. With the establishment of the investment authority, there is an entity dedicated to investing and making sure tourism and infrastructure develops. We just conducted a market study, and it was exciting to see the number of hotels in the pipeline. There will be almost 10 three- or five-star hotels opening in Sharjah in the coming years. The fact that we will be a dynamic player in the market is exciting, but also a big responsibility. We need to make sure we provide what the market needs. We have to make sure the surge of new hotels does not conflict with each other in Sharjah. </p><h4>What is the biggest challenge for the sector?</h4><p>In the hotel business, the fact that the city is alcohol-free can be a problem. However, I am happy to see that giant international operators find a different way to make their hotels work. Sheraton has found ways to compensate for the fact it is dry with family packages, which are luring in a lot of non-Muslims. A lot of visitors, or even residents, may not think of Sharjah as their first option when they want to shop or have a staycation, but Sharjah is working around this and finding its own unique selling points. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you think of Sharjah's capacity to become a cultural hub and a center of creativity in the UAE?</h4><p>Sharjah has a reputation for being the first to do innovative things. It was where the first school in the UAE was founded, had the first woman to receive a PhD, the first nurse to graduate, the first girls' school, the first radio station, and the first airport that came into service—although that was constructed by the British. As such, when it comes to culture, Sharjah is a trendsetter. Thanks to His Highness's continued focus on culture, there has always been an ongoing effort to educate the youth. He is always keeping an eye on developments in the world, and when he sees something that works well in other countries and cultures, he wants it to happen here as well. Since His Highness established the American University of Sharjah in 1997, education has become a central issue. I am a member of Sharjah University's board of trustees, and in the past four years, His Highness has advised the Chancellor to turn Sharjah University into a hub of scientific research. In light of these achievements, Sharjah will always remain a trendsetter in cultural and educational arenas.</p><h4>What have been your recent achievements?</h4><p>His Highness' mission for Rubu' Qarn is something that I have always wanted to do, albeit without knowing it consciously. This mission is the solution to almost every problem. Every problem, ranging from minor misbehavior by children and adults such as public littering to more serious forms of crime, can be solved by having the right institutions fill the lives of children with knowledge and ethics. It is possible to do this with books, music, painting, and technology, among other things, such that they have time for nothing else. That said, this may also put many ministries responsible for fighting crime out of a job. My latest passion is to ensure that the four entities active under the Rubu' Qarn Foundation complete and reinforce each other's work. We have an interesting work cycle, taking in children from the age of 6-13 and looking after their needs. At 13, they go to Sajaya and the youth centers, before joining Sharjah for Capability Development when they are 18 or 19. I am also a writer of science fiction books for young adults in Arabic, which is an extremely important format in the Arab world, despite all the funding it still needs. </p><h4>Why is fostering creative thinking in children so important?</h4><p>The process of invention or discovery depends largely on imagination. Unfortunately, education in this part of the world draws hugely on rote learning—but how can one become a creative entrepreneur if they were educated by rote? If we do not have enough entrepreneurs—because no one taught children to be innovative and creative and ask questions—then the government will be under pressure to create more old-fashioned jobs. In such a society, even those who express creativity will be silenced.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges in art, culture, and education in Sharjah?</h4><p>We do not have any obstacles, though funding can sometimes be a challenge. Rubu' Qarn, to be sure, is fully funded by the government, and although it does not generate money, as a force for social uplift, it pays off indirectly. Rubu' Qarn is training a generation that will contribute to the prosperity of the UAE. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about any recent operational changes or offerings SCTDA has on its plate?</h4><p>There have been a number of recent developments in the emirate; Sharjah is the only Emirate that borders the other six, as it is centrally located and is the only one with access to both the east and west coast. The new Sharjah-Khorfakkan road, which opened in March 2019, has reduced the travel time between Sharjah and Khorfakkan from 90 to 45 minutes. His Highness Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Muhammed Al Qasimi, the Ruler of Sharjah, endorsed this project with the vision of one day connecting the east coast to central Sharjah, so the impact of the road will be invaluable regarding tourism opportunities. A large project with a huge investment, the new road cuts into the difficult mountainous terrain through five tunnels. Hospitality-wise, niche ecolodges are another great selling-point. Along the east coast in Kalba, there is the new Kalba Kingfisher Lodge, a unique venture beside ancient mangroves, not to mention the new lodge in one of our most enticing tourist attractions, Mleiha. Here, along with the Mleiha Archeological Center, we now have the Al Faya lodge, with five luxury rooms. Sharjah's newest family entertainment destination, the recently renovated Al Montazah, is a 126,000-sqm water park located in the heart of the city. Also, we are also very proud of the Rain Room and Heart of Sharjah. The former, designed by the Sharjah Art Foundation and the UAE-based Space Continuum Design Studio, is an immersive installation which allows visitors to walk through a downpour of continuous rain, 1,200 liters of self-cleaning recycled water, without getting wet. The Heart of Sharjah project, the largest historical preservation and restoration project in the region, has been registered in the tentative list of World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. It seeks to restore historical buildings by constructing new structures following traditional Sharjah architecture and transforming them into hotels, restaurants, cafes, art galleries, and markets. </p><h4>How do you assess the recent global trends in tourism?</h4><p>It is important to keep ahead of global trends and understand how they will work for us and which are beneficial to adopt. We have a strong hold on global tourism trends, using various methods such as digital marketing statistics and surveys plus intense consistent research involving tracking systems and making sure we keep up our connectivity with various forums and workshops, many held by ourselves and others that we attend in other countries.  </p><h4>How was 2019 compared to previous years in terms of tourism?</h4><p>The tourism sector is different from others, as it is delicate and can be affected quickly, in just one day, for political or economic reasons. It is one of the most profitable sectors, but its delicacy comes with high risks. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook on Sharjah's capacity to maintain an educational hub and center for creativity in the UAE? </h4><p>Sharjah has been investing heavily in its schools and universities, laboratories, libraries, research centers, and science and exploration centers. This includes Rubu' Qarn, the umbrella for four Sharjah-based entities: Sharjah Children, Sharjah Youth, Sajaya Young Ladies of Sharjah, and Sharjah for Capability Development. Since early childhood remains a top priority, SEC is currently supervising 25 nurseries across the Emirate with around 1,500 children enrolled, in addition to opening five new nurseries in 2019.</p><h4>What major events does the council plan to organize?</h4><p>The major events in 2019 are mainly focused on early childhood, students' activities, and the Sharjah Award for Excellence in education, which was conducted few months ago; however, the main activities are the Silver Jubilee celebration of the Sharjah Award for Excellence in education, which has awarded 65 distinguished students. Another competition was conducted for teachers, which is about elaborating the most creative teaching plan. In addition, SEC has been organizing a project called Rakaiz that supports the education system from an aspect of empowering positive behavior among children and youth in our community. The program consists of many activities and programs throughout the year, including lectures, movie competitions, and a forum. </p><h4>Why it is so important for you to enhance creativity amongst the youth in Sharjah?</h4><p>It is important to define their responsibilities and commitments and, through the determination of their capabilities, establish a stable infrastructure that leads to future development in a competitive and innovative framework.<br>How do innovations in technology and specifically AI affect your work?<br>SEC provides software for employees that suffer from visual impairment and smart boards in nurseries to support teachers and contribute to developing childhood creativity.</p><h4>What are some of the biggest challenges for education in Sharjah?</h4><p>One of the biggest concerns is the lack of highly qualified local teachers. What is more, in this time of technological evolution, the availability of rapid communication channels, and our extremely multicultural society, the education system is encountering intellectual conflicts and a high instance of misuse of technology. </p><h4>As 2019 was deemed the year of tolerance, where do you see the biggest opportunities to improve in Sharjah?</h4><p>The Emirate of Sharjah strategically supports a culture of tolerance by bringing together various cultures and different art platforms that significantly help create an attractive place to live. Effective communication system platforms are central to this continues, especially when it comes to international collaboration. </p><h4>What are the foundation's main goals and objectives for 2019?</h4><p>SEC has four foals. The first is ensuring the promotion of early childhood education at the government's 25 nurseries, which will increase to more than 80 in the coming decades. The second seeks to develop students' integrated characteristics, while the third is to foster a culture of innovation, excellence, and creativity. The last aims at providing the most efficient and transparent administrative services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the progression of the university in recent years?</h4><p>A major development of Al Qasimia University was moving away from the paper to the electronic world. Many advanced educational methods have been introduced, and theoretical education has been replaced by practical education. The university also began taking its students to field forums to gain practical experience in ministries, courts, police stations, and many other bodies.</p><h4>What is the university's mission?</h4><p>The university's mission focuses on educating and graduating students in an Islamic environment and have them return to their countries and show people that Islam is a religion of love, tolerance, and moderation, not one of hatred or aggression. Al Qasimia Islamic University urges the teaching of Islamic principles and the graduation of students who know the real Islam, which is far from terrorism and violence. We respect everyone and all other religions. We must accept all individuals from all religions all over the world because Islam calls for ethics in dealing with people.</p><h4>What benefits does a student receive from studying in Sharjah?</h4><p>One of the biggest challenges facing Al Qasimia University is assimilating its multinational students and various cultures into mainstream society. As such, the university decided to help integrate them into our culture and customs by encouraging them to go out twice a week once to UAE tourist attractions and once a week to shopping centers. We hold training courses to introduce students to the customs of UAE society and how to interact with a culture different from their own without feeling alienated. Al Qasimia University is a full scholarship university. All university supplies are free for all students, including registration fees, stationery, books, and even tickets. Distinguished students in all fields are given great attention and can be sent abroad at no cost.</p><h4>The university maintains a close connection with both the public and private sectors. What new courses or further extensions are being planned?</h4><p>His Highness' vision is extended globally through exhibitions, lectures, poetry houses, mosques, and universities, all of which strengthen the scientific and cultural aspects of the UAE in general and Sharjah in particular. His Highness the Ruler of Sharjah's vision has transformed the Emirate itself. His Highness is keen on science and culture and has established many monuments, including the University of Sharjah, Al Qasimia University, the American University of Sharjah, the Police Academy, Technical College, Skyline College, Heritage Institute, and the Academy of Performing Arts. In addition, he has founded the institute of Arabic language and the Holy Quran Complex, as well as established many exhibitions, festivals, and museums, in addition to local and international cultural events that will raise the global profile of Sharjah. </p><h4>How does the university offer opportunities to foreign students?</h4><p>Al Qasimia University relates to universities worldwide, and we organize an annual competition for the Holy Quran that involves about 50 countries. Such competitions are a form of partnership between universities; we do not rely only on Sharjah, but also go abroad influenced by the vision of His Highness. There will soon be another competition in Arabic. Today, we have students from 70 countries. Registration is done through the website and the university itself. We also reach out to ambassadors to meet with the students from their countries and speak to them about their problems. New foreign students are assisted in learning Arabic by taking courses for six months to a year. University graduates are then contacted by the Union of Graduate Students in case they want to complete a master's degree.</p><h4>What have been the university's most important collaborations and joint projects at the international level?</h4><p>There is cooperation between Al Qasimia University and other universities. Currently, an agreement is being concluded with a university in Saudi Arabia. We have also concluded scientific agreements with universities in Malaysia, Al-Azhar University in Egypt, and others to exchange best practices, especially those that have the same vision as Al Qasimia University.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What new academic programs or expansions do you have in the works? </h4><p>The new expansions at the University of Sharjah are numerous, especially in terms of graduate programs. The job market demands employees have these certificates due to new technological advancements and their applications in the private and public sectors, and the university must meet the requirements of these new technological developments. The university's president, the Ruler of Sharjah, issued a directive to establish the College of Computing and Informatics, which is concerned with modern fields such as smart cities, the internet, AI, drone technology, blockchain, and cybersecurity, in addition to the establishment of the Sharjah Research, Innovation, and Technology Park as a free zone entity.</p><h4>What are the biggest educational challenges facing Sharjah and the UAE? </h4><p>The University of Sharjah, along with other universities, is consistently keeping pace with new technological advancements. Any delay creates a skills gap that is compounded and increasingly difficult to close, with technology moving so rapidly. There is no doubt that technological advances will be faster in the future than they are today. This is the biggest challenge for the current and future education sector in the Emirate of Sharjah and in the broader country, because both are working on modern development according to the highest international standards. There is no doubt that at the core of this development is the technological revolution, which constitutes the cornerstone of every element of future commercial and institutional development.</p><h4>What unique skills do students gain from studying at the University of Sharjah? </h4><p>His Highness established the university as a national development project for teaching, research, and service to the community, which harmonizes and interacts with the job market and public institutions in a professional manner. Integrating scientific research and innovation into its curricula and educational programs at all levels, the university also stresses extracurricular activities that support education, enrich the student experience, and integrate information technology into the teaching and research process. All of this has the aim of raising the profile of the university internationally. These are the unique features that have attracted over 100 nationalities. The university also offers 102 academic programs for specializations required by the job market, many of which are not offered elsewhere. Additionally, students are required to engage in graduate research projects utilizing state-of-the-art education, research, and computer laboratories, which are also used in teaching, administrative and technical capacities. As for the university's relationship with its students after graduation, this takes many forms. Our alumni association plays an important role through which the university opens all its doors to meet the scientific, cultural, athletic, and social needs of its graduates. </p><h4>What are the most important academic cooperation agreements and joint projects that you have at the international level?</h4><p>The university has recently strengthened its position internationally by signing several cooperation and partnership agreements with prestigious international universities, including the University of California. There is also an agreement with the University of Oulu in Finland for scientific research and with the Desert Research Institute in Nevada for research in water resources and pollution. We also have ties with Harvard, the American Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, the University of London, and the University of Göttingen. These partnerships include joint research projects, which are published in international journals, and much more. </p><h4>What are the added advantages integrating artificial intelligence into higher education?</h4><p>The applications of artificial intelligence are numerous and relevant to industry, agriculture, commerce, research, and law, among other fields. The College of Computing and Informatics in particular will deal with such technical matters, especially AI.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-benefits-of-competition]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of healthcare output and business prosperity in recent years?</h4><p>Since the time the hospital was founded in 1981, Al Zahra has offered a premium level of patient care and service. The strategy of previous owners was to attract only premium patients, and this focus on premium customers and premium treatment did not change when the hospital was sold to NMC. The new owners wanted to preserve the legacy of a premium hospital, which took the form of combining premium-level treatment with a premium-level patient experience. We also wanted to expand patient volume by offering services to more people. This has been the strategy, and the operations of the hospital were directed accordingly. We saw a 20% increase in the number of patients between 2017 and 2018, during which time we maintained the same premium-level care. This is a true achievement in this market. In terms of business prosperity and healthcare output, if you preserve the best services, you will see a rise in patient volume and business going forward. When a hospital reduces the cost of services, it can greatly expand the pool of available clients. I am very optimistic about what this can mean for the country and health of the market. The NMC corporate office has also lent considerable support in terms of specialty expansion. After we were taken over by NMC, we established a cosmetology department, a long-term care department, and a cardiac surgery unit, and are now starting a USD200-million project to include the development of a brand-new building. This will be a 16-story facility adding around 200,000sqft to our capabilities. Such expansion is supported by NMC, whom we expect to facilitate strong growth in the coming years.</p><h4>What about Al Zahra sets it apart from the competition?</h4><p>Many new hospitals have entered the market, creating a new level of competition. These newcomers have recognized that this market has a great growth opportunity. When there is a high level of competition, the level of customer care improves across the market. We have seen our own level of patient care improve as competition has increased and have worked to expand and improve almost every aspect of our care in this climate of growing competition. We have an excellent platform in place, which allows us to take every advantage while we grow. We are not bothered about competition, as we understand that it will only bring improvements. We have been active here for 37 years. There are two pillars to healthcare delivery; one is the clinical outcome and the other patient care. No one in this market can match our clinical outcomes. Most of our doctors are trained either in the US or UK, which becomes the biggest differentiator in this market. Along with this, we have started to focus on patient experience. When people get the best experience with the best outcome, there is less reason for us to be concerned about the competition. No other private hospital in the UAE offers the level of specialty that we bring to the market.</p><h4>How do you attract attention to the world-class service you offer? </h4><p>We maintain the best cutting-edge technology and equipment at our facilities, which has greatly helped our growth plan. In terms of health tourism, growth started with Sharjah Healthcare City. We provide patients from around the world with bariatric, cardiac, and oncology surgery, and as competition picks up, we will see more specialties moving to Sharjah.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you summarize 2018 at Al Qassimi Hospital in terms of business prospects and healthcare output?</h4><p>It was certainly quite a challenging situation in 2018, particularly due to population growth. Al Qassimi Hospital also received Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation in December 2018 after two years of preparations. Our building is not new—it was constructed in 1983—so getting accreditation with all the infrastructural requirements was a challenge. We had to upgrade everything from the power system to the wards, other facilities, and manpower. We added extra staff, new services and equipment, and more intensive care beds. We also had the new 180-bed mother and children hospital open next door, which covers Al Qassimi Hospital's obstetrics, gynecology, and pediatrics. This kind of separation added the challenge for Al Qassimi Hospital of developing new services to cover the gap left by the other specialties. We intend to start a couple of expansion plans in 2019 with a cardiac center, a new stroke clinic, and a plastic surgery unit, as there is a great deal of demand.</p><h4>The UAE and Sharjah have been identified as new locations for tourism healthcare. What kind of opportunities does this open up for Al Qassimi Hospital and the country?</h4><p>As a healthcare provider, we are dependent on the volumes we get. As a physician, if you do not have the volume you cannot provide a service. So the more tourism that comes to the country, the more work and the greater the chance you have to develop new services. The spectrum of healthcare services you provide becomes wider, and your desire to improve your performance also increases with competition, which is quite tough now, especially in the private healthcare sector.</p><h4>What sets Al Qassimi Hospital apart from the competition, and how would you evaluate the sector itself?</h4><p>Al Qassimi Hospital is unique in what it is doing here. As a Ministry of Health (MOH) hospital, we are not focused on financial ends alone, but are also here to help people who cannot afford private healthcare. We provide innovative technologies that may not be a priority in the private sector. We try to develop services that can be a cost burden initially, but certainly offer higher quality. What we do here is a kind of merger of a socioeconomic role plus innovation and research that the private sector is often not interested in conducting. We have really been involved in encouraging our staff to do more research because we have a lack of adequate information about our population's health and frequency of disease. That said, the government has put a lot of measures in place to come up with solutions to combat these kinds of endemic diseases.</p><h4>What international participation and knowledge exchanges does Al Qassimi Hospital have?</h4><p>We have had a doctors' visiting program for many years that includes inviting doctors here and sending doctors abroad for training. It is important to exchange knowledge at even the team level; not only individuals are requested to come over and teach or perform surgery. An entire Belorussian team recently visited for pediatric-cardiac surgery, and we are expecting another team from Belarus in June 2019. These pioneering visits enrich our staff's knowledge. In May 2019, we had one of the top cardiologists visit, and we currently have two visiting doctors in orthopedics. This has also been an economic success. You can do a simple calculation and see how much more it would cost to send these patients abroad compared to treating them here. </p><h4>Are you also inviting foreign doctors to stay and work for longer periods? </h4><p>This is something we are in the process of doing. We have made some agreements and are trying to organize this with a Japanese group and certain American groups for a program in which doctors can come here for six months or a year. It is not easy for people to come and work here, but there is a plan to facilitate this in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess 2018 in terms of business prosperity and healthcare output?</h4><p>With new hospitals under construction, existing facilities expanding, and ambitious plans to improve the quality of treatment available not only for residents but also the growing number of medical tourists, the UAE has a competitive healthcare sector, especially in 2018. Active participation of both local and international private investors in healthcare has helped the success of the healthcare business.</p><h4>Sharjah already has several important free zones with numerous healthcare institutes. What is the current state of SHCC?</h4><p>With the growing population of Sharjah and adjoining Emirates, the latter of which alone is expected to reach 2.7 million inhabitants by 2025, there is an acute need for more healthcare facilities. The supply of specialized surgery and cancer centers, advanced diagnostics, and rehab and cardiac care centers is limited and represents an excellent opportunity for investors. As per the latest reports, Sharjah's healthcare market potential is projected to reach AED5.6 billion by 2020. Understanding this huge potential, SHCC is all geared up to attract investors. Currently, we are completing our clinical building, where the leasing is expected to start by 2020. For hospitals and other projects, land leasing has already commenced.</p><h4>What is your strategy in terms of attracting foreign direct investment to SHCC?</h4><p>As part of our strategy, we focus on both international healthcare institutions, investments, and homegrown brands. Gaining the support and trust of homegrown establishments adds value to this project. The strategic location of the project matters, as it is approximately 20km from Dubai International Airport and close to Sharjah International Airport. It also well positioned in between the two national highways. The other competitive advantages SHCC offers are reasonable charges and fees, a single-window service system, and transparent and easy regulations. The zone also offers other free zone advantages, like zero taxes and duties, repatriation of capital and profits, 100% business ownership, and a customer-friendly environment with all the desired infrastructure.</p><h4>How does increasing digitalization affect the healthcare sector in Sharjah, and how are you implementing the usage of AI in SHCC?</h4><p>Technology plays an important role in healthcare and will impact the role of decision making for regulators as well as healthcare providers. The digital revolution has touched on all facets of healthcare. It is in line with the UAE vision 2021. The revolution ranged from paperless patient records and software-enabled diagnostic systems for quick detection of infectious diseases to telehealth, robotic surgery, and e-pharmacy. SHCC's infrastructure will be developed according to these trends, and we advise all our tenants to follow the digital revolution.</p><h4>Which medical areas currently exhibit the most potential for healthcare tourism in Sharjah?</h4><p>Overall, our healthcare services support health tourism in Sharjah, though we are seeing a greater demand for specialized facilities such as cardio centers, diabetic management centers, day surgery centers, neurology and oncology centers, wellness centers, and so on. These will be additional attractions for health tourists. Sharjah already attracts many tourists from across the world; more healthcare institutions operating in the Emirate will definitely boost health tourism.</p><h4>What sets UHS apart, and what is your outlook for the overall sector in Sharjah?</h4><p>UHS' continued commitment to patient safety and care has successfully earned it a re-accreditation by the Joint Commission International (JCI), distinctively putting UHS at the forefront of excellence.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of the company's operations in Sharjah?</h4><p>K&amp;A was founded more than 50 years ago in Beirut and now has over 6,000 people in more than 30 offices across the world. Our holding company is in Singapore and our executive office is in Dubai, and we have around 1,000 people across the UAE. We opened our Sharjah office in 1968, and were among the first consultants here at that time. The Ruler of Sharjah assigned us to develop one building project and since then we have undertaken many projects for the public and private sectors, including roads, water networks, utilities, industrial areas, and buildings. Our Sharjah design center is one of the company's biggest offices, providing expertise across the region. </p><h4>What is your main focus in Sharjah?</h4><p>We are a multidisciplinary consultant, so our expertise is diverse. In buildings, for example, we have specialists in everything from high-rise towers to shopping malls, hospitals, schools, and housing. We master plan large-scale communities, and design and project manage all aspects of infrastructure within them, such as roads and utilities. Our current projects include the biggest mall in Sharjah, Al Zahia City Center, which is under construction, and Sharjah's first master-planned community, known as Tilal City. This is an important mixed-use project which will be home to around 65,000 residents. K&amp;A produced the master plan and is now involved in various aspects of design. Tilal City comprises almost 1,500 land plots, combined with parks and education and community facilities.</p><h4>Can you please explain how smart cities and sustainable design will change the way we live?</h4><p>Smart cities are yet to be fully realized, but we can see an emerging smart ecosystem starting to play a role in most people's daily lives. Characterized by multiple emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as the IoT, AI, 3D printing, next generation telecommunications, and driverless vehicles, smart cities will enable us to create environments that truly respond to the needs of people. The utilization of these technologies in an organized and integrated way is at the heart of our drive toward smart cities. Smart cities are there to enhance our quality of living, the performance and interactivity of urban services, to reduce costs and consumption, and to increase contact between citizens and governments. Importantly, they will also help to tackle some of the major socio-economic issues facing the world today such as climate change and rapid urbanization. We are currently working with Sharjah Urban Council to make Sharjah the first city in the world to have an age friendly certificate. We are preparing the guidelines related to every aspect of housing, streets, landscape, commercial areas, and developments, and the council will set a template for others across the region and beyond. </p><h4>What training programs do you have for your employees?</h4><p>Our industry is undergoing rapid change because of the impact of technology and digitization. It is therefore vital that we constantly train our people and provide support through mentoring, role modelling, and knowledge-sharing. Moreover, we encourage our people to take an active role in industry conferences and events. We also send colleagues on trips to visit suppliers and manufacturers in Europe, Japan, and China to have a deeper understanding of materials selection.  </p><h4>How is the company undergoing digital transformation?</h4><p>Commitment to technology has been a part of K&amp;A's DNA throughout its history. We were among the first engineering consultants in the region to digitalize its systems, and we were the first to introduce Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to the region. An area where we have taken an important step forward is in the development of our smart cities approach by leveraging our GIS expertise and integrating it with other technologies and platforms. This brings multimodal systems and various assets together into a more comprehensive view, which allows improved visualization and analysis.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[reyes-maroto-minister-industry-trade-tourism]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate these past twelve months, and what would you highlight as the main achievements that the ministry has made this year?</h4><p>The balance is quite positive, as President Pedro Sanchez has put industry at the forefront. My job has been to put the industry on the public agenda in order to talk about industry and the challenges that it is facing in this country. Today, it makes up 16.1% of our GDP. The seven year absence of a Ministry of Industry has meant Spain has lost an opportunity to make industry a national project. It is my job to fix this and to activate the industrial agenda in this country in order to overcome challenges such as Industry 4.0 and digitalization, which includes the development of blockchain and AI. In commerce, we have launched two important projects. One has to do with the approach of intrusion in trade. There is a lot of illegal trade on the internet, and it now represents a 9% loss in turnover in the Spanish commercial sector. This has been, and still is, a priority for the Spanish office of trademarks and patents. We have transposed the trademark law, we have created a discussion that we have called "Against the Intrusiveness in Trade" where different public administrations participate with the private sector. The second is Commerce 4.0. This represents a huge opportunity to modernize trade. It is important not to see digitalization as a threat. We created the Observatorio de Comercio 4.0 in October to start working on a private-public forum. This government has built bridges to talk to companies and sectors because to us it is the most efficient way to work. To know the concerns they have is fundamental in defining the country's future project. I believe we have succeeded in that and we have defined what we call "La agenda del cambio,'' which is an agenda for a Spain 2030 that is aligned with the objectives of sustainable development. Another priority is the ecological transition in the fight against climate change, which this government has also put on its agenda. The results from the macro point of view, such as the creation of employment, GDP growth, the competitiveness indicator, all show that we have maintained our commitment. </p><h4>Spain has advanced with the implementation of Industry 4.0 in many sectors, but SMEs still lag behind. What steps is the ministry taking to support SMEs in this regard?</h4><p>98% of our companies are SMEs, and, in fact, 54% of those are micro SMEs meaning they have fewer than 10 employees. We needed to bring the programs we have closer to them so that the SMEs can benefit, and there are two important elements to consider here. One that we have effectively configured is the SME policy for 2030, which  is important because it gives us some guidelines of what each of us should do. It does not only depend on what the ministry does but what we do with the autonomous communities and municipalities, as well as partners in the private sector. In terms of the strategy, we have already defined where we have to act. This gives us parameters to act, according to the SME policy in Spain, and these actions are related to innovation and internationalization, but also with sustainability as a way to improve the production models of SMEs and elements that have to do with delinquency. It is an issue that affects the SMEs in particular because they support invoices and therefore have a tax system. Without the charged bill, they don't comply with the law. It is the debate we have worked on in parliament. It must be reactivated in the next term. For the SMEs, it is a priority that such delinquency is reduced. We are also measured by the Ministry of Finance in terms of payment periods, but the inter-company trade has many gaps in terms of time. That reduces competitiveness. The SMEs have no money to address the changes. Regarding Industry 4.0, we are also bringing the programs closer to SMEs through the network of chambers of commerce. The Chamber of Spain has a whole territorial network, and we are meeting with businesses at a local level. Providing this information in this way is effective because many were unaware that we had the Industry Connected 4.0 program, which we started in 2015. The fact that in 2019 there are companies that do not know about it means that we have a communication problem. We hold an annual event called the Congress of Connected Industry 4.0 where we present to companies what technological changes are taking place, what the accompanying programs that we have are, while also coordinating with other ministries. In terms of digitalization, the industry cannot work alone, so we are working with Red.es, the Center for the Development of Industrial Technology, and the education sector, both on a university and professional level, which is a key issue. We favor the processes and products to ensure the transfer of new technologies to the company but we lack the human capital to really make the transition that our industry and our SMEs need. We are working with professional training centers to acquire digital talent and boost the skills of our workers. In the DESI 2018, we are ranked 13th, so we have a long way to go, and without adequate training for people this will be a transition where many people will be left out. The first step in addressing this is to make sure companies effectively incorporate digitalization as a value to their business model, while also educating human capital on how to use these new technologies in hospitals, for example. New machines are bought, but they are not used for a year because they lack the trained professionals to operate them. At this moment, increasing human capital is a priority for the government. Industry 4.0 is the responsibility of many ministries and it is a country project that has to be driven by the government to help the leading companies.</p><h4>We have met with many companies in the automotive sector and many complain about the fall in production. I wanted to know the opinion of the Ministry on the cause of the fall and what are you doing to ensure growth moving forward?</h4><p>The fall in production is due to many factors. I want to start with the international context. We export 84% of the vehicles that are manufactured in Spain. What is happening in the markets where we export? Germany's growth has slowed and Brexit has generated a lot of uncertainty in a sector where value chains are global. We have the US threatening us with tariffs for cars, and that threat generates more uncertainty. It does not have as much to do with what is produced, because most of what is produced is sold for export, but with registrations. We have an electric car still project just starting in Spain and in Europe, but with small penetration. Technologies such as hydrogen, LPG, or gas have not yet made it to the consumer and therefore we must explain what the ranges of products that can be purchased are. Explaining the value of the industry here in Spain, because eight out of 10 cars produced here are sold outside. The decisions that are made in the markets where we export affect us in our production. I think that we have defined a model according to the European one, which has been a model of success. The European automotive sector has achieved the status that the US used to have. We are currently the leaders in global production but if we want to keep it, we have to make a transition that we have not made yet similarly to countries such as China, Korea or Japan. The decisions we make are long term investment decisions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Orange Island project progressing?</h4><p>We are on track to complete Phase 1 (75 hectares) at the end of 2019. The reclamation was completed ahead of schedule in 2016,  We are currently constructing the phase 1 infrastructure, which includes the roads, storm drainage, water, sewage, and part of the power provision. The reason why power is not 100% is it will be rolled out in a modular fashion according to occupancy over the course of the next few years. Critical mass will be reached once 80% of the villa plots are built up. The infrastructure for the remaining 75 hectares (Phase 2) is scheduled to be completed in 2022.</p><h4>What will the project consist of?</h4><p>Orange Island is a new district of Lagos comprising 150 ha of land reclaimed from the Lagos lagoon and is part of the new Lagos Lagoon Districts on the Lekki Peninsula. This was conceived in the 2006 Lagos State Masterplan as part of its plan to manage Lagos as a “megacity." We started the reclamation in 2014, the land was then left to consolidate for over fourteen months. While some parts have been consolidating for four years. Work on the infrastructure commenced on the consolidated part of the land in 2018. Another two years is being spent rolling out the infrastructure. We are currently in the second year and the entire project has taken five years so far. By the expected completion date of December 31, 2019, the project would have taken sixty-three months.</p><h4>What percentage of plots have been sold?</h4><p>There were two phases. In Phase I, approximated 88% has been sold to date, and in Phase II, which we started marketing this year, about 70% has been sold. We are fortunate to have created a strong brand driven by good corporate governance, execution capacity, quality of the project team, track record, competitive pricing and sheer grit and determination. The market seems to have approved of our work, and as a result demand for our land has remained high. We were also fortunate to have attracted corporate sales. One of the critical success factors has to be the management of our purchasers (customers). Understanding the buying characteristics of our target market was key. The average Lagos white collar land buyer is sophisticated, knowledgeable and intolerant of poor quality or excuses for lack of delivery. They account for most of the land sales in Lagos and the Lekki Corridor in particular. As such, the pricing plan we gave our subscriber took account of this. Because Orange Island is a reclamation project, we were able to offer purchasers a 36-month payment plan, which was unprecedented at that time. The payment plans were also tailored to each purchaser. This strategy worked well for us mainly because we delivered on our execution milestones, focus on quality and treated our subscribers as partners informing them about all aspects of the project.</p><h4>What was the financial engineering strategy behind the project, and how was it funded?</h4><p>The project was funded mainly by pre-sales. We did have some equity and secured local debt. Initially, we applied and obtained Export Credit Agency (ECA) finance from the Netherlands, though we were not able to draw down on it as this was a few months before the crash in the Naira exchange rate. In summary, the reclamation of the entire 150ha island cost approximately NGN12 billion (USD33.33 million), and the infrastructure for Phase I cost about another NGN13 billion. We borrowed a total of NGN2.8 billion (USD7.8 million) for Phase I which we were able to pay off within eight months of drawdown. At this stage, we have spent about NGN25 billion before the infrastructure cost for Phase II. Our purchasers' payments were made on individual payment plans based on their individual circumstances. Once agreed upon, we were quite strict on adherence to the payment milestone. We found that this method meant that our purchasers rarely defaulted on their payment plans. One of the reasons we were able to do that was because key our contractors, Van Oord Nigeria and Metropolitan Construction, dredging and main infrastructure contractor respectively, agreed to be paid in accordance with our cash flows and not by the standard method of certification and valuation used in the industry. Our bankers, Keystone Bank Limited were also very supportive. All contracts, sub-contractors, suppliers and consultants were paid based on our cash flows and not on the existing norms in the industry. We have Swampsea Construction to thank for keeping the project on critical path. They did an excellent job of providing overarching technical support and supervision of the project. We were honest about our funding constraints and kept our word on meeting scheduled payments. A closely monitored master spreadsheet was drawn up showing subscriber inflow versus expected outflows. This was used to schedule payments a month in advance.  Many would consider this this unconventional strategy risky. Relying on pre-sales to fund projects is not ideal, but in the existing financial environment we had to be extremely innovative in the creating a workable funding plan for our project. This is what worked at Orange Island. I am not recommending that al projects of this type should be funded in this manner, but I would urge developers to find novel ways of addressing the unique challenges of executing projects in a dynamic, difficult emerging economy like ours. Innovation in marketing, design and finance strategy are essential. They are many 'saner' financial models that work in other parts of the world, but Nigeria is unique.</p><h4>How do you expect the project to help and improve Lagos? Do you plan to capitalize on the marina?</h4><p>I hope that Orange Island provides a model for creating private sector driven, sustainable districts in our crowded, chaotic city. We do not take proper advantage of our waterways, which is a shame, especially with the current traffic congestion on our roads. Ferries and car ferries are just starting to arrive. For all the islands that have been reclaimed, the Ministry of Physical Planning has established a rule that there must be space allocated for water taxis and a place for the government to build a ferry terminal. Orange Island is part of a larger plan. The Island is located on the Lagoon Highway which is accessed from Freedom Way directly off the Lekki Epe Expressway. This will subsequently lead into a regional road and bridge system. There is also the coastal road on the Ocean side of the Lekki Peninsula, so this entire area is meant to be served by a new system of roads. If the government does it, I believe it will go some way in alleviating the traffic jams on the Expressway, though this is currently uncertain.</p><h4>What is your assessment of PPPs for infrastructure projects in Nigeria, and do you see potential for more?</h4><p>Developers of master planned communities in Nigeria essentially become their own little governments, providing roads and other infrastructure. Orange Island is more of a housing infrastructure project than a true real estate project. I believe partnership with the private sector is the right approach. A great deal of progress has been made on public private partnerships in infrastructure projects particularly in Lagos State. History has shown private enterprise can achieve much if provided with the right incentives. The government needs to do more on that front. Better incentives and an improved operating environment will encourage housing development further. The other thing is that the state government treats PPPs as commercial ventures. To make such partnerships more successful, the government should step back from the commercial aspects and focus on its role to increase employment, improve the quality of life, and should earn revenues through taxes, tariffs, and levies. It must focus on making sure the operating environment is right and incentivizing developers to build and develop. That said, we are proud to be a showcase of how PPPs can work well in Lagos.</p>]]></richbody0content>
