		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can Mexico do to reassure international investors?</h4><p>Despite the uncertain international context, we view Mexico as an attractive destination for investment due to the quality of its workforce, its preferential access to the largest economies of the world, its privileged geographic location, and—particularly in recent times—because of its structural reforms implemented in the telecommunications, energy, financial, and education sectors, among others. Mexico's economy and macroeconomic fundamentals are moving in the right direction. The IMF raised the nation's 2017 growth forecast, praising the economy's resilience. In addition, Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ratings have boosted their credit outlooks for Mexico. The peso has surged 22% since Trump took office, driven by diminishing expectations over the unraveling of NAFTA or an overhaul that would damage Mexico's economy. All these factors have contributed to improving the investment climate in Mexico and generating better competitive conditions that make the country a more attractive investment destination.</p><h4>What role can multinational companies play in promoting growth and development in the South and Southeast of Mexico?</h4><p>One of the most pressing challenges in Mexico is its high level of inequality. The state with the highest household income is Nuevo León, with USD66,836, more than 140% the national average. The state with the lowest household income is Guerrero with USD27,584, where the average household income is only 60.1% the national average. In that sense, one of the goals included in our Vision 2030 is to double the national GDP per capita and improve its distribution. Growth and development have not been equal within the country and it is therefore necessary to seek instruments that promote the incorporation of regions lagging behind in the South and Southeast. We believe the creation of special economic zones in these regions is a great initiative to promote investment. We have a committee specially focused on the development of the South and Southeast. The objective is to collaborate in closing the North-South gap by participating in the design of policies and instruments that promote the incorporation of these regions in Mexico by fostering investment. These regions have strong potential in sectors such as energy, tourism, and agriculture that need to be better exploited. One of the biggest challenges is the effective implementation of the rule of law, which needs to be urgently addressed.</p><h4>What steps does the country need to take to continue moving in the direction of technological development and high-tech manufacturing?</h4><p>As we made clear in the Mexico Vision 2030, in order to achieve a solid economic growth with the arrival of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, innovation and technological development must be strongly promoted. Mexico shows a historical lag in terms of its investment in science, technology, and innovation. Among OECD countries, Mexico has a low score on patents and relevant scientific publications, and public and private investment in R&amp;D is below almost all countries of the OECD level. In 2014, R&amp;D expenditure as a percentage of GDP in Mexico was 0.54%, in contrast to Japan (3.58%) or Germany (2.87%). We firmly believe Mexico must move from manufacturing to “mindfacturing;“ the country must evolve from a manufacturing-based economy to a creative one. Mindfacturing generates greater value and better opportunities than the manufacturing industry and human capital will be the key to achieve this transition. To help accelerate Mexico's transition from a manufacturing-based economy to an innovation-based economy, we must focus our efforts on industries with high growth potential, such as the aerospace sector, which showed an average growth of 21% from 2010-2014. Global companies must participate in important sectors of the economy and through the investments we make in infrastructure, innovation centers, technology development, and human capital training. We have a positive effect on promoting innovation. Mexico must strive to capture a greater proportion of global companies' R&amp;D investment globally. We have an ambitious but not impossible goal: to create the conditions for our companies to invest an additional 5% by 2030. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your strategies to continue attracting foreign investment to Mexico?</h4><p>FDI decisions gather a multitude of variables, and they reflect a company's intent for growth and long-term strategy to achieve their goals. These decisions are often made with 20-30 years' projections, and not with a four-year-term view. The uncertainty linked to the beginning of President Trump's administration caused companies and markets to quickly react to every statement or tweet from the president, as was seen on the peso's performance during the first semester of 2017. In parallel, we saw a few US companies announcing their intention to withdraw part of their investment from Mexico. However, Mexico keeps working to remain an attractive destination for FDI, by enhancing competitiveness, improving the business environment, increasing trade diversification, implementing structural reforms in key sectors, and improving infrastructure across the country. Our efforts have borne fruit, and most companies have maintained their plans of investment in Mexico. Actually, during 1Q2017 Mexico received USD8 billion in FDI, the highest record for a similar period since 1999.</p><h4>President Trump has frequently talked about renegotiating NAFTA to get a better deal for the US. What is Mexico's position toward these declarations?</h4><p>NAFTA has been a successful agreement that came to strengthen and deepen Mexico's productive integration with the US and Canada for the sake of North America's competitiveness. After 23 years of enforcement, NAFTA's revision comes timely, since it is of utmost importance to include new disciplines (e-commerce, telecommunications, energy, intellectual property) to better adjust to the 21st century economy. Mexico is willing to jointly construct the architecture of a better NAFTA, respecting some basic pillars of the negotiation: not to reverse the progress achieved so far (e.g. we will not accept to renegotiate tariffs on imports or quotas); NAFTA's revision should not be based on the idea that the agreement has only been beneficial to one of the signing partners, as NAFTA has brought benefits to all its parties; and we must maintain a trilateral perspective, under a “win-win-win“ vision. Thus, NAFTA's modernization opens up a range of opportunities to strengthen North America, and lays the ground to make it more prosperous, sustainable and inclusive. </p><h4>The government has helped over 50,000 SMEs through the National Institute of Entrepreneurship. What is the relevance of SMEs and their integration into productive value chains for the development of the economy?</h4><p>MSMEs are the backbone of Mexico's economic activity, accounting for a substantial amount of job creation (77%), and making an important contribution the country's GDP (more than half). Supporting SMEs is a priority for Mexico, and we have undertaken several actions to support them. Under President Enrique Peña Nieto's administration, we created the National Institute of Entrepreneurs (INADEM) to strengthen SMEs, promote their competitiveness, and help them to adapt to the new international market trends through financial aid and technological training policies. Moreover, for the first time ever, we established a national strategy to support SMEs by promoting a set of structural reforms in strategic sectors like telecommunications, finance, competition, and energy. All of them are aimed at widening the range of goods and services for SMEs at cheaper costs, impacting positively on their competitiveness. Worldwide, SMEs face a complex challenge, in a constant demand for specialization and business models' innovation. Therefore, allowing SMEs to become global providers requires leveling the playing field for them in terms of eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade-; facilitating innovation transfer; and encouraging their involvement in services provision of manufacturing processes. Mexico is also working on these fields in favor of SMEs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you decide to start an NGO, and what is the mission of Centro Fox? </h4><p>When I left the administration, I decided I wanted to do more for other people. My wife and I have three foundations that we have created and funded thanks to our donors. The core of what we do is around leadership; every year we have over 200,000 people that visit this center. We want to touch each and every one of them with leadership attributes. We implemented this in the form of education through seminars associated with different universities in Mexico and abroad. Secondly, we do some think tank activities and work on key issues in Latin America. All of this is addressed with high priority for people with scarce resources and who live precariously. We want everyone to have the same opportunities in life. The other two foundations carry out charitable initiatives and we sponsor a number of health programs, like tending to people who are paralyzed and are in wheelchairs.</p><h4>How are your various foundations funded?</h4><p>First, we have some generous donors. We approach foundations, friends, and corporations and ask them for donations. We are tax deductible in Mexico and also in some places in the US, which eases our fundraising campaigns in the US. Another source of funding is the conferences I give. In an average year, I give about 48 conferences and I donate what I get paid to the foundations. Other sources of funding include working with corporations and attracting FDI in Mexico and helping them to navigate our business environment to ensure that they are successful; the only thing we ask in exchange is that they become donors.</p><h4>To what degree is technology an important element in Centro Fox's work?</h4><p>Leaders need technology, knowledge, and capabilities. And they also need the capacity to innovate and create. We are trying to kill two birds with one stone. We try to build compassionate leaders; otherwise, they will not transcend. These leaders need to be of a high yield and capacity. And that is why out of the poor and the humble families we try to build and promote that kind of leadership that is compassionate and promotes the skills needed to transform society. </p><h4>What do you consider the Mexican economy's strengths and weaknesses?</h4><p>We are strong because Mexico is a successful nation and economy. We are the largest manufacturing hub in Latin America. Manufacturing wise, Mexico is larger than the rest of Spanish-speaking Latin America together. We are the most competitive manufacturing market in the world. Now, Mexico is moving into the next phase, which is a knowledge economy with technology, innovation, and creativity. All of this is where we want to be participating and nurturing. Even though we have many universities providing students with engineering degrees, we are still behind in terms of education as compared to other countries. Mexico still has big challenges to face, such as corruption. We must reinvent ourselves and eradicate this culture of corruption, and changing cultures takes years so we must make sure that our democracy fights against corruption, while transparency and accountability become the number one thing in Mexico.</p><h4>What should the next Mexican president do to reassure international investors regarding US-Mexican relations?</h4><p>It is not Mexico who caused this turmoil. It is the disrupter and the destroyer also known as Trump who decided to break all the written rules of the economy. He has harmed Mexico, the US' main partner, too much, and he believes that by patting our back he can go back to how things were before. We were deeply offended and that will not change in the very short term. Now the beast has to be leashed. He has to be domesticated and educated on his ignorance. Otherwise, things will remain uncertain and corporations will hesitate to invest not only in Mexico, but also in the US. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[concrete-steps]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the effectiveness of Mexico's major structural reforms as a tool to increase economic growth and reduce poverty?</h4><p>The structural reforms represent an opportunity for the Mexican economy to reach economic growth rates above 2.5% and thus reduce poverty. A less dynamic economic scenario makes reforms even more necessary. One of the aims of the structural reforms is precisely to improve wages and increase employment, which will impact outmigration and generate opportunities for renewed dialog with the US administration. Greater efficiency, production, and formal employment that is well paid is key to strengthening domestic demand. The telecommunications sector reform has already contributed to the entry of new players and reduced tariffs. The financial reforms have led to an increase in credit and investment. The tax reform has succeeded in increasing public revenues, which is in line with the UN's focus on domestic resource mobilization for development. Avoiding a fiscal adjustment that slashes public investment or social expenditure is key. In that regard, we should focus on ending ineffective fiscal privileges and on strengthening the Tax Administration Service (SAT) to minimize tax avoidance. These structural reforms are a necessary step in that direction but are far from sufficient. The potential of the energy sector reform is enormous. It is a comprehensive reform that includes the electricity, gas, and renewable energy sectors. In terms of the oil sector, there are a variety of oil fields that even with oil prices at their lowest levels remain viable for exploitation. These reforms are consistent with the UN 2030 Agenda. However, there is a long way to go for Mexico to achieve greater economic growth, reduce poverty and inequality, and achieve greater well-being for all Mexicans.</p><h4>GDP growth is expected to reach 3% in 2017. What factors have enabled Mexico to maintain this level of growth?</h4><p>ECLAC estimates that in 2016 the Mexican economy will expand by 1.9%, which is below the 2.5% registered in 2015. Among the factors that directly affect this deceleration are the negative performance of the US manufacturing sector, which is highly linked to Mexican exports; international economic and financial instability; the decline in public revenues, mainly from oil; and public spending, which led to a slowdown in domestic consumption in the second half of the year. In 2017, ECLAC estimates economic growth of around 2.2%, as the slight improvement in external demand is expected to be offset by lower investment and public spending, due to lower public oil revenues. We must be attentive to the evolution of US economic policy measures and their impact on the Mexican economy, as the risks of an economic slowdown may materialize. To maintain sustained economic growth Mexico needs to strengthen its domestic market by improving its income distribution, raising the minimum wage, diversifying their exports, increasing the value added of their products, and increasing innovation and productivity.</p><h4>What concrete steps can the country take to reduce economic inequality in line with Agenda 2030?</h4><p>Reducing economic inequality in line with the 2030 Agenda requires a structural change in national policies to boost growth, such as a countercyclical macroeconomic policy, a selective fiscal adjustment to protect public and private investment and social policy, maintaining minimum wages, and the creation and implementation of industrial and technological policies for a strong environmental and productivity boost. In particular, it is necessary to boost investment, which has a positive impact on productivity. At this point, an active fiscal policy and the application of intelligent adjustments are important: deducing evasion/avoidance, which on average equals 6.3 points of regional GDP (USD320 billion); increasing tax collection and improving its efficiency to be more redistributive and progressive; keeping an eye on both the level of public expenditure and its composition, and avoiding excessive adjustments in public investment and social spending, which may affect those most vulnerable. Other policies targeted and specific policies are needed in the labor market. In addition, monetary policy must continue to stimulate domestic demand while also managing inflation, which has shown a downward trend. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What advancements have you seen in CONACYT's Program for Science, Technology and Innovation (PECITI) for 2014-2018 in Mexico?</h4><p>The advancements have been considerable. PECITI has five important directions; the first is investing more in science, technology, and innovation. In the last four years, the federal government has increased resources by 40%, which currently represents above 0.5% of GDP. It is the largest investment in history by the federal government in science, technology, and innovation. Nevertheless, we still need more investment from the private sector, which has grown less steadily. Because of that, we have reinforced the Program of Stimuli to Innovation. Companies present technology and innovation projectsand once they are evaluated, we finance them along with the companies. In 2016, we invested MXN4.122 billion, in addition to the MXN4.165 billion in private investment.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the Mexican human capital in research and development?</h4><p>Mexico has taken advantage of the available opportunities to become a high-quality manufacturing country. However, this competitive advantage has an end date because the cost of labor will increase as the country develops and the quality of life improves. We have worked hard to create capabilities for research and scientific and technological development that are more attractive than just the cost of labor. For example, Mexico has great potential for development in the aerospace sector. Once foreign companies come to our country and see our work, research, and development capabilities, they will install here, as has happened in Baja California, Querétaro, Sonora, Chihuahua, and Nuevo León. In a similar fashion, Audi, CONACYT, and the government of Puebla created a leading training and technological development center in Audi's Puebla plant. We would like to replicate this within the automotive sector in order to generate specialization capabilities. Mexico is transitioning from being an automotive assembler to a generator of knowledge and innovation in the sector. The country is also well positioned in biotechnology, especially in the subsectors of pharmaceutics and agri-foods. We promote innovation in the southern states as well. The interest in these regions is to generate knowledge chains for the production of the agri-food industry. </p><h4>What role does CONACYT play in training and developing the skills of human capital for SMEs?</h4><p>Mexico is not yet creating the most advanced technologies; however, we are generating an intermediate innovation capability for supply chains in the automotive and aerospace sectors. This is where Mexican companies are able to integrate into more sophisticated value chains. We are capable of forming highly skilled engineers for these industries by linking with companies and developing research consortia that work closely with them. We are developing the electronic part of the automotive sector in Aguascalientes, the tooling and molding for this industry in San Luis Potosí­, the safety and lighting systems in Guanajuato, and a cluster for plastic production in Tlaxcala.</p><h4>What are your goals until the end of this administration in 2018?</h4><p>The most important achievement of CONACYT in the coming years will be applying science, technology, and innovation for economic development, competitiveness, and social welfare. In the last few years, the industry, civil society, and academic institutions have realized this value. If we want to position ourselves in the knowledge economy, we have to accelerate investments and linkage strategies, and not only be a country that receives manufacturing and assembling investments. We must have the capacity to be creative and innovative, and strengthen strategic value chains. Mexico is a relatively stable country, although there is a certain variation between administrations in terms of policy orientation. President Peña Nieto has directed us to give continuity to our programs for 20 years and more. We are visualizing this through a reform of CONACYT that will give us greater autonomy and continuity in budget planning. Our purpose is to make CONACYT an institution that is not influenced by political changes and preferences and that is able to continue with its programs and long-term strategies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Present in Costa Rica since 1920]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[therese-gearhart-president-of-the-latin-center-of-the-coca-cola-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Costa Rica for Coca-Cola and your current position in the country?</h4><p>We have been here since 1920. Because the Coca-Cola Company produces locally in every country through franchise bottlers, that makes us one of the most important partners in any country in terms of employment. We are embedded and invested in Costa Rica, having been here almost a century. Costa Rica is our headquarter hub for our Latin Center region from where we manage 31 countries, including the Caribbean, Central America, and the northern part of South America. Costa Rica, also offer us highly skilled bilingual talent. Furthermore, our concentration plant, from where we export to the Caribbean, Central America, and other countries, is also proudly located in Costa Rica since 1962. As we transform into a total beverage company, we will continue to deliver the products Costa Ricans love and contribute to the country's economic growth with our value chain partners.</p><h4>How do you rate Costa Rica as a place to be headquartered in?</h4><p>From a large import/export perspective, we focus on local production. We make more of an impact to the local economy. We try to procure all our core ingredients locally, so our impact for Costa Rica is truly felt here. Our broader business and the entire value chain starts with growers, who grow what we procure, like sugar cane. We try to be everywhere and available, and we have a huge footprint in terms of trucks, warehousing, and the whole sales, distribution, and logistics arm.</p><h4>Regarding your impact on the community, how do you help raise awareness of consuming high-sugar products like Coca-Cola?</h4><p>People around the world have been enjoying our beverages for 130 years because they love the taste of Coca-Cola. As a company, it is important to us to ensure that consumers have a variety of choices to help them manage their sugar and calorie intake. That is why we offer a wide variety of great tasting beverages with reduced, low, or no, sugar and calories. For example, last month we launched Fanta 2.0, which now contains fruit juice, fewer calories, and no added sugar. As a total beverage company, we are working to improve the recipes of our products as well as introducing new products to give our consumers the best possible choices. Our commitment to the well-being of consumers is also why many of our beverages come in small packages. We also provide clear information on how much sugar and how many calories are in our beverages, so that people can make informed choices about what makes sense for them and their families. We truly believe that the key to a balanced lifestyle is to consume a variety of food and beverages in moderation. Like all food and beverages, soft drinks with sugar can be part of a balanced lifestyle as long as people don't consume them in excess. In addition, we're evolving our long-term business strategy to become a total beverage company to give people the drinks they want and the information they need to make truly informed choices.</p><h4>Costa Rica is one of the world's most advanced green and sustainable countries. Are there Coca Cola programs that are adjusted to the green vocation of Costa Rica?</h4><p>We have several programs that help the environment. We have important projects regarding the protection of water. As a fact all the beverages we produce in Costa Rica are water neutral since 2016, meaning we restore back to nature the same amount of water that our product have. In packaging, for more than 15 years, in collaboration with Coca-Cola FEMSA we have the Misión Planeta project where we recycle plastic bottles. We also have other projects regarding the environment for example we participate in the Coastal Cleanup Day and Reforestation Day, among others.</p><h4>What is your general opinion on the FMCG sector in Costa Rica?</h4><p>As leaders in the beverage industry, we know that people's tastes and preferences are changing, and we have decided to change to do more to meet these demands. We are making our low sugar and sugar free drinks more visible and easy to find, and we are bringing many more drinks to more people in more places including options such as organic tea, coconut water, ready-to-drink coffee, juice, and purified water.</p><h4>What challenges have you faced in Costa Rica?</h4><p>The biggest challenge was last year, with Costa Rica and a lot of global economies struggling. In Costa Rica we face the normal challenges of operating while trying to manage costs and facing pressure from competitors. As a business, we know how to manage these challenges and remain committed to doing business in Costa Rica.</p><h4>What are your main sources of growth in the coming year?</h4><p>Our long-term business strategy is to offer people around the world the drinks they want. We are reducing the amount of sugar and calories in many of our brands. We are offering more new drinks that provide benefits like nutrition and hydration. We are manufacturing smaller and more convenient containers so that people can control sugar consumption more easily. And we are providing the information that people need to make truly informed decisions.</p><h4>Do you have innovations or programs that help you motivate your employees here in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Anything the company offers is available for all of our talent in Costa Rica. We are primarily a marketing company, so everything we do is designed to get people to think differently and to be constantly innovative.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Indonesia among the top 20 fastest growing Asian tourist destinations]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[arief-yahya-minister-of-tourism-of-indonesia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some key milestones the tourism sector has reached in the past year, and what has contributed to these achievements?</h4><p>From January to May 2017, tourism growth in Indonesia was one of the best in the world and among the top 20 fastest growing Asian tourist destinations. Based on our statistics, our growth rate is 20%. We are lucky to have a president who is committed to growing the sector, and tourism has been labeled as a leading sector since 2014. For foreign exchange earnings in 2016, tourism is ranked fourth among other sectors here. In Indonesia, the first sector is oil and gas, the second is coal, the third is CPO, and the fourth is tourism. Oil and gas is decreasing by 40%, coal is decreasing 20%, CPO is also decreasing. Only tourism has increased and is the highest foreign exchange earnings for all service sectors. In 2019, tourism will be number one in foreign exchange received. Compared with our competitors, in terms of inbound tourist arrivals, Malaysia is decreasing by a half percent, while Indonesia and Vietnam are performing the best in Asia. According to the World Economic Forum, as of 2017 our global rank is 42. Price competitiveness for Indonesia is top five and in cultural and natural resources we are in the top 20. We have a good product and a good price. Bali is the best destination, and for halal tourism we are ranked third, number one is still Malaysia and number two is the UAE. We used to be number six, but we have improved our ranking. We have promotions from Australia, Japan, Singapore, Amsterdam, Paris, and the US. When Obama visited Indonesia, we advertised in Time Square twice. We advertise in Saudi Arabia as well prior to King Salman's entourage arrived in Indonesia in early 2017. During 2014, 2015, and 2016, tourism was a leading sector. Our competitor has always been Malaysia, which is our spiritual competitor, and Thailand is our professional competitor. We received congratulations from our President for the sharp rise in foreign tourism; it has been growing 20% year on year.</p><h4>What are your key priorities moving forward?</h4><p>We have three top priorities. The first is digital tourism, the second is homestay, and the third is accessibility. Two thirds of customers are using digital devices, even Chinese tourists are sharing using digital media. The manual travel agent is diminishing. We have 17,000 islands and 75,000 villages in Indonesia. The solution for village tourism is homestay. We are going to develop 100,000 homestays within three years in rural areas. Currently we have three main destinations here in Indonesia and Bali is contributing to 40% of Indonesian tourism. Jakarta contributes 30% and Riau Island, next to Singapore, contributes around 20%. These three make up 90% of our international tourist arrivals. We have to develop new destinations, and we have thus far pointed out 10 of them. We call them the 10 new Balis. Our target for incoming visitors has increased from 12 to 15 million, in terms of air connectivity there is still a shortage of 2 million seat capacity, so we need to fulfill that 2 million to achieve 2017 target of 15 million international arrivals. By 2019, to achieve 20 million international arrivals, we need an additional 4.8 million in seat capacity.</p><h4>Infrastructure has been a key piece of the President's economic agenda. What role is the Ministry playing in supporting investment in infrastructure?</h4><p>In Bali, we are planning to build a rapid-exit taxi way at the current Ngurah Rai International Airport to increase and optimize its capacity. For 2019, we are also developing a new Bali airport, new Kertajati airport in West Java that will finish in 2018, and new Jogja airport. Toba island is already famous for its lake, the largest volcanic lake in the world. There are almost 30 million people in the greater Jakarta area, who have the greatest purchasing power in the country. In terms of financing the development of the destinations in Indonesia, we cannot depend only on the government budget, we have to invite foreign investment. The government will provide deregulation incentives and special economic zones for these top 10 destinations. That is what we are trying to give and provide to compete with the other destinations in the region.</p><h4>What is your broader strategy for international cooperation? How does that contribute to the ministry's mission?</h4><p>Telecommunication, transportation, and tourism have assimilated made Indonesia easy to access from a wide variety of destinations—I call them the 3Ts. Still, proximity is the main factor that contributes to the number of customers, specifically cultural proximity and distance proximity. If we are going to build international cooperation it must start with our neighbor countries, in this case that is ASEAN. Based on the ATF, 50% of ASEAN tourists are visiting from other ASEAN countries. That is why we have an association called ATF, the ASEAN Tourism Forum. We also have APT, which is ASEAN Plus Three, including China, Japan, and South Korea. These three countries are contributing 30%. In total, ASEAN +3 countries are contributing 80% of our international tourists. India is another country of focus. The number of wealthy people in India is 250 million. That is the same number of the entire population of Indonesia. India is a major market for us, and we believe by the end of 2017 India will surpass Japan in terms of tourism.</p><h4>What are your key ambitions for the coming year?</h4><p>We believe in 2017 the number of tourists will increase by around 25% compared with the previous year. Regarding tourism investments, they are already USD525.94 million for this year alone, equating to growth of almost 95% from 2016 in the first quarter. We are simplifying protocol for yacht and cruise arrivals as well, and we are more open for foreign investment. It is smart to invest in Indonesia because it has a high purchasing power; it has the fourth largest population in the world with one of the highest rates of economic growth. The government and the Ministry of tourism have made a serious effort to improve our ease of doing business in all sectors. The government understands that we need to make a fully supportive industry so that the mentality of the people is the same and positive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Mexico's integration in Latin America differ from its relation with the US?</h4><p>It is difficult to think that Mexico can totally liberate itself from its strong economic dependency on the North American economy. Both countries have a strong economic integration that is not easy to terminate. This means that Mexico cannot look in the same way to its southern neighbors, despite the signing of recent agreements such as the Pacific Alliance or more recent developments in the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). Nevertheless, Mexico will always be an integral part of Latin America due to its historical and political heritage.</p><h4>How has Mexico performed as an observer in UNASUR?</h4><p>UNASUR has not yet regulated the condition of “observer countries.“ This is why Mexico's condition as an observer is more of public relations exercise without practical implications for the time being. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4><span class="red"></span>What efforts is the current administration taking to improve the investment climate and promote employment creation?</h4><p>Honduras' economic growth is based upon the strengthening of institutions, infrastructure development, macroeconomic stability, and the development of our human capital. This is why our efforts have been focused on these four essential pillars to develop the basis of the second part of our program. To do so, we launched the 20/20 Honduras Project, which aims to improve the business climate, while focusing on the development of agribusiness, textiles, business services, tourism, intermediate manufacturing, and housing. Taken together, we hope this initiative will generate 600,000 jobs, attract investments of USD13 billion, and boost exports. These six economic sectors are where the Honduran economy really has the potential to take off and generate enough jobs to meet the needs of the population. We already have a solid growth of 3.6% of GDP, but we can reach more with the implementation of the 20/20 Honduras Project. We are also organizing a scholarship system that will allow us to train and develop our human resources with priority given to areas related to the 20/20 Honduras Project.</p><h4>How will the government increase the country's competitiveness inside and outside the region?</h4><p>The elements for increasing our competitiveness all lay within the four previously mentioned pillars. In the short term, investment in infrastructure will be one of the most important elements because it will turn Honduras into a logistics corridor for all of Central America. We also have a plentiful and potentially well-qualified workforce that has already shown its strength in the maquila manufacturing industry and in rendering various business services. Furthermore, we have made various legislative advances that enhance foreign investors' legal protections, not to mention improved our competitiveness, both of which are reflected in our international rankings. For example, we moved up 23 places in the World Economic Forum's global rankings from 111th in 2014 to 88th in 2016. Our goal is to continue moving forward and make the country more competitive.</p><h4>With nearly USD1 billion in bilateral trade, Mexico is Honduras' fourth-largest trading partner. How important is this economic relationship?</h4><p>Mexico is not only an important trading partner but also a prominent investor in our country. With trade of approximately USD1 billion and hopefully rising, I hope these ties will strengthen and continue to generate more jobs in both countries. I also hope our FTA remains in place and that we can continue to expand our commercial ties with our northern partner. Both countries have opportunities to grow even more as trading partners because of our proximity, shared cultural values, and common identity.<br>How would you rate the importance of the Mexico-Central America gas pipeline for Honduras?<br>This is an important project not only for Honduras but for all of Central America. Undoubtedly, having an alternative energy source at competitive prices is important to improving the competitiveness of our economy. It also gives Mexico permanent and reliable clients within its natural sphere of influence. We must remember that the relationship between Mexico and Honduras dates to pre-Colombian times. Thus, the gas pipeline is important for the region, as it would generate an energy zone between Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and, hopefully, El Salvador. It will be a multi-million dollar investment that will benefit the entire region.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the importance of the role performed by Mexican private sector investors in the Honduran economy?</h4><p>Mexican investors have been and currently are the number one foreign investors in Honduras. Nonetheless, we are always looking for more Mexican investments in Honduras, which is why I made two visits to several Mexico states to encourage them to come, invest, and settle in Honduras. As a result of these visits, an increasing amount of governors' delegations and business leaders are coming here. I am convinced the arrival of Mexican companies would not only benefit Honduras for employment creation, but Mexico as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the importance of Mexico's economic presence in Costa Rica?</h4><p>I like to think of Mexico and Colombia as our big brothers and sisters; they are a reference for us. I am a historian, so I value very much the fact that Mexico has had a permanent presence in our country since pre-Colombian times. There are many bonds between Costa Rica and Mexico, and clearly the investments that Mexican companies have made in Costa Rica that preceded the free trade agreement are significant, valuable, and provide a lot of employment. I do not think the Mexican FTA has been as successful as others. This is a first-generation FTA and it needs to be updated sometime soon, as it was the first such agreement that Costa Rica had ever signed. All the others follow suit, and we should look into that agreement and areas that have not been as successful so that we can work on them further.</p><h4>What areas hold the greatest potential for further cooperation between Costa Rica and Mexico?</h4><p>We have been arguing in favor of global value chains, as well as of working to create trade ecosystems. I like to think that we do not need to see each other as competitors; Mexico is huge, while Costa Rica is very small. Costa Rica's population would fit into Mexico's federal district five or six times over. There is no competition whatsoever; however, we can find areas like the ones we have been trying to develop strongly like services, aerospace, and industry, or high-tech research and development areas wherein Mexico can profit from our academic background and we can profit from Mexico's high convening power. We should think this over, and this is the kind of thing we ought to look into from a diplomatic and trade perspective as well.</p><h4>How can cooperation on immigration be further expanded in the region?</h4><p>I hope it will not be necessary and that we will soon see an end to the migration flows that we have seen in the recent past. It is a complicated situation; it is not something that I would like to perpetuate in time. Unfortunately, in all likelihood, it will continue for a while, and we have to be careful. During my visit to the UN and my participation in the conference call with former President Obama, I insisted this needs to be seen as a regional issue; it is not Mexico or Costa Rica's problem, it is everyone's problem. We have to be careful that a problem that affects everyone does not end up being the concern of no one. We look to the other side and let the flows go through and ignore the human and security concerns that all of these countries legitimately have. Most of this migration flow ultimately moves toward the border between Mexico and the US, as Mexico is the nearest point of entry into the US. I would like to see a more regional vision on migration, starting from where they begin—85% of migrants are Haitians—and Brazil, where they dwell before starting to move on north, passing through all of the countries in the middle between Brazil and the US. This is a humanitarian tragedy that we have to look at with sensitive and practical eyes.</p><h4>Costa Rica is the only Central American country with a Strategic Association with Mexico. What makes Mexico a strategic partner for Costa Rica?</h4><p>The importance of Mexico lies primarily in its size, its cuisine, and products in certain areas of the country because it is close, and we share with them mutual concerns regarding health, environmental, and security issues. It is important to have a Mexican perspective of the region. As a region the Tuxtla dialog has been one of the first that Central America ever had after the peace agreement in 1987; Mexico is a significant part of the greater Central America, as well as part of the greater Caribbean. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Today, we have the opportunity to take stock of what has happened in the field of telecommunications over the last four years. In one of the structural reforms, we seek to create an inclusive society for all through the use of this important tool, and above all assure that through it we continue to consolidate ourselves as a democratic country. When we see other countries closing themselves to the use of these technologies, that is when we can see the extent and the value of what we have achieved as a nation.</p><p>We are an open country. We are a country that aims for its society to have access to all these tools that are so indispensable, so fundamental, and offer access to universal knowledge and connectivity between Mexicans and the rest of the world. We are an open society. We are a country that continues to consolidate its democratic calling through this reform.</p><p>Four years ago, Mexico dared to propose a new paradigm and began a profound transformation in telecommunications and information technology. We did so conscious that the technological changes we underwent demanded that we establish the basis for a new model of development, based on connectivity and digital technology. </p><p>To avoid change would have been irresponsible. It would have meant condemning Mexico to backwardness. It would have meant depriving the population, especially children and young people, of the benefits of the digital era in their daily lives, in their education, and in their possibilities of entertainment and entrepreneurship. It would have impeded companies from being more efficient and competitive. It would have limited their access to advanced digital manufacturing, which generates products with high added value. It would have reduced the possibilities for Mexico to have modern telecommunications that incentivize a more productive economy and more inclusive development. </p><p>Therefore, in Mexico we decided to promote, without limitation, information and communication technologies. This is illustrated in the area of telecommunications, where today Mexico is almost unrecognizable from the way it was just four years ago. In this short period, the number of internet users in Mexico has grown by more than 60%; we have gone from 40 to 65 million, which means that today, 80% of our young people can connect to the internet. In the same period, the number of Mexicans with a cell phone grew by 20 million. Today, 80 million of our fellow citizens use this technology, which is, furthermore, the preferred medium to access the internet. </p><p>In the promotion of this intense process, I recognize the role of the Mexican Chamber of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technologies. As a demonstration of the process that we have driven together, the telecommunications sector has grown for the past four years at an annual rate of 10%. That is almost four times higher than the rate of the overall economy. Due to the fact that we have torn down barriers to investment during this administration, more than MXN230 billion in private funds have been allocated to telecommunications infrastructure. </p><p>This evolution is not a coincidence. Business leaders see the advantages of a sector that now is much more open to competition and innovation; a sector that has the certainty of being regulated by the Federal Institute of Telecommunications, which is autonomous and technically solid institution.</p><p>The reform is already producing tangible benefits for Mexican families. With the elimination of long-distance fees alone, we are saving MXN20 billion annually. In the same way, international long distance tariffs have shrunk by 40% and mobile phone tariffs by an average 43%.  The reform has an important social dimension that we also must keep in mind. This could be the most important change that we have enacted: the reduction of the gap between those who have access to digital technology and those who do not have it.</p><p>First, with the program México Conectado, people can access free broadband in more than 100,000 public spaces. Second, the network of Centros de Inclusión Digital Punto México Conectado, which was recently commended by the UN telecommunications organization, offers, in its 32 state centers, education and training in IT. Third, the transition to digital television has freed up the frequency of 700mhz, something, while complicated, is beneficial to the entire sector. At the end of the day, this frequency will allow us to develop the red compartida, or shared web. This will represent high quality and high-speed telecommunications coverage for an estimated 100 million Mexicans by the year 2024. </p><p>I am convinced that the future is being built today. These advances are only the beginning. The technological revolution is far from over. Therefore, we must continue evolving to fully incorporate ourselves in a world that is every day more globalized and more interdependent. </p><p>Some people think that the changes we have achieved in telecommunications were inevitable, that they would have occurred by themselves. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are many countries in the world that are currently falling behind because, unlike Mexico, they do not have the public policies, resources, or active participation of their telecommunications private sector. </p><p>It is our responsibility to assure that we stay the course in the implementation of a framework of absolute transparency and accountability. Together, we will continue to broaden the boundaries of what is possible. <br>Let us continue constructing a Mexico that is more prosperous, inclusive, competitive, productive, and most importantly, has more opportunities for its citizens. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Will reach USD200 million in Mexico in 2017]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[enrique-valera-director-general-db-schenker]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has DB Schenker performed over the past year?</h4><p>It has been a successful year. Over the last three years we have been able to double our top line results, while quadrupling our bottom line results. In 2017, we will reach almost USD200 million in revenue in Mexico. The quality the last year is reflected in all our market segments: air, land and sea. We have added some country logistics and new business segments like customs brokerage and project cargo. Apart from the growth in our traditional business segments, we have been gaining market share in these two new segments.</p><h4>Why has the company been able to grow so quickly in Mexico?</h4><p>The Mexican market is still growing, though perhaps not at the pace we wish might be. For us the major factor has been capturing market share. We have outgrown the market in all segments. We have also been able to do this without reducing margins, and typically it's one or the other. In this case we have grown and maintained the same level of profitability. The logistics and freight forwarding business has been growing much faster than the rest of the economy, reaching 8-9% growth in recent years and in 2017 we will see growth of 35% compared to 2016's figures. One of the reasons we have been able to grow so strongly is our excellent team. Over 40% of our costs in relation to gross profit are personnel expenses. We are a service company, and if you don't have the right talent and talent that is motivated then your operations will suffer. We have a good mixture. We have also been able to reduce our staff-rotation every year. The secret was reducing customer churn and adding new customers, which we did thanks to our great team. We have some new talent in the project cargo and customs brokerage areas and in the sales area, and we have seen marked improvement.</p><h4>What has been your experience as you have tried to expand into the customs brokerage business?</h4><p>We know that customs brokerage is one of the links in the supply chain, so if you want to provide a customer, be it on the import or export side, with the full supply chain then you have to offer customs brokerage services. This especially true in Mexico where customs brokerage is still related to a specific broker who is a physical person and the cost is quite high. Mexico has been improving and become more competitive in this segment. Customs brokers are now much more transactional, which has brought down costs and improved customer experience. Our approach to this issue, considering that Schenker Mexico cannot be a customs house broker, is to be the sole interface for our customers. This means we must either outsource this service with a third-party customs broker contacting our clients, or take ownership ourselves. We have opted for the later, and we will now be the interface for our customers. We have established a portfolio of suppliers because no single customs house broker can supply a single solution for the whole country. We are in the process of building this supplier portfolio, and we have our own system for the production of customs house brokerages, meaning that it interfaces with our operational system as well. Our customers can see the full track and trace process and the full follow up of their cargo in our systems.</p><h4>What segments are you currently involved in, and how has the importance of each developed over the past years?</h4><p>In different business areas, we have different levels of success. All are successful but to varying degrees. We have been successful when it comes to consumer goods and retail. This has been quite successful on the import side for ocean and airfreight. On the export side, our perishable business has been excellent, especially in airfreight. In terms of contract logistics, we run two big operations for a major high-tech customer and we were able to get a new large customer within our portfolio. We have also established a larger pool of sales executives in the logistics area. In this area, we need process engineers, implementation managers and other skills sets that we don't typically require in the freight forwarding business. We have all of these people now, and this is an investment that will lead to continued growth this area.</p><h4>What distinguishes Schenker from its major competitors?</h4><p>There is a direct correlation between cost of personnel expenses and gross profit. You need to have the right talent on board and you need low staff rotation, otherwise you lose expertise. Our business is moving away from its traditional orientation towards people and becoming more and more automatized and robotized. In the meantime, though, people are key. We have big customers with considerable volumes and they want to know who is tending to their account. They want their shipments to be taken care of constantly, and our people ensure that. At the end of the day, the quality of our customer service and our commitment to them is what makes the difference. This is in the DNA of the company. The best proof our success in this area is the low churn we see in our customers. Our top ten customers have been extremely stable over the last few years, and we are adding new brands without losing the old ones.</p><h4>What does Schenker's 40th anniversary of operations in Mexico mean for the company, and what do you feel like you have accomplished over the last 40 years?</h4><p>I have had the good fortune to be involved with the company for 12 out of the last 40 years. I have seen many different stages of the company. In the beginning, it was just a small freight forwarding company with no logistics area, no customs house brokerage, almost no ocean export business and less than 25 FTEs. Today, we are at almost 500; hence, the scale is different. The professionalism with which our services are offered is also totally different. Systems and infrastructure help, of course, but the way we do business has totally changed. We have made huge strides in terms of efficiency and productivity in the last few decades. Business moves much faster and volumes are much higher too. One of the main advantages of being an international firm with a global presence is that we can introduce new technologies and processes into the Mexican market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Fostering an innovation ecosystem in Qatar]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[maher-hakim-managing-director-qatar-science-technology-park-qstp]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess QSTP's role in creating an environment that fosters innovation and product diversification in Qatar, as well as that supports private entrepreneurs on the peninsula?</h4><p>QSTP's mandate falls under the umbrella of Qatar Foundation's Research and Development, which has heavily invested on these types of activities and has been preparing young Qataris to enter the cycle of science, research, and technology development. Innovation means turning scientific research and technology development into a social and economic impact by creating technology products that becomes useful for society. That is the area where QSTP is focused. We are creating an ecosystem with people, mindset, and processes, quadrupling the attention and investment on technology innovation. QSTP is helping turn Qatar Foundation's investments in education and technology research into useful technology products and economic opportunities. Additionally, we are supporting and training the business community that aims to create new technologies in the Qatari market. Therefore, we view our role as essential in the country's transition from a resources-based economy to a knowledge-based one. The core of this vision is creating industries that bring technology products to market, and QSTP can leverage all the good work that has been done in QF in education and research to achieve this goal.</p><h4>Since your appointment last August 2016 and looking at your experience in Silicon Valley, what are the lines that are drawing your strategy as QSTP's Managing Director?</h4><p>I am a tech startup entrepreneur at heart. I love the game of innovation and the hard work and creativity that comes with building new technology products and bringing them to the market. What I bring to the table is the understanding of the core elements and processes as they happen at innovation hubs like the Silicon Valley and others and how the world can benefit from it. There are some fundamental ingredients that are applicable to the Qatari ecosystem, and the first one is diversity. It is crucial to bring product innovation to a market that will be global in nature. The impact of innovation determines its success, and is measured by how many people adopt it. In this process, working with a diverse team of people that has a broader understanding of how to appeal to a global audience is essential, and Qatar provides this ecosystem. Secondly, there has to be an innovator mindset that understands that in order to create a product you need to focus on a niche market and acknowledges the sacrifices associated in the short term. The last crucial element is to be surrounded by an incentive structure that supports you in case of failure or delay when setting up a tech company. All of this is offered at QSTP. I am just helping our stakeholders understand that this type of talent, skill, and innovation ecosystem requires the appropriate investments to put together with the right processes. This is essential to successfully transform the country and see local companies that can introduce tech products to the market.</p><h4>What are the sectors that offer the most potential to drive Qatar's future growth?</h4><p>We have to consider what the core competencies of the country are. If I want to start a tech startup, I would have to ask what Qatar could bring to me that I cannot get somewhere else. By doing so, we do realize that there are three different elements. Firstly, we know Qatar is building new cities, such as Lusail. Therefore, if I am a company that is focused on smart city solutions, Qatar is an interesting place to start. Secondly, the country is considered a major player in the world energy market. Consequently, Qatar has a competitive advantage in any innovation associated with the oil and gas industry, including the opportunities to discover new energy sources. Thirdly, another key industry would be sports. The FIFA World Cup is happening in 2022, and Qatar is heavily investing in the sports industry, so it could potentially be a great market for sport-related companies. Qatar is a great early market for startups, with a friendly ecosystem and with worldwide credibility.</p><h4>How are you capitalizing on the potential of your state-of-the-art facilities to attract major foreign tech players?</h4><p>If we envision the world 20 years from now, when oil and gas will no longer be available, Qatar has to start providing products and services that globally people will be interested in buying—for example, generating income through exporting tech-based products and services regionally and globally. In today's world, the more innovative and technologically advanced your products and services are, the more we can demand a premium for them. Therefore, Qatar's transition to a knowledge-based economy has to be based on its ability to create a technological development and export sector. Our brand new Tech4 building comes as a result of our purpose to expand our offerings and strengthen our footprint in the free zone area, becoming a technology and innovation hub able to attract more foreign companies. We welcome R&amp;D companies, like some of our current tenants, and innovation startups.</p><h4>How is QSTP cooperating with other science and technology parks and encouraging companies and institutes from around the world to commercialize their technology in Qatar?</h4><p>QSTP is a member of the International Association of Science and Technology Parks, and that gives us connections and access to other communities. Technology and science parks around the world are just one element of our global ecosystem, but there are several others. We need to build connections with other accelerators and incubators around the world. We also have to develop connections with venture capital industries and organizations that can provide talent to us. We have outlined a program to recruit global startup companies that Qatar can add value to and support its development. In this sense, we are partnering with Challenge 22 to attract global startup companies involved in sports technologies.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are laying the foundations for a whole range of programs. We are currently conducting several pilot projects, so my expectation for this year is to see the launch of a number of programs and analyze their results. We want to make sure that we get ahead with all of these initiatives and that the community understands that the goal to experiment with these ideas. After one year some of them will stop because they did not work and some will be based on what we have learned. For the few of them that create a real impact, we will double down on them and pursue them further. Therefore, within a year, I am hoping to have a clear understanding within our team of what are the good programs that can take us to the next step in terms of building the innovation ecosystem we all want to see in Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Billion-dollar investment needed to save Jakarta from the sea]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[victor-coenen-director-pt-witteveenbos-indonesia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Witteveen+Bos heads the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development master plan, also known as the Great Sea Wall, to protect Jakarta from disappearing under the sea. Could you tell us more about this project and its urgency?</h4><p>Indonesia faces a tough decision, namely the medium and long-term flood protection strategy for the metropolitan city of Jakarta. The construction of a sea wall seems likely, but there are discussions on timing, location, and the design life time. However, there is no discussion on the need for immediate protection. Part of this short-term protection is to heighten the existing sea walls with two and a half meter. The construction work has already started and the first districts will be protected this year..However, in some places the city is sinking at a pace of 20-25cm a year. In those parts, the wall will only protect the city for the next 10-15 years and the question is what to do after that. There are now two options on the table: a medium-sized sea wall that will protect the city for 30-40 years (if the sinking is not stopped) or a large sea wall that can protect it for 100 years (with or with sinking). It is a matter of funding, and the discussion continues. We hope to receive the final answer soon because currently there is a Korean and Dutch technical team waiting to detail this sea wall, be it the medium-sized one or the large, original one. The medium-sized one would cost USD6 billion, while the large one would require USD10 billion. Of course, protecting the city is not just about building a wall; there are other expenses and infrastructural necessities to consider as well, such as revamping the drainage system in the city, upgrading the water supply system, cleaning all the water in Jakarta, and more. When we add this all up, the long-term cost could easily be doubled.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the government's commitment to the project?</h4><p>Initially, the Indonesian government wanted to finance the large sea wall with real estate and additional land reclamation. A large island was designed for that, with the profits from developments and investments on that new island planned to finance the sea wall. However, investors in existing islands and some ministries feared that too much real estate would be put on the market and prices and profitability would fall for everyone if such an additional island were to be built. The large new island idea is now off the table and currently NCICD only focuses on the sea wall and other water management related topics. The government still intends to subsidize the flood defenses through real estate development and sales, but now from the ongoing land reclamations in the Bay of Jakarta instead of the new island. Our company is involved in both the sea wall and artificial islands projects. In fact, there is no island around Jakarta where we were not involved in some way. We are specialized in constructing islands and infrastructure in very soft soils, like those in Jakarta Bay. These islands are private developments, led by large investors. Jakarta has an enormous need for housing, so this is a profitable business.</p><h4>Thus far, the focus has been on crisis water management. How should this be balanced with more long-term solutions?</h4><p>In water management, it is always important to solve the most pressing and urgent problems first. It is like with Hurricane Harvey, where Texas will also clear the rubble first and look at revitalizing the existing system. After that they will consider to build additional systems and solutions. Coming from a Dutch water management tradition, we always plan and build systems that last 100 years, or at least 50 years. We never build something that will last only 25 years, except for emergency protection purposes. However, I do understand that in Indonesia there is a lack of public money. It is a country that needs a large amount of public money for short-term issues, and spending that much on a long-term solution is difficult.. That said, if the government decides on building the 25-year sea wall, we as engineers will try to stretch the lifetime of that wall as much as possible to make it as effective and sustainable as possible.</p><h4>There is a debate concerning the wall and the environmental effects as it would change the natural dynamics of water flows. How would you address this criticism, and what are the alternatives?</h4><p>The critics have a point; all of the water in the entire city of Jakarta and upstream is polluted as there is hardly any wastewater treatment. If we drain that water into reservoirs, we will get black lagoons. With the large sea wall, there will be a large lagoon with poor water quality. Likewise, with a medium or small sea wall, there will be smaller, but numerous polluted reservoirs. Actually, cleaning the water systems should be part of any flood management scenario for Jakarta. Some critics insist on a natural defense for Jakarta, such as repopulating the mangrove swamps and forests along the coast; however, that will not protect Jakarta from three or four meters high seawater. The situation is already out-of-control and the sea is now already 3m above street level. No natural system can protect the city in such circumstances; the sea would simple run right through the mangroves. That means the only other alternative is to abandon Jakarta, which is not a real option. However, there are certain areas where natural solutions can provide protection, and we are also working on those solutions like restoring the mangroves in central Java, for example. Where possible, we go for the soft solution, the natural solution. However, unfortunately for Jakarta, the situation is already out of control, with water overtopping the sea wall at high tide and this cannot be stopped by planting trees. We can only stop that by stopping land subsidence and strong sea defenses. That being said, constructing sea walls takes years. The large outer sea wall will take three years of design and eight years of construction. The planned lifetime of the emergency wall is 10-15 years, while for the large sea wall we already need 11 years before it is finished. We can, therefore, see how urgent the situation is.</p><h4>What other challenges does Indonesia face in terms of maritime engineering, and can you as a company address these issues?</h4><p>As an engineering company, we do not only focus on hard engineering such as building ports and bridges, but also look at soft engineering. We do it from a social responsibility perspective, but also because we believe soft solutions have been neglected in the history of civil engineering and that the consequences of that have started catching up with us. The mangrove project in Central Java is an example of our attention for so-called Building with Nature. We are not only restoring mangroves there, but also giving economic benefits for the local communities, who can develop fishing, create fishponds, and so on. We design the mangroves in such a way that they catch sediment so the land grows again and expands: smart mangroves, basically. Another project that we are doing is looking at how to protect coral habitats. There is a great deal of tourism development on small, beautiful coral islands, though this is also destroying the natural habitat. These are sensitive areas, and a large number of tourists mean a great deal of damage. We have been doing tests on coral restoration and beach protection, trying to merge tourism with the strengthening of ecosystems. We will try to expand the first successful trial to a larger project that will involve the Indonesian government and research institutes to roll this out on a larger scale. This is not a commercial enterprise for us; it is purely from a CSR perspective. However, it is also important for us in terms of learning more about green engineering and also benefiting Indonesia and the planet in terms of saving and restoring coral habitats and coral islands. We are testing several methods to determine which works fastest and most effectively, in terms of results, manpower, cost, and so on.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[usd245-million-recently-invested-in-airport-infrastructure]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What initiatives and sectors are currently at the top of your administration's priority list?</h4><p>The focus of the UK-Madagascar Trade and Investment Forum was mainly on energy and mining, but those are not the only key sectors. We chose them in particular based on the research carried out on the potential of energy and mining in Madagascar based on the first UK-Madagascar Forum. But agriculture also stands out as an important sector for us, and we have identified many opportunities in agro-business. Similarly, eco-tourism also offers many opportunities for growth, and we have designed a special new product in that sector where we believe there is high potential for growth. There is interest in the UK for environmental and biodiversity issues. When you consider that Madagascar possesses truly unique biodiversity, it is clear that the environment coupled with tourism constitutes a rare opportunity for the country in terms of developing its ecotourism sector—not just for Madagascar, but also for the UK. The underlying principle of the partnership between the UK and Madagascar is a win-win. That being said, energy and mining stand out from the other sectors. Energy is an important issue on the international agenda today, even more so due to climate change. There is particular interest in renewable energy. Madagascar is currently going through a transition toward developing more of it. As for mining, it is a diverse and large sector, and Madagascar has all kinds of resources, from precious stones to oil and gas. That is why we have identified energy and mining in particular as the sectors where we see the most opportunities.</p><h4>You mentioned ecotourism and environment on the one hand, and extractive industries on the other, two industries that don't always complement each other. How do you strike a balance between extracting mineral resources and protecting biodiversity?</h4><p>This is the key objective and responsibility of the state; to strike a balance between mining activities and the protection of the environment. This is even more important when you consider that all the mining resources like gold and precious stones are located in the protected areas. Therefore, our primary task has been to create a legal framework for the conservation of protected areas and the overall environment, a legal framework that is already in place.</p><h4>There has been an investment of USD245 million in two of Madagascar's international. What do you expect to be the economic impact of these?</h4><p>Madagascar is a long way from Europe, North America, and Asia. That is why international aviation and air connections are crucial for the country, which is the logic behind our modernization of those two airports in Antananarivo, the capital, and Nosy Be, a tourism hotspot. Airports are the first and last windows into Madagascar; therefore, we want to increase the capacity of these airports to be able to receive and attract a greater flow of tourists and visitors to our country, as well as more investors and scientists. So, a more modern and safer transportation and aviation infrastructure is the first step to achieving this.</p><h4>Are any of these investments being done through PPP partnerships, and is there an outlook for legislation regarding public-private partnerships in the near future?</h4><p>We already have the legislation in place for PPPs, and these two airport projects are both PPPs. To start off two major projects like that as PPPs has been a great experience for us, and we want to replicate this in other projects and sectors as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[christabel-m-banda-executive-director-of-insurers-association-of-zambia-iaz]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	How did the landscape of Zambia's insurance market change in 2016?
</h4><p>
	In 2016, there was a significant drop in new entrants to the market, which was influenced by the introduction of the new capital requirement regulation. Only one new insurance company registered in 2016, and at the end of 2016 there were 34 insurance companies, five reinsurance companies, and two reinsurance intermediaries operating in the country. This measure to increase the capital requirement was introduced to strengthen insurance companies and ensure liquidity in the insurance market. Considering that insurance penetration in the country is fairly low, the amount of companies servicing the market was far too high, and we now hope to see a smaller but stronger pool of providers that are able to innovate and provide new services to bring the uninsured population into the fold. The legislation has a grace period of two years, which will expire in September 2017, which has given companies time to adjust. The IAZ's mandate is to preserve and foster a favorable climate for the insurance business in the country, which is why we have been pushing for the new Insurance Act since 2012. Currently, insurance business in Zambia is governed by the 1997 Insurance Act, which has now become outdated for the most part. We have, however, received assurances from the Ministry of Finance and the Pensions and Insurance Authority that there will be progress made in enacting a new Insurance Act in 2017.
</p><h4>
	What are the association's goals and strategies for increasing insurance penetration in the country?
</h4><p>
	Over 95% of Zambians do not participate in the insurance market. The IAZ's target is to have at least 6 million Zambians covered by an insurance policy by 2019. For this, we need to rethink our insurance offering: Currently most Zambian citizens are employed in the informal sector, but most products available from insurers are conventional and only speak to people in formal employment. Microinsurance bridges that gap, catering for those with irregular income. We also look at certain positive insurance policies that can be made mandatory, such as compulsory group life insurance schemes for employers with a certain number of staff. Some of our members partner with mobile service providers, which will also help to open the market to the 11 million mobile phone subscribers nationwide. Finally, in more developed markets, insurers are visible and there is a high level of consumer education, but this is not the case in Zambia, we are trying to change that. A Finscope survey from 2015 found that 42% of Zambians had never heard about insurance. Therefore, the IAZ is mobilizing resources to push the agenda of raising awareness.
</p><h4>
	What are the main challenges facing Zambia's insurance market?
</h4><p>
	Aside from necessary changes to legislation, the other challenge is the issue of liquidity. Insurance in Zambia is not provided on a cash-and-carry basis, and by the end of 2015 we had a situation where 52% of premiums were with debtors. This means insurance companies are struggling to pay claims because their money is tied up in debtors, leading to a double setback of high debtors ratio and also stiff competition resulting in undercutting of rates. Prices are being driven down, and we are operating in a soft market with low rates and high-risk profiles. This puts a great deal of strain on companies, with many companies in 2015 not making profits from underwriting. Many managed to scrape through owing to investment income that cushioned their operations. The IAZ is working with the regulator to settle the issue of liquidity and debt management, keep it in line with the industry's growth, and prevent it from potentially stifling the sector. However, we are optimistic that with the new government policy direction of a homegrown economic recovery program and copper prices looking up, these are realistic goals that can be met.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Khalifa University recently celebrated its 10th anniversary. What have been the milestones and major accomplishments for the university after a decade of activity?</h4><p>The last time we met, the expansion of the campus was still under construction, and recently the first phase of this expansion has opened. It is a student hub with student services office, library, and university leadership offices. The second phase is expected to open in 2017 with academic spaces, classrooms, faculty offices, gyms, and recreational campus facilities. In terms of student intake, we were astonished by the number of students that applied for the new academic year as well as the rate at which our admissions offers were accepted.  This most recent intake thus became the largest in the history of the university with more than 600 new students. We will also open our College of Science and Center for Teaching and Learning in 2017 with interesting chemistry and science programs. This growth has forced us to grow our services and reflects how well reputed the university has become since we are outperforming our peers, some of whom have struggled with the economic downturn. </p><h4>How does this expansion match your aspirations to be a leading education center?</h4><p>We have high aspirations and they go beyond the regional expansion plans we might have; our ultimate aspiration is to boost and support the impact that the Abu Dhabi education sector is having on a global level. What we have managed to do at Khalifa University is great and unprecedented. Now that we are placed in the major leagues, we are forced to do much more intensive benchmarking and figure out how to stay at the top of the game. We are trying to increase in numbers, reach out to more students, and take advantage of the resources the Abu Dhabi government has invested in a great variety of sectors.</p><h4>How are Khalifa University's plans expected to change with the government's announced merger between KUSTAR, Masdar Institute, and Petroleum Institute?</h4><p>The merger implies the creation of a single university will have distinguished institutes operating under a single umbrella. Regardless of the details decided for the branding of the resultant university, it will not eradicate the brands of Khalifa University, MI, or PI since they are globally recognized for their tailored offerings, and it is in the best interest of Abu Dhabi to maintain these brands. Plans for the merger are at an early stage and will evolve in the following months once the programs are unified, a new name for the university is decided, and the agreement is properly settled.</p><h4>How is Khalifa University pushing its students to diversify their choices for career paths and venture into more entrepreneurial sectors?</h4><p>This is one of the reasons behind the upcoming College of Science, which has been sponsored by the Ministry of Higher Education and is granting scholarships to Emirati and foreign students alike. The Center for Teaching and Learning also focuses on addressing what we see as the biggest challenges in education, such as acquiring the best faculty, developing and maintaining the best teaching methods amongst them, and assuring the modernity and rigor of the knowledge received by students. The Ministry's plan to have more people teaching science and math will contribute to diversify career paths by providing alternatives for students to choose from. On the other hand, we also need to create more entrepreneurs through venture capital and angel capital funds to invest in startups and innovate in those industries where the future lies. We have a great initiative to create the Khalifa Innovation Center through the Khalifa Fund and invest in entrepreneurial projects, invite people to see what students are working on, and engage both through their mutual initiatives. This is a major part of our new five-year strategic plan, and we are creating the necessary facilities, platforms, and research tools to encourage more students to support these projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Zayed University's milestones over the last year, and what major changes has the university undergone?</h4><p>The most important measure of any higher education institute is quality, and we achieve that through the accreditation process that we have in place for all of our programs. This is one of our first priorities as the youngest federal university, having been established in 1998. Zayed University has completed the process of international accreditation and recognition from US-based bodies for the majority of its academic programs. This process started in 2008 with the institutional accreditation by the Middle State Commission for Higher Education (MSCHE), one of the regional accreditation boards in the US. Then, the process of program-based accreditations started with our College of Business programs obtaining AACSB accreditation in 2012, while College of Education programs achieved NCATE accreditation the same year and was the first college to achieve that outside of the US. Thereafter, two of our College of IT programs completed the ABET accreditation in 2014; our College of Arts and Creative Enterprises obtained substantial equivalency from the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD) in 2015; and the College of Communications obtained accreditation with ACEJMC, the accrediting body for colleges of communication and mass media in the US, in 2015. </p><h4>The local labor market in the UAE faces a shortage of graduates in certain areas of expertise while it is saturated in others. How is Zayed University addressing this issue? </h4><p>Generally, our programs align well with the job market and in certain areas where we can adjust enrollment to meet the job market needs, we will do this by providing new options. The largest area in the job market is business with around 30% of jobs, and this is matched by the business college attracting 25-30% of the university's students, mainly in the areas of accounting, finance, human resources, and marketing. The second largest area is engineering and technology with a 25% share of the job market. We are introducing engineering alongside the already existing IT majors to cater to this segment of the job market. Beyond these two broad areas, other segments such as science, communication, and law occupy anywhere from 4-8% of the job market. To differentiate Zayed University graduates in all disciplines, we are refocusing on what people refer to as “new millennium skills“ in all our programs. People classify these skills differently, but they usually cover critical thinking, interpersonal skills such as communication, ethical conduct, group work, and lifelong learning and knowledge of contemporary issues and the latest technologies. </p><h4>What are some of Zayed University's initiatives regarding entrepreneurial programs and innovation in learning? </h4><p>At Zayed University, we have our general entrepreneurship education, which is part of the core program to all students. Apart from that, each discipline has its own approach to entrepreneurship. For example, students in the College of Business are required to develop case studies and create a business plan for their capstone, students in the College of Arts and Creative Enterprises couple their senior design project with a business plan, and so on. As an institution, we have cooperation agreements with a number of incubators and groups outside of campus because they provide the spaces for entrepreneurs to grow and the mentorship to help them in this endeavor. Furthermore, each Spring, we have a business fair on campus where around 120 companies, mostly owned by alumni, exhibit and market their products, while some are owned by current students who study and work. This platform inspires others to become entrepreneurs, especially as we also have booths for the regulator and funding agencies for SMEs. Our alumni survey shows that around 11% of our graduates work in the private sector, but we are making every effort possible to increase this percentage with support from the community. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major changes in Abu Dhabi's healthcare sector promoted by HAAD?</h4><p>HAAD works to fulfill its vision for a healthier Abu Dhabi by adopting a two-pronged approach that focuses on both prevention and treatment. Over the past few years, HAAD set out to transform the sector through 58 different initiatives to cover seven strategic priorities it outlined for a better healthcare system and a healthier community. These initiatives include providing a care continuum to reduce capacity gaps in healthcare services and minimize reliance on international patient care; improving the quality of healthcare through its routine quality standards and monitoring of the healthcare system—we accomplished a number of milestones in 2016 via our flagship quality program the Abu Dhabi Quality Index Program (JAWDA), attracting and retaining healthcare professionals with a special focus on increasing the number of Emiratis in its overall workforce; preparedness for emergency during emergencies and disease outbreaks; wellness and prevention of disease to focus on the Weqaya program, injury prevention, mother and child care, occupational health, combating and preventing communicable disease, updating vaccine programs, reducing hereditary illnesses, improving oral health, and combating obesity in children and much more; ensuring cost-effectiveness to sustain healthcare spending, optimizing spending on medical products, and a system to assess health insurance premiums; and a network of medical laboratories to achieve savings; and e-health, which entails the creation of a health information platform to enable the exchange of data among providers.</p><h4>What are the main targets of your Capacity Master Plan regarding technological introductions in the healthcare sector and how will the plan channel investments into the sector?</h4><p>Over the years, HAAD has consistently studied the needs of the healthcare sector for capacity planning, including demand within remote areas, in order to ensure optimal investment to meet current and future needs, and secure a return on investment. The statistics reflect the need for medical services and identifies gaps in healthcare offerings so as to ensure investors have the necessary information to make the best decisions. According to health statistics in 2014, there are gaps in beds of intensive care, orthopedic surgery, gynecology, cardiology, urology, and psychiatry. To fill these gaps, HAAD works closely with investors, providing them with all the necessary information, including the medical needs and requirements of the health sector to help them make the right decision. With these focuses in mind, HAAD guides and incentivizes investment in the sector through the provision of a complete analysis and defining baseline and measurement systems to assist in identifying capacity gaps, developing a capacity planning methodology, and a more comprehensive Capacity Master Plan to provide a detailed supply-side modelling at the district, centralized, and regional service level. </p><h4>What are the prospects for the Emirate to become the region's medical tourism hub?</h4><p>HAAD is proud to see where the healthcare sector in the Emirate stands today. We are indeed proud of world-class providers joining the local healthcare scene such as the Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi to help increase the capacity of the sector. However, our confidence in the sector's performance is not just based on the increase in healthcare providers. Over the past year alone, we witnessed a series of impressive successes ranging from the introduction of effective programs and initiatives, to the development of various areas in the healthcare sector, with an emphasis on improving patient safety and quality. For example, we saw the Abu Dhabi Quality Index Program (JAWDA) positioning us in an increasingly distinguished position compared to other healthcare systems in the region. Building on our success, we were able to achieve another milestone by hosting the fourth Annual Middle East Patient Safety &amp; Quality Congress in Abu Dhabi. The congress saw us bring together industry leaders to discuss the most pertinent issues in healthcare, such as effective regulatory engagement, innovation, quality, technology integration, and patient empowerment. We celebrated Abu Dhabi's pioneering healthcare efforts, showcased our quality model to our peers, and exchanged valuable knowledge to further elevate healthcare in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Sports Council progressed in its objective to bring the attention of the sports world to Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>We have delivered a strong level of exposure to both our international events and to our partners, while continuing on our journey to becoming a global capital for sport. One of the major highlights we achieved during 2017 is the upgrade of the Abu Dhabi Tour to the highest level of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), which means this event was included in the 2017 World Tour Calendar. This is particularly impressive when we consider the Abu Dhabi Tour has only been running for two seasons and is already sitting at the top table of world cycling. This recognition has a positive impact on cycling, the wider sport sector, and for the development of events in Abu Dhabi. We have also maintained our focus to improve the level of engagement within the local community and to ensure we are promoting a healthy and active lifestyle for all of Abu Dhabi's residents.</p><h4>What is ADSC's strategy to promote sports in the Emirate?</h4><p>Our campaign Sport in Abu Dhabi seeks to promote the Emirate's central role in sport's global landscape. The campaign has three pillars: invite international teams to use our facilities and our sporting ecosystem, in turn bolstering our sports tourism return; leverage our events from the Sport in Abu Dhabi international promotional platform and increase event attendance and awareness; and promote the hosting of world-class international sports events in Abu Dhabi. We experimented with such an umbrella marketing campaign with our niche Golf in Abu Dhabi campaign a few years back. Based on the successful outcome and our experiences we will return to the market and expand our offering to include other sports such as football, cycling, and triathlons. The campaign also aims to highlight the importance of sport for all and promote healthy lifestyles.</p><h4>How have your investments in infrastructure been reflected in the events Abu Dhabi has attracted?</h4><p>We are more than halfway into the five-year strategy we launched in 2014, and now we are looking forward to completing all the goals of that strategy. The following two years will be extremely exciting for us; we are hosting the 2017 and 2018 FIFA Club World Cup, 2019 AFC Asian Cup UAE, and the 2019 Special Olympics. These are high-profile events that will continue to cement our position on the world's sporting map. We have now reached a point where our infrastructure is sufficient to host these type of events and, furthermore, it is precisely these types of partnerships that will enhance our ability to bid for future international events. This future plan will also depend on developing our own champions and creating paths for local athletes. This is why we require a long-term plan for the upcoming years.</p><h4>What impact will a locally developed sports ecosystem have on the lifestyle of people in the UAE and how will this drive ADSC's future?</h4><p>We see the future of the sports ecosystem from different angles. Abu Dhabi, and the UAE as a whole, have been a success story for the extensive number of achievements in a short time. We have hosted international events and promoted the Emirate as the indisputable hub for the sports industry in the region. At the same time, we have brought the knowledge and know-how through interactions with most of the international teams and entities that we partner with. We plan to continue to treat sport as a fundamental national requirement, similar to education, health, and security given its links to these areas. A country with a healthy, active community spends less on healthcare and also has a larger margin to spend on other areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE is promoting culture and investing in knowledge programs. What were some of the ministry's flagship projects in 2016?</h4><p>Culture in the UAE is defined by pluralism. The UAE has had unparalleled success with hosting visitors and working residents from around the world in a safe and accommodating environment. Regardless of country, race, or religion, millions of expats safely live and work in the UAE. As hosts to people from around the world, Emiratis draw strength from their cultural identity and have created a society that reflects their traditional values of hospitality and respect. Our culture has been strengthened by exposure to cultures from around the world, making us global citizens without losing sight of who we are. The ministry, therefore, underwrites the preservation of that culture and is dedicated to advancing an appreciation of that identity and enhancing the culture that has shaped it. We also seek to become a global center for promoting the utility and beauty of the Arabic language and for communicating an enlightened understanding of Islamic values. Supporting the great array of cultural activities taking place in the UAE can render a difficult task since the UAE is awash with cultural activity; nevertheless, we keep supporting the most prominent initiatives such as Dubai Expo 2020, Saadiyat Island with the Louvre, the Guggenheim, the Zayed National Museum, the film festivals in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature in Dubai, and the Abu Dhabi Festival organized by the Abu Dhabi Music and Arts Foundation.</p><h4>As the UAE becomes a center of multiculturalism, how is the Ministry working to preserve local identity and unite Emiratis under a single array of cultural values?<br></h4><p>First, we promote Emirati self-knowledge. We need to know ourselves, we need to know other people and other cultures, and they need to know us. Dialog enables knowledge and understanding, and enriches culture. As our community opens itself to the acquisition of knowledge about others, the very culture of the community evolves. Its outlook broadens, its curiosity sharpens, its understanding deepens, its respect for others increases, and its commitment to its values strengthens. The peace and prosperity of the UAE depends on that knowledge and on respectful dialog among all elements of our diverse population. In the UAE, we have been blessed with leaders who understand that the imagination and creativity of the arts provide a wonderfully informative insight to culture. HH the President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al-Nahyan has encouraged our country's artists and has signaled to the entire world the high regard accorded to the creative arts of our UAE citizens.</p><h4>How is the ministry encouraging these new talents to explore their creative spirit?</h4><p>The ministry is already implementing plans to promote and support many important cultural initiatives. We are building strong connections with established and aspiring writers and artists. We are forming oases of creativity throughout the country that will welcome artists from the UAE and abroad. In those locations, they can learn, create, and nurture their imaginations together. We are also encouraging all members of our communities to engage in personal cultural expression by offering skill development and artistic expression opportunities for everyone through programs in our Culture and Knowledge Development Centers. We have major international cultural initiatives with various countries in the world. The collection, documentation, study, and publication of UAE heritage are essential to the mission of the ministry and we undertake efforts to authenticate and publish major works and encyclopedias in various languages, organize heritage festivals, establish digital libraries, publish periodicals, and work closely with colleges and universities in making the study of UAE heritage a valued field of scholarship. The UAE intends to become a global center for the creative industries and the ministry will assist that development by holding cultural conferences, building strong regional and international cultural relations, and organizing an active cultural season in the ministry's centers throughout the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

This began with the completion of the USD2 billion Zakum project. During this project NMDC built four artificial islands for oil production platforms, which was a very complicated job because we made the islands into productive brown fields. That required sophisticated work in construction, methodology, and design. After the Zakum project, we moved into Egypt to lead the international consortium for Suez Canal and achieved that project on time as well. Then we went from Suez Canal to India for one of the biggest current projects for an LNG terminal. The culmination of all of these projects means that today, NMDC is recognized as a global player in the sector.</p><h4>What are some of the strategic challenges that come with working on such large and innovative projects in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>The NMDC is honored to be taking on strategic projects for Abu Dhabi, like the Khalifa Port project, and the development of new islands for real estate and entertainment. Abu Dhabi Port is something unique for us and other companies because it is a multi-activity project. You will not find any of our competitors building quay walls up to 21m below sea level and also doing dredging in a project at the same time. This is really a unique job for NMDC to show everybody how much NMDC has to offer. For any project like that you would normally find a couple of companies working together, one to do dredging and another to do the quay wall, but NMDC is doing everything by itself. The foundation of NMDC is built upon our strong partnership with Abu Dhabi Port, as well as our relationship with the Abu Dhabi government entities, especially ADNOC. The Abu Dhabi government has trusted NMDC with its most strategically difficult jobs, which sends a very good signal. This kind of relationship with Abu Dhabi government and the trust of Abu Dhabi government for NMDC creates a strong foundation for NMDC to grow upon.</p><h4>How does NMDC integrate smart technology into its projects?</h4><p>We have our fleet plan initiatives already running, and we are building a new hopper that is up to date with the latest technology. We are upgrading our fleet with the latest technology, alongside another initiative to link our Cutter section fleet to automation technology for dredging. Everything is linked to performance and efficiency so whatever technology we implement is not solely for the sake of having new technology. The fleet development initiatives we have are to add more power to the fleet when it comes to qualifying NMDC for more complicated jobs. </p><h4>What sustainability initiatives or environmental projects are you working on or supporting?</h4><p>When you think of NMDC as a dredging company, there is often a concern for the environment because we are making channels and we are digging into the sea. However, we have a QHSE department, which is a strong component of the company, and we do a construction management plans to make sure that we are not damaging the environment. On top of that, we took the initiative to start several projects to improve the water circulation for mangroves and for the marine habitat. Furthermore, a couple of months ago we started initiatives to clean all the water ways of Abu Dhabi, as well the seaports. With our own equipment, we cleaned up everything, and by today's figures we have removed about 42 tons of rubbish from the sea. We believe that this is our role, and we have to be committed to the environment because this is not just for us; it is for the coming generations.</p><h4>What type of competition are you anticipating within the market and what is your outlook in general?</h4><p>The main competition in the dredging is usually between six or seven companies, with a few in Europe, one very big one in China, one in the US, a small one in Malaysia, and we are the biggest one in the Middle East. We are competing with each other everywhere. Now that we have become a player on the world stage, 90% of our projects have international competition. Even in local projects you will find us competing with the other major dredging companies, whether it is here in the Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, India, or Egypt.  The market is not as easy as it used to be, and we are doing our best to keep growing internationally, not only in the GCC. At the moment, we see some projects coming, but of course it is tough. I see this difficulty in a positive light because it forces us to make the company resilient, capable, and ready for the challenges of te future. The market is always like that, and we have to use this as an opportunity to better NMDC. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[alonso-bogantes-general-manager-matra]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has happened in MATRA during the last year?</h4><p>We added new brands to our portfolio, the most important one being Volvo Trucks. Volvo owns Mack Trucks and that helped achieving this goal as we have represented Mack since 1953. This expansion of our portfolio in the trucks business enlarges our focus and footprint. There are products Volvo has which will allow us to compete in segments of the market we did not participate before. Volvo Trucks includes buses, so it also means an expansion for us as we already represent Zhong Tong buses. In this segment, we are well diversified as Volvo Buses are high-end products and Zhong Tong focuses on a more economic type of bus.</p><h4>Why is it important to diversify your portfolio of brands?</h4><p>It is important to add value; however, it is more important for us to have the critical mass to be able to compete in each sector. MATRA is undeniably the largest dealer of heavy machinery in the country and the only way we can justify the investments we have made in the last few years is by having different products for the industries we cover. Being the largest dealer means our customers expect a lot more from us: More presence throughout the country, more parts inventory and shorter lead times. It also means investing in resources so that our employees are better trained and able to solve problems quickly. As a contrast, we could concentrate on certain industries and try to just perform on those which means having a smaller company. We chose having a larger company with a larger footprint. As an example, this year we opened branches in Rio Claro, Caldera, and Guápiles. There will also be a big focus on Guápiles in 2018 because there will be significant expansion of demand in the Caribbean.</p><h4>What is the importance of secondary cities such as Limón?</h4><p>Limón will likely be the fastest-growing area outside of San José in the next few years. There will be exponential growth because of the dynamics of the logistics industry. As a result, other sectors of the local economy will grow, especially those related with primary services. Executives will start living there, there will be necessities of more hotels, restaurants schools, etc. The government will have to look into the logistics and the infrastructure. The other area that will continue to grow is the north of the country in the surrounding areas of San Carlos. We see big expansions of business in the agriculture and agro industrial sectors. It already is a dynamic area and primary services should also continue to grow.</p><h4>How do you see this infrastructure problem evolving in the future?</h4><p>I do not see it evolving; nothing has happened in the last 12 months. I am not being negative; it is a matter of analyzing what has happened and how we incorporate those facts into our budgets. On a positive note, we hope the 57 agreements achieved by the nine main political parties become a reality. In the end, it means whoever wins the next election will have to work toward accomplishing those agreements. For the first time in 20 years political parties are agreeing on common subjects and are concentrating on the ways to execute what the country needs. One of those subjects is infrastructure. We all agree we need to be able to execute the construction of roads and finally solve the problem of mobility, especially within the metropolitan areas. We hope the next government will be able to implement it.</p><h4>Has the boom in construction impacted MATRA's business?</h4><p>It has positively impacted particularly the industrial part of our business. We sell power generation and every building built needs a power generator. The services and specialized manufacturing industries are growing; especially those related to free zones. Forklifts and power generation play an important role in those sectors. If the pace at which the country builds buildings and free zones was equal for roads, bridges, and dams then we would be in a great shape.</p><h4>Why should customers choose MATRA?</h4><p>Because we are the best at what we do. The relationships with our customers does not end when the equipment leaves our facilities; we in fact believe that is when the relationship starts. We have been in the market for 66 years. It is not a matter of luck to be able to take care of this market for such a long period of time. It requires a great deal of knowledge and compromise. The market recognizes our commitment with aftermarket focus. Customers can rely on us for parts, service, rental, and more. We are undoubtedly the best solution because we have a footprint all over the country, technicians travelling all across the country, and the tools and technology to be able to put machines to work.</p><h4>What is your strategy for growth in 2018 and for the future?</h4><p>We want to concentrate on covering the brands we represent and properly delivering based on the expectations of our customers. We also want to focus on growing demand for port machinery products. We want to make Volvo one of the main truck brands in the country. We will slow down on opening of new branches and will focus on enlarging the infrastructure on current 15 facilities. That also means bigger service shops at certain branches.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the ministry's main developments and achievements over the past year?</h4><p>To ensure the highest levels of healthcare, the Minister of Health &amp; Prevention has set up health centers staffed by professional family doctors. The ministry has sought to improve the capabilities of these centers and now has a total of 77 centers in the Emirate. Over the past few years, the medical staff have expanded their services to cover the various needs of the community. In primary healthcare, there have been successes in many programs in areas such as periodic examination, pre-marriage counselling, mental health, health promotion, and continuing medical education. Primary care has been at the forefront of our strategies for the development of comprehensive health programs, the most important of which is the early detection programs for the prevention of genetic disease, including neonatal diseases. This program will help us to establish a national record of congenital malformations and genetic diseases in the UAE. The aim of this program is to protect children from mental and physical disabilities, and to reduce the number of deaths. The program was established in 1999 and succeeded in detecting many of these distortions. In international accreditations, the percentage of international funds for our health centers has increased, and the Joint International Accreditation Committee is continuing to cover the Ministry of Health &amp; Prevention's centers until 2021.</p><h4>Statistically, cardiac and chronic diseases pose the biggest threat to life in the UAE. How is the ministry tackling these issues?<br></h4><p>Our leadership is committed to addressing this as the biggest cause of death in the Emirates. Our centers and clinics, as well as our partners in the public and private health sectors, have developed an advanced strategy to address non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases as well as risk factors such as obesity. We have carried out several awareness campaigns to the community on the main risk factors, including programs for healthy hearts and the benefits of physical exercies, as well as the danger of tobacco. These programs have raised awareness in different parts of the country and within public and private education institutions.</p><h4>How will Health Mirror transform the approach of patients toward health services and what impact do you expect this new technology have on the sector as a whole?</h4><p>The Health Mirror supports the government's vision of implementing a high-quality health system, and improves disease prevention and mortality reduction for chronic and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood-pressure. This smart sensor will allow patients to learn their weight, height, BMI, and even the weather forecast simply by standing in front of the mirror. The smart mirror will be connected to a medical filing system, which allows the patient to view his or her electronic medical file, book appointments, and communicate with a doctor. This is an innovative way for patients to access the necessary healthcare from their own home, and allows doctors to monitor the condition of their patients quickly and accurately.</p><h4>Smart applications and digital products have been some of the most interesting introductions from the ministry in recent months. How have these features helped you reach a wider audience?</h4><p>The Ministry of Health &amp; Prevention is keen to offer a range of e-services and smartphone applications as part of its ambitions to become a smart service. This is based on the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to ensure access to government services around the clock, and to meet the needs and expectations of citizens via the adoption of services on smart devices. The ministry seeks to spread knowledge about new and innovative electronic services among the customers and employees, to reach a wider audience through a variety of media including its website, social media, and local newspapers. The latest developments in smart services include the Smart Patient Portal, telemedicine, the unified medical file, the Happiness Index , and our smart pharmacy program. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Success Story]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-success-story]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abu Dhabi Ports presented one of its best annual results to date in 2016. What were the major accomplishments for the company's development over this period?</h4><p>Last year we had quite a successful run. At the time we closed our books, our performance for 2016 reflected a 152% increase in our net profit, 15% increase in revenue, a 90% increase in our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA); our customs contribution jumped to 70%. We contributed 3% to non-oil GDP in 2015 and we expect the number to increase for 2016 once we obtain the results. We handled 1.54 million TEUs in 2016, reaching a total of more than 5 million since the inception of Khalifa Port in late 2012. We handled more than 17.8 million tons of general cargo and bulk, hitting the highest record in the Emirate, with a 16% increase. Cruise passenger traffic is also estimated to grow by 8% in 2016/2017, with over 250,000 cruises from 137 ship calls. We opened a new cruise beach destination in Sir Bani Yas Island and also completed the second phase of the warehouses in Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (KIZAD) by adding an additional 64 warehouses. We leased more than 2.1sqkm in 2016. Furthermore, we continued to put Khalifa Port and Abu Dhabi on the map of global trade through a major agreement we signed with the Chinese company COSCO under the One Belt, One Road initiative, which has selected Khalifa Port to be its hub in the region.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi has its eyes set on the exporting industries as a driver of economic growth. As the manager of the leading export hub in the country, how is AD Ports contributing?</h4><p>Responding to the rising demand from both foreign direct and existing investors wanting to establish and grow their manufacturing and industrial business in UAE free zones, we have launched Khalifa Port Free Trade Zone, the largest free zone in the region with a total size of 100sqkm. We are currently in the process of leasing plots but this will take some time between signing the agreement and having factories up and running. We already signed a couple of agreements that will see 15-20 factories or logistics providers up and running, and when this area is fully built, the real contribution to GDP will be visible.</p><h4>What would you like to attract to KIZAD that could take it to the next level when it is fully operational?</h4><p>The beauty of KIZAD is that we made it in clusters that we defined according to Abu Dhabi's needs and the parameters of Vision 2030. KIZAD has highly targeted sectors coming into its facilities. On top of that, there are some sector-centric enablers such as EMAL for aluminum, Borouge for plastic and polymers, and other companies alike. We have already established the high-end players as anchors for other companies, so we are expecting the middle and low stream players related to these industries to follow suit. The plan is to have sectorial clusters and we are marketing all of these clusters in parallel. All of these industries are part of a bigger vision of what Abu Dhabi and the UAE needs in terms of industry and logistical providers.</p><h4>The popularity of Khalifa Port has facilitated its prompt expansion. What have been the major advances in this regard?</h4><p>The port is fairly new with just about four years of operations, but it has already stirred high demand. We recently expanded it by 1km and are also deepening the channel and the basin from 16.5m to 18.5m to cater to the biggest ships sailing today and in the foreseeable future. We added 1km of quay wall and the adjacent land, which is a substantial area as well. The agreement we signed with COSCO was also a motive for this expansion, as the deal will add 3.6 million TEUs per annum. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for the company and how would you assess Al Nar's development over recent years?</h4><p>We began operations in 1973 with a range of infrastructure projects across the UAE. We were a family-owned company, but are currently in the process of implementing a shared ownership arrangement for the key people in the company, ensuring a fruitful future for the entity. Over our 43 years of history we have been growing slowly but surely to become a leader in the contracting sector covering a large spectrum of areas. We have developed projects in the water, electricity, sewerage, street lighting, and fiber-optic areas, as well as in-house engineering and procurement. Al Nasr has become a one-stop shop for companies looking for high-quality engineering services and this is what plays to our advantage.</p><h4>How has Al Nasr structured its business model over these last four decades?</h4><p>We have structured ourselves as a self-sufficient entity for every job we do. We have been pioneers in the sub-sectors we cater for, such as water, and therefore did not need to depend on someone else to fulfill our projects. This has proven to be a quality that has played in our favor, as we have not been forced to rely on third parties. Al Nasr's business model is an in-house model. Our clients know and acknowledge this model and know that we are quality-driven, even if that means committing part of our profits for the sake of delivering a project on time.</p><h4>How has your background as one of the first UAE-based contracting companies served your expansion plans and how have you contributed to the maturing of engineering services in this country?<br></h4><p>Being a UAE-based company opens many doors for contracting and engineering companies such as Al Nasr. We have been blessed with the path we have embarked on in this country, and we have been part of some of the most iconic projects in Abu Dhabi, such as Yas Island, Khalifa Port, Al Raha Beach, and the Al Ain Stadium, among others. We execute highly technical construction projects that would be rendered challenging by most contracting companies due to the complexity of their development. On top of that, the UAE has advanced enormously in its rules and regulations, permit systems, and infrastructure developments. It is no exaggeration to state that we are spoiled in such a developed market and we are proud to be part of it and to promote the UAE brand in the region.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the current state of the market and how is this situation impacting Al Nasr?</h4><p>The market has been going through an interesting spiral of ups and downs, and we see it as a matter of survival of the fittest. The most competitive companies have been able to overcome this period while others have perished in the process; at the end, this will generate a healthier market with only quality players operating in it. We believe that by end-2017 this restructuring process will finish and we will see a revamp in the market. I see a bright long-term future for the UAE.</p><h4>What have been your experiences operating projects outside of the UAE and how do opportunities in neighboring markets fare against those present in the UAE?</h4><p>Having a long-standing history of successful projects in the UAE has been one of our strongest platforms to move outside the country; however, for now we have decided to return to our roots and operate solely from the UAE. The process, however, has been anything but easy. We have started projects in other GCC nations but the processes are slow, obstacles are great, and the experiences have not always been pleasant. It is for that reason that we have decided to remain local and would rather invest in our operations here to increase our share in the Emirati market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What best practices have you adopted from your partners globally to transform the national media landscape in the UAE?</h4><p>The largest area for growth is probably the digital media aspect, where global changes are leading the way. We saw the best practices in different areas and we understand the engagement model. Whether it is Netflix or Amazon, we look at these companies that care deeply about the digital platforms and we engage with them in their ambitions to conquer the local market. Advising on the viability of local content and where the demand might be is part of our engagement with international players. At the same time, we tackle the learning curve for digital media and understand what media represents and how we can use the platforms that are booming at the moment. One of our main objectives is to develop Arabic content and we also want to build upon these partnerships to promote locally developed content, from video and cinema to gaming.</p><h4>How has legislation on national media changed according to the UAE's transformation into a sophisticated, more globally integrated nation in the global arena?</h4><p>One of our major preoccupations is how to bring the legislative framework governing the media in sync with the realities of the digital era. There are many legislative initiatives that we have either completed or are in the process of finalizing—classification of all published materials, including films, according to the age groups they are suitable for, a comprehensive legal framework for digital and online media, and the easing of licensing processes with maximum reliance on online platforms, for example. We are currently reviewing our legislative framework in its entirety to see to what extent it conforms to the realities of a digital era.</p><h4>You support local content and support the readers who would consume that content. What are your strategies to attract publishers and editors, as well as foster readership in the country?</h4><p>The Reading Law was launched in 2016 to foster reading as a habit and improve readership. Part of the initiative of that law is to support the publishing industry, which we are responsible for. At present, we want to help the publishing industry to classify books and to reengineer our processes. We are also revising the licensing process to make it shorter and easier for the publisher to publish more books. We also started an initiative to support publishers who find the costs of printing too high, if their content promotes our local culture and identity, we subsidize the cost of printing. Furthermore, we are currently involved in the process of finalizing some decisive measures to enhance digital and information literacy in the UAE. It will cover a wide range of issues relating to our everyday aspects of digital literacy. </p><h4>The NMC is in the midst of its 2017-2021 Strategic Plan. What target have you set your eyes on for the development of the local media industry?</h4><p>We are now fully invested in providing our online services to the best international standards and we are working on legislation to regulate online and digital media to the highest standard. Our objective is to ensure that the legislative environment for the media sector in its entirety in the UAE is on par with the best anywhere in the world. We will grow our partnership network, such as the MoU we recently signed with Abu Dhabi University to enhance a new generation of competent media persons in the UAE, who are rooted in the local cultural milieu on the one hand and wired to the global scene on the other. We want all of our services to be digitally available and we want all our licenses to be viewable from mobile devices. For the NMC, our strategy is to be up to date with innovative solutions that can provide information to the public to facilitate the UAE's ambitious plans. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been ADT's major contributions in promoting Abu Dhabi as a trade hub?</h4><p>The growth ADT experienced over the past 10 years and the opening of a new port in this zone enabled trade to grow in Abu Dhabi in an unprecedented way. In only a decade, Abu Dhabi went from facing difficulties to accommodating a competent global network and the establishment of 63 international connections from one single zone. This, along with the improvement in the cost of logistics, transit times, and ease of doing business, has been our major contribution to the local economy. We have also been able to triple our business from 2010 to 2016, which reflects a positive impact from a local perspective. We have created a number of interesting jobs for the local labor market, we introduced state-of-the-art technologies into our daily operations, and have also hired a growing number of locals.</p><h4>Which sectors have absorbed the opportunities left by conventional industries?</h4><p>In 2017 there will be a mixture of 12 logistics, operations, and industrial companies opening up in KIZAD. The industry is diversifying into raw material sectors in industrial, alternative energies, and services industries such as pharmaceuticals. It will still be those key commodities that drive growth on the export side, but with a larger push toward regional logistics as a way of adding value to the Abu Dhabi economy. There are still large investments in the pipeline for paper mills, copper re-barring, and similar downstream metal value adding processes, but there will also be a stronger focus on automation and technology rather than activities that are labor or energy intensive. The best part from an economic perspective is that the industries keep diversifying and, as long as there are options for Abu Dhabi to extend its trade tentacles, good things will come.</p><h4>ADT signed an agreement to expand and operate Khalifa Port in partnership with Chinese company Cosco Shipping. What does this agreement entail and how will it benefit the operations of the port? </h4><p>The agreement entails the transition of Khalifa Port into a multi-operator environment such as the ones we have in traditional regulator-operator environments in places like Europe or the United States. In sharp contrast, most Gulf ports are monopolists with a single entity acting as the regulator and the operator at the same time. At Khalifa Port, there will be open competition and that is good news for trade and the industry since it will drive the quality of services up and it will ensure that customers are being offered the right prices. The plan is to add around 80,000TEU capacity to the port and we expect it to be fully operational by mid-2018. This is the second concession that has been secured with Khalifa Port, meaning that there will be a second terminal in this area.</p><h4>What do you envision for the development of the export industry for the next year?</h4><p>While the stabilization of oil prices will certainly take some time before it sees the light at the end of the tunnel, there are other economic drivers that will positively impact growth in the UAE. Population growth is one of the main ones, with a higher forecast than any other GCC country positioned at 11%. This will be one of the main variables that will shape the economic future of the country in the short run and will position the UAE ahead of its peers. Also, local companies have found ways to diversify their operations and offer more cost-effective services to counter imbalances caused by lower oil prices. They have done their own checklists and this has been for the benefit of the country as a whole. In an economic slowdown everyone needs to look for internal value and that is happening a great deal at the moment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With an expected 24 million passengers passing through Abu Dhabi Airport in 2016, how would you assess the airport's role as a regional hub?</h4><p>The consistent increase in passenger traffic is emblematic of Abu Dhabi's status as an international hub for commerce and tourism, and as a transit point connecting all corners of the world. After record-breaking figures in 2015, passenger figures at Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH) have continued to increase, reaching 11 million between January and June, representing a 6.6% increase compared to the first half of 2015. Having a world-class international airport plays a vital role in raising the profile of the Emirate and enables the diversification of Abu Dhabi's economy by fostering growth across industries through increased connectivity.</p><h4>How will Abu Dhabi Airports' activities contribute to the objectives of Abu Dhabi 2030 Vision to propel touristic activities and raise the number of visitors?</h4><p>Aviation and aerospace are among the key growth sectors identified by the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030, and we are committed to supporting this vision. Abu Dhabi Airports has strong relationships with a host of industry stakeholders and works closely with the Tourism and Culture Authority (TCA), the Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC), and Etihad Airways. We highlight events such as the Formula 1 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Abu Dhabi Air Expo, and Abu Dhabi Summer Season, promoting them via strategic activations across all our terminals. Currently, Abu Dhabi Airports is focusing on developing capacity at Abu Dhabi International Airport and on the construction of the Midfield Terminal Building (MTB.) The MTB is a vital enabler of the diversification of the Emirate's economy. It will foster growth in other industries through improved connectivity and further develop tourism by increasing the airport's overall capacity, allowing more airlines and more passengers to use our facilities, raising the overall capacity to 45 million passengers per year. </p><h4>What new technology has been introduced to the airport's facilities and what other innovations are you looking to develop?</h4><p>The MTB will have the very latest technology in every system that is installed, exceeding global standards. We recognize the need for smart solutions that can be implemented parallel to the construction of our new terminal, to improve capacity. In March this year, we launched the Smart Travel system, which allows passenger traveling through the airport to complete all their travel processes, from check-in to aircraft boarding, interacting only with technology. Implemented in partnership with the UAE's Ministry of Interior and Abu Dhabi Police, smart travel consists of five steps: self check-in, self-bag drop, e-registration, e-gate, and self boarding. The system reduces passenger processing times by up to 70%, meaning less time in queues for travelers and more time to enjoy the airport's facilities such as Duty Free shopping, spas, food and beverage outlets, the library, and children's play areas. This technology not only provides greater convenience for passengers, airlines, and the airport, it also improves security by giving a more accurate and reliable source of passenger data. A more advanced version of Smart Travel will be incorporated into the MTB, along with other IT-based solutions.</p><h4>What are your targets for the next two years?</h4><p>We always aim to grow our business commercially, improve our processes, and maintain high standards, all while delivering a world-class experience to our passengers. Abu Dhabi's growing economy and its increasing attraction as a place for tourists, businesses, and transit passengers creates the need for the best-quality transportation infrastructure to be available in the Emirate. This starts and finishes with the capital's airport, so it is vital for us to keep pace with the increasing inflow of passengers and offer them the best possible experience when they use our facilities. Over the next two years we will continue to invest in new technologies to cater for the key challenge of growing passenger traffic, and focus on finalizing our iconic new airport terminal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-major-hub]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the largest helicopter operator in the GCC, which industries represent the bulk of your operations and how have they evolved over time?</h4><p>We are the largest commercial helicopter operator in the Middle East with a highly qualified team of pilots and maintenance engineers, all supporting a large number of companies in the UAE. The UAE remains our major hub. In the UAE, there are different sectors such as oil field support, Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS), and transportation of nationals to the different islands around the mainland through fixed wing aircraft, that remain our largest chunk of services as a company. On the other side, we also have done a series of international contracts that have gone from leasing aircraft in India, to lending our services to the oil industry in Brazil during an oil boom in the past, to firefighting services in Spain. We also run HEMS in Saudi Arabia, where we were well positioned due to the promptness and efficacy of our services. We also do a lot of maintenance for other parts of the world. Our secret is that we are a diverse company in terms of services, so we are able to evolve, grow, and retract depending on the market and this opens the door for a better position among the local competition.</p><h4>Aerospace and defense have been two of the leading sectors identified in Abu Dhabi's vision. How does ADA contribute to the development of local intellectual property?</h4><p>Our 40 years of know-how as a company is intellectual property to me. We have developed expertise during that time and we are trying to build on this and leverage this in order to offer different solutions locally and globally. Our strategy goes around working on delivery. As we have mastered the operation and maintenance of aircraft over the past 40 years, we have moved on to training people and companies. This is where our expertise can be captured and delivered in the training program that we will offer at the training school that we will operate, as well as through our consultancy services. Our partnership with Agusta Westland Aviation Service (AWAS) is a piece of that, as it is the master manufacturer of the AW139. With it we have cultivated certain capabilities within the country so that the support for its product is being done in-house.</p><h4>Which markets represent the greatest opportunity for expansion?</h4><p>India presents a pool of opportunity for us due to its proximity and its rapid growth. We will focus on the Indian market as we move on. It is important to state that ADA has no limitations when it comes to its reach, and we will move wherever we perceive opportunities coming our way. Historically, we have been everywhere and there is no geographical limitation to where we can operate. We have good pilots, good aircraft, and a good system, making us the best choice in the market.</p><h4>What do you envision for the aviation sector in 2017 and how will ADA fit inside these developments?</h4><p>The aviation sector overall is very volatile. It is affected by economic situations within the area, and the best approach we can have toward the market is putting things in perspective. The strategy implemented by many of the players within the sector—and where many of them invested—protected them from being totally impacted by the complex economic situation. Every player has put in place a strategy to diversify their earnings. All of the sectors do not go bad at the same time, so this is a good survival strategy to cope with the ups and downs. The common factor is the oil price; there are pros and cons that accompany it. It makes your operations cheaper on the one hand, making it more attractive for people to travel. We need to work around this volatility and go through challenges with strength, and ADA has mastered this strategy well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the impact of the recently implemented Property Law in Abu Dhabi and how does it reflect on your daily activities? </h4><p><span></span>Business planning and decision-making are based on analysis, information, and intuition. The impact of the new regulations is that we have started to see more analysis for future business growth, therefore creating a win-win situation for the authorities, the regulator, and us. Today, we have the information we require about the number of people renting, what types of products are available, and so forth. It is a healthy environment for new businesses looking to establish themselves here, and for continuity and growth. At a personal level, I felt the market needed this new legislation in order to analyze and have a necessary breakdown of information about the sector.</p><h4>How would you describe your portfolio mix between high, middle, and lower-end real estate?</h4><p><span></span>The inherent flexibility that characterizes FGP allows us to cover all the different segments of the market, especially in Abu Dhabi and we have high, middle, and low-cost properties. In 2016, there was a significant drop in demand for high-end properties because tenants started to become more cost conscious and because this is an internally driven market. We leveraged our portfolio in light of market conditions; for example, if a tenant has been living in one of our high-end properties, we can offer them alternative accommodation in the middle rental bracket. We have thus been able to maintain our high occupancy rates and there has been no significant impact on us from changes in the market.</p><h4>What do you foresee for FGP's performance in 2017?</h4><p><span></span>In 2017, there will be a merger that will yield huge opportunities for First Gulf Properties and our partner in terms of synergies. After the merger enters into effect in April 2017, we will become a market giant. We are looking forward to being able to leverage on our existing services and collaborations between both real estate arms and so forth. We already have activity with Reem Island, developing projects with over a couple of billion in investment. Abu Dhabi is unique in terms of its real estate demand and supply model as there is no volatility due to the regularized market. We are focused on build-to-lease at the moment and we will continue on this path during 2017.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was ADNIP's performance over the past year and what were the company's major accomplishments?</h4><p>We experienced great growth across all of our business lines in the past year. Our paper production line increased turnover from 65,000 to 95,000 tons in a 12-month period, and we were fully booked with no spare quantity left to sell. The new machine produces advanced NTT paper, a higher absorbance, softer, and bulkier paper with unique qualities that is only produced in Mexico, Chile, and the UAE. This new product opened doors to the European market. Different multinationals have approached us to commercialize NTT paper. On the other hand, our carpet business also increased, and we went from selling 200 million to 270 million per year. We improved the efficiency of the machines to produce larger quantities with less material wastage. Our medical devices segment also performed well in the production of auto-disable syringes for vaccination, where we remain the major supplier for UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organization.</p><h4>Your expansion process has encountered problems related to competition from mass-production companies. How has ADNIP responded?</h4><p>Mass production centers, such as China, Turkey, and India, represent our fiercest competition because they sell at lower prices and apply dumping practices when introducing their products into tertiary markets. However, our strength is in quality rather than quantity, and we maintain a strong client base with companies that are conscious of quality and conform to tight schedules. Mass production competitors find it more difficult to comply with timings and deliveries, and that is where they lose out in comparison to ADNIP. </p><h4>Which markets represent the bulk of your operations for the paper production line?</h4><p>Our main market is Saudi Arabia, to which we export around 40% of our production. In recent years, they have shifted from what we used to call 100% recycled paper or super commercial paper, which was 70% recycled and 30% prime pulp, into prime quality paper, which is far more expensive due to its purity. Other than that, we are also exporting to Europe where the biggest tissue companies such as Kimberly Clark are coming to the UAE and shipping our products to their markets. To the UK alone, we ship 500 tons of paper every month. </p><h4>The healthcare sector in the UAE is projected to become a USD20 billion industry by 2020. How will ADNIP capitalize on this opportunity?</h4><p>Our medical devices lines went through long periods of stagnation before taking off. Until recently, we used to depend heavily on our global partners such as UNICEF to support the line, because there are many requirements, qualifications, and red tape to overcome before fully commercializing this type of product. We recently won the tender from the Ministry of Health and are now working closely with the armed forces and all the medical entities in the UAE to supply them with medical devices. </p><h4>Which markets have been most receptive to your reusable medical devices?</h4><p>Around 90% of our medical devices are shipped outside of the UAE, mainly to Africa, Latin America, and the Arab world. We currently ship around 400 million syringes annually. In addition, our partnership with UNICEF opens the door to countries with a strong presence to these programs, from India to Lebanon to Southeast Asia. </p><h4>What do you see for the future of the company in the next three years?</h4><p>The company is currently worth AED800 million, which we are working to make AED2 billion in the next two years. Immediate plans for 2017 are to do mergers and acquire new business lines that will awake the interest of other companies. We are looking to diversify our scope to cover other industries such as aluminum, steel, carpentry, and the like. There is a great future in these areas and, despite the current economic adversity, I see a great performance for ADNIP for 2017. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the aviation industry in the UAE in recent years, and what opportunities remain? </h4><p>Historically, growth in the UAE has been mostly focused on building capacity in airports and airlines. This has seen UAE national carriers double their seat capacity every few years for the past two decades. Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah have made huge investments in upgrading the runways and terminals at their respective airports. In addition to this, GCAA has undertaken an airspace restructuring project to increase the existing capacity in our skies. This multi-phased project will take some time, but we expect it to result in a multifold increase in capacity in the coming years. MROs and general aviation are the areas where I expect to see the most growth in the future. On our part, we are implementing initiatives to stimulate investment, especially in these particular areas. For example, GCAA will be hosting the 2nd Investment in Aviation Summit this year, and we are confident that such endeavors will lead to tangible outcomes in the near future.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi and Dubai are both becoming international aviation hubs. What strengths do each have to encourage the sustainable growth of local aviation?</h4><p>As HH Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of Emirates, said, “One-third of the world's population, nearly 2 billion people, live within a four-hour flight from Dubai International, and 80% within 12 hours." This is a natural geographic advantage of the UAE. The country's leadership has an ambitious vision to diversify the economy, and the aviation industry is central to any such effort, whether through trade or tourism. Additionally, industry growth is dependent on the quality of infrastructure. The UAE is recognized as having the best road transport infrastructure globally, and the second-best air transport infrastructure. Our open skies policy is yet another catalyst to enhance connectivity and sustainable growth. Together with stakeholders like national airlines, airports, and academic institutions, we are working on stimulating innovation and creativity that we are certain will yield long-term, sustainable results.</p><h4>With the expansion of airport facilities, air routes, and e-services, what will be the main focus for GCAA to strengthen the sector, and what do you expect in the future?</h4><p>Some of the current changes in the industry relate to technology, while others are related to the policy environment. Drone technology will most likely create a massive shift in the industry. I expect to see a proliferation of that technology for both non-traditional usage such as surveillance or topography, and traditional aviation services such as the transportation of goods and passengers. GCAA is developing a sound regulatory framework to ensure that we stay ahead of the curve. As for policy issues, we occasionally see a tightening in the market, especially in times of economic downturn. We are determined to maintain open skies in the UAE and promote global liberalization.</p><h4>After 10 years of operations, what have been the main contributions of GCAA to the development of the industry in the UAE?</h4><p>In the last 10 years, we have made quantum leaps toward achieving a safe and sound industry. We have worked first and foremost on strengthening our resources both in number and in knowledge. The GCAA created the necessary structures, defined roles and responsibilities, overhauled its regulations, created industry committees, and improved its services to be on par with the best practices in the world. This was attested by the results of the audits we underwent, all of which we passed with flying colors. Furthermore, we have built a strong team of inspectorate staff capable of executing effective oversight and resolving safety issues that is also very customer oriented. This balance between the two hats of enforcer and customer service was very tricky. As such, GCAA has put in place policies and strategies to ensure that neither of the two roles negatively impact the other. We take pride in the excellent relationship we have with stakeholders, which is what has really made the difference. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Petro Middle East, and how has the company opened its market to new opportunities throughout its 20-year history?</h4><p>Petro Middle East was established in 1995 as a fully Emirati company with the objective of supplying equipment and providing high-quality services to the oil and gas, petrochemical, and utilities industries here and in neighboring Gulf states. Throughout these 20 years, we have been able to offer our clients a vast range of the latest, most eco-friendly products and services by adapting the newest technologies to our daily operations. We work under a diverse list of principles and have joint ventures with other major players in the industry, promoting knowledge transfers and best practice expertise among our peers.</p><h4>The UAE is renowned for the high quality of its oil and gas companies. How has Petro Middle East managed to keep ahead of the competition as a supplier for the major competitors in the local market?</h4><p>The strategy Petro Middle East has followed was designed and implemented by our management and crafted to ensure sustainable growth and profits for the group, be it through adding more services or investing in new joint ventures. In addition to that, Petro Middle East believes in valuing the caliber and quality of employees within our team, and our main ambition has been to build a goal-oriented team. We believe in investing in our employees' capabilities and in giving them all the resources needed to excel in their respective fields, which resulted in the company staying on top of its game vis-á-vis major competitors.</p><h4>What steps has Petro Middle East taken to diversify its operations over time, and what new areas are you looking forward to exploring?</h4><p>Petro Middle East has invested in many joint ventures over the years, like Press Bolts M.E., the first fastener-manufacturing facility in Abu Dhabi, and RRC for Industrial Chemical Cleaning and Specialty Services. We have recently embarked on a new joint venture to provide engineering services and maintenance for the electro-mechanical sector. This diversification process has helped us successfully execute a number of jobs for the Riyadh and Jeddah airports' expansions through our joint venture firm, RRCME, in addition to several jobs in Oman.</p><h4>The downtick in oil has given suppliers that offer cost-effective products an opportunity. How has Petro Middle East built momentum for this?</h4><p>It is true that cost-effective products have been given a greater chance to penetrate the market, and we are taking the chance to get our products out there in this highly competitive market. For example, through our Turbodene product line specialized in waste heat recovery, we are working with various clients to implement systems that will save power by recovering wasted heat. We are doing some feasibility studies for various clients. Furthermore, we also are proposing value-added engineered products and solutions to ADNOC companies, such as high strength composite tubulars/OCTG for down hole applications in collaboration with Akiet (Holland), which will save millions of dollars in drilling and completion budgets.</p><h4>What is the significance of building key partnerships for your company?</h4><p>Building key partnerships with international companies has been always part of the vision of Petro Middle East's management. That is the reason behind the joint ventures that we continue to develop. Our aim is to continue to look for other joint ventures that will enhance our market share in the UAE and GCC and contribute to creating a more stable group of companies.</p><h4>What is your investment plan for the upcoming year, and where would you like to see the firm by 2020?</h4><p>Petro Middle East will keep searching for innovative solutions and product suppliers to represent them in the UAE, as well as for new joint ventures to help us maintain sustainable growth until 2020. We will invest in the upstream industry, engineering services, the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning industries, and other industrial applications outside the traditional oil and gas industry to diversify the group's long-term revenue. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[one-milestone-after-another]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The energy sector experienced many changes in 2016, which has had an effect on EPC suppliers. What challenges has this posed for Linde?</h4><p>The most blatant consequence of the recent downturn was the spending cuts across the industry. A lot of our customers tightened their financial belts and revisited their spending patterns, which inevitably has had an impact on the EPC market in particular. First, there was a pause in awards followed by an overall delay in major decisions; so several projects were shifted or shelved. Now, we gradually see an uptick in activity as our clients have adjusted their strategies and are getting more comfortable with the current price dynamics and the prospect of a more moderate but sustainable oil price. Budgets have been rearranged, and the industry is more comfortable in sanctioning some of the key projects. </p><h4>How has Linde's position as a one-stop-shop EPC company played to your advantage during this period? </h4><p>While being a comprehensive solution provider remains to be an important attribute in our sector, the smart combination of technology and operational elements is critically important. However, all of this can only yield results if it translates into optimized total cost of ownership or, in simple terms, an optimized CAPEX and OPEX. This means that in the EPC world of today being just a one-stop-shop is not necessarily enough to guarantee your success. It is for this precise reason that we offer a number of business solutions. </p><h4>Linde has placed significant effort on developing new technologies to address emissions in the hydrocarbon industry and help turn it into a more valuable molecule. Can you tell us about these initiatives?  </h4><p>Linde is one of the leading organizations in terms of efforts in developing a comprehensive blueprint for the CO2 ecosystem. We have designed and built the world's largest CO2 purification and liquefaction plant in Saudi Arabia for SABIC's United Plant, where SABIC-United is capturing CO2 from the operations and, after purification, putting the CO2 to better use. This is the role of innovation as a means of turning around the CO2 emission challenges to potential opportunities. The commercially captured and purified CO2 can be utilized in upstream for energized fracking as well as in enhanced oil recovery (EOR), whereas in the downstream CO2 can be used as a feedstock to produce chemicals. This is a journey in its early stages but suggests a great future ahead. </p><h4>Linde was awarded the EPC contract for Borouge's Boil Off Gas (BOG) compressor project. What does this entail and what are your expectations? </h4><p>We have had the pleasure of being a part of Borouge's ethane cracker projects in the past and greatly value its vision for operational excellence, as well as optimization across their system wherever there is an opportunity. The BOG compression project, a midsize EPC opportunity, is of the same nature. It is to take advantage of every single molecule and convert them into the bottom line for Borouge's shareholders. This project was tendered and awarded in 2016 and has already been set in motion. Engineering and procurement are well underway and will be followed by site work soon. </p><h4>Your Abu Dhabi office manages operations in other MENA markets. What are some of the most important projects outside the UAE?</h4><p>Having addressed the UAE's opportunities earlier in our talks, we have also made some good progress in one of our major EPC projects in Egypt, which is intended to be a world scale naphtha cracker with associated units. This project, when successfully on-stream, will be pivotal for the economic future of Egypt. The project enjoys very good support within Egypt, so we look forward to the final milestones ahead. We also see good opportunities in Saudi Arabia, both in connection with Vision 2030 and as part of the continued strategic focus of the likes of Aramco and SABIC in their integrated value chain, such as gas networks and chemical clusters. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the company's progress and place in the local insurance industry?</h4><p>
	Our 10th anniversary in 2016 was important to us because we continued our growth, especially in Dubai and the northern Emirates. Our “home market" is Abu Dhabi, where we have the lion's share of our industry, so growing in the other six Emirates was a natural move. By the time we started in 2017, we had an additional 65,000 members secured in Sharjah alone. Furthermore, we have also expanded in terms of our quality. We have improved our services in every segment we offer, made administration procedures more efficient, and designed a domestic strategy to increase productivity and bring overall costs down. These steps will allow us to serve customers better with reasonable premium rates. We had alterations in almost every business line due to reforms introduced in 2016. One of the main changes was the introduction of co-payments for treatment taken in private sector healthcare centers, where Thiqa cardholders have to cover 20% of the total cost of the treatment themselves.
</p><h4>How have recently adopted healthcare regulations transformed your approach towards the local market?</h4><p>
	Initially, the impact was felt more strongly because of the relatively short notice with which these changes were announced. We were suddenly faced with the challenge of changing our systems and modifying communication channels with our clients and providers in less time than we initially would have.
</p><h4>
	How has Daman sustained its competitive leverage within Abu Dhabi's oversaturated market and how does it tailor its offerings to the lower-income segment?
</h4><p>
	The Abu Dhabi insurance market is price-driven. Daman has made it clear that it will never fall into a price war; we would rather be competitive by minimizing administrative costs or optimizing our procedures without selling under production costs. We are not interested in simply selling with guaranteed losses. We work under the method of attracting clients for our services and reasonable products rather than focusing on prices. We have been successful this way and will continue on this path.</p><h4>What is Daman's approach to e-health services, and what have been the company's most recent digital introductions?</h4><p>
	As people increasingly use their smartphones in every aspect of their lives, we deem healthcare a key part of that new way of life. We work heavily on digital health solutions, assistance centers, and pilot programs to extend the scope of our e-health services. We want to offer a selection of proven solutions. At the moment we focus on three key subjects through these applications—tackling diabetes, nutrition programs, and a support program for pregnant women. We have invested in new medicine and a deeper integration between digital solutions to include payments, procurement services, and the like. A further sophistication of e-health will radically change the ways in which we can provide coverage and how we guide our members towards best practice methods in healthcare.</p><h4>What do you envision for the development of the local insurance industry in 2017, and how will Daman remain at the top of the game?</h4><p>
	The focus for the future will be innovation. In 2016, we created a position called Chief Innovation Officer as a reflection of the company's commitment to this part of the business. We have also increased the number of staff members working on innovation and the development of new digital products with an entire floor dedicated to this area. It is through innovation that we try to come up with solutions that might further benefit our customers' requirements. Within the motor sector, the Insurance Authority has defined new rates and new regulations that will certainly impact the market in a positive way. As for the insurance market as a whole, things are hard to predict. There are over 60 players competing in the industry today and experts predict mergers as a tool to obtain a larger share in the market.  It is doubtful we will see major mergers in 2017. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[abdullah-salim-al-salmi-executive-president-capital-market-authority-cma]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the CMA actively promoting investment, risk management, and capital formation?</h4><p>The purpose of the CMA is to regulate and supervise two sectors in Oman: capital markets and insurance. By providing friendly and clear regulations that govern the capital market, we are encouraging foreign investment to come into the country. That is part of pooling capital in order to finance economic projects in Oman. We have seen good signs of that when comparing ourselves in the GCC. We have the highest amount of foreign capital market participation in the GCC; around 30% of our total capital is owned by foreign investors. We also consider ourselves the most open market in the region when it comes to ease of access of doing business and own listed securities in the exchange. On the other side, we regulate the insurance sector, which has two main functions: to insure investors and to insure the public at large. In other words, insuring belongings, businesses, and activities. We believe it is important for any economy to have an active sector that is encouraging people to invest and build assets, as well as making sure that the assets are insured against anything that may happen. The insurance market also functions as a way to pool funds, by gathering cash installments. In this regard we consider the insurance sector investors in their own right, one of the largest in the market. We do look after insurance companies to ensure they are working in a fair manner and working according to the rules and regulations set by the CMA.</p><h4>What is the CMA doing to attract and retain companies in the local capital and insurance markets?</h4><p>We are trying to work with the government in order to prioritize some of the companies that are government owned. As part of Tanfeedh, we have discussed and deliberated over these issues, agreeing that we need to establish a five-year plan into which we can put all government-owned companies, and afterward considering certain criteria to prioritize which companies should come first. That depends greatly on the readiness of the company to offer IPO. We are trying to work with the government in order to implement this initiative. If we manage to bring some of these companies to the public, it would enlarge their shareholder base in the market and provide new products. You cannot attract investors to your shop if we do not have a product. The other element we are working on is sukuk which is something similar to bonds. We have finished the legal framework and all of the rules and regulations are in place. The bond market is another option to encourage investors to go beyond the banking sector. We are also looking into REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts). REITs are another element that we feel is promising. A lot of investors have huge assets here, and that huge value is locked. By adapting REITs it will encourage companies to unlock some of that value and come up with new projects.</p><h4>What are the CMA's objectives for 2017-18?</h4><p>As regulators, our objective is always to keep up with international standards and review our rules and regulations to be sure they are sound and acceptable. For 2017, we hope to see a new takeover code issued, and we believe that it is in the final stages. That should be published soon. We are also working on the new securities laws, a huge task that requires consultation. We have already started the consultation with the public. We have put the initial draft on our website so that the public can look at it and give their feedback; up to now, we have received a huge amount of feedback from investors. We have looked into it and conducted workshops to bring our stakeholders together and listen to them. We have planned other workshops to follow up on the incorporation of the feedback we have received so far. The second draft is ready, but now we need to gather the stakeholders again to explain it, get them to understand it, and buy into it. Then we will be talking to the government entities for final approval.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision for the development of the sector?</h4><p>2016 produced a year of unexpected political and economic shocks, which for many countries, has led to uncertainty and worry. However, the strong leadership and ambition the President, HH Sheikh Khalifah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and the Crown Prince, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, means Abu Dhabi is well placed to benefit from all these shocks. The diversification of the economy through the creation of a well-capitalized, credible world-class financial sector has provided a vehicle for success and growth. ADS Securities is grateful for the opportunity this has provided us, but the best is yet to come. The global financial services industry has evolved significantly since ADS Securities launched in 2010; technology, regulation, and capitalization continue to shape the market in the near and medium term. But, last year the sterling flash crash also demonstrated the risks that technology, in inexperienced hands, can play in our industry. </p><h4>The downswing in oil prices prompted financial services to increase their market share. How has this effect worked in favor of financial companies such as ADS Securities?</h4><p>The visionary leadership of Abu Dhabi and the UAE prepared the country for the downturn in the oil price. Long before the drop occurred, they foresaw the need for economic diversification to guarantee the country's long-term interests. Thus, before the downturn, thriving financial service and real estate sectors had already been established. The importance of this is also linked to the changes in the relative strength of the major currencies.  </p><h4>Economic diversification has pushed an increasing number of companies to look for financial assistance. How has this positioned ADS as the partner of choice for financial services?</h4><p>ADS is one of the largest brokerage companies in the world, and the consolidation of the UAE as a global financial hub has worked to our benefit. We have the largest capitalization among brokerage companies globally with USD585 million. This has allowed us to invest in people, technology, and the products we provide to our clients. ADS has been able to cultivate a sense of confidence among our clients; they know their money is safe, their trades will be executed, and they are backed by advanced technology and state-of-the-art financial regulation.</p><h4>What are the main services you offer from London?</h4><p>London represents nearly 60% of the foreign exchange market, so as the Middle East's largest foreign exchange brokerage, it was essential that we have an operation there. The commercial and business benefits have already validated this decision. In London, our operation is focused on serving our retail and institutional brokerage businesses, as well as the broader UK and European markets. Despite Brexit, London's status as a financial hub will remain untouched. </p><h4>What do you envision for the near future of the financial sector in Abu Dhabi, and where will ADS fit into that future?</h4><p>Looking forward, ADS will continue to focus on our four core business lines—online and offline brokerage, capital debt markets, investment banking, and asset &amp; wealth management. ADS' ability to leverage our strong relationships, deep capitalization, and global influence to reach out to bankers, brokers, and LPs to ensure our clients benefit from the deepest liquidity, fastest execution times, and most competitive spreads truly sets us apart. The UAE has the connectivity, resources, infrastructure, time zone, and regulatory environment to provide any financial services professional with whatever they need. Both Vision 2021 and Vision 2030 form a solid financial package in the long run that will establish Abu Dhabi as one of the strongest financial services markets on the planet. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Manufacturing to represent 33-34% of GDP by 2019]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[airlangga-hartarto-minister-of-industry-indonesia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the Ministry of Industry's key accomplishments and achievements over the last two years?</h4><p>The Ministry of Industry is in charge of developing the manufacturing sectors in Indonesia. President Joko Widodo's vision for industry is first to develop the country's human resources. As part of this, the Ministry of Industry is transforming middle schools, especially vocational schools, so they become the mainstream of Indonesian education in the future. We would like technical training to be a main part of our human resources development based on science, math, engineering, and technologies. Through these vocational schools, we will develop students who can then go on to polytechnic training. We are following industrial countries such as Germany and Switzerland that have vocational schools and polytechnics to develop their human resources. The objective is to get the competitiveness of our labor, talent, and supervisory pools onto the manufacturing floor. The old system is based on a general education at middle school followed by university. This transformation is one of the aspirations of our President. The second aspect is the inclusiveness of the Indonesian economy. There are disparities between the rich and the middle class and poor. We need to narrow the gap by introducing new opportunities for SMEs in the consumer market. We will use the digital platform as a way to transform the SME ecosystem to create inclusive growth in the economy. We will use e-marketplaces based on local start-ups. The difference between Indonesian start-ups and American start-ups, for example, is that here we create jobs out of the application of our digital economy rather than reducing jobs.</p><h4>Indonesia has incredible potential to increase its industrial sector on several fronts. What key strategies drive your work today?</h4><p>Our strategy is strengthening the value chain. In Indonesia, we have a few industries that are competitive. One is based on our natural resources and the second is based on our plantations or agriculture. Both are key for Indonesia's manufacturing sector. Another area is based on metals and electronic manufacturing, and we also have chemicals and textiles manufacturing. With these kinds of industries, we can develop a proper base for participating in ASEAN's Industry 4.0. For example, as part of Industry 4.0 we are promoting activities in the electronics industry, as well as in the food and beverages, cement, and the steel and automotive industries. These are the companies that are already using some element of automation, robotics, or artificial intelligence to enhance their competitiveness internationally. The fourth issue is to advance regional development within the country. So not only to develop industry in Java, but also to develop these activities outside Java. Outside Java we have developed 14 Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Industrial Estates based on the availability of raw materials in those regions. For example, in the North Sumatra region we have developed an industrial estate in Sei Mangkei based on the capital development of crude palm oil (CPO). We have also developed areas in West Kalimantan based on bauxite mining and in East Kalimantan with all the petrochemicals, gas, and palm oil. We have a new development in North Kalimantan based on hydro-power where we are going to build 7,000GW capacity under our master plan, as well as a smelting and refinery complex. In West Papua, there will be developments based on LNG and gas for petrochemicals. In the Southeast of Maluku there is gas for petrochemicals as well. So we have developments happening in a number of geographical areas based on resource-based industries. Of course, Indonesia's manufacturing is still heavily based on Java Island, and secondly on Sulawesi.</p><h4>What work is the Ministry doing to promote value-added industries that are less susceptible to price volatility?</h4><p>Over the last 10 years, commodity prices have been volatile, but that is no longer the case with most commodities going down in price. This is an opportunity for Indonesia to move further into manufacturing. We have a roadmap for 10 million tons of carbon steel in Cilegon, for instance. We have also built a ferronickel plant in central Sulawesi. By YE2017, we will have the capacity to produce around 3 million tons of stainless steel per annum. With increases in production in Sulawesi this capacity will increase to 4 million tons in the next year. This will make Indonesia the second largest producer of stainless steel after China. This is the value addition from USD60 per metric ton of ferronickel raw material into around USD2,000 per ton of stainless steel. This is a real indicator that Indonesia is enhancing its value-added manufacturing. We have done the same thing with CPO from plantation into chemicals and with other commodities as well, such as bauxite to aluminum and aluminum alloy. Therefore, the commodity price drops are in fact a big opportunity for Indonesia.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Currently, under the UN Industrial Development Organization Indonesia is ranked number 10 in the industrial countries and our local manufacturing value-added is at around USD230 billion. We hope that we can increase the level of our manufacturing value-added. In terms of the percentage of GDP and the classification of industrial countries, we can see that the new paradigm for industrialization is not only about manufacturing, but it is from the beginning of the design, the raw materials, and through to distribution and wholesale, so the entire chain, including the consumer and any reuse of the product. This is about the whole cycle and the industrial sustainability concept. We expect that the recent contribution of manufacturing here can be increased from 30% of our GDP today to 33-34% by 2019. That would still not classify Indonesia as a fully industrialized nation, it would be about half. We are on the right track.</p>]]></richbody0content>

One of our biggest achievements in 2016 was enabling the blockchain mechanism through our e-voting services, which has been highly successful. ADX was able to build its own e-voting platform to provide more efficient services for our stakeholders, while guaranteeing secure access to the most technologically advanced forms of trading. The objective for 2017 is to make this platform even bigger and expand it to other services in the exchange. We have built a kind of two-way communication into our website, so we can receive information from our clients and send information back to them. </p><h4>How is new technology changing the market, and how do companies and SMEs operate in the trading markets? </h4><p>These technological advances have established ADX as a benchmark model for the development of other stock exchanges across the region. The blockchain mechanism is a highly developed tool that has not been used in any other MENA market, and we are happy to share our expertise with other markets. The ultimate goal for a bourse working with an SME is to make it grow and help it go public; once they do so, they need mentoring, support platforms, and to develop investor relationships that make their growth sustainable. Along with our stakeholders we are working to provide them with the full range of services.  </p><h4>How will the partnerships between ADX and ADGM foster knowledge transfers between both institutions?</h4><p>ADGM has a unique role to play in attracting international players to Abu Dhabi, and that is a major accomplishment. To that effect, we recently signed an MoU with ADGM to foster bilateral cooperation. The MoU is in line with ADX's commitment to the growth of the financial services sector in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the development of a sustainable financial environment under the auspices of Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, while also establishing a framework that strengthens the bilateral cooperation between ADX and ADGM.  Through the MoU, ADX and ADGM can jointly explore and develop financial products and services that will further boost the economic growth and investment sector of Abu Dhabi. </p><h4>What impact will the Bankruptcy Law have on the financial markets and what are the clearest benefits you see at this stage?</h4><p>Whether institutional, individual, local, or international, any investor that wants to invest in a place or platform is looking for security, transparency, good governance, and well-connected rules and regulations. They want to know that if they invest they will be treated fairly when it comes to risk. This is where the Bankruptcy Law strengthens the market. The more you put into this area of law, the more you adhere to international standards, and the more attractive you are for global investors. We have to speak the same language, use the same mechanisms, and play by the same rules and standards that other countries do. The Bankruptcy Law is yet another asset we have placed in our basket, and it will encourage a larger number of investors into the UAE. </p><h4>Abu Dhabi's vision is to become a global hub for finance. What steps should the Emirate stake to bolster that ambition? </h4><p>Abu Dhabi's profile has increased substantially over the past few years. What we need to do is continue developing our infrastructure and rules and regulations, as well as promote our strengths. The UAE offers the best platform for Asian businesses trying to access African markets and for African businesses trying to distribute their production in Europe, not to mention for European investors trying to get into both those markets. What we need to do is promote these assets and connect all the players around the globe and strengthen our position as a focal point for finance. Abu Dhabi holds all the potential to be a trusted partner in this regard. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>During 2016, oil prices witnessed constant rebounds, adding to better growth rate expectations for the UAE. How have these factors impacted the Central Bank's expansionary policies for 2017?</h4><p>As oil prices nearly doubled from the low levels reached early this year, the concerns that oil prices could fall to the low 20s turned out to be baseless, which was obviously great news for the UAE economic outlook. The Central Bank's estimate is that non-oil activities will continue to grow by about 2.7-2.8% in 2016 and 2017, which is a respectable performance compared to global growth, notwithstanding the impact of the fall in oil receipts on our economy, which we are keen to contain going forward. The Central Bank remains determined to maintain its continued commitment to the fixed peg of the dirham's exchange rate against the US dollar. However, we are keen to increase our capacity to manage liquidity to weather the impacts of external shocks, while adhering to the direction of US interest rate policy. Under these conditions, our focus is on the liquidity needs of banks with a forward-looking agenda. To that end, our research is currently focusing on the scope to activate the macro prudential instruments we have at our disposal and develop contingency plans to weather the adverse effects of global shocks on the domestic economy. This said, it could never be overstated that monetary instruments aim at managing liquidity to maintain resources for private sector activity. However, as experiences around the globe have demonstrated, available liquidity should be coordinated with fiscal and structural policies to boost investors' confidence. The consortium of policies should be growth conducive to enhance our economic prospects to support the non-energy sector in the medium term.</p><h4>How will the full economic diversification redesign fiscal and monetary policy when this target is met in 2021?</h4><p>The UAE has been successful in diversifying its economy away from oil. Moreover, the strategies adopted by the UAE's 2021 Vision, Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030, and Dubai's Strategic Plan 2015 are all intended to attract foreign capital to promising activities, especially export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing, transport and logistics, tourism, telecommunications, renewable energies, and aviation. To support these activities, the government has played a leading role in infrastructure and regulatory developments that have boosted growth prospects in non-oil activities over time. To ensure sustainability in the wake of the recent decline of the oil price, the government has implemented necessary reforms to diversify fiscal revenues while reining in public expenditure in a gradual manner to increase fiscal sustainability. In parallel, policy coordination has necessitated diversifying sources of financing with a goal to reduce reliance on domestic liquidity and safeguard credit growth in support of private sector activity.</p><h4>What are the main incentives the Central Bank currently offers commercial banks to further extend credit to this segment of the economy?</h4><p>Supporting SMEs is a strategic decision taken by the federal government, which has been a priority in the wake of the oil price decline. The first step in this direction was the issuance of the SME Law in 2014, which led to the creation of the SME Council. The Ministry of Economy is taking the lead in this regard and is fully cooperating with us to promote this vital sector. In the particular case of the Central Bank, we are committed to playing a fundamental role in the capitalization of SMEs and startups. We set up a team whose main task is to make proposals on the ways and means the Central Bank could contribute to the implementation the SME Law, in coordination with the concerned stakeholders.</p><h4>What action has the UAE taken to cut its deficit and how does a currency peg signal a positive outlook on the Emirati economy to investors?</h4><p>We agree with the IMF on the need for fiscal discipline in order to maintain fiscal sustainability and ensure the stability of the fixed peg regime. In the UAE, the government of Abu Dhabi took the lead by reviewing water and energy prices in 2014, which reduced the subsidy burden on the fiscal budget. In August 2015, the federal government pressed ahead with the reform of the energy subsidy system, with the aim of aligning local energy prices to international levels, and improving the overall fiscal outlook of the UAE. Reining in the budget deficit requires actions on both the revenue and the spending sides. Reforms have focused on diversifying non-energy revenues. On the spending side, fiscal consolidation aims to strike a balance between growth priorities and ensuring sustainability. In this regard, the UAE could afford to pace fiscal consolidation gradually in light of available sources of financing, including financial buffers accumulated by the sovereign wealth funds. The ample international reserves the Central Bank relies on signify a solid background to our commitment to the stability of the exchange rate peg. Other GCC countries took similar actions albeit at varying degrees, therefore, we remain confident in our ability as GCC countries to keep the fixed peg regime. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Every year, the renewable energy world turns its attention to ADSW. What is the impact of this global event and how has it contributed to positioning Abu Dhabi as a leader in renewable energy?</h4><p>ADSW has played, and continues to play, an important role in positioning Abu Dhabi at the forefront of the renewable energy sector. It is the largest gathering on sustainability in the Middle East, and it has become established as a truly global forum which brings together governments, policy makers, business leaders, and industry experts from across the world. The event addresses a regional and global need for a common platform which tackles a number of critical and interrelated issues. Its aim is to further our collective understanding of the major energy, economic, and technological trends shaping the world's sustainable development. More than that, it is about empowering the global community to respond. The value and importance of ADSW can be seen from its sustained growth into an eight-day event that brings together a wide variety of stakeholders to drive the adoption of renewables and sustainability. The figures speak for themselves; last year we welcomed five heads of state and 73 government ministers to the event, as well as around 1,700 CEOs from different industries. In total, around 38,000 people participated from 175 countries. This year, ADSW welcomed major delegations from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and India for the first time, and another 18 countries had pavilions. This very clearly demonstrates that ADSW is a global platform that strongly supports Abu Dhabi's leadership position in renewable energy.</p><h4>Masdar City has become one of Abu Dhabi's landmark initiatives. How has this project set a precedent for other eco-friendly cities around the globe and how has it attracted global tenants to its facilities?</h4><p>Masdar City is one of the world's most sustainable urban developments and its name is recognized throughout the world. One of the most important factors behind this is that we have kept true to our philosophy that urban development should be based on the economic, social, and environmental pillars of sustainability, with the goal of providing a high quality of life with a low environmental footprint. This integrated approach has enabled us to provide a workable template which others can follow, especially here in the Middle East. Masdar City is today experiencing the most rapid development since it was established, and it has evolved from an entirely self-funded initiative into one driven by partnership. This allows the city to grow at a commercially sustainable pace, while at the same time sharing best practices with wider industry, which is a key part of Masdar's mandate to support the diversification of the UAE economy. </p><h4>What are some of the flagship projects you have invested in abroad, and how are they transforming the energy landscape of developing nations? </h4><p>Masdar has played a central role in deploying renewable energy in the UAE, the wider Middle East, and further abroad. We have invested in renewable energy projects with a combined value of USD8.5 billion over the last decade, of which Masdar's share is worth approximately USD2.7 billion. The gross capacity of these projects, which are either operational or under development, is 2.7GW. We are active across the full spectrum of clean energy projects, from the world's largest utility scale offshore wind farm currently in operation, the London Array in the UK, to a number of small-scale solar home systems. The 117MW onshore Tafila Wind Farm in Jordan was the first commercial utility-scale wind power project in the Middle East. Also under development in Jordan is the 200MW Baynouna Solar Energy Project, the country's largest solar power plant. Our work is truly international, from the Middle East and Africa to Europe, Asia, and the South Pacific. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the development of renewable energy in Abu Dhabi in the year ahead, and what will be Masdar's focus?</h4><p>Through Masdar, Abu Dhabi and the UAE are embracing the huge potential that renewable energy and sustainability offer economies to energise growth, foster advanced R&amp;D, and find solutions to global challenges. In doing this, we are accelerating the development of our industry. Masdar will continue to support the momentum of renewable energy development in Abu Dhabi. We can be very optimistic about the future as we continue to build on recent successes, in line with the double-digit capacity growth that the renewable energy sector is experiencing. Masdar's evolution from being a catalyst for the adoption of renewable energy and sustainability into a market leader will continue. We will see this through our ability to invest at scale, as well as through the diversity of our operations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess ADGM's role in establishing a world-class financial free zone in Abu Dhabi and how does the Emirate attract financial multinationals to establish branches in ADGM?</h4><p>ADGM, the international financial center in Abu Dhabi, was established to support the financial stability and complement the vibrant economic growth of Abu Dhabi and the UAE. It is ADGM's role to identify and cater to the current and future needs of the markets in our region. Our three authorities, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the Registration Authority, and ADGM Courts have been fully operational since October 2015. We have also launched several new initiatives to address the unfulfilled needs of stakeholders for regulated products and business solutions. By providing a comprehensive suite of funds and new innovative investment vehicles, local and global financial institutions can now conduct activities in the UAE, which had to be undertaken overseas in the past. To date, we have registered more than 350 diverse non-financial and financial companies from local and international markets. Global institutions such as Macquarie Capital and Aberdeen Asset Management have also demonstrated confidence in ADGM to host their MENA operations. In terms of funds, we have five domiciled funds and three foreign funds in ADGM. On expanding financial services, we are also pleased that Mubadala Capital will be relocating to ADGM on Al Maryah Island soon. In addition, more than 70 special purpose vehicles (SPVs) have been set up, catering to a broad range of business types, uses, and industries.</p><h4>What key milestones have you reached in the past two years?</h4><p>We are honored that ADGM, in our first year of operations, has been recognized by the industry as the Financial Center of the Year (MENA) 2016 by the prominent Global Investor/ISF publication. ADGM is the first jurisdiction in the region to adopt common law in its entirety, similar to other international jurisdictions such as Singapore and Hong Kong, as opposed to codifying common law. One key advantage of this is that we can benefit from changing case law, which is critical, especially in wealth management where standards, norms, and practices are evolving. ADGM Courts serve as an independent and first-class common law judicial system for ADGM. We are also the first courts in the entire MENA region to be founded upon the direct application of the English Common Law for civil and commercial matters. Being recognized by the FinTech Federation as a global hub member and our efforts in building a fintech ecosystem in the region are significant milestones and achievements.</p><h4>What is the current state of ADGM's target to make Abu Dhabi the regional hub for fintech and what progress has been made in this regard?</h4><p>We are living in a world where transformational technologies are pushing the boundaries of economic opportunity while challenging current business models. Fintech developments such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, biometric applications, and virtual currencies are expanding the frontier of financial services. 2016 saw more than USD17.6 billion of VC investments in 1,436 global fintech deals across 66 countries. ADGM recognized the potential and impact of fintech on our economy since we first began operations. In March 2016 we became the first jurisdiction in this region to announce our ambition to be the fintech hub to support, enable, and accelerate the sector's development. We moved quickly on two fronts, first establishing a conducive and balanced regulatory framework, then launching the Regulatory Laboratory (RegLab) in November 2016. RegLab is a regulatory sandbox designed to encourage fintech startups to develop, test, and deploy their solutions before going out to the market. This is the first RegLab in the MENA region. So far, we have received interesting applications from local and regional stakeholders, including an application from Singapore on digital banking. We are glad to approve our first batch of five ADGM RegLab firms and opened up the second batch of fintech applications. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Has there been a change in opinions in Saudi Arabia that the country possesses all the assets it needs and now is the time for utilization?</h4><p>Absolutely. In Saudi Arabia we have scores of resources. What we are trying to do now is to utilize these resources in the, most efficient, economic, and beneficial way. This is key. We can no longer go ahead without planning and thinking strategically about every step of the way. The 2030 Vision has opened a broad horizon and reshaped how we do business. I am convinced that those who cannot cope with this new era should step aside. People are actually quitting if they are unable do what is required. There has been a change in the way of thinking, be it in ministries, government agencies, or the private sector. We are also optimistic; regardless of the situation today, we are on the right path.</p><h4>How is the unified policy you debuted last year progressing?</h4><p>We implemented the unified policy in phases and are now finalizing the fourth phase. The unified policy has been beneficial for the market and has solved most issues with fake insurance policies. We developed electronic solutions and made agreements with the Ministry of Interior to create a data center containing all the information of each insured person to verify that the information is 100% valid. We linked the identities to their mobile numbers, so we can contact and inform clients that they are insured. We have also resolved the issue of Saudis working in the private sector by ensuring that they are all included in the mandated health insurance scheme, which will also be done electronically. In 2017 we expect around 1.5-2 million Saudis will be enrolled in health insurance schemes. We also regulated a minimum list of health providers in each city. The policy will not be approved unless there is a minimum list. This year we will also hopefully we will be launching our biggest product, which is called SHIB, the Saudi Health Insurance Policy project. SHIB is a total transaction scheme. Our goal on this is billing with quality, not just a billing with service. Each organization had its own ways of thinking and acting, but now we are working to create a common platform that can be utilized by different agencies and organizations to unify all the quality standards, the platform standards, the electronic data centers, and the rest. This will help CCHI, as well as the other stakeholders and the insurers as well. We are collaborating with the Ministry of Health, the Council of Health Services, and the Transformation Center. We are cooperating with them nearly on a weekly basis and on all sorts of programs and projects, including the purchasing system, with the Ministry of Health, and with regulatory policy and strategy.</p><h4>Will the private sector play a bigger role in health insurance?</h4><p>Certainly. We cover almost 38% of the population under CCHI, Saudis and non-Saudis, all through private employment. With our cooperation, before 2020 there will be changes and growth in the private sector. The majority of the public hospitals will become corporatized. The demand is there and there is a lot to do for all sides: the health insurance companies, the public, and the private sector. Our goal with CCHI is to no longer achieve anything without KPIs. KPIs are now a keystone in all parts of the health sector. We are now creating KPIs for each employee, each section, and each department, for the CCHI, for the government, and for the companies. We are also planning to publish an evaluation that unites both us and the customer. This will ensure that we are be at the top of our game otherwise we will not survive the competition.</p><h4>How have the stringent goals of the National Transformation Plan influenced your operations?</h4><p>We are planning for a 100% digital transformation for the CCHI and the sector as a whole. We will cover the capacity; the provider side. We are looking for strong health insurance companies with strong regulations and are also making it about health, not just medical. We need to have a healthy population, not just adequate hospitals to treat the ill. We are also monitoring our transparency in terms of governance. By 2018/19, we will have a fund for those who exceed the maximum allowance. Our policy covers up to SAR500,000, and the fund will pay for those who exceed that. We are also proposing to amend and update our bylaws by 2018—we may even change the law itself. We have collected feedback from companies and are already drafting a proposal and will bring it to the Royal Cabinet. SHIB will start in 2018. We will have our 100% digital Center for Customer Services by then as well. Our unified policy will be completed in July 2017. We are restructuring the council and reengineering all our processes within 2017. By the end of the year we will have a project for the council's social responsibility to the sector. Soon we will launch our website, which will be full of data on both Saudis and non-Saudis and be updated daily. We are working with the Ministry of Health on pricing and developing hospitals' services. We are also cooperating with SAGIA on motivating investments in insurance and in the provider side, in both international and local investment. Visitors now already have to have full health insurance coverage from this year onward. All people entering for business must have insurance. All visitors, excluding the Hajj and Umrah visitors and diplomats, will have compulsory health insurance from a Saudi insurance company, and it will all be done electronically and on the spot with the premium added to the cost of the visa.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The latest edition of the International Water Summit took place in January 2017. How would you assess the event's contributions to the work and promotion of ADSSC?</h4><p>This was the sixth edition of the International Water Summit and it has become larger year after year. As part of the World Future Energy Summit (WFES), which summons some of the top speakers in the sector, we find it a great platform to promote the work of ADSSC, our projects, and our commitment to the development of the conscientious use of utilities in the country. Part of our activities in the event included a stand in the exhibition, managerial presence to inform people about what is happening at ADSSC, and an opportunity to build up relationships with international suppliers and contractors who attend the summit. ADSSC also participates in some of the presentations and panel discussions. We use the event to help promote our investment program with the intention to find synergies with other like-minded institutions and companies. It is a great PR event to introduce the newest technologies available in the industry. Moreover, it is an ideal platform for Abu Dhabi to showcase its achievements regarding wastewater and water usage, which are particularly important for the country.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the approach of the average person to efficient water usage and how do you encourage a more conscious use of water utilities?</h4><p>Most people do not think too hard about the utilities they use, including water. Concerns only arise whenever there is a problem in receiving the service. We still have an important role to play in conveying to people that water is a limited resource and that its usage has a huge impact on the environment. One of the ways to do this is to make water valuable to consumers by charging a realistic price for it. A cost reflective charge makes people more careful about how they can stop wasting resources like water and power. We seek to get people to understand this through education and the interaction with community groups. The increase in water tariffs has already resulted in a reduction in water usage, but the numbers still need to go down further. ADSSC's flow has dropped in the last two years, but it has been more due to the downturn in the economy than the reduction in tariff supplement. We also work with other partners, such as Masdar, to develop new technologies, reduce energy costs, and utilize any waste products that come out of the process. We have made a great start, but we can make further improvements with continued cooperation. </p><h4>One of your flagship projects is the Strategic Tunnel Enhancement Program (STEP), which is reaching completion. How will STEP enhance your performance in the market?</h4><p>STEP has been a feature of ADSSC since we started work on it in 2008. Construction work started with our first tunnel contract in 2009. At the moment we are at the tail-end phase of its construction, which ran a little longer than anticipated due to construction issues at the pumping station. The pumping station is now substantially complete and we have now successfully introduced sewage on a small scale to test some of the pumps and technology. We expect the station to be fully operational by the last quarter of 2017. The next phase entails the de-commission of 35 pumping stations that are associated with STEP and the sewerage systems. This project pushes pumping standards to the limit in terms of size and volumes, and is a major global scale achievement for Abu Dhabi. We are confident that commissioning will be completed in the next few months and that it will be fully operational by the end of 2017. Once completed, STEP will have a huge impact in terms of reducing the carbon footprint with our calculations showing that the new pumping station will be much more efficient than the 35 pumping stations it replaces. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In light of the upcoming 10th anniversary of Khalifa Fund, what is your assessment of the institution's role in financing SMEs and startups and what setbacks has the institution overcome along the way?</h4><p>Since its inception, Khalifa Fund has worked on two main pillars. Those were primarily on fostering entrepreneurship within the mindset of the Emirati population and the direct financing of small businesses, especially those startups. I would say the first few years were challenging from the perspective of managing expectations and how entrepreneurship can be perceived as a new career opportunity other than always looking for a public-sector job. Hence we embarked on a series of strategic initiatives that engage with the communities and institutions that have outreach programs even from a social development direction. Furthermore, we conducted hundreds of awareness campaign programs and activities through academia and NGOs so as to entice young people and get them excited about the new lifestyle being an entrepreneur can provide them. On the small business financing side of our mandate, we started with one financial product and gradually created more products that fit the different demographics of the applicants that come through our door. With that we started to see a surge of interest from an average of about 50 applications to over 300 per month. I would also contribute that notion to the fact that in 2009 our mandate was expanded to cover the whole of the UAE and that brought more interested parties forward. Of course we cannot forget the period of time when the global economy went through some turmoil and much of the region was affected by it. Needless to say that SMEs were faced with similar challenges especially due to the fact the service sector was one of the areas much affected in this region. However, and in the last several years, we at Khalifa Fund have been able to devise a mechanism whereby we would closely monitor the different economic sectors within the UAE and accordingly come up with targeted policies to support SME growth or limit them for a period of time and until that economic activity starts to see some improvement in its performance.</p><h4>How will the recent move from the Ministry of Education to include innovation in its parameters encourage education centers to develop the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the UAE?</h4><p>I believe that it will enhance the ecosystem within the UAE. We at Khalifa Fund believe that innovation takes different shapes when it comes to surviving in a competitive economy, especially when you have new business coming from regional and international destinations. Without that crucial parameter, young business tend to struggle and at times fail. At times we at the fund have seen several business owners completely change their business model/operations and try to innovate in their own respect so as to be able to grow that business and address new opportunities.</p><h4>What are the main constraints in fostering entrepreneurial mindsets among young Emiratis and how can these effects be reversed?</h4><p>These challenges need to be tackled at the grassroots. Young people in primary and secondary schools need to be exposed to these ideas and be encouraged to become entrepreneurs in their own respect, besides looking toward the labor market as a career opportunity. We also acknowledge that gaining experience in the world of work builds character for those UAE graduates and we welcome a period of time where they gain work experience. I have personally worked with the European Union Commissioner Office on creating a link with other international institutions that are willing to provide some level of skills development for business owner startups and that is still in the works. I will not deny that we continue to address the stigma linked to self-employment and that needs to be addressed if we want to see a new generation of entrepreneurs. There continues to be a lot of work done by schools, universities, and governmental agencies to change this perspective and that is why we have always said that this will be a collaborative effort from all related parties. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The newly formed Mubadala Investment Company, which was formally established on May 1, 2017, brings together an asset portfolio worth USD125 billion. What was the rationale behind this merger?</h4><p>The rationale for merging two of the Emirate's key government-owned investment entities, International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) and Mubadala Development Company, was to create enhanced economic value for the government of Abu Dhabi. As a combined entity, Mubadala Investment Company will realize synergies and growth in multiple sectors, including energy, utilities, technology, aerospace, industry, healthcare, real estate, and financial investments. Mubadala Investment Company has a stronger, more dynamic balance sheet and world-class expertise in a pool of industries vital to Abu Dhabi's growth. As a result, it can contribute more significantly to the diversification of the economy, in line with the Abu Dhabi Plan and the country's long-term vision.</p><h4>What do the two organizations bring to Mubadala Investment Company in terms of heritage and legacy?</h4><p>IPIC and Mubadala Development Company have played leading roles in Abu Dhabi's economic growth and diversification. IPIC was established in 1984 by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, with the aim of directing Abu Dhabi's energy expertise and petroleum heritage toward the creation of a modern, diversified economy. IPIC's first major acquisition was Cepsa and, since then, it has become a global powerhouse in the hydrocarbon value chain with investments in 18 leading companies worldwide. Mubadala Development Company was established in 2002 to advance the Emirate's economic diversification. The company's first project was Dolphin Energy, a groundbreaking joint venture with Occidental Petroleum and Total that directly connects gas from Qatar's North Field with customers in the UAE and Oman, and today meets approximately 30% of the UAE's energy requirements. By 2017, Mubadala Development Company had become an active investor across multiple sectors in more than 20 countries. As a combined force, the two companies form an investment powerhouse that includes partnerships and subsidiaries in more than 30 countries and has a group-wide employee base of more than 68,000 people.</p><h4>Given the significant scale of the new company, how has the business been structured?</h4><p>Committees made up of representatives from both Mubadala Development Company and IPIC worked together over a six-month period to develop a structure that would best serve the mandate given to us by the government of Abu Dhabi. The business has been organized across four investment platforms of significant scale: petroleum and petrochemicals; technology, manufacturing, and mining; aerospace, renewables, and information and communications technology; and alternative investments and infrastructure. These platforms will help accelerate the diversification of the Abu Dhabi economy through strategic investments across critical sectors within the UAE and abroad.</p><h4>What will be the investment strategy for Mubadala Investment Company outside of Abu Dhabi and how is the company allocating a more varied range of sectors within its portfolio?</h4><p>Mubadala Development Company and IPIC were both highly active globally, and as a combined entity with partnerships and subsidiaries in more than 30 countries, this will continue. Our focus remains helping to fulfill Abu Dhabi's long-term vision for a globally integrated and diverse economy, and operating as a trusted global business that partners with the world's best companies and institutions. Our semiconductor business GLOBALFOUNDRIES' international presence embodies our approach to investing in globally integrated sectors. Through nine fabrication facilities spanning three continents, GLOBALFOUNDRIES has established Abu Dhabi's footprint in the advanced technology sector—a core pillar of the Emirate's diversification strategy. IPIC has brought the new company a significant international portfolio of assets, including stakes in Cepsa and Borealis, one of the largest polyolefin producers in the world. In addition to these established assets, we are also continuing to explore new markets through capital investments and a range of Sovereign Investment Partnerships. For example, we have established relationships with sovereign-backed entities in Russia, China, and France that are creating significant opportunities in a variety of sectors with like-minded partners. In addition, our dedicated financial arm, Mubadala Capital, began in 2017 to manage third-party capital for the first time, following a transaction with Ardian, the independent private investment company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are innovation and creativity pushing the country's development, and which sectors have benefited the most from investments in these areas?</h4><p>Ever since the government began laying the foundation for an environment that fosters knowledge and innovation, we have seen higher interest in entrepreneurship as a direct result of SMEs and start-ups getting access to much-needed funding. Efforts for human capacity building, especially among citizens, are ramped up to complement the country's steady modern-day growth. Knowledge and innovation play a crucial role in the country's efforts to diversify its sources of income as well by building an industrial environment fueled by knowledge, innovation, modern technology, and scientific R&amp;D. Additionally, sustainability enablers are empowered through the enactment of important policies aimed at promoting faster industrial growth in line with UAE Vision 2021. All sectors are fully committed to the UAE's bid to adopt a knowledge- and innovation-driven economy thanks to their proven benefits and necessity. At the Ministry of Economy, for instance, we have launched 12 relevant initiatives and 39 projects covering a wide spectrum of creative developmental activities, specialized micro-projects, and manufacturing and research initiatives.</p><h4>With a 16% share of the national GDP, the industrial sector has been positioned as the beacon for economic diversification. What have been the major advances in this regard during 2016?</h4><p>In 2016, we witnessed a high-performing and vibrant local industrial sector on account of a strong economy supported by key government policies such as the economic diversification strategy. The sector's core areas have remained resilient despite global uncertainties thanks in part to this all-encompassing strategy, which also seeks to reinforce the performance and efficiency of the local business community. The UAE is now in fact the third-most efficient market in terms of goods, which could be viewed as the result of our government's efforts to reduce our reliance on oil. The non-oil sector's GDP contributions in 2015 climbed to about 77% at current prices and 70% at constant prices. For our part, the ministry is fully committed to doing its share by continually supporting investment spending on strategic and value-added projects.</p><h4>The newly implemented Bankruptcy Law has raised expectations regarding better practice for indebted SMEs. What is your view of the impact of the law on the SMEs and the national economy?</h4><p>The government has enacted the law and undertaken other measures precisely to fuel the growth of SMEs. Increased incentives, establishment of a common definition for SMEs, and provision of modern facilities and benefits tailored to fit the needs of SME owners and local entrepreneurs have been put in place to initiate growth and development in the sector. The approval of the Executive Regulations to the Federal Law on SME projects to incentivize local businesses and provide them with access to funding has further stimulated its expansion. The Ministry of Economy has forged strategic partnerships with various countries to further invigorate the SME sector, improve its competitiveness, ensure its sustainable growth, and widen its reach by facilitating its entry to new foreign markets, with emphasis on innovation, technology, and knowledge.</p><h4>What are the economic prospects of the ongoing plan to build a vibrant knowledge-based economy in the UAE in terms of job creation, attracting young entrepreneurs, and contributing to the country's economic diversification?</h4><p>All our efforts are geared toward putting the UAE in the top-10 countries on the Global Innovation Index, in line with UAE Vision 2021. The UAE has already achieved significant milestones and progress in its journey towards economic prosperity, as evidenced by its inclusion in the 2016 Global Innovation Index. The Ministry of Economy has also opened the state-of-the-art International Centre of Patent Registration (ICPR) in collaboration with its South Korean partner. The new international center will also conduct a skills development-training program for professionals in the field of intellectual property as well as pursue research on relevant topics. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which economic sectors represent the bulk of FDI and where would you like to see investment flow in the coming years?</h4><p>According to the Statistics Centre - Abu Dhabi, FDI increased by 8% to reach AED95 billion by the end of 2016. Data indicates that most economic activities last year registered positive investment flows, especially manufacturing, construction, IT and telecommunications, financial institutions, and insurance, which was despite the 13% fall in FDI flows in that same year. These statistics reflect the competitive business environment of Abu Dhabi. To create economic diversification, the government of Abu Dhabi is working on bolstering the economy and business climate to merge Abu Dhabi with the international economy by attracting more foreign investment with more focus on the sectors that were specified in Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030. The Abu Dhabi Investment Office, under ADDED, is working on a strategic plan for the Emirate to attract FDI in non-oil strategic sectors. To achieve that goal, the Abu Dhabi Investment Office is working on promoting the Emirate as a global favored investment location and providing value-added services to potential investors. Abu Dhabi depends on FDI coming from Europe, which makes up 14% of the total, compared to 8% from Arab countries, 3% from the GCC, and 10% from Asian countries. In close collaboration with the Ministry of Economy, every year ADDED organizes and participates under the UAE Pavilion at Hannover Messe, in Germany, one of the largest specialized industrial fairs in the world. We also send delegations to Japan, China, Korea, and India, some of the biggest target markets in Asia, in addition to participating in the Annual Investment Meeting Dubai (AIM), an important platform that many countries participate in. The Abu Dhabi Investment Office plans to organize The Abu Dhabi Investment Week in a number of countries that have special economic relationships and large projects with Abu Dhabi in order to promote investment opportunities in the Emirate.</p><h4>How will the new industrial plan propel Abu Dhabi's manufacturing and exporting sectors and what role does the plan play in the Emirate's diversification efforts?</h4><p>ADDED, represented by the Industry Development Bureau, takes into consideration all factors that support the industrial sector and targets specific activities that contribution to Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030. During the upcoming term, Abu Dhabi's industrial strategic plan focuses on providing a supporting environment for the industrial sector in priority areas such as industrial financing, protecting intellectual property, and foreign property laws. The aim is to support investors, bolster competitiveness, and achieve the industrial strategy. The manufacturing sector grew by 0.5% between 2015 and 2016, from AED50.3 million to AED50.6 million. Manufacturing accounted for 6.9% of GDP in 2016, which demonstrates the importance of the sector to the wider economy.</p><h4>What are some of the leading initiatives ADDED supports to foster innovation in Abu Dhabi and promote the funding of SMEs and startups?</h4><p>The Takamul program, which was launched in 2011, has implemented many activities since its launch, including supporting patents and enforcing the connection between inventors and concerned sectors, in addition to a continuous effort to improve the services it provides to inventors, universities, and other parties concerned with inventions and managing innovation pockets in many major local companies. Takamul's support for patents starts with registration at the patents office in the Ministry of Economy, where the program pays for the initial registration fee and lawyer fees to handle the details of the invention and respond to appeals against the patent. Takamul has supported more than 200 patents since 2011 and approved 60 patents this year. In addition, the program includes many new projects that ADDED plans to launch during 2017, and Takamul has a dependable financing application that includes establishing intellectual property rules, implementing an in-depth commercial value analysis, and building and executing a business plan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>OPEC's 2016 WOO was launched outside of Vienna for the first time and the UAE was selected. What are the highlights of the mutual cooperation between OPEC and the UAE?</h4><p>Time proved this decision was the right one. We felt that by attaching the WOO launch this year to a major industry event, in the form of the high-profile ADIPEC, we would get maximum exposure. And we did. It was a resounding success. It was also extremely beneficial for the organization to have such an event in one of its member countries. Over the years, the OPEC Secretariat has forged great links with member states and the UAE has proven to be no exception. With its vibrant economy and fascinating high-tech development, I am certain it will continue in the same vein—as a valued and trusted member of the OPEC family. Our visit to ADIPEC proved to be an excellent opportunity to extend those relations further. In fact, also for the first time, we chose Abu Dhabi as the location to unveil a new Smart App version for OPEC's other flagship publication, the Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB). This was done at a press conference one day before the WOO launch. Significantly, the Smart App's development was achieved through a joint IT project team involving the UAE Energy Ministry and the OPEC Secretariat. It was another example of how OPEC and its member countries are working together to improve ties and ultimately conditions in the global oil sector.</p><h4>How would you assess the participation of the UAE's national oil companies in the construction of a stable global market?</h4><p>The UAE has made startling economic and technological progress over the years and stands today as an accomplished and highly respected member of the global community. Through the capable operations of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and its many subsidiaries the country has secured a sound economic footing that will continue to pay dividends going forward. These companies, through the application of best practices, continue to forge agreements with international oil concerns that result in the optimum management of the UAE's petroleum resources. Over the years, these national entities have gained considerable experience and knowledge of the industry and the authoritative and responsible way they conduct themselves and do business with the outside world has a direct bearing on the stability of the oil market. Consumers need to know that the oil and gas they require for their domestic needs will always be available and, in the UAE, as well as other OPEC producers, security of supply is assured. And that is ultimately down to such companies as ADNOC and the UAE's other energy firms. In the future, the UAE and OPEC member countries in general will be required to supply even more oil to global markets, so it is indeed reassuring for consumers to know that ultimately they can always rely on these ever-evolving national oil companies for their needs to be met.</p><h4>With the current plans of the UAE government to reduce its dependency levels towards the oil industry below 50%, how will this transform the dynamics between other OPEC members and the UAE?</h4><p>The countries that make up this organization have reached a superior level of understanding, having spent over half a century working together on attaining a set of goals that are common to all of them. Over this long period, there have been many ups and downs, but through it all members have shown a sense of unity. What is striking is the great understanding they display of each other's needs and situations, an approach that has shone through in the many informed decisions OPEC has taken over the decades. There is no doubt in my mind that this family camaraderie has enabled the organization to remain relevant and effective on the world stage and an essential element in the welfare of the global economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few months, one of the prevailing sentiments in all my conversations with GCC leaders has been this sense that in challenging times, you turn to your oldest and most dependable friends. That is the spirit in which I recently visited the GCC. We have a rich history on which to build. From the very first treaties, the UK has been proudly at the forefront of a relationship between the Gulf and the West that has been the bedrock of our shared prosperity and security. As the UK leaves the EU, I am determined that we should seize the opportunity to get out into the world and to shape an even bigger global role for my country, to build new alliances but more importantly to go even further in working with old friends, like our allies here in the Gulf, who have stood alongside us for centuries.</p><p>In accepting the honor of addressing GCC leaders, I seek not just to offer a message of continuity, but to begin to build a bold new chapter in our cooperation; to forge a strategic relationship, a relationship based on true partnership, and an enduring commitment between our countries and our peoples; a relationship through which together we can meet these great challenges to our shared security and prosperity, and grab this opportunity to build an exciting future for the generations that follow us.</p><p>When I think of the growth of this region over the past 50 years, from the transformation of Dubai to the position of the Gulf as the UK's third-largest export market, I never forget that the bedrock of this prosperity and stability has been the relationship between the Gulf and the West. Now, in this period of uncertainty, is the time to recommit to this relationship. </p><p>Already the Gulf is a special market for the UK. Last year alone, trade between the UK and GCC was worth more than GBP30 billion. At the same time, Gulf investment in the UK is helping to regenerate areas from Aberdeen to Teeside, and from Manchester to London. I am determined that we should do everything possible to build on this and elevate our trade and investment to an even more ambitious level.</p><p>Free trade makes us all richer. It creates jobs. It increases investment. It improves productivity. It transforms living standards and creates opportunities for all of our citizens. And nowhere is that more important than here with our friends and allies in the Gulf. I am delighted that we agreed to set up a new Joint Working Group to examine how we can unblock remaining barriers to trade and take steps to further liberalize our economies for the benefit of our mutual prosperity.</p><p>Just as we take every possible step to break down the barriers that are restricting our trade and prosperity, it is also important that we continue the work to bring our peoples together and to ensure that the benefits of greater prosperity are shared by all. We all recognize that there is some way to go before we can say that these economies really work for everyone. But I have been encouraged by recent economic and social reforms you have taken forward and by the bold vision set out by all of the Gulf States for more fundamental and lasting change, most recently with Abu Dhabi's vision for 2030. This vital strategic relationship between the UK and the Gulf—a partnership steeped in so much history and so full of potential for our future—now demands even more concentrated efforts. That is why I want to continue the hugely positive discussions we had in this first ever UK-GCC dialog at leader level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[5,000MW of renewable capacity installed over 40 years]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ignasius-jonan-minister-energy-mineral-resources-indonesia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main issues in the Indonesian energy sector, and how would you summarize your approach to those issues?</h4><p>We cover electricity, oil, and gas from upstream to downstream through retail and also mineral resources through mining. The sector is one of the sources for the future growth of the country. We have to be a pioneer in many areas to increase opportunities for the expansion of the economy. One of the key issues is infrastructure. In many areas of Indonesia, we see that there is still a lack of infrastructure availability. The infrastructure must come first. Secondly, the reality of the lowest cost energy is important. My attitude toward the sector is that the lowest cost of energy is essential; which is a key competitiveness of the country. For example, if the electricity tariff is much higher than many exporting countries, then our industrial product will be less competitive comparing to them. We try to make the electricity tariff as reasonable and affordable as possible.</p><h4>Can you detail the Ministry's intentions with its new power purchasing regulations, and also the recent ministerial decrees that have modified those regulations?</h4><p>The only goal for ministerial decrees is to make a clarification and speed up the process of any electricity investment, such as an independent power producer. I do understand some of the input that the ministerial regulations will refrain the bankability of any independent power producer projects, but we have explained that the business risk itself cannot be borne by the government. The business risk has to be borne by the power plant company but the political risk and the government commitment risk are with the government. The decrees address this issue.</p><h4>How would you address the concerns regarding the ability for investors to invest in renewable energy projects?</h4><p>Over the past 40 years, we have installed almost 5,000MW of renewable capacity. I have been in this office for less than 10 months, and we have committed and signed transactions for almost 500 MW only within this time. Therefore, people who complain about the tariff in my opinion are the people who are not able to compete. Last week the national electricity company signed around 46 transactions for close to 300 MW of renewable energy, so 11 of the investors may have backed off, but 53 signed already. As long as companies matched the technical requirements, then we have to compete with the price; either it is made in Japan, China, Europe, or America, it does not matter.</p><h4>Are renewable projects meeting cost requirements at a greater rate than in the past, and do you see increased deal flow for renewable energy?</h4><p>They have to be able to compete reasonably well with the fossil energy. In the UAE, they produce solar PV for electricity for only USD0.0242 per KW-hour, so why not here? I tell the renewable energy unit of my department that 20-30% of total generation is the goal, and just compare this to the OECD countries plus China as how many have achieved more than 20% these days? Not many. The issue is that the renewable energy industry has to be able to compete as they cannot just sell this idea at any cost.</p><h4>What is your strategy for making exploration and production in Indonesia more attractive for oil majors and smaller firms? </h4><p>There has been no cancelation of exploration. As long as the oil price is around USD50 then it is difficult to increase exploration and production unless the government wants to give up a lot more. If they want 10% of the split to go to the government, then many of the big players are interested, even the smaller operators. However, that is not the goal. For the USD50 oil price, I do not think the encouragement for increased exploration is significant except for shale oil and gas in US since the production costs are getting lower. For the traditional methods, especially offshore, I do not think they have the courage to increase these days at USD50.</p><h4>How do you plan to encourage mineral exploration and what is the best way to reconcile the interests of Indonesia and foreign investors?</h4><p>The mining sector here has been through ups and downs, but the key issue is also that the products of the mining sector—the copper, nickel, bauxite, gold, and silver—are plentiful here. They are also following the market price, and that is the big parameter of how we can grow this investment in the mining sector. If the market is down, then the foreign miners will demand a lot more concession or a lot more split so we have to make it acceptable. We can make a scaling split or we can make renegotiation, but when the market is up again we have to come back to the table to renegotiate the terms. As long as it is in accordance with the mining laws and constitution, the rest can be negotiated from time to time, but if it is against the constitution then the answer is no and no. There is no country that will give up its constitution for the interest of any mining company, and the same is true for other industries such as oil and gas.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead and in which sector do you see the most movement?</h4><p>The goal for the next 10 years is that electricity must be the engine of growth. First is the availability, second is the tariff, and third is the capacity. Those three elements of the electricity will be supported and adjusted from time to time according to the demand. What we can expect is that for the next 10 years we will see a lot more electric cars on the street, and we will change some cooking customs throughout households in Indonesia; whereas many of them use LPG for cooking, we want them to change to electric stoves.</p><h4>What do you see as the ideal role for the state in developing further electrical generation and distribution?</h4><p>The government has a lot to do in regard to helping reduce the generation imbalance and the price of electricity in the country as the disparity between what people can afford and the cost is still significantly wide. For that issue, the President has suggested that as long as the private sector can afford to do the investment then we let the private sector do it so that we can subsidize the people who earn a lot less.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Our success was underpinned by pioneering a true PPP model in Saudi Arabia that delivered a strong a lasting value proposition. Naturally, we reinforced this approach with an operating and business model geared towards generating commercial opportunities by enabling and delivering better services to the public. Government entities are our key customers, and our goal was to enable them to serve all citizens better, with something that costs them nothing but delivered results and made an impact.</p><h4>How do you support and pay for your operations? How do you generate revenues?</h4><p>Whenever we come up with a solution we think about it from a multidimensional perspective: stakeholders, sustainability, and financials. In this sense, we assure an added value to all stakeholders to have a direct and positive impact through which we can generate revenue.</p><h4>What are some of your recent products, and how do they fit your business model?</h4><p>One recently launched product with Ministry of Housing was “Wafi" or off-plan sales. Essentially, this is the licensing of sale on map for real estate units. This enables developers to engage in large-scale real-estate projects such as apartment complexes and sell its units as they progress in their build-out, organically funding later stages with the earlier stages. Wafi provides full integration with the Ministry of Justice for seamless electronic transfer of deeds, automates all requests for complete licensing, and can electronically evaluate real estate developers and their projects. Perhaps of greatest value is the virtual integration of all stakeholders along the value chain for such a large project. It embodies our business model because it is innovative and provides a great benefit to the country, much like our award-winning 180Sec CR registration, which saved over 2 million man days for the economy. The economy-wide impact of such an initiative is enormous. OPS "wafi" will reduce the price of real-estate units for end-users, reduce the price of development and lower the cost of funding by banks &amp; investors while generating improved returns. The overall process is also streamlined, where before every step was manual and hence long, now it is automated and instantaneous.</p><h4>How do these programs generate revenue?</h4><p>We at Thiqah believe that if you create a truly innovative and smart solution, something of true value, then the revenues will follow. There is no one revenue generation method here at Thiqah, such as a supermarket. Rather, the stakeholders whom are benefiting from the overall ecosystem, solution, the data or anything related to the products and are willing to benefit from that service, is how we make money.</p><h4>What about future areas of growth?</h4><p>When the NTP was released, we examined our activities and realized that our business model truly embodies just what privatization is all about. We want to show and introduce this model to other entities, and we have expanded our portfolio from the Ministry of Commerce and Investment (MCI). Today, we are proud to have solidified partnerships with over 12 governmental entities replicating our proven partnership model.</p><h4>Is there an opportunity to privatize this organization?</h4><p>We are a 100% private entity. If the question is about going public, we are ready in terms of all policies and procedures to go to the CMA and satisfy its requirements. Our main focus is to keep growing in a healthy and sustainable manner, empowering our gifted employees to improve our beloved country and keep adding value.</p><h4>What are your most immediate ambitions in the next 12 months? </h4><p>The country is on a fast track to development. Going with the same pace requires Thiqah to be more dynamic than ever. This means we have to double our efforts in order to fulfil our purpose of leading change. Putting that in mind, we have major programs in which they embedded many initiatives. One, we have to maintain strong relations with all governmental entities. Two, Innovate. Three, enable entrepreneurs to become a key factor in what we are doing. For example, our goal in this year to launch "Miras" where we believe it is going to be a major player in enhancing business environment in Saudi.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the KKESH facility fit into the healthcare system in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>KKESH started operations on November 1983 as an eye care unit. It focuses on ophthalmology and all our services are within the ophthalmology profession, with all its sub specialties. When the hospital was set up, the idea was to have the best Ophthalmic Institution to serve the people in the country and the region and also serve as an educational and training center for future professionals within Saudi Arabia. The third mission was to be a research center for eye care in the country; another area that KKESH is covering is public and community education. These are the main pillars of KKESH's functions.</p><h4>How have the Vision 2030 reforms in the health sector changed the way you operate?</h4><p>Since its foundation, KKESH has focused on delivering its services and training future ophthalmologists in the kingdom and the GCC. Now and in compliance with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, our role has expanded to include developing and supervising national eye care programs and community services. KKESH's impact on ophthalmology in Saudi Arabia currently is huge; about 52% of all consultants working in the country have been trained at KKESH, 100% of ophthalmic technicians graduated from KKESH, and around 57% of the cornea transplants within the country are done by us. We provide the corneas of the other transplants as we have the only fully serviced eye bank in the country. Thus, the impact of KKESH on Saudi ophthalmology and even the GCC is huge. In many aspects of eye care, KKESH is quite developed compared to other centers in the region. For example KKESH is the first hospital in the Middle East to reach HIMSS 7 stage in Electronic Medical Records (EMR). This is a measure of the adoption and utilization of EMR functions required to achieve a paperless environment in order to optimize patient care. Level 7 being the highest. To date, there are only three hospitals in Europe that reached this level.</p><h4>KKESH advised the government on the new model of care currently being rolled out by the ministry. What is unique about your operations?</h4><p>In terms of the new model of care proposed by the ministry, there have been several pathways for care and KKESH, because of its extensive experience in day care surgery and rapid delivery of services, was selected to lead the development of the “Planned Care“ pathway for the whole country based on our own model. This is because in the last seven to 10 years we started shifting most of our operations to daycare services and a one-stop clinic, where we do everything for the patient in one visit. KKESH is unique because unlike the other medical cities that cover a clear area and population, KKESH covers the entire country for one expertise, and that has presented a challenge. We are the only tertiary eye care hospital in the country and, because we serve the whole population as well as the fact that there are no primary standalone eye care facilities, it was a challenge to build a complete cluster around KKESH.</p><h4>What are the main challenges when it comes to implementing this new program of care?</h4><p>In our case, the changes that are evolving are beneficial to KKESH's mission and to the service that we provide to the community because it now gives us a bigger role in influencing eye care throughout the whole country, which we did not have before. As a result, this will help patients receive better and more efficient and comprehensive treatment. Our plan is to expand the services that we provide at KKESH; we need to expand our medical staff, the support services, and the health team because there will be a greater need to see more patients and do more procedures, and in terms of expanding services there are major ambitious plans of establishing other centers throughout the kingdom that could be either part of KKESH or closely collaborating with it.</p><h4>What are your key plans in the next 12 months?</h4><p>The changes that we plan are the expansion of outpatient department and all our subspecialty services, because that has not had a major expansion since the establishment of the hospital. We plan in the coming months to have such an expansion and this will likely double the number of rooms in the emergency room. We will also make certain changes to the entrance of the hospital that will enhance accessibility and expand some of our clinics. We will also work on partnerships with international eye centers as well as with medical cities or even private hospitals. The new vision is to partner with the private sector and also international centers and hospitals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai continued to lead the region in attracting FDI and climbed up in global FDI destination rankings in 2016. What is the outlook for FDI inflows to Dubai in the current global business environment?</h4><p>FDI plays a vital role in strengthening Dubai's economic sustainability and competitiveness. We remain positive about the outlook for FDI inflows to Dubai in the coming years thanks to high investor confidence and the Dubai Plan 2021, which is transforming Dubai into one of the smartest and most sustainable cities in the world. In 2016, Dubai ranked third globally, after London and Singapore, in the number of FDI projects, which is a clear indicator of a strong diversified economic growth. Dubai managed as well to maintain its leading position in the region and ranked seventh in FDI capital inflows despite the challenging global economic environment. Moreover, in a few years Dubai will host Expo 2020. The mega event has already created new opportunities for both leading global businesses and SMEs to be partners in infrastructure development and service delivery.</p><h4>The bankruptcy law has now been implemented and will presumably boost Dubai's Ease of Doing Business ranking. How does the entity envisage that this will affect the flows of FDI?</h4><p>There is no doubt that improved regulations address investor concerns and indicate maturity and an improved confidence in Dubai's business environment. Dubai has established clear FDI policy leadership and continues to lead with modern regulatory frameworks to keep pace with the economic shifts and new business models. We see a positive impact on FDI flows moving forward, as we work in close partnership with private sector leaders to introduce new future-ready policy levers and create new opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs.</p><h4>Dubai Investment Development Agency launched Dubai FDI Monitor in 2016. How is accuracy being maintained when investments are taking more unorthodox form; for instance, with freelance visas available, emerging sectors becoming more prominent, and companies that are based upon intangible assets?</h4><p>Dubai FDI Monitor maps out the investment landscape in Dubai through tracking, validating, and analysis of FDI flows as part of Dubai FDI's data analytics and foresight program. This is the first-ever FDI Monitor at a city level and the feedback on the reporting service has been extremely positive. As a service to foreign investors, we support decision-makers who will now be able to analyze FDI trends and opportunities in Dubai by sectors, geographic clusters, and source countries. The FDI results and trend analysis reports are based on international classification standards (NACIS) and fDi Markets data as well as our tracking technology and database. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the service provided is accurate and current, taking into consideration that the data is updated in real time. As part of our continual improvement process we are now tracking M&amp;As and new forms of investment, which both reflect the economic maturity of the domestic economic base and allow us to monitor FDI activities at joint ventures, strategic partnerships, alliances, sub-contracting, and license arrangements.</p><h4>Dubai has been moving up the Global Innovation Index, and now ranks as the most innovative Arab nation. Which sources, and channels, of FDI have been particularly pivotal in assisting that move?</h4><p>The UAE National Agenda 2021 is set to drive the knowledge economy contribution to reach 5% of GDP. The UAE Innovation Strategy and the Higher Policy for Science, Technology and Innovation played an important role in galvanizing efforts at the federal and local levels to climb up on the Global Innovation Index ranking. Major global players in the financial and ICT industries today choose Dubai as a regional innovation center. FDI into R&amp;D activities in Dubai was 1% of total capital flows in 2015 and it has improved dramatically to reach 5% in 2016.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Costa Rica’s Stock Exchange in operation for 41 years]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[cristina-masis-ceo-mercado-de-valores]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Mercado de Valores?</h4><p>My father, who always had his interests in the stock exchange, founded this company in 1975. The national Stock Exchange started in 1976 and today, 41 years later, Mercado de Valores is one of the founding members that´s still in the business. He was always interested in the financial sector, he occupies the position of general manager of Banco Crédito Agrí­cola de Cartago and he also had a financial company called Multivalores, that started as a foreign exchange business. At the beginning, there were many private companies listed and active in the stock market. This is not the reality today, because our market is focused on government bonds, and many companies that were family owned were sold to international companies and moved out of the stock market. The reality today is that the stock market is almost 90% public issues; hence, we are thinking how to get it back to what a stock market should be. This is not easy, as there are things that should be taken into consideration, such as changes that should be done related with legislation and the fact that the access to bank credit is easier for companies rather than all the diligence that requires if you want your company to be listed in the stock market. There is a lot of work to be done to move companies into the market.</p><h4>What is the profile of your clients?</h4><p>They are mostly individuals but we also assist corporations. We are specialized as asset managers for families and individuals and because this is a business based on confidence, we are focused on building a close relationship with our clients. We have been in the market for 41 years and our clients know our history and values. We are responsible in making our best analysis and closely monitor what goes on in the market having in mind that our purpose is to advise and make the best decisions for our clients having in consideration their objectives and needs.</p><h4>How many clients have you covered over your history?</h4><p>The total number of clients we have is around 2,200. The number of clients has grown over the years because of our performance and trajectory, that results as a good reference as this is the best way to be considered for new clients. Also, our funds have been an important alternative of investment for new professionals who are starting to make their investment profile, through the funds clients can diversify and start making investments orderly and in a good way. We also design custom portfolios when the client has a larger amount of savings and considering their needs and objectives, we can structure a unique investment strategy for them.</p><h4>How are the recent currency issues affecting the financial sector? </h4><p>The biggest challenge for our country is the high financial deficit our government have. We know the government is trying to find a solution for this problem that has been there for many years. The exchange rate is related to this topic; in Costa Rica although our currency is not US dollars everything here is sold and priced in dollars. Also, there is a big risk in getting loans in dollars, so the financial sector is trying to move people to change their loans to colons. Because of this the government will have difficulty to access credit, then the rates can raise and that can put pressure to the exchange currency. Despite the issues, the country is still attractive and we still receive a lot of international investors because of other virtues the country offers.</p><h4>Why should investors come to Costa Rica and what are your goals for 2018?</h4><p>For investors, including companies, Costa Rica provides a lot of opportunities with qualified professionals and a healthy investment climate. We have to improve many things regarding bureaucracy; however, there are institutions such as CINDE, for example, that do a lot of work to help companies get through that smoothly. Also, there are many opportunities to invest in infrastructure, let's say as co-investment with the government in pubic concessions, once politic issues are surpassed through the congress. We, as Mercado de Valores, have the capacity and experience for helping investors to keep their interest in Costa Rica, we can provide an analysis of their needs and investments related to their sector of interest and we also have good relationships with business men with whom they can find common interest. We can help this companies get established in the country and if they need financial advice they can count on us to understand and find the best alternatives. Many companies that come to Costa Rica and invest through us start investing small amounts of money, starting with their cash flow. If they decide to increase their investments, we can provide them with many opportunities that includes international and local alternatives. We have the capacity to provide a professional analysis to clients who come with their portfolios from abroad, as they ask us to review them and provide them advise looking if we can do some things or changes that improve their portfolio as private investors. We hope as a country we can keep investors interested in Costa Rica.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[vinay-grover-managing-director-simba-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of Simba Group's major achievements?</h4><p>We started almost 30 years ago, and have witnessed economic growth and various changes in the nation's demographics. This 30-year journey has been at times turbulent, and other times smooth, but like the rest of the economy we have seen significant growth in the last few years. The country's growth is clearly apparent when traveling the streets of Abuja, Lagos, and other big cities and overall, I would say growth has been moderate to good. However, I see a brighter future in the next decade because certain fundamentals that were previously lacking in the country are slowly becoming available. Once the foundation gets stronger, the benefits will begin to show.</p><h4>What projects do you have in the pipeline in transportation and the other sectors you cover?</h4><p>We are distributors of TVS Motors, one of the biggest exporters of two and three-wheeler vehicles in the world. Over the last few years, we have invested heavily in further developing our assembly capabilities and ensuring access to affordable service and spare parts across the country. We have also invested in R&amp;D to work with our partners in customizing and developing the vehicles for the local road conditions and market preferences, and simultaneously work towards optimizing efficiencies across the value chain. That begins with local assembly and distribution, but also involves extensive training for riders as well as mechanics across the country. So far, we have trained over 25,000 mechanics, which enables us to deploy our service offering in every corner of the country, helping our vehicles becoming the brand of choice.</p><h4>In 2015, you were recognized as one of the leading companies providing services in Nigeria. How has service contributed to your growth story?</h4><p>Our entire philosophy is driven by service; whatever we do, we strive to be the best in terms of service. That is an area we have found was lacking in Nigeria to some extent. It might have been a cultural issue, where people had just become used to buying products, not having anywhere to service them, and then going out and buying replacements. Clearly, that's not acceptable and addressing that has helped us to reach the leadership positions we have, not only in the motorcycle and three-wheeler business, as I alluded before, but also in the inverter business where we have market leadership. For example, we were the first inverter company to offer customer service through a dedicated call center, and by the time our competition got wind, we had already moved forward and taken our offering online as well as upgraded our telephone services to 24 hours. That's helped us to stay ahead, and our customers have rewarded us for that. Our growth has also been due to the general economy, which was growing rapidly until the recent downturn. People have realized dependency on one commodity is not a way to move forward. These last two years have been times of consolidation and a time to look at which areas we would like to move toward. Agriculture is one, another is renewable energy. We may have actually entered at a time when it was not so popular to be in renewables. However, we gathered all our experience and knowledge and implemented several projects on this front. Now, with the realization, and probably because of the costs of renewables coming down, especially solar, there is a lot of engagement with renewables.</p><h4>What is your ultimate ambition and goal for Simba Group?</h4><p>We do not want to grow for the sake of growth. Topline growth does not excite us as much as being able to come up with something we can get recognition for in terms of being the best. We have always had the slogan that we do not want to be the biggest, but the best. Having said that, we always strive to stay in businesses in which we have a dominant role to play. We would like to have businesses where we at least have a 40—50% market share. That is a healthy amount and is achievable—in some businesses we are even at 60%. To remain at a high level of market share is important when we look inward, rather than outward, to see how we can improve ourselves to be able to provide the best to our customers as well as contribute to the sector.</p><h4>You have expanded into agriculture and renewable. What is the growth potential of these sectors?</h4><p>As for agriculture, Nigeria has good, fertile land. Before the discovery of crude oil, Nigeria was a net exporter of agricultural products. Once crude oil became the source of foreign exchange earnings for this economy, and started contributing a high level to its entire GDP, agriculture lost its importance. There was a heavy amount of migration from the villages and rural areas into the cities. That is why we see cities like Lagos expanding to a population of 20 million. Presently, people are moving back to the rural areas, back to the basics of farming. They need to be reoriented. We have to engage with people at a younger age to make it more attractive for them to get back into farming. Our agri-consultancy business is built around just that idea, with our teams deployed in project management of small, medium, and largescale farms and processing units. We have worked with various institutions to execute projects involving irrigation solutions for farmers across states, community irrigation programs, implementation of integrated poultry farms and the development of an integrated oil palm plantation and processing mill. As for green and renewable energy, as has been determined, sunlight in Nigeria is extremely good, making solar a viable form of clean energy. Nigeria is highly efficient in energy in terms of electricity. Today, the economics are far better than they ever have been before. The cost of investment capex has gone down considerably per watt of production, and that makes solar solutions for the home significantly more viable than ever before.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>The economy has possibly been through its worst phase. However, I do not expect a miraculous change, I do expect 1.5-2% GDP growth. If the trend continues over the next few years, it is not going to be too long before we can go back to the 7-8% growth rate we experienced in the past. With availability of electricity and improved infrastructure and investments, GDP growth could even reach 10%. As for the company, we have to look at the overall economy, which directly affects our businesses. Because we are so diversified and we choose to go into areas where we see a scope of high growth, we have the opportunity to outpace economic growth. To continue our past trends, we would like to work for at least a 25% growth rate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Cartagena's tourism sector performed thus far in 2017?</h4><p>So far, 2017 has been an especially good year. We have seen a 13% increase in Colombian tourists, a 17% increase in foreign travelers, and 15% more from cruises. If you compare Cartagena to the entire country, its tourism sector has grown by 22% while the rest of the country it has been around 13-14%. Of course, these indicators are quite high and we see that for the next couple of months this growth rate will slow down a bit based on economic slowdown. This year, we project 2.7 million visitors for the entire country.</p><h4>How can other municipalities and cities along the Caribbean coast use Cartagena's tourism development as a model to benefit the entire region?</h4><p>We are a model and leader of the Caribbean region in tourism because of our strong team that is based on collaboration between the public and private sectors. The national and local government invests in Cartagena, and we have a strong objective. We want to facilitate not only the growth of Cartagena but create connectivity between us and the rest of the world, creating more jobs and formality in the region overall.</p><h4>How can Cartagena address the issue of informality in the tourism sector?</h4><p>Cartagena has a high level of poverty, which leads to informality. On a small scale, if you are unemployed, you may think about buying a bottle of water at the store to later sell it at the beach for a bit more. On a larger scale, informality also includes entrepreneurs that do not pay taxes and are not officially registered as a business or company. Tourism in this line wants to improve life quality for everyone so we are working closely with the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism in order to fight informality and have a better business climate.</p><h4>How do you balance Cartagena's growth in tourism with sustainability?</h4><p>Let's compare Cartagena on a global scale to Barcelona. Tourists have replaced locals within the city, which is exactly what we do not want to happen. The bad image that Colombia had in general for several years because of the outside conflict kept Cartagena as a hidden gem, but, of course, we now want to develop the city. Not only is Cartagena a destination; it is an experience. We want tourists not to merely come here, but to really experience the city, its culture, and the people. We want the kind of tourism that stresses quality over quantity. We want tourists to come here that are committed to the people and the development of the city and society of Cartagena. We have restaurants and entertainment and want tourists to come and leave a good trace in Cartagena and bring it back to their country.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for Cartagena?</h4><p>I see Cartagena becoming the biggest and most beautiful sustainable destination in the Caribbean. To do so, we need to change the mentality. Tourism has to elevate the quality of life, not only for certain people, but also for everyone in society. There is still a lot of work to be done in that area, but we are headed in the right path. For example, if you purchase something in Cartagena we want it to benefit the people of the city, not a manufacturer in a foreign country. Our goal is to create a new type of tourism in Cartagena that considers all these aspects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Give Peace A Chance]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[give-peace-a-chance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your strategies for further expansion around the country?</h4><p>Our mission is to follow the students in every aspect of their life and that is why we have campuses in Bogotá, Tunja, Bucaramanga, Villavicencio, Medellí­n, and one distance learning campus that covers 23 medium-sized cities throughout Colombia. Our mission is to educate and develop people. We are the oldest university in the country, and with our quality education, our plans for the next 12 years are to educate everyone in Colombia to the highest possible level. We also want to help everyone gain access to higher education. One of our main programs is our long-distance education program, a field in which we are a pioneer. This allows people and students from all over the country to access high-quality education.</p><h4>What responsibilities do you see higher education having in the post-conflict era? How will USTA be involved in the peace process?</h4><p>We have been waiting for this peace deal for a long time and have been teaching about it for the past couple of years even before the peace deal was signed. Our goal has been to develop people to be aware of events within Colombia. We developed the undergraduate program in Social Communications for Peace, which teaches our students throughout all stages of their education about peace. We wanted to be close to the communities who had to leave their lands because of the narcotics traffic. We work in prisons as well to educate criminals to re-integrate them into society. This is our contribution and commitment to communities and to society. Another important aspect is that we work with territories affected by the war to restore the land to the people from whom it was expropriated. We also have a mission called University Pastoral that is bringing the Dominican humanist though to very distant areas of Colombia and bringing students to places like Los llanos Orientales (Eastern Colombian Plains) for them to be more sensitive and to know more about the people in their country from poor and rural areas. This shows our commitment to the entire country.</p><h4>What are the main challenges Colombia faces in ensuring the peace process is successful?</h4><p>People must know the details of the process, something most Colombians have not learned yet. Second, we must teach people to be more sensitive to the fact that Colombia needs to live in peace and that from this peace a great many development opportunities will spring. As part of this, we must understand that accessing southern parts of Colombia, such as the Amazon region, will be critical and difficult. The last is the politicization of the peace process. We need to get rid of this polarization because the peace deal will bring peace to the country, no matter which political party one is involved with. The peace process will bring development to the entire country and the political process has to be credible for the good of the country.</p><h4>What are the next steps for USTA's development?</h4><p>We have a 2016-2019 general development plan, and a 2016-2027 comprehensive multi-campus plan. Our main goal is to internationalize and build our multi-campus strategy because we want to be committed to the peace process. This year we launched this project and participated in institutional accreditation. Our goal for 2017 is to implement our vision of being a high-quality institution. We also have ambitious plans in terms of rankings and would like to be a top university in the country. We also have a very ambitious budget. Our plan is to better ourselves as an institution both in Bogotá and nationwide. We also want to enroll more locals. <strong></strong></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[quality-education]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Politécnico working to prepare the next generation of Colombians to meet the country's workforce demands?</h4><p>Education is a necessity for future development. Nevertheless, the level of coverage in Colombia is still precarious; although previous governments have made efforts to improve this, especially through SENA, barely 50% of the population is currently being reached. Politécnico has a clear mission to make education as inclusive as possible, meaning that it can be offered to any citizen who wishes to study. Politécnico stands out by offering a real strategy of quality education that is an alternative to the typical Colombian educational model. Absence in face-to-face education is barely 5%, while absence in virtual education in 13%. Setting aside any academic, economical, or family problems that students have, our objective is to make sure they graduate and improve their conditions as people and professionals. Another important issue is entering as many cities and towns as possible. Colombia cannot be reduced to Bogotá, Medellí­n, Cali, Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Santa Marta. It has thousands of municipalities, and we are conscious that we need a model that will allow us to reach every corner of the country. This is our virtual education model.</p><h4>What is the relationship between Politécnico and SENA, and how has this assisted the education sector?</h4><p>SENA is an educational entity that trains technical graduates in two-year programs. What Politécnico does is articulate the transition of SENA students into a professional career; this means that the university accredits everything they have studied and they do not have to start from scratch. In addition, Politécnico opts to give students the opportunity to choose what they want to study, depending on what they like and what their personal or professional goals might be. Besides SENA students, we also offer options to senior high school students; we are currently advocating that their last year or two of technical schooling be included as part of their university studies, so they do not miss the opportunity of going to a university. All this is part of our inclusive strategy, which will have a huge impact on the amount of people that will be able to access education in Colombia.</p><h4>What role do Politécnico and the education sector have in ensuring the success of the post-conflict era?</h4><p>This topic is surrounded by challenges, the largest being the integration of all the demobilized combatants into the education sector. There is still a huge vacuum due to the fact that universities ask for a certain level of secondary education prior to enrollment; many of the demobilized have never been to school before. On the other hand, it is hard to know in which part of the country demobilized combatants will be reintegrated, making face-to-face education an improbable choice for universities. The only way to make education available for these people is through a qualified, virtual education model, offering both bachelors and complementary training, since it is complicated to build classrooms, transport teachers, and move to every corner of the country. This leads us to other problems such as connectivity; although there are fiber optics in every municipality of Colombia, it is important to have private operators contributing with investments to assure people have a good internet connection. This might not be a good investment for operators, given that many areas in Colombia barely have 10-20 families consuming their service, but it is necessary to making education accessible. What can Politécnico do? We have to generate the necessary virtual content to offer that bachelor's or training, since it's not mandatory to have on-the-ground teachers to educate. Another important factor is to integrate the police and military into educational issues, something Politécnico has been doing for quite a while. Currently, we have an agreement to formally educate 400 police officers in Medellí­n. In general, Colombia has great potential in this area, but it should be exploited strategically for everyone to benefit from it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tadeo recently inaugurated a new building for its school of art and design. What impact will this have on the university and neighborhood?</h4><p>Our university is in the center of the city and is one of many schools: there are estimates that up to 200,000 people study in the center of Bogotá each day. This includes both traditional and new universities that have decided to stay in the center, making it difficult for a private university to remain here because people are moving to the north of the city because they are convinced the historic center has deteriorated too much. With about 10 other universities, we are working together in security and combining our efforts when it comes to things like cultural activities. We are trying to carry out some activities to give life here in the center a new meaning. This movement has only begun to happen in the last five to six years. So not only is the building important for our university, it is part of this broader strategy to revitalize the center. Tadeo is also a cultural center in and of itself; we have many concerts, exhibitions, and galleries here. We dedicated our newest building to arts because the arts are strong here: about 35% of students are from the faculty of arts. Together we have four schools: arts, engineering, sciences, and social sciences and administration—but the largest is the arts.</p><h4>What roles can agricultural and rural programs play in a post-conflict era?</h4><p>For example we are experimenting with seeds and other similar things to see if they can be profitable and see if they can be marketed, which is extremely important. Now we are signing projects with the government with all the money said to be coming with the arrival of peace. The only way to recover the places where violent groups once reigned is by giving them the possibility of doing something meaningful with their time and energy. That is the usefulness of these kinds of experiments and research. We are also trying to develop a program that can go throughout the country offering agricultural management in over 150 small medium-sized municipalities. The challenge is seeing the accord as part of a broader agricultural agreement. Even for the guerrillas, the most important thing to making the peace sustainable is the development of agriculture. This process is a wonderful opportunity for the country to focus on the energy of the country and try to recover various rural areas, but also to come to terms with the violence we have across the entire country.</p><h4>What is your current progress toward your Vision 2020 goals?</h4><p>We want to be recognized by 2020 as a very innovative university and have the products that represent this innovation. The laboratory is important in this regard. Thus far, we have decided to fund 15 projects in the arts and sciences that are now in their early stages. We also want to support innovative teachers in the biological field by supplying them with the classroom technology and methodologies required for groundbreaking experiments. Yet we also keep the students at the very center of our focus. What is more, we are working to remain technologically innovative and to internationalize our curriculum by emphasizing student exchanges. Our goal is to have 1% of students study abroad. In internationalizing the curriculum, we can also bring the world to the students. With more than 120 teachers from 120 universities around the world coming here to teach or attend conferences, this is not hard to do. We are also reinforcing our relationship with China through the Confucius Institute, improving our exchanges with China and bringing Chinese culture here to the campus. This is one of our social missions: to have a very wide array of students of all backgrounds here and something we want to preserve. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Grupo Menarini recently opened a direct office in Colombia after being active through distributors. Why Colombia and why now?</h4><p>There are several factors that a company such as ours has to take into consideration when approaching a new country: the first is the stability of the country, the second is our perspective and what potential the country might have in the future, and the third is the attention of society and government to the healthcare of the population. We found that Colombia is attentive to these three factors. These are fundamental elements that made us come here and have our operations here. Another important fact is that Colombia is extremely stable and we see large growth in the economy; there are no risks compared to other countries, especially in Latin America. Law 100 and other healthcare statements from the government show how the government has always paid close attention to the healthcare of its society. Hence, for these reasons, Colombia signifies considerable opportunities for Menarini</p><h4>What impact will your new direct presence here have on Menarini's local operations and the end user?</h4><p>One of the Menarini company's largest commitments, especially in the healthcare sector, is to educate our sales persons so they can teach doctors and institutions how to use the products and medicines. Of course, just having a distributor did not allow us to have a direct impact on the medical culture—the scientific promotion of healthcare in general—and not just on individual products. We wanted to develop a medical culture by directly teaching doctors the best way to use our products and to directly improve the lives of patients. We wanted to prepare doctors to solve their patients' problems with our products; in order to do this, we must perfectly describe the opportunities that are on offer to solve their problems</p><h4>What are your short-term goals for this new office?</h4><p>Our short-term goal is to commercialize six products here, mainly in three areas: cardiovascular, gastroenterology, and the treatment of pain. In 2017, we plan to launch three new products, mainly in cardiovascular and pain treatment. Another goal is to expand our pipeline not only in these three areas, but in others as well. We take pride not only in expanding our presence here in Colombia but in creating jobs for Colombian families. We want to make them participants in our dream of bringing the Menarini family everywhere into the country. We have no limits in a country like this and will grow in the future. The Menarini group came from humble roots in Italy and now has a presence in more than 110 countries as a result of the will of the Aleotti brothers, who are always ready and prepared to seize an opportunity to introduce the pharmaceutical products of our company in the countries where we are not yet present. Of course, 2017 was the year for Colombia and Peru; however, in the next couple of years we want to grow and expand in parts of Latin America that we have yet to enter. My personal dream is to have a map in my office with a Menarini flag on each and every single country in the world. The story behind the Menarini name begins in a small pharmacy called Farmacia Internazionale in Naples. It sold products for immigrants making their way to the US and Latin America before they boarded a long boat journey. Fearful of being stopped and quarantined at the gates of North or South America, they stocked up on lots of products at the pharmacy before they left. Their dream was to be recognized as immigrants and welcomed into these countries. Now Menarini is carrying on this dream of reaching Latin America and being a major local player in the country. We like to dream big, and this is where dreaming big has brought us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is SENA evolving to meet the country's rising demand for human capital? </h4><p>SENA is turning 60 and emerged from the collective effort of Colombian businessmen, the national government, and workers with the aim of training Colombian workers to become more productive. During this time, it has been accumulating experiences and economic scenarios that offer different training alternatives. We have two fundamental elements, quality and relevance, both of which we seek to employ in the training we offer at SENA to the country's economic needs in light of the evolution of the world economy. For example, when the petroleum economy shifts, this has reverberations in several Colombian regions. SENA must also adapt to these regional and economical changes on a regional basis. This is how we maintain our relevance when it comes to education. The other element is quality, which is the difference between having an excellent or merely average graduate; this is why we invest a great deal of our resources in infrastructure, technology, and knowledge transfer to ensure high standards.</p><h4>What role will SENA play in the implementation of the peace process?</h4><p>The role of SENA in the peace process has two fundamental parts, the first being directed at the people who will be reintegrated into Colombia's democratic life and society. We are involved in the demobilization process of the self-defense groups, not to mention those who left the FARC or ELN in the last decade. In a broader effort, we have paired with the Agencia Colombiana de Reintegración, the agency specialized in receiving people who are reintegrating into society. We estimate there will be around 17,000 ex-militants whom we will have to receive and help train through employability and entrepreneurship schemes. The second important role that SENA plays post conflict is to offer different training alternatives to populations that were victims of the armed conflict. We have served more than 2 million of these people in the past 10 years and aim to keep this pace in the next 10. We will increase the presence of SENA in traditional conflict zones, where the presence of armed groups has until now restricted the presence of the state. Now that guerilla groups are being demobilized, the state and SENA will soon arrive.</p><h4>What part of the Colombian economy will have the biggest future demand for labor?</h4><p>The peace process will allow the arrival of important international and strategic investors. The president made a state visit to the UK in September, and most of the meetings he had were with the financial and corporate sector. In an effort to garner strategic investments, he billed the country's eastern plains as ripe for tourism. We still do not know half the country and projects like penetrating the Colombian forests, mountains, rivers, and the Orinoquia and Amazon regions will be important. We will also develop the fields and grow cocoa crops, which will allow us to produce high-quality chocolate that allows us to compete with other markets such as Switzerland. Currently we import 40,000 tons of rubber that we could produce ourselves—not to mention much more—for both consumption and export. This is how the peace process will open new opportunities. SENA currently offers rubber and cocoa training as well as environmental tourism. There are a great many dynamic new economic perspectives that the peace process is making possible that SENA will have to bring into the country.</p><h4>What are your goals for the next year?</h4><p>In numbers, we want to give 1.3 million Colombians technical and technological training. Regarding entrepreneurship, we want to create a thousand new companies using seed capital. Regarding professional certifications, we need to determine what skills people have through comprehensive exams and then build a fast employability route. We aim to certify at least 150,000 Colombians in job skills and employ around 400,000 new Colombians in formal jobs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Alpina's strategy for navigating the current macroeconomic climate?</h4><p>Obviously, it is difficult to control macroeconomic factors, and we are looking more inside Alpina to see what we can do for our consumers and continue growing. One of these steps is continued innovation. We have 25 launches planned for 2017, including both brand extensions and new products. We have started with the launch of four or five products in January-February 2017. We knew the start of 2017 would  be challenging with the tax reforms, and one way to face that was to be more aggressive with our new product launches. This sent a message of confidence to consumers that we are continuing to invest in giving them more product choice. This strategy works well and we believe 2017 should be another good year for Alpina.</p><h4>Alpina significantly increased its exports in 2016. How do you see this continuing?</h4><p>Our exports should continue to grow. We have made efforts to continue expanding our operations into more countries. Our exports grew in 2016, and we can grow from that base again because many of the countries we sold to last year were new markets for us, for example Mexico, Canada, the Dominican Republic, and Aruba. All those countries have potential for growth, and as we go into those markets, we seek  different opportunities to sell our products in additional countries. Therefore, our expansion comes from both our increased penetration of areas where we are already present, in addition to new countries with different opportunities. The favor of our products has proven to be successful in a variety of countries, although we also alter some products to suit particular markets.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for the agricultural and agri-food sectors to grow in the post-conflict era in Colombia?</h4><p>When we think about post conflict, we think about agriculture and productivity. The conflict in Colombia took place in rural areas where agricultural activity is based. Therefore, the only way to ensure the peace process is sustainable is through investment and development in Colombia's agricultural sector. This is the sector Alpina has been in for the last 70 years in Colombia. We have been purchasing from farmers and the dairy industry, and there has also been the development of the fruit industry. We have helped those farmers and other producers who have been caught up in this conflict and given them options to develop their businesses' sustainability and profitably. Therefore, Alpina is perfectly positioned to seize the opportunities in the post-conflict perfect. We operate in some of the regions that have experienced significant conflict and by sourcing from those places, such as in the far south; we are giving people the opportunity to make a life and have an income through their agricultural profession.</p><h4>What is keeping the agricultural sector and agri-industry from reaching their true potential?</h4><p>The country has significant challenges in infrastructure, which is still basic, especially in rural areas. It is difficult to transport products from place to place. Many companies like us have had to develop our own logistics. There is also the issue of government support for the growers, for example being able to get credit to improve their processes and productivity. As a company, we can help those producers, but it is difficult for us to have an impact on a wider scale. The government has to help the agricultural sector in general. We can do our part with the people we work with. For example, we have helped farmers create associations and taught them how to work together and purchase and share equipment as a group. This has helped develop not only the farmers' businesses as suppliers, but also their communities and problem-solving skills. This is a model we have been using for a long time in various communities with smaller farmers that do not have the individual capacity to sell to Alpina. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges do you expect from the implementation of the peace deal, particularly in the agriculture sector?</h4><p>In the short term, the greatest challenge will be the specific implementation of the agreements in two areas. The first is the eradication of illicit crops and the proposed substitution of illicit crops. This is a large challenge for the agricultural sector because of the 188,000ha in which there are illicit crops, the government has only committed to replacing 50,000ha. If producers now in the illicit business of drugs do not have a real market-driven option to replace illicit crops, this will be a major failure down the road. That is why it is important that the government works with the private sector to make a real contribution that not only serves as a substitution but also becomes a market-driven strategy. It must be viable; otherwise, a great deal of subsidies and economic support will be needed from the government, which can only ever be a short-term solution. Second, we are now discussing the land and property rights laws, which is also a huge challenge because these will send a signal to the investors who, regardless of their size, are committed to increasing the profitability of the agricultural and agro-industrial sector in Colombia. There are many opportunities; however, when the rules for businesses are unclear, a great deal of investment gets held up. The country is waiting for this process to be fully implemented, to know that private property is respected, that there is equal access to land, and that there is no political ideology behind this. </p><h4>What strategies should be used to incentivize investment in the agriculture sector?</h4><p>There are multiple ways to create a new mindset in the community of agricultural producers. We need to transform a supply-oriented sector into a market-driven one. What we have now are incentives from the ministry of agriculture for increasing the supply but not necessarily to be able to sell the products. Elements such as branding, packaging, product differentiation are critical. Most producers in Colombia do not necessarily invest resources in these things; however, when competing with products from other countries, new criteria are needed to make  decisions on investing resources to be more attractive to consumers. We have been narrowing the divide between producers and consumers to prevent the margin staying in the hands of middlemen. It is not that we want to get rid of them; we need the agricultural sector to be more profitable and self-sustainable. Regarding labor force, we are facing a new challenge, which is the reduction of the manpower in some rural areas. We need to formalize a labor policy for employment in the rural areas and think about the children growing up in these areas. Introducing new technologies, improving education for the rural population, formalizing rural labor contracts, and creating incentives for rural entrepreneurs are vehicles to make the countryside more attractive for people and for investment.</p><h4>What are your expectations for how the agricultural sector will finish 2017?</h4><p>Last year was modest, with growth of around 0.5%. It was affected by two things: El Niño and the transportation strike, both of which were concerning. While the latter is unlikely to happen again this year, there is a 50% probability according to some models that El Niño will strike in the third quarter of 2017. It is hard to make general predictions about the behavior of the agriculture sector because we need to consider coffee, palm sugar, poultry, and eggs, among others; it would be tough to make such a prediction. However, if the policy and rules of engagement are stable, if the signals for the people who invest in their own businesses are the right ones, and if the economy and consumption increase, then this could be a good year for the agricultural sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the strategies behind FCC's two latest projects in Colombia, the Toyo tunnel and the El Salitre Wastewater treatment plant?</h4><p>In every market that FCC operates in, we want to start out as an aggregator of value. In order to be the most competitive player in the market, we need to have a strategic difference. Given its 5km length, the tunnel project required much expertise, which is precisely what we brought to our collaborators in the project. As for the water treatment plant, we did this project through Aqualia, a subsidiary of FCC and the fourth-largest company of its kind in the world. We also have local partners whom we try to make a part of the construction process, not only on a per diem production basis, but also throughout the entire scope of a project's operations.</p><h4>What is your experience using and implementing the PPP model in Colombia?</h4><p>Private investors are important for these kinds of projects in Colombia; however, the money and expertise of a private investor is not enough, because in this specific case we are not talking about one company's profit margin, but the welfare of the entire country. Therefore, it is necessary for the government to strongly support these private investors in order to overcome environmental and community issues. There are some issues that private companies can assume the risk and responsibility of managing; however, they still need the government's help with community and environmental issues. Sometimes it is easy to simply leave all the responsibility with private actors. Nonetheless, if we look at 100 projects here in Colombia and questioned which ones finished were on time, we would be surprised to learn that so few were. Time delays can last for years, with huge impacts on the cash flow. Those who have to put the money down often lose confidence about whether a company will finish on time, and start asking for far more guarantees for the money they already put down. This too can affect cash flows. People often think foreign companies come into the country to exploit it, but this is not the case at all; countries around the world compete with one another to attract investors. It is easier for countries with fewer and more clearly designated regulations to attract these investments. Thus, countries overcrowded with regulations present a more uncertain picture. This is one of the challenges Colombia currently faces.</p><h4>How would you characterize the medium- and long-term attractiveness for Colombia as an investment destination for foreign investors?</h4><p>Colombia is a country with enormous opportunities, especially for people in Europe. FCC is a Spanish company and there is a kind of affinity with Colombia, especially since we share a common language. Colombia has a great deal of potential for young people. Given the massive demographic gap in Europe and the fact that the “old“ continent is actually growing quite old, for this reason alone Colombia is an excellent place to invest. There is a large young workforce here in Colombia and in neighboring countries that when given the tools and education will seize the future.</p><h4>As a company, where does Colombia fit into your long-term strategy?</h4><p>Our goal is to consolidate and expand here in Colombia, but all the people we are hiring and that already work both for us and with us are Colombians. As such, we really believe in sharing knowledge and being part of the actual culture and growth of Colombia. It is very important that we continue to share a long-term vision with the government, since our mission is to transform the country through measures like the 2035 Plan, we need the government's backing. In this regard, President Santos is on the right track, though we will see how they actually help us implement this. The previous president was also helpful in attracting actors from the private sector into Colombia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Coosalud is one of the largest insurance companies in Colombia and a top-ranked health promoting company (EPS) according to the Ministry of Health. How did it gain its leadership position?</h4><p>We are a cooperative company—in other words, a non-profit organization. Coosalud has grown exponentially in numbers; however, our most important asset is people. Developing our human capital has really translated into huge gains. Our main objective is to help the poor population in Colombia. One of the primary things we do in the health insurance industry is evaluate people's risk in order to minimize their threats. As a result, we have improved people's health by reducing deaths because of foreseeable diseases. To develop our people, we have implemented certain programs to boost happiness at work, not only with competitive salaries, but also by giving people plenty of reasons to be proud. Being a part of an organization that is socially and environmentally responsible makes our employees feel satisfied. If our employees are happy at work, people with sickness and diseases will receive better and more humane service. This has allowed us to achieve two milestones. First, our affiliates chose us as the best EPS in Colombia, and second, we were chosen by “Great Place to Work" as one of the top-10 companies to work for in Latin America.</p><h4>How would you assess the economic and social impact that Coosalud has had on the Caribbean region?</h4><p>The Caribbean coast is one of the most underdeveloped areas in Colombia. The poverty rate is high compared to other regions and it is an area where the rural population has few economic resources. Therefore, our strategy to focus on poor people has allowed many of them access to healthcare services. As a result, we have steadily reduced the mortality rates in that region and increased people's chances of employment. We also directly employ about 900 people. In addition, Coosalud has been one of the best EPS in terms of implementing the government policy to supply health services to remote areas with the poorest people, reducing mortality and morbidity indicators and allowing people to be more productive and find better jobs.</p><h4>What foreign investment opportunities are there in Colombia's healthcare sector?</h4><p>There is a huge opportunity because the healthcare system still requires more capital to stabilize its finances. There are currently 14 beds for every 10,000 inhabitants. However, 18 of the 45 best hospitals in Latin America are Colombian. Many international groups such as Sanitas have already invested in the country. The international interest in this sector demonstrates its huge opportunities. Colombia spends a large amount of money on healthcare, which should mainly come from the government. This large sum should be attractive for investors.</p><h4>What opportunities will result from Colombia's peace agreement?</h4><p>It will certainly benefit foreign investors because rebel groups like FARC were a hazard for them. This post-conflict atmosphere will also generate a great opportunity to invest in all those under-developed areas where the rebel groups were previously present. In our sector, new hospitals and health centers will certainly be built in these regions. In the end, Colombia has a great opportunity to grow, and investors are welcome here. What is more, we also seek to join the OECD, and investors could look at the country as a real star in the global economy.</p><h4>What are your remaining goals for 2017?</h4><p>We are searching for a partner to provide us with the equity we need to grow in this sector. We have about 8% of the affiliates in the subsidized regimen over the country, and about 3% in the total industry. Our goal is to grow in both and penetrate the contributory scheme, where we are currently not active. We also want to improve our risk management programs to make an impact on our people's health. Our goal is to become a national and international standard in the health insurance industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Cementos Argos' expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We plan to continue growing our operations not only in Colombia, but also in the US, Central America, and the Caribbean as well. We are highly optimistic about all of our operations in the US because we expect the new government's plans for boosting infrastructure spending to have positive effects on our company. We are well positioned to take advantage of this. Additionally, we expect strong growth in Central America and the Caribbean because we are market leaders with a strong presence in Honduras and Panama, both of whose economies are doing extremely well. Both countries are also investing heavily in infrastructure and the demand for cement is strong. We also like these regions because their demographics will necessitate more infrastructure and housing in coming years. In 2016, operations in Colombia were challenging because it was the first year in almost a decade that demand for cement decreased—by roughly 6% and for many reasons. First of all, we had a drought that also increased inflation. In the second part of the year, we had a transportation strike and rising inflation and interest rates, which depressed consumption. The start of the 4G projects was also delayed. In 2017, we expect work on the 4G project to increase demand, particularly in the second half of the year.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in the 4G infrastructure projects for Cementos Argos?</h4><p>We are market leaders in construction infrastructure in Colombia, and since 1944 we have built almost 80% of Colombia's infrastructure. We have the best value proposition for 4G projects, and we have secured supply for 40 of the functional units for the first and second waves, which represent 75% of the project's volume. All of this indicates that 2017 will be a much better year for the industry and for us. 4G projects will be the engine of the Colombian economy in 2017. At least eight projects have been fully financed and these will provide a boost to the economy. We are fully confident that the other projects will be able to secure the necessary financing. Colombia is in dire need of these infrastructure projects, and a key component of this are the 4G projects. In regard to financing, the interest from foreign firms has been strong. Goldman-Sachs has financed two of the most important projects and some other international financial institutions have been providing financing. The international community has shown quite a bit of interest in infrastructure projects in Colombia.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your investment strategy beyond Colombia?</h4><p>We want to become a leading cement producer in the Americas. Our area of interest stretches from Canada to the tip of Argentina. We have a strong presence in the US, which currently represents half of our revenues and 30% of our EBITA. In 2017, it will be 55% of our revenues and 45% EBITA. Markets outside of Colombia represent 70% of our revenue. Approximately 50% comes from the US and 20% comes from Central America and the Caribbean, so the reality is that those operations are extremely important for us. We want a balanced footprint of assets and businesses. The US is particularly attractive because it is a developed market with a stable currency. This means that most of our exposure is in Central America and the Caribbean, where the demographics are attractive and the potential for growth is high. It is also great that many of their currencies are pegged to the US dollar. Moving forward, we will be looking south of Colombia for more and more of our opportunities.</p><h4>What role does the Colombian market play in your current operations?</h4><p>The Colombian market represents 30% of our current revenues and plays an important role in our EBITA. Going forward we expect Colombia to play an important role in our operations. We are fully confident in our operations here and will add 1 million tons of capacity between 2017 and 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[up-and-running]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the current state of Colombia's rail projects?</h4><p>There are currently seven rail projects in Colombia and an additional three under preparation. Taken together, these amount to more than 2,500km and would make a complete national railroad system. The country already moves more than 300 million tons of freight each year, domestically and internationally; therefore, we need an efficient transport system such as railroads. We have a developed system of trucks, but the cost is higher and less efficient than rail. Since our goal is to develop an entire national railway system of more than 2,500km, we need the help of big investors such as JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs. We also need an excellent construction company that knows how to build railroads and the requisite infrastructure, not to mention the help we will need from manufacturers of locomotives such as GE and Bombardier. In addition to an excellent operator, we also need help from the producers of the freight and the companies that make and move the products. We have made some contacts with foreign companies; however, when they see the state of the Colombian railway system, they prefer to remain in a waiting position. We also need the support of the government, which cannot wait until firms simply come to Colombia of their own volition and develop the railroad system: it first has to help make it more attractive. It is not because we do not have a sovereign guarantee that we do not want one; not only do we need the signature of the Minister of Finance, we also need the assistance of the President, the Vice President—who is in charge of infrastructure development in Colombia—the Minister of Transport, and the Minister of the Environment. Indeed, we need the help of every manager in the Colombian government if we are ever to develop this country's railroads.</p><h4>Despite the lack of a master plan, how would you describe the current level of interest from foreign firms?</h4><p>I see that companies are interested; however, if there is no clear path for how to move forward with the project, they ultimately lose faith. For example, we had three large Chinese companies that expressed interest in winning a contract to build Colombia's railroad infrastructure; however, who will hand out this contract? We need investors; we need political and financial institutions, companies that will make the loans, and companies to handle the logistics and operations. We need many companies to be involved in the development of Colombia's railroads. There are companies that are interested; however, if they do not see concomitant interest on the part of the government, then the whole project looks like a mere private undertaking, when in reality it needs to be a national project.</p><h4>What is the timeline for beginning construction of the Ferropetrol line?</h4><p>We still do not know. The original date was January 2017, but that is no longer the case. What needs to happen is a great collective effort in which everyone joins forces: all the builders, generators, the entire government and all the financial institutions and investors—we need to bring them all together to develop Colombia's railway system. Maybe a year or two after all the relevant parties have sat down together the construction of the railroads can begin.</p><h4>What goals do you hope to accomplish by the end of 2017?</h4><p>By the end of 2017, we would like to have a structure and company that goes beyond our status as just the Ferropetrol project development company, but has become a fully fledged railroad holding company called Ferrolat and has brought all the relevant concessioners, builders, constructors, and operators into the fold of one company whose sole objective is to develop Colombia's railroad system. Not one but all seven projects. By the end of 2017, we will have this structure up and running in Colombia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Almaviva perform in 1H2017?</h4><p>The results from 2016 exceeded our targets and we have made an important change to how the company was operating as well as improving our customer approach though a centralized customer service unit. So far in 2017, the economy has had a slow start and GDP growth up to April was at 0.6%. With all of the new economic laws and taxes there has been a great deal of uncertainty, which has had an effect on local consumption and different industries such as beverages, automotive, and high tech. We optimize different economic conditions and give our customers the most optimal logistics network model to ensure that they are on the market in the best way possible. This is where an integrated logistics company such as Almaviva, with 78 years of experience, has many benefits for our customers. For example, we operate customs, international transportation, transport from ports to cities, warehousing, and distribution, which are basically the movement of goods. As always, when the economy is in this manner then all companies try to optimize every area of their companies and logistics is becoming more and more important in Colombia with the conditions we are living in currently. </p><h4>How is the logistics sector in performing in this environment of slow growth?</h4><p>In the logistics sector, we manage to understand how the economy is performing. We see an impact on the performance of the different companies that are our clients and our role there is to work with our clients to try to understand how we can optimize the logistics network as fast as possible. The big opportunity for us is to try to capture different logistics services; I have seven logistics services and may have a customer with only three so I try to give the customer a discount in one of the existing services and try to get two or three more additional services offered to the client as an integrated logistics offer though synergies based on our strong and largest pool of assets. This will improve the customers' actual costs and bring more efficiency and this is our current goal. The role of the logistics companies such as us is exactly this when the economy is good or when it is bad. When everything is running high and economic perspectives are good, there are opportunities to have projects and invest in doing things differently, while right now companies are not willing to invest in technology or services that require additional costs; this is where we have to try and balance the process of making a logistics offer to our customers.</p><h4>What trends are you noticing regarding Colombian companies expanding their international presence?</h4><p>There is a great opportunity in Colombia to improve the exportation process. We are typically managing the same stuff that we manage all the time, such as flowers, coffee, and bananas. Colombia is focused on specific products that it has focused on in the past. There are interesting opportunities, and what have been happening in the country in terms of the peace process and people going back to the fields and countryside to work at their farms will allow us to improve the process with a more technical farming techniques, which would allow us to boost exports and increase the volume and variety of goods being produced. The investment that the country is making in the logistics network and roads is important, as it is one of the most difficult aspects here as the country is divided by three big mountains. This makes it difficult to develop roads; there has been a lack of evolution in this area over the past years. There is investment being made and as we are in the process of going back to agriculture, this will allow us to have production that allows us to increase exports from the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In late 2016, Jaguar Land Rover opened its second office in all of Latin America in Colombia. What opportunities do you see in the local market?</h4><p>Our first office is in Brazil, near the factory in Rio. It has been there for the last 10 years since it was part of the Ford group. When Tata Motors bought the Jaguar and Land Rover company, the regional office was already in Brazil. Today, especially in the automotive segment, Colombia is growing faster and faster. We are here for many reasons—because of the country's improved economic situation and its current financial opportunities. It is completely different than it was 10 years ago considering the luxury market is now possible. In the 1980s and 1990s, people had money here but could not show that they did. Then, premium cars started to become more present as the country grew safer and economic activity improved. People were more comfortable displaying their wealth. Now, there are 30 year olds driving a Mercedes or BMW. The brands are increasing their portfolio just like other premium brands around the world. It is preparing itself to show it can offer everything the country is ready to receive. Colombia is one of the fastest-growing countries in Latin America, especially in the automotive segment and in premium brands.</p><h4>In what ways will your new direct presence in the country impact the Jaguar and Land Rover brands?</h4><p>Jaguar Land Rover is a part of Tata motors now, and there is greater investment in technology and products everywhere. For example, we now produce our own engine that we could not 10 years ago. We were just a small brand with one small importer and a single showroom in Bogotá. With the national sales company behind us, we have more financial muscle invested in the country as well in our processes to bring in more cars with better prices. We see an excellent market with huge opportunities. As a group, we invest a great deal of money in technology, people, and factories. We produce our own engines, which is also great for us. The company is growing, the brands are growing, and the country is growing. We are in the right place at the right time.</p><h4>What are your expectations for your first full year here?</h4><p>We want to be three times larger in the coming year. Now we can help the importer and our dealer while growing our service. We still do not have a dealer on the coast, Cali, or Medellí­n. There are many geographic opportunities; however, we must execute our strategy intelligently. Medellí­n and Cali are important pieces of the market. We will eventually get there; however, first we will expand services and then open a new showroom there. If we want to grow we know we have to get out of Bogotá, strategically growing from the aftersales perspective first.</p><h4>How has the macroeconomic situation impacted the automotive industry?</h4><p>We expected the year to start with stronger sales. Because of the economy and tax reform people are waiting to see how they are affected and how the tax reform will ripple through the economy. It is not bad compared to last year, especially because we had a motor show in November. We do expect an increase in the premium market with more or less 5% this year through until December. The second half of the year is typically better than the first. Generally, sales are 60% in the second half and 40% in the first. This is why we are still confident we can make it. In terms of both Jaguar and Land Rover we have increased sales by 44%. This is partly because of the national sales company presence and partly because we changed our prices. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2017 marks the 35th anniversary of Servientrega. What does this milestone mean?</h4><p>We have had seven different five-year strategic development periods during our 35-year history. The first was the foundational one, into which we put a great deal of time, effort, and love, and for which we started with little money. Then, we had the second period of development where we worked on technical details and the business began to take off. The third was diversification, because we did not want to get stuck just moving and dealing with documents; we would not have had the success we have now. Then, we had the consolidation period, where we gained more visibility and expanded to the US, Ecuador,  and Venezuela. After that was the integration period, where we focused on creating synergy between logistics and all other areas of the supply chain. Following this, we had further expansions in Panama and Peru. Finally, our current five-year plan is focused on sustainability, where we are strong especially in terms of corporate social responsibility. We place great emphasis on being environmentally friendly. Our commitment to the environment is important—we recently planted 180,000 trees in a large forest. We are one of the most environmentally friendly companies in Colombia. After 35 years, we have 15,000 employees and 3,500 vehicles in the Andean region. We work in both the air and maritime segments. Of course, this is the base and the roots of where we come from. Our idea is to integrate the logistics chain. We want to create a sort of strategic competitive circle in which we involve all the players. We have won awards at the World Economic Forum, becoming the main player in the Andean region. We want to add a competitive variable into the game. We have infrastructure that is ready to sustain e-commerce, and this is one of our next big challenges to tackle.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in the future for e-commerce in Colombia?</h4><p>There is a need for more collaboration in the e-commerce and logistics and pay system. For these, we have created a service that will integrate all of the e-commerce players. We also want to evolve in the identification systems, such as fingerprinting and biometrics. Another challenge is creating more standardization in order for all the players to all work together toward automatization in order to make the entire process more sustainable for every player in the chain.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for international investors and commerce in Colombia?</h4><p>There are opportunities for foreign investors in Colombia in any sector, not only the one in which we operate. Of course, it is important they have a long-term view. If they come and stay for only a short period of time, it is not sufficient; they do not understand us or where we come from.</p><h4>What about Colombian companies looking abroad?</h4><p>We see many companies investing outside of Colombia and looking to new fields. Colombian entrepreneurs are excellent, and their best course of action is to look at investments abroad that will come back to benefit them in the long term.</p><h4>What are your priorities and goals for the coming year?</h4><p>Our goal for the next five years is to make all of Latin America greener. For the next generation, our goal is to make the entire world greener. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Putting the ICT in post- Conflict]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[putting-the-ict-in-post--conflict]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you envision the ICT sector's role in the peace process and post-conflict era?</h4><p>ICT has a fundamental and transversal role in building a country with a stable and lasting peace, as a key player in the different processes of integration, social inclusion, and citizen participation. That is why we are strengthening our ICT policy, Plan Vive Digital para la Gente, for the post-conflict era in three aspects: enhancing our deployment of communications infrastructure in remote areas, encouraging digital literacy, and empowering digital entrepreneurship. More than five decades of armed conflict in Colombia have contributed to deepening inequality in the country. That is why the Ministry of ICT is helping close the gap between the city and the countryside through the National Rural Connectivity Plan, which will deliver high-speed internet to municipal centers and offer community access solutions to populated centers of more than 100 inhabitants. It is through ICT that areas affected by the conflict in aspects such as health, education, and agriculture can be reached immediately. We are aware that peace building requires the participation of all of society without making distinctions, and the Ministry of ICT will play an active role in strengthening the community, institutions, and region.</p><h4>How would you characterize the current progress of Colombia's digital transformation?</h4><p>Colombia has taken a step forward in terms of ICT in the last six years thanks to the implementation of the ICT policy Plan Vive Digital para la Gente. The country's progress has been recognized internationally. According to the Digital Evolution Index of Tufts University, Colombia was one of the top-10 countries in the world that advanced the most toward a digital economy during the 2008-2013 period. Similarly, according to the latest report of the Digitization Index of Professor Raúl Katz of Columbia University (US), in 2015 Colombia went from being a country of “transitional digitization“ to one of “advanced digitization,“ a category shared by most OECD countries. Since its implementation, the ICT policy has promoted the development of the country's digital ecosystem in four components: ICT infrastructure, ICT services, applications and digital content, and user skills. Likewise, the Plan Vive Digital para la Gente has set four main objectives: consolidate the ICT sector as a generator of employment, develop a digital government that harnesses ICT for greater efficiency and transparency, contribute with ICT to the transformation of education, and transform the quality of life in the cities and territories with the development of regional digital ecosystems, especially access to the internet. Colombia now has 15.3 million internet connections—seven times more than in 2010. Furthermore, 639 towns and cities now have access to fourth generation (4G) mobile services.</p><h4>How would you characterize Colombia's regional competitiveness regarding attracting ICT investments?</h4><p>Colombia is one of the countries with the greatest economic stability. The IT industry accounted for 1.19% of the country's GDP in 2015, according to indicators from the IT Observatory, and has been positioning itself nationally and internationally because it provides technological solutions that improve the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy. The consolidation of IT in Colombia has allowed foreign companies with extensive experience in consulting services, technology solutions, and R&amp;D development to focus their attention on our country. They are attracted by the quality of digital talent, local demand, and opportunity to export their products and services to other markets in the region. This is the case of Globant (Argentina), Indra (Spain), Synapsis (Chile), Capgemini (France), and Stefanini (Brazil). It is evident that companies in the region have found similar or better conditions in Colombia for their businesses than those in other Latin American countries. CAGR in IT was 37% from 2012 to 2016, closing the gap with respect to the region's strongest economies such as Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Argentina. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Reach for the Cloud]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[reach-for-the-cloud]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the strategic opportunities for SAP in Colombia?</h4><p>Our presence in Colombia is extremely important for different reasons. We have 2,000 clients in Colombia, with 7,000 clients in the north region in Central America, the Caribbean region, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. Therefore, we are playing an important role and as a main influencer. We have two main challenges; the first is to grow in our core business toward the digital transformation and the second, which is very important, is to maintain the power and capacity of deciding and influencing the actual market. We saw many opportunities in the cloud, which is 30% of our business. We have seen triple-digit growth in the past several years in this sector, so we are confident that this will continue.</p><h4>How do you compare Colombia's digital transformation process to other countries in the region?</h4><p>We are currently gaining a great deal of momentum; however, it is hard to measure the impact of the digital transformation. We have about four or five ways of measuring digital transformation, which include government policies, ease of doing business, human capital, technology, and market preparedness. We are at the top of the countries of Latin America and believe the digital economy will be around 6% of GDP, which is close to European countries and North America. Colombia has excellent infrastructure we can use. Institutions have started to understand they need to make some changes to facilitate companies to move forward in that direction, since companies need to be more competitive. Colombia especially is in a great position to understand and manage the technology. </p><h4>How has the Colombian market embraced the types of services that you provide?</h4><p>It has definitely been receptive. We did not invent the digital economy; that was something that happened five years ago but SAP realized that it needs to play a different role in the market and we invested close to USD50 billion not just developing new technology and a new digital core but buying new companies in the market to create something that we believe to be the best framework for developing the digital environment. This country is a little behind, economically speaking, but that means it is easier to accelerate the technology because we do not have the legacy that most of the largest corporations or most developed countries do. Companies can go straight to having the best technology right now, so for customers willing to start moving toward the digital world, it is much easier. We now see many trends, especially in small and medium companies, which truly need to be more competitive and can accelerate faster than any other companies. Approximately 50% of the GDP of the Colombian market is SMEs, and probably 80% of the employers work for SMEs so it is a huge market that we have there.</p><h4>What is your outlook regarding cloud services in the local market?</h4><p>We will continue to have triple-digit growth in cloud for 2017, and at least in the way we see the market, I would say that more than 90% of our install base is moving toward the cloud. There is another wave that we see regarding emerging trends. We just launched a new product called SAP Leonardo, which is what we see in more intelligent applications; therefore, those trends are still new in the market and we are just launching that in our markets. It comes with many disrupting technologies that will generate another wave of digital transformation. We can embed those disrupting technologies in our applications to determine how our technology can help companies understand the markets better and differently. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the Colombian market for Samsung's strategy in Latin America?</h4><p>The Colombian market is already a big one but still has huge potential to grow. In terms of country size and population, which are already formidable, it is even more attractive for its growth potential. We are investing a great deal and studying how to be a better member of Colombian society. The Colombian market is very important for competition between retailers. If we prove ourselves in the Colombian market, we can prove ourselves in the global market. In this sense, the Colombian market is very important.</p><h4>Which business lines have the most potential in Colombia?</h4><p>The mobile device sector is definitely the most attractive. Within our business portfolio, mobile is the highest portion for our business. Even though the penetration in mobile devices here is already quite high, we have room to grow technology wise—in 4G and 5G, for example. Smartphones have already penetrated the Colombian market, but the LTE technology has a way to go. We are focusing on how to supply LTE and 4G technologies to Colombian society. This is where Samsung's expertise has an advantage in Colombia.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges in Colombia that are unique to this country for Samsung? </h4><p>When I arrived in July of 2015, we were in the middle of an economic fluctuation, mainly in the exchange rate. At the beginning of last year the exchange rate was around COP2,000 to the USD, and at the end of last year it was COP3,000, a 50% devaluation. That impacted our business very negatively and still remains a big challenge. The macroeconomic situation is not great, and inflation has also impacted us. These are some of the challenges of doing business here. The last thing is competition. There are too many players on the provider and retail side. Competition is a factor, and the market price is ever fluctuating. The visibility level is a little low, which also factors into our business. In the short term, competition is a challenge to our business, but in the long term, it is good for us. It makes us stronger, and the competition always generates innovation.</p><h4>How is Samsung partnering with local institutions?</h4><p>I am very proud of what we have done this year and last. One of the things is called the Tech Institute, the principal aim of which is to utilize our facilities and technology for the betterment of Colombian society. We have already developed certain facilities and products that we are excited to share with the Colombian people. We also have a corporation with the National Service of Learning (SENA), where we set up some classrooms and they use our products to facilitate learning and teaching. We are running the smart schools format as well. This year we developed a different kind of project called Nómada, a mobile classroom. We developed some equipment and then dispersed spot tablets, TVs, and even tables. We currently have eight modules that we sent out across the country to areas that do not have access to normal classrooms. It is a great tool to approach the people that live in rural areas like the Amazon or in the mountains. We can fold it up and take the classroom anywhere we go.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017?</h4><p>There are still some economic challenges, not to mention the tax issue, but we can manage the issue and will grow in terms of sales revenue. Ten or 20 years from now, Samsung wants to be an inspirational and admirable brand. We are not just doing business without providing some solution-oriented products. We want to provide benefit to Colombia as an integral member of society, not just the economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[udderly-unbelievable-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why was Bogotá chosen as Tetra Pak's headquarters for the Andean region?</h4><p>The headquarters of the company in this region is in Bogotá for many different reasons: there are almost 50 million consumers here, Colombia has shown economic stability for the past few years, and its political institutions have been stable, all of which attract foreign investment. One of our main categories is milk, and Colombia has the highest consumption of milk per capita in South America and after Brazil is the second-largest milk producer in the region. Here, our market share is one of the lowest worldwide, meaning there is a huge opportunity for growth. We also see that in other categories such as juice and nectar. Compared to other markets, Colombia is still underdeveloped. Therefore, if we put everything together, Colombia is a key market for the company, and the group has been investing heavily in the country and the region over the past years. For the region in general, we have had double-digit growth the last two years and intend to maintain this level.</p><h4>How would you characterize the first half of 2017 for Tetra Pak?</h4><p>For 2017, we expect to have the same level of double-digit growth we had last year. As of today, we will see 12% growth. The market has not started out as strong as the previous year; the beverage category in Colombia for the first three months fell compared to the previous year. Colombia has all the pillars to keep growing; however, the situation in the region, such as tax increase and other factors, created a constraint during the beginning of this year. I expect, however, these factors to change in the coming months. Thus, our expectation is to grow around 15% in Colombia this year.</p><h4>How is Tetra Pak implementing digital innovations into its operations?</h4><p>Today, it is key to work on digitization and on digital platforms. With current technology, we are able to connect the entire plant, from where we prepare the product, to the filling line and the package itself. This also allows us to monitor the entire process and provides digital information to the plant manager that helps improve operations and performance. In addition, we are now introducing The Hololens, a kind of goggle, in partnership with Microsoft. With these goggles, we can provide remote support 24/7; if there  is an issue in the plant, a user can wear these and receive support from a specialist anywhere in the world, whether it is for our technicians or even customers. We are investing heavily in digital innovations, and there is still much to be done.</p><h4>How are you implementing Tetra Pak's sustainability initiatives in the local market?</h4><p>The environment is one of the four strategic pillars of Tetra Pak; the company has big ambitions for sustainability and has invested a great deal in this area. For example, as of last year, all Tetra Pak packages are 100% recyclable—with new technology we were able to make caps and polymers out of sugar cane to create the first 100% renewable carton package. For our ambient packages, 82% is made of renewable material, using the same approach as pasteurized products with bio-based resources. Our goal is to get 100% recyclable or 100% renewable packaging. We are supporting the construction of five plants in Colombia that will recollect packaging and through various processes separate the paper part from aluminum and the polythene; the paper can then be used for books and more. The aluminum and polythene can be the used to produce chairs, tables, and roofs, for example. We also have programs across the region where we go to schools and explain to students about the importance of recycling and the environment. We have invested around USD400,000 over the last two years supporting various recycling activities in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sophisticated-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the strategic importance of the Colombian and Andean markets for PPG Industries? </h4><p>As PPG Industries has expanded around the world, there are still a few markets where we see opportunities to grow. The Andean region is one of the areas where we are still underrepresented in terms of our market share and participation. Latin America and Asia are main areas where the company will be looking for growth. In terms of the mature regions, such as Europe, the US, and even Mexico, our levels of participation are so high that, while there is some room for more growth, we also have to concentrate on defending our market share. The Andean region is one of the regions where we see potential sources of growth for PPG Industries in the future.</p><h4>What segments in particular present the biggest opportunities for you? </h4><p>Today, we have five business units in the Andean region that we manage from Colombia and have one segment that is still managed from the US. We have our automotive business where our main customers in the Andean region are General Motors and Renault. However, our automotive business has been declining in Colombia. The local automotive industry is under a large amount of stress due to the free trade agreements Colombia has, while countries like Mexico have a competitive advantage. Therefore, it is a challenge for the automotive industry in Colombia to compete. PPG Industries' second business line is our protective and marine coatings business (PMC). This is a highly specialized segment that covers heavy-duty maintenance. This business line is mainly aimed at the oil and gas and infrastructure industries. Oil and gas was an important segment for us over the last three years while Colombia was building a new refinery; however, now our PMC business is more about maintenance and new projects. We also see great potential for growth in our marine business in Colombia, Chile, and Peru. Our third business line is products related to automotive repairs, for example collision repair and products for car builders that are not original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This is an important market and is a little more fragmented than our first two business lines, but it is also a market that is starting to be driven by innovation. Our fourth segment is our general industrial business, which is basically anything that needs to be painted in a factory, such as appliances. This is perhaps where we see the greatest opportunities for growth here. As Colombia and the region start to get more activities in the OEM segment, along with more environmental protection standards coming in, this will help us to grow our business here. We see the opportunity to grow further as an industry as the region gets more sophisticated.</p><h4>What other strategies or priorities do you have for PPG Industries in 2017?<br></h4><p>Our goal is to continue growing the business here. Anywhere we think PPG Industries is underrepresented we have to go for market share. Our goal is to help the market become more sophisticated based on productivity and technology, so working to help industry be more competitive and environmentally friendly. We have to consolidate our operational strategy in the region. We are well established in Colombia, but there is still room for growth in other business lines that we do not have at present. We are evaluating whether we want to bring those types of businesses here or stick with the five business units we already have. Ecuador accounts for about 15-20% of our business, and Peru another 10-15%. We see opportunities in Peru, a market that we think will continue to grow. In Peru, oil is growing so there will be some infrastructure potential there. An important part of our consolidation is to define our business model for Peru.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[fresh-coat-of-new-paint]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook on how the tax reforms will affect the housing sector?</h4><p>The government extends its collection through small businesses and employee wages, and the economy can be affected because it can reduce consumption. At the industrial level, the income tax will be reduced, but profits will fall, possibly reducing the interest of investment from foreign companies and causing the exit of several companies. However, there could be good investment expectations in the post-conflict zones, as they will have the benefit of reduced income tax for 10 years. In the construction sector, construction of houses that exceed COP800 million could be reduced as they will be taxed with VAT; therefore, our sales can be affected.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in the post-conflict era for Quimica Cosmos, particularly in previously inaccessible regions?</h4><p>We will see a number of foreign governments looking to invest in the country, such as the US and the UK, to support the development of areas affected by the war. The Colombian government also has a rural development plan, under which it will give subsidies and other support to develop areas not previously accessible. Of course, for Quimica Cosmos this also represents an opportunity to promote and sell products in these areas.</p><h4>Beyond housing what other sectors are you focusing on for 2017?</h4><p>Our main focus and business line is architectural paints, in which we rank second in Colombia's market share. We are developing two more product lines, one for construction and another for industry. In the construction segment, we already have certain products and are developing some new lines. In terms of industries, we seek to meet the market by manufacturing products that are faster to use. For example, some old products require the customer to mix and wait before applying them, so we are developing a much faster product that is easier to apply, environmentally friendly, and better for people's health.</p><h4>What products are you developing to fit the needs of the local market in Colombia?</h4><p>We have developed two ways of meeting the market's needs. One is through our suppliers, which basically offer us all the new technologies available. Our policy is that the new technologies we use have to be environmentally friendly and non harmful to human health. One of these is an anti-insect paint coating that repels insects. This is particularly important in Colombia today with mosquitoes carrying diseases such as the Zika virus. The product contains a specific chemical that is used by the Swiss Army and was integrated into soldiers' clothing to keep mosquitoes away. This chemical will be used in our paints. Importantly, it does not kill mosquitoes; it just repels them, so this product is ecologically friendly in design. Another way to meet market needs is through our annual surveys with our clients. We use their feedback to help us develop new product lines.</p><h4>What are your goals for Quimica Cosmos in 2017?</h4><p>For 2017, we plan to keep growing and aim for double-digit growth of around 12%, which is what we achieved in 2015. Given the new market opportunities that have opened up now, we are also looking for new activities in the construction and industrial sector. From March 2017 onward, the government is starting a formalization process for our sector. There are many players in the paint industry in Colombia that do not always meet the required standards, so further regulation of the sector is required. Starting in March 2017, every paint product will have to comply with the labeling regulation provided by the government. This is an excellent development for companies like us that already comply with regulations, not to mention for the standards of the paint industry in general. The standards in the sector will be higher, and we have a headstart already. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[model-mining]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2015, the Soto Norte project was acquired by Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala. How do the assets in Soto Norte fit into Mubadala's global portfolio?</h4><p>Mubadala is positioning the UAE in fast-growing resource markets by supporting the creation of industrial champions in critical value chains such as aluminum, copper, zinc, and gold. Mubadala took full ownership of the project in 2015 and has focused the project so it can be executed in line with world-class community relations and environmental sustainability values. We adjusted the project metrics, reduced capital investment required, and designed a project with a significantly lower impact on the environment. This reduced the risk for us and increased the overall value. Now, it is a robust project that can go forward and has a 20, 30, or 40-year lifespan once we start operations. It will be one of the top five largest underground gold mines in the world once in operation, with about 450,000 ounces a year in production.</p><h4>Roughly 80% of the gold currently produced in Colombia is mined illegally. What is Minesa's strategy for combating this issue?</h4><p>I recently received a report from the University of British Columbia estimating that illegal mining in our area produces about three-quarters of a ton of mercury each year. However, we cannot just come in and force the local communities to all work for us. Traditionally, they have been mining here for hundreds of years and have a right to do what they have always been doing, just not in harmful ways; that has to change. If we create a coexistence model and build them a mine and a treatment plant with the same technology we are using, then buy that product off them we can remove this impact. We can also now start looking at sustainable industries around eco-tourism, as it is a beautiful location and the history of traditional mining is also an important culture whose cultural importance should not be overshadowed by its impact on the environment. We are there to work with them and be a part of their community, value their rights and those of their children to understand how the impact can be mitigated or be beneficial, and work toward that goal. </p><h4>How does Colombia rank in its ease of doing business in the regional mining sector?</h4><p>Colombia is difficult, but no jurisdiction in this day and age is not. In Colombia, it is different because popular participation and the vote have more influence over the outcome than the national government. Tolima municipality just had a referendum in which 98% of people said no to mining. There are 39 other municipalities looking to hold a similar referendum, so there is a whole groundswell against mining. Colombia has a jurisdiction and technical permitting requirement that, if managed structurally and institutionally, would be in line with that seen in other countries in the world. The constitutional court keeps changing the rules, which has led to participation at the local level, which is then done without the full knowledge of what they are talking about. This is where the mining industry is failing to show them how things can be done right, given that Colombia has two types of mining. There are mega mines, which are operated by multinationals and are responsible, but which operate in areas far from the sensitive environmental regions. There is then illegal mining and nothing in between. The perception is either one of illegal devastation and the pouring of mercury and cyanide into the rivers, or a mega-mining project. But there are examples of mines around the world working harmoniously in sensitive areas without significant problems because they operate in a proprietary fashion. In Colombia, we need a flagship project that can prove to Colombians that this can be done. I truly hope that we can be that model. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[creating-the-right-conditions]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your expectations for the hydrocarbon sector for 2017? </h4><p>Compared to 2016, this year is expected to be better for a number of reasons. The first is because, at least up until now, international prices for oil have been above USD50 a barrel, which in the case of Colombia, allows many of the projects to be economically feasible. It seems the price crisis is over—or at least the worse is behind us. Companies have done their best to adjust costs and become more efficient, which allows us to be more optimistic. Nonetheless, it is not easy to predict what will happen with the investment budgets, especially because different countries are interested in increasing their production and selling those barrels of gas. At the same time, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries sent a clear message to the world indicating they would not be the only ones reducing the oil supply in order to keep prices at a more competitive level. In the case of Colombia, specifically, a sign that creates more certainty, is that the tax reform has been approved, although many challenges remain. The biggest is that the country still needs to create conditions that make it more competitive regardless of what is happening with the international price level.</p><h4>What else can be done from the government side to further increase the feasibility of hydrocarbon projects?</h4><p>It is true that the national government introduced some reforms in order to reduce the impact of the crisis in oil prices and, compared to other countries in the region, Colombia is in a better position after so much uncertainty. In the case of the oil and gas business, the government introduced some measures, especially the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH), in order to introduce more flexibility in contracts. We are seeing the results of those measures right now. For example, in 2017 investment in E&amp;P will increase as compared with last year's investments. Nonetheless, we still have some economic challenges, and the government is fully aware of all of them. One has to do with reaching a more competitive government take. After the last tax reform, the offshore projects were able to maintain the same tax situation. Nonetheless, in the case of onshore projects, due to a new tax that introduced on the dividends of foreign companies, the government take was increased rather than reduced, as was expected.</p><h4>What challenges still remain in the sector regarding legal security?</h4><p>One of the main assets Colombia has had is that it is a country with a stable political system, its macroeconomic policies are quite predictable, and despite its challenges, it still has an important institutional structure and legal security. Unfortunately, we are facing a challenge in that aspect because of certain rulings in the judiciary system and because we still need to regulate different mechanisms of community participation. This is an important issue, but sooner or later those worries will disappear, as the needed reforms are approved.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the offshore sector in Colombia? </h4><p>Most companies agree on the interesting prospects that Colombia has offshore, and many have been working with a great deal of enthusiasm since 2014, precisely the time the oil crisis started. Colombia has done more than 100,000km of seismic exploration. In 2017, a number of companies are expected to invest in five specific wells; hence, this offshore activity is a clear commitment from the companies. We believe that there is still some room to be more competitive offshore, especially if the discoveries are related to gas. Gas has different economic requirements, so we will need to adjust the economic models to the new reality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

In late 2016, the District of Bogotá was authorized by the City Council to divest 20% of Empresa de Energí­a de Bogotá (EEB) to fund the city's infrastructure program, while retaining the District's majority share with a stake of 56%. This divestment, or democratization, which is governed by Law 226, implies that the asset should first be offered to the solidarity sector: EEB employees, labor unions, pension funds, and government workers, among others. Our expectation for this democratization process is for the citizens of Bogotá as well as Colombian investors that value the position and great potential of GEB to buy shares in the company. The democratization will allow the company to strengthen its corporate governance and provide additional disclosure of information of the company. This process, along with other investments and our strategic geographic expansion plan, will allow us to become the largest non-mining company in Colombia and one of the largest companies within the energy sector in Latin America.</p><h4>How is your strategy shifting to focus on the major urban areas in Latin America? </h4><p>Our main strategy is to focus on big metropolitan areas. We currently serve the megacities of Bogotá and Lima, because we love to attain markets with high density population and a high demand of electricity and natural gas. Our experience from Bogotá has taught us how to do business in major cities. It is not only about bringing gas and electricity to people, but also improving urban energy solutions as a whole.</p><h4>How do sustainability and renewable energies factor into your new strategic restructuring?</h4><p>There are several areas where sustainability will give us strength as a company. One of them is what we call a genuine relationship with the community. All companies have a relationship with the community and a social responsibility toward it, but we want to really change our relationship with the community. A company has to be willing to get to know its community and be a part of it, which is one of the biggest changes we are making. We have been forced to make changes with the community, especially in Guatemala, and have learned to understand how to really work with the people from the start of the project. The relationship with the community is crucial to the longevity and success of this company. Another area we would like to expand in is renewables, by seeking new opportunities in countries where the energy matrix is transitioning to this sustainable and low-emission generation source. We want to grow our assets in distribution and transportation of gas, renewable energy, and transmission. Regarding energy generation, we will concentrate our efforts in non-conventional renewable energy sources. The regulation in Colombia is changing and will boost investment in cleaner energy production.</p><h4>What are the next steps for GEB's restructuring?</h4><p>We have teams working on three strategic business units: urban energy solutions, interconnecting for market development, and low emission generation. The entire company will be restructured around these three strategic units, and our effort will be on growing these markets. All the assets will be restructured as well. We are also divesting our none-core assets: Promigas, ISA, Nutresa, and Banco Popular, something that will give us more resources to invest in our three strategic business units. We are also developing 12 transmission line projects in Colombia. Over the next four years we are investing around USD700 million in transmission projects. Our main focus of 2017 will be on these projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is GM Colombia addressing the needs of the local market?</h4><p>Times change and there is a lot of movement in the industry, especially in regard to customers' needs. In response, 13 years ago we established that connectivity is an important step in the vehicles evolution. We launched Chevystar, which is based on the concept of safety. We launched five or six versions of the product and to celebrate our 60th anniversary in 2016 we took the opportunity to launch our eighth generation of Chevystar. The key difference with this latest version is the state-of-the-art hardware that allows us to read the information from all the computers in the car. The data is transmitted through the internet to our centers; therefore, we continuously monitor and understand what is going on with the car's performance. We analyze the vehicle's data using various algorithms. When a critical issue arises, we send that information to the customer through an app that enables the customer to set up an appointment at any of our Chevrolet assistance centers in Colombia. The system also allows the client to run the tests on their car to check if it is working  well. Therefore, we are staying ahead of the trend when it comes to the internet of things. This is a major forward step for our 60th anniversary legacy.</p><h4>How do you see the uncertainty factor of 2016 carrying over to 2017?</h4><p>We were forecasting an industry slightly better than 2016 (260,000 vs 253,000 in 2016) supported in the fact of a better and more stable macroeconomic background (controlled inflation, a flat COP vs USD rate, and peace agreement consolidation); however, the year didn't begin as expected, the Tax reform along with other factors, had a negative effect in the consumer confidence with historical low levels in  January at -30.2. Today, we are still below the 2016 confidence levels; however, we see a positive trend and expect the second half of the year to grow at a better pace.</p><h4>How do you see the upcoming tax reforms impacting the automotive sector?</h4><p>The main consequence of the tax reform for us was the VAT change from 16% to 19%, it had an immediate impact on all vehicle prices and an enormous impact on the consumers (confidence index moved from -10.7 in Dec to -30.2 in January).  The auto industry is highly correlated to the confidence index level. </p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017?</h4><p>We are projecting an industry of 243,000 vehicles for 2017, with some upsides that will come in 2H2017 In 2016, the industry end in 253,000  units and the projected 243,000 units for 2017 is a slight reduction despite the negative effects in the consumer caused by corruption scandals and Tax reform, trend. We thought 2016 was going to be similar to previous years, but it was not because the peace deal was not signed in 1Q2016 as we expected. This meant we spent eight months speculating about what was going to happen. Now, the trend has changed and can improve. The level of industry in Colombia is comparatively low, even for this region. The only markets in South America that have a similar or lower index in terms of car consumption per capita are Bolivia and Paraguay; and Argentina, Chile, and Brazil have doubled or tripled the size in terms of their car market. Those markets are at 325,000 units, or 80,000 above us. If you compare the last five years we have dropped 150,000 units, 2017 is a year where the trend is going to change, possibly reaching more than 260,000, which we are planning to recover market share. This is important because GM has been a huge leader in the Colombian market, but there have also been a lot of new entrants. Some 10 years ago there were 30 car brands competing in the market and now there are 70 brands  in Colombia. Chevrolet is holding the number one position with almost 2e% of the market, and we intend to increase that share. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the strategies behind GeoPark's aggressive drilling at a time when exploration investments overall have been down in Colombia?</h4><p>We had a challenging 1Q2016; several activities were conducted in order to mitigate the effects of lower oil prices. In this sense and although we delayed our drilling campaign several months, it was re-started considerably earlier than many companies in oil industry. We were successful at drilling in the Jacana field, with consecutive success in three wells. We also had a workover campaign that increased our production. Consequently, the results we got were moving the boundaries of Jacana fields, extending them into the northwest and helping us achieve the target of increasing our reserves. Of course, we are happy with the results: 100% success rate in the 2016 drilling campaign, which is on the top for benchmarks in the industry. Altogether, these wells are producing approximately 2,000 barrels out of a total 34,000-35,000 bpd that we are currently operating. Therefore, Jacana field is bringing us positive results. Several tests and activities will be developed in this area in order to boost our production for 2017 and coming years.</p><h4>Colombia needs an estimated USD7 billion annually over 10 years to maintain exploration operations and production levels. With a 2016 budget of USD3.5 billion, how can this gap be closed?</h4><p>It will not be closed, at least not in the near future. Exploration levels have certainly fallen and, of course, reserves are getting closer and closer to their limits. Unless there are more incentives for a company to invest in this environment—including social and financial encouragement—then companies will not invest what the country requires to catch up with its needs; however, better late than never. Looking at the results of the seismic studies and the number of wells being drilled, it is unlikely there will be aggressive exploration or that there are enough economic signs from either regulators or the general financial environment for people to risk it and explore. But every company has its moment, and so despite what the rest of the industry is doing, we will continue to move forward.</p><h4>What are some specific regulatory changes that would encourage investment in this field?</h4><p>There are two opportunities right now, the first of which is the tax reform. This could be a game changer for the industry, considering that Colombia's stake is approximately 70%, probably the highest rate in the region. We are aware of the government's income needs, but we trust that equitable solutions are found to encourage the oil industry to continue risking in Colombia. The second opportunity is the new bidding rounds, but the new regulations and the rounds themselves have been announced for months now without much result. Once the final regulatory draft is issued, we will be able to determine our participation. We believe there are still enough opportunities in Colombia for companies of our size to move ahead. </p><h4>What is your outlook for Colombia in regard to its shale and offshore resources?</h4><p>Colombia needs to open new areas to exploration. Exploring the Pacific was an option, but previous rounds were not that successful. Colombia needs more offshore exploration, for which regulations has been successfully enacted. Then there is shale, which only a few companies have committed to explore. There are still regulatory, environmental, and social concerns, but if we want to continue extending the bounds of our self-sufficiency, we need to find an alternative. Shale gas seems a quicker solution than offshore  although it is more expensive and much more controversial. In any case, it will not be economical until the price picks up. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which are the agency's strategies for increasing Colombia's competitiveness in attracting foreign investment in the hydrocarbons sector?</h4><p>In the last decade, our country has implemented clear and strong policies to stimulate foreign investment. Along with the recognition of our legal and political stability and the entrenched democratic traditions that characterize our government and the peace process, these have positioned us as a more competitive country to facilitate business and foreign investors. We have attractive contractual and tax terms as well as a good degree of certainty and legal stability, which are the main determinants for national and foreign investors making investment decisions. These measures gave us international recognition as leaders and pioneers in confronting the fall of oil prices and were confirmed by the president of the World Bank during his visit to Colombia in January 2016. The results of these adjustments are now beginning to show as exploration activity picks back up. The first relates to the social viability of the oil industry. We implemented the Hydrocarbons Territorial Strategy (ETH) with the objective of fostering spaces for dialog with local communities. New methods have been implemented to deal with social unrest and have paved the way for companies to undertake their activities with every actor involved in the production chain. The second is related to environmental licensing. We are working to generate inter-institutional cooperation between the national and regional environmental authorities in order to generate shorter response times and the standardization of procedures and requirements for environmental permits. At the same time, we provide technical support to these authorities to facilitate their understanding of the oil industry. The third has been to improve the process of awarding exploration areas, including the contractual conditions that regulate their development. This focus led to a new regulation issued for the allocation and administration of areas for exploration and production, as well as the adoption of new contractual models adjusted to the current situation of the industry and our country. The fourth focus is to provide more geological information to more precisely identify the hydrocarbon potential of the country. </p><h4>What impact will the tax reform have on the hydrocarbons sector?</h4><p>One of the foundational drivers of the recent tax reform was the decline in tax revenue induced by low oil prices. This led to a substantial reduction in exploration, which consequently lowered the chances of increasing the country's oil reserves. Within the framework of the 2016 structural reform, we presented to the Congress of the Republic a series of measures to encourage the exploration and development of the oil industry. Three such fiscal measures were approved and are in force today. The first is the Certificate of Tax Reimbursement (CERT). It constitutes a tax-saving and refund mechanism for all oil companies that carry out exploratory activities for these specific investments. The second is a VAT refund for all exploratory activities carried out in offshore areas. This measure seeks to benefit offshore investment in consideration of the technical and economic characteristics of this activity, which involves large sums of capital and is more technically and operationally demanding than onshore projects. Allowing early repayment of the VAT allows for a greater cash flow, and beneficiary companies can have that return year after year and in turn reinvest it in more exploratory activity. The third measure is the amortization of investments. After complying with the rules and requirements established in the standard, oil companies may amortize expenses related to investments for exploration, development and construction of mine, oil, and gas fields carried out between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2027, by the straight line method over a five-year term. </p><h4>How does the offshore sector fit into Colombia's long-term hydrocarbon strategy?</h4><p>40 years ago, the great discoveries of gas occurred in our country, which has guaranteed domestic supply. Since 2004, when we signed the first offshore contract, we gave the industry a new dimension. Today, we have 22 contracts signed with companies leading in exploration that have been recognized for their economic and technical strength. ANH welcomes Colombia's new horizon for hydrocarbons, as determined by the recent findings and prospects in the Colombian Caribbean. In recent years, characterized by low prices, the exploration investments developed in this border basin surpasses any other exploratory activity developed in the world. In fact, about 37,000sqkm of seismic activities were carried out in 2016 and approximately 30,000sqkm in 2015. This has had results with the recent findings by Ecopetrol and Anadarko. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[New Incentives]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[new-incentives]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook regarding foreign investments in the hydrocarbon sector? </h4><p>At the beginning of 2017, there was still a negative impact from the collapse in international commodity prices. There has been a strong fall in prices since 2015-2016, which has led to an ongoing investment standby. That being said, prices have stabilized at around USD45-55 per barrel. With prices stabilizing, we will start to see investment programs recovering and regaining traction throughout 2017. The initial calculations from the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP) show that exploration investments are doubling in 2017. The target for this year is 840 million barrels, but we expect that to increase as things recover.</p><h4>What are your ministry's strategies to further incentivize investments in this sector?</h4><p>The tax reform that was approved in December 2016 includes provisions that incentivize new investments. We have an investment instrument that was used in the 1990s for export promotion, the Certificate for Tax Reimbursements (CERT), which  helps with reimbursement for various taxes in cases where a company can prove it is putting delta investments over the minimum commitments in the E&amp;P contract. Basically, we create financial incentives that will improve the breakeven cost of new exploration and additional reserve projects. We are also doing a target incentive for mining to incentivize additional investments there too. This will improve the base of investments, and also hopefully expedite these programs. Another instrument that we have introduced in the tax reform is the reimbursement of VAT for offshore exploration. This is critical, because a new frontier offshore project in the Caribbean has long-term periods of exploratory phases, with nine-year averages. Companies will now be able to get reimbursed for VAT the first year after investment, which translates into 10 years if the project is on time. The financial cost of a 19% VAT over 10 years is huge. Hence, as long as a company keeps money flowing into the investment program, it can be reimbursed in the first year following the investment. We also introduced incentives for renewables, which will be significant in the coming years, given the huge opportunity in the market for incorporating new renewable technologies into the energy matrix.</p><h4>What impact do you expect these measures to have on investments?</h4><p>The first calculations the ACP did in oil exploration show that we could double our investment from USD1.5 billion per annum to more than USD3.3 billion from 2016 into 2017. Once the incentives come into effect, we will start seeing results as soon as 2018. The Colombian Mining Association also estimated investments of up to USD7.5 billion over the next five years, which is 10 times the annual average. Therefore, we expect a significant recovery of investments in oil and mining, and a great deal of new resources coming into the energy market through new renewable investments.</p><h4>What role must the energy and mining sectors play in the post-conflict era?</h4><p>The aim is to be able to access these regions and do the studies and geophysical tests to determine what is out there. The peace agreement will now allow us to be able to do this. The energy sector will indeed be important in terms of economically opening these regions up and integrating them into the national grid. After five decades of internal conflicts and civil war, the post-conflict peace process necessitates a different way in which companies, governments, and territories relate and talk to one another. We will have to learn new ways to communicate and work together. It will take time; however, we need new ways of relating to each other to implement and construct a lasting and sustainable peace. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was U Energy established?</h4><p>U Energy was established in September 2011, with its first branch at the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC). The idea behind U Energy was to create a boutique health club with a philosophy committed to continuous improvement through knowledge and innovation. With a trusted team of expert trainers, U Energy offers its clients a unique experience through personalized training, state-of-the-art equipment, and effective, interactive classes in a focused environment conducive for a healthy, energetic, and comfortable workout.</p><h4>What are the highlights of the Go by U Energy concept?</h4><p>Go by U Energy was created as a fitness studio by making fitness easy in a more convenient and intimate workout experience with tailored classes and dedicated personal training.</p><h4>Currently, U Energy is well positioned with several branches in Beirut. What are your further expansion plans?</h4><p>At the moment we have three U Energy branches: Bliss, Downtown, Hazmieh and two “Go by U Energy" branches: Adma and Gemmazyeh. Our future expansion plans are to have three more locations in Lebanon. We will also introduce a third brand as a new concept next year.</p><h4>What are the main foundations of U Energy?</h4><p>U Energy is built on three main foundations. First, the science: our sports science department is the governing body responsible for providing the best quality of service ever experienced through continuous research and schooling to the trainers. Second, the system: our training program is uniquely structured and divided into four cycles. The system will keep members running and motivated, and is also scientifically validated as being the highway for your ultimate goals. We prescribe, document, and track data with our system, distinguishing us on an international level. The third foundation is the community: U Energy is more of a family than a company, where members are involved in everything we do, such as monthly outings, outdoor activities, boot camps, parties, and yearly events.</p><h4>What makes U Energy stands out from other fitness centers in Lebanon?</h4><p>U Energy is the place to come to when you want to feel good about yourself, your health, your body, and your mind. We are all dedicated to working on our guests' energy and to form simple habits that will make people feel good and challenge their personal status. The quality of our services and our continuous improvement through innovation and knowledge make U Energy stand out from the rest of the fitness centers in Lebanon. The main services we provide are, personal mentors. Choosing the personal mentor service means members have a fitness mentor watching their back. The mentor will first assess their goals, needs, and capacities. Thereafter, members will be prescribed a personalized exercise program. According to the assessment result, you mentors will then follow up and update members' programs after a post-training evaluation. We also offer personal training. Members donate their bodies to science; this is the only term to describe our personal training service. It is the safest highway to your ultimate goals. A personal trainer will guide members closely in every step they take. The training program is uniquely structured and divided into four advanced cycles. Our systematic approach in personal training will keep people motivated without a ceiling to what is aimed for. Finally we offer group fitness. Our classes are built and structured in-house. The structure of each class is based on scientific studies and years of experience. The variety of our classes provides guests with a great balance to reach their optimal shape and fitness level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[ULACIT students can choose to take 50% of their studies overseas]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[silvia-castro-rector-ulacit]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of ULACIT?</h4><p>ULACIT began to operate in 1987. It grew out of a technical school that was established in 1936, four years before the first public university was founded in Costa Rica. This is a proprietary institution, founded with the objective of offering science, technology, and other programs. ULACIT was the third private university founded in the country; comparatively, we are an established institution in Costa Rica, although internationally we could be considered a young university. Our mission is to educate and prepare leaders to serve the world. There are three key operative words in that mission statement: “leaders," “service," and “world." We are not a university for everyone, but seek to attract the best performing students in the country. We seek to create and prepare leaders for business and public life. We have a high focus on activism and serving the community, and our teaching model encompasses that concept of service.  That is why we have been ranked the best private university in Central America for six years in a row.</p><h4>How do you prepare leaders for the challenges they have to face in the world?</h4><p>The first step is to recruit and select leaders. We visit every town in the country and ask community leaders if they know people with the skillsets we seek. We search every corner to scout for talent. People come up to us and we analyze the credentials, test their leadership abilities, and interview them to assess their talents. We recruit full 100% scholarships, a free ride for the entire program, and we do that with 100 students a year. This allows us to select the best of the best in the country. These are not just students with high academic standing but also students with musical, sports, art, or other talents, and also a strong leadership orientation, a history of activism, and a spirit of service to their respective communities. Those are the key qualities we look for. We also seek to engage a diverse range of students of different ages, ethnicities, political and religious affiliations, socioeconomic backgrounds, sexual orientations, and abilities. We build a special community where people can come and learn from those who excel in many different fields. They not only learn about leadership from those with leadership experience and interests, but also come here to become leaders for the global world by being exposed to a rich, diverse, and multicultural environment. In that interaction, we provide a unique learning environment. We don't just teach about leadership; we encourage students to exert their leadership abilities in real life.</p><h4>What programs do you offer?</h4><p>We have programs in three basic areas: engineering and design, social sciences, and business and economics. We are expanding in engineering and design, which the world is moving toward. We are not known just for the variety of programs we offer; we are known for the way we teach. We use project-based learning methodologies. We do not use exams like traditional universities do. It is project-based learning founded on inquiry, research, problems, and service, based on the Teaching for Understanding (TfU) framework developed by Harvard's Project Zero. We tropicalized that teaching model to ULACIT. We have an Americanized curriculum, with aspects like Freshman Seminar, First-Year Experience, and Gen-Ed (general studies, or liberal arts). We are the only university in Costa Rica that incorporates a liberal arts curriculum as understood in the US. That means we include 14 courses—28% of the curriculum—that are general studies, and students have to learn how to reason verbally, quantitatively, morally, and aesthetically. Hence, it is a strong program based on developing reasoning skills. All students have to learn about entrepreneurship as well, regardless of their field of interest.</p><h4>What is the importance of internationalization for ULACIT?</h4><p>Internationalization is important to us. Our students can decide to take 50% of their learning requirements abroad. They can decide to do that by paying local tuition at ULACIT and taking courses at partner institutions outside of the country. That is a huge advantage for students who cannot pay USD3,000 per credit; they can study in 30 different countries. We facilitate those exchanges through our Global Education Office (GEO). Furthermore, we are the only Costa Rican institution that is a member of the National Student Affairs Association in the US. Beyond academic studies, we also have other support services to help students get the best results they can in terms of finding jobs and getting started on their careers as well, just as other American universities do.</p><h4>How would you rate the current situation and level of education in Costa Rica, and how ready Costa Ricans for competing internationally? </h4><p>Our points of reference are developed countries such as those in Scandinavia, and there are still challenges that need to be resolved. There are also strengths that we are known for in the region. One of those strengths is the level of English proficiency of the population, much higher than many other countries in the region. In addition, Costa Ricans are more reasonable in the sense that they are better at thinking through their decisions and being more systematic about their thought processes; that is due to the better skill set they bring from primary and secondary education, which is of higher quality than in other neighboring countries. In terms of challenges, we are not graduating as many students as we should from our high schools. This is an issue that the government is addressing. From my perspective, our students reflect more soft skills than I have seen in other countries in the region, and the areas of opportunity that need to be further developed are quantitative skills, such as statistics and mathematics. Their knowledge in those fields is still lagging.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for ULACIT in the coming five years?</h4><p>We just released our five-year plan, and our big priority is internationalizing the institution, in terms of teaching, research, extension, and social responsibility. We want to keep offering services and programs that are not offered in the country or the region. We want to also stay innovative in the delivery of education, in which we are currently ranked number one in the country through our project-based learning model, which is contextualized and applied to our particular context.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the role of the Public Transport Authority in Saudi Arabia's rapidly evolving transport sector?</h4><p>The Public Transport Authority was established in 2012. At the time it was formed it was only responsible for managing public transport, meaning mass transit and transporting people. Last year in March there was a decision to merge the Public Transport Authority with the Railway Commission, a move that significantly expanded the agency's portfolio. The goal was to merge these two entities plus move the regulation of transport goods and marine regulation from the Ministry of Transport to this authority. You can see from that change that this is a significant shift within the sector, and one that conforms with other government restructurings to provide more independence and a clearer structure. The Public Transport Authority is responsible for regulating three sectors: railway, land transport, and maritime transport. It is totally independent. The authority does not own or operate projects; it just regulates. I was appointed President at the end of October last year. At the start we revisited our structure and started recruiting and building the team to regulate. Our aim is to have a solid, well-regulated industry that is inviting for local and foreign investment. We are after a few things; we need to make sure the service provided is safe, well priced, and high quality. To achieve these goals and targets we have started to make a few changes. A few key things are Saudization and localization—not only localized in terms of labor but also localized in terms of the industry itself. We are importing many cars and need to make sure we are at least manufacturing the spare parts.</p><h4>What key regulations and changes indicate your new direction?</h4><p>It is no secret that if we do not have a regulated industry we will be doomed to end up with a mess. In Saudi Arabia, there are more than 1 million trucks and unless we regulate this fleet we will face problems. A government company has developed a platform for us called Wassal, meaning connecting point A to B. The role of this platform is to bring in licensed service providers to one stage. This platform will centralize the weight of the truck, the hours the driver has driven, and his record, and will include dispatchers and other stakeholders in the sector. With that technological leap we can solve many problems at once. With this we will be able to improve the service and reduce accidents. In addition, we have been regulating and working with a company called Takum, a government company under the Ministry of the Interior. It is in charge of fining and enforcing all transport laws. We are assisting it on the ground to ensure that the taxi drivers are licensed and that taxis have the right safety equipment. Our role in maritime is making sure everyone is following international agreements and adhering to them for safety, environmental, and other regulatory requirements. When it comes to railway, a lot is happening.</p><h4>What is the future of the Saudi land bridge project?</h4><p>Part of the Vision 2030 is for Saudi Arabia to become an international logistics hub. Saudi Arabia is a large country, the size of half of Western Europe. We need to have proper ports that can accommodate the expansion. The ports that we need to develop most are on the Red Sea. Approximately one-third of the world's traffic moves through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal. The land bridge is a key part of the success of our ports. It will be freight oriented. We have finalized the environment and which ports it will be connected to. We will tender it to the private sector.</p><h4>The Haramain-High Speed Rail project is on track to begin limited operations later this year. Will it be profitable to operate in the medium term?</h4><p>The goal is that this project is sustainable so the ticket price is not decided yet. We need to have reasonable prices for people to be able to afford and use it but also to make sure we are profitable and managing costs. We are studying the tariff and the costs of all the trips between destinations. This project will be able to pay for itself with the tickets and the real estate around it.</p><h4>What are the major things you hope to accomplish in 2017?</h4><p>I think 2017 is the year when we want to make sure we have commercially committed partners, not hit and run investors. The goal for the end of 2017 is to identify the proper industry players. We will support the committed ones. When it comes to safety we will be addressing many key issues on barriers and other issues that make our roads some of the most deadly. In 2017 we need to make sure we improve the safety of our transportation. Of course, we also need to make sure that we are providing enough job opportunities to Saudis. We have already started by requiring service providers such as Uber and Careem drivers to be Saudi. This country is young and many Saudis are looking for jobs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Major rating agencies have reaffirmed positive outlook for Colombia in 2017]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mauricio-cardenas-santamaria-minister-finance-and-public-credit]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Colombia is entering the first year of the post-conflict era. What impact does the ministry see the peace deal having on Colombia's GDP and the overall economy?</h4><p>The end of FARC as an armed group will boost long-term economic growth. It will reduce the destruction of physical and human capital, enhance confidence, increase productivity, and facilitate social cohesion, among other factors. In addition, honoring the agreement requires investment that will be concentrated on rural development and in regions where capital is scarce, generating economic returns. According to our calculations, which only take into account the fraction of total investments required that can be financed by the National Budget, those two factors would result in an aggregate benefit on economic growth of 0.35pps per year between 2017 and 2031. The cumulative effect of peace due to these two factors could imply, by 2030, a GDP 5.3pps higher than the one resulting from a scenario in which FARC continues to operate as an illegal armed group. One of the most important and positive effects of the agreement is that it will generate a regional convergence process. In fact, estimates show that the regions most affected by the conflict—most of which are also the poorest—will have an economic benefit three times greater than the one expected for the country as a whole. This is the case of regions such as Arauca, Vaupés, Caquetá, Meta, and Guaviare. Estimates indicate that the economic sectors that could benefit the most from the peace agreement are agriculture (1.5pps per year on average over the next 15 years), construction (1.2pps), and civil projects (0.5pps).</p><h4>How concerned are you regarding the protectionist rhetoric coming from the administration in the US? How prepared is Colombia for such potential external shocks?</h4><p>The US is Colombia's largest trading partner. Both countries have built a strong, longstanding relationship based on mutual respect, cooperation, and common goals. US support of Colombia as an ally has been bipartisan, which is why, regardless of the party in office, we expect Colombia and the US to continue having a close and productive relationship. The recent meeting between President Santos and President Trump is a clear indication of this. In this context, the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, which entered into force in May 2012, aims to improve the investment environment, reducing tariffs and other barriers to exports, expanding trade, and promoting economic growth in both countries. Recently, the US government expressed its will to renegotiate some trade agreements with economies in which the US presents a deficit in the trade balance. The latter is not the Colombian case; hence, we do not expect modifications in the existing agreement.</p><h4>What does the ministry view as the primary successes of the tax reform implemented earlier this year?</h4><p>The tax reform was a substantial effort to modernize the Colombian tax system. The goal was to make the system simpler, more competitive, and improve equality. We accomplished these three objectives. The bill approved by Congress in December 2016 is a comprehensive overhaul of the Colombian tax structure with a long-run perspective, focusing on competitiveness and on effectively controlling tax evasion. Thanks to the reform, tax returns are now simpler, which substantially reduced compliance costs and fully incorporated international accounting rules. In addition, the reform promotes competitiveness by reducing corporate income tax rates and eliminating the wealth tax in an effort to keep increasing formal employment, promote private investment, and boost the economy. Finally, the reform focuses on making the tax system more progressive, making sure that those who earn more pay more, protecting the purchasing power of vulnerable families and providing a level playing field for taxpayers. The approval of the reform reduced uncertainty and enhanced confidence. In fact, all three major rating agencies Fitch, Moody's, and S&amp;P have reaffirmed Colombia's rating two notches above investment grade (BBB), and during the first semester of 2017 Fitch returned its outlook of the country's debt ratio to stable. The government is now focusing on several key pillars for long-term economic growth: implementation of the peace agreement; execution of the 4G infrastructure investment plan; allocating more resources to education; and continuing with fiscal consolidation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is GM Colombia addressing the needs of the local market?</h4><p>Times change and there is a lot of movement in the industry, especially in regard to customers' needs. In response, 13 years ago we established that connectivity is an important step in the vehicles evolution. We launched Chevystar, which is based on the concept of safety. We launched five or six versions of the product and to celebrate our 60th anniversary in 2016 we took the opportunity to launch our eighth generation of Chevystar. The key difference with this latest version is the state-of-the-art hardware that allows us to read the information from all the computers in the car. The data is transmitted through the internet to our centers; therefore, we continuously monitor and understand what is going on with the car's performance. We analyze the vehicle's data using various algorithms. When a critical issue arises, we send that information to the customer through an app that enables the customer to set up an appointment at any of our Chevrolet assistance centers in Colombia. The system also allows the client to run the tests on their car to check if it is working  well. Therefore, we are staying ahead of the trend when it comes to the internet of things. This is a major forward step for our 60th anniversary legacy.</p><h4>How do you see the uncertainty factor of 2016 carrying over to 2017?</h4><p>We were forecasting an industry slightly better than 2016 (260,000 vs 253,000 in 2016) supported in the fact of a better and more stable macroeconomic background (controlled inflation, a flat COP vs USD rate, and peace agreement consolidation); however, the year didn't begin as expected, the tax reform along with other factors, had a negative effect in the consumer confidence with historical low levels in January at -30.2. Today, we are still below the 2016 confidence levels; however, we see a positive trend and expect the second half of the year to grow at a better pace.</p><h4>How do you see the upcoming tax reforms impacting the automotive sector?</h4><p>The main consequence of the tax reform for us was the VAT change from 16% to 19%, it had an immediate impact on all vehicle prices and an enormous impact on the consumers (confidence index moved from -10.7 in Dec to -30.2 in January). The auto industry is highly correlated to the confidence index level.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017?</h4><p>We are projecting an industry of 243,000 vehicles for 2017, with some upsides that will come in 2H2017 In 2016, the industry end in 253,000 units and the projected 243,000 units for 2017 is a slight reduction despite the negative effects in the consumer caused by corruption scandals and Tax reform, trend. We thought 2016 was going to be similar to previous years, but it was not because the peace deal was not signed in 1Q2016 as we expected. This meant we spent eight months speculating about what was going to happen. Now, the trend has changed and can improve. The level of industry in Colombia is comparatively low, even for this region. The only markets in South America that have a similar or lower index in terms of car consumption per capita are Bolivia and Paraguay; and Argentina, Chile, and Brazil have doubled or tripled the size in terms of their car market. Those markets are at 325,000 units, or 80,000 above us. If you compare the last five years we have dropped 150,000 units, 2017 is a year where the trend is going to change, possibly reaching more than 260,000, which we are planning to recover market share. This is important because GM has been a huge leader in the Colombian market, but there have also been a lot of new entrants. Some 10 years ago there were 30 car brands competing in the market and now there are 70 brands in Colombia. Chevrolet is holding the number one position with almost 2e% of the market, and we intend to increase that share.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do JLT Re's s9trengths fit the needs of the local market?</h4><p>It is in our DNA to understand our clients and their needs, no matter what. Based on this knowledge, we propose effective solutions and offer our biggest asset—expertise. Years ago, JLT understood how important local markets were; but above all, we knew the importance of understanding different kinds of scenarios and how to offer clients tailor-made solutions to meet them. This is why specialty solutions became our main pillar of action. We are not a jack-of-all-trades and master-of-none type of company. Rather, we are specialists in power, oil and gas, financial lines, insurance, property, government, business, marine, and aviation. </p><h4>Which sectors are particularly interesting for JLT Re going forward?</h4><p>There is clear growth in the oil and gas sector, which produces 13% of Colombia's GDP. There are also great opportunities in property associated with goods manufacturing. We have captured that space in the past and would like to continue doing so. We have also been more intensively present in the oil and gas sector since my arrival. As a client-first organization, we like to understand clients' needs. Our clients are insurers who are the first channel of distribution for our services. Therefore, we promote ourselves to key insurers in the Colombian market, an approach I introduced to our firm. Global insurance market conditions are also difficult right now; it is a great buyers' market. As an intermediary, if rates come down JLT is also affected. However, it is good for our clients, so all in all we look at it positively. JLT is a powerhouse globally in marine, but in Colombia we only had a small slice of the market share and are trying to expand that. Today, JLT is by far the leading reinsurance broker in the Colombian market. </p><h4>What is the importance of the Colombian market for the group's regional strategy?</h4><p>JLT believes that all markets are important, which, with their particularities, advantages, and opportunities, gives us the opportunity to learn, innovate, and offer our best as a company. That is why in 2004 JLT started its operations in Latin America. Prior to that, the company had a small operation in Brazil before deciding to invest in Latin America by acquiring Heath Lambert. JLT initially invested in Colombia, Peru, and Mexico before going elsewhere in Latin America. </p><h4>Will other foreign players enter the Colombian insurance market?</h4><p>On a global scale, investors are entering the insurance sector, which means traditional insurers willing to do mergers and acquisitions or private equity funds. In Latin America, a Canadian fund, Fairfax, recently acquired AIG's operations in the region. What is more, Latin American player SURA acquired RSA's operations. There was also the recent merger of Chubb and ACE, which happened on a global scale but had an impact in Latin America. We thus see more capacity entering the Latin American region in the form of new players and dynamics. In the Colombian market, all the major insurers and re-insurers are already present. This gives an idea of the global insurance and reinsurance sector's commitment to Latin America. For JLT, Colombia carries a great deal of weight in terms of the overall revenues the company generates. </p><h4>What are your priorities for 2017?</h4><p>Our clients. Servicing our clients is fundamental to the success of this business. A second and equal priority for us is to continue adding value to our entire client approach. The main goal of JLT is always to be far beyond just transactional servicing, but helping clients understand and better map their risks, and bring them new solutions. Therefore, the expansion of the scope of services we provide our clients is one of our priorities. Thirdly, helping our clients maximize their opportunities in the current soft market is important. We want to help them get the best deal from the existing market conditions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the current rate of private pension penetration in Colombia? What are your strategies for improving the penetration level?</h4><p>The Colombian population is around 48 million; however, only a little more than 8 million regularly contribute to any form of pension fund. The main issue keeping people from contributing is the informal economy. This is not pension reform; it is labor reform. Two important laws regarding the reduction of taxes for payrolls have been introduced, and we are excited by the impact they might have. Tax reform is key in ensuring that SMEs thrive and do their part to strengthen the formal economy. In terms of market education, we launched a campaign called Familia Porvenir, an initiative based on digital technologies in which we wanted to explain to Colombians how pension funds work and how they benefit their future. The family proved to be a great model for explaining this, because every member has a different set of topics and priorities regarding pension funds that relates to each segment of our clients. We developed a robust digital strategy along with a website that explored pension funds through this kind of narrative, always in a simple and entertaining language. This effectively engaged an audience that is otherwise rather difficult to reach, and it was met with a great deal of success. It was a groundbreaking strategy for a financial services firm in Colombia. </p><h4>What is your short-term outlook for Colombia's economic situation and its impact on private pension funds? </h4><p>We have achieved high returns on capital for our affiliates over the last year. In the first quarter of 2017 Porvenir's largest Mandatory Pension Fund yielded an effective annual rate of 14.57%, and the industry also had a good performance (13.67%). The markets are responding well, but there is always the potential for changes. However, up to now things have been great. The US economy has also been growing quite well, and the equity markets are reaching new heights. Within the pension fund industry, there is an important variable that will determine the bulk of the sector's development, and that is informality. Informality is improving, and we are in a wait and see mode to determine if informality will stabilize at current levels or if it will display more volatility. The Colombian government has introduced a new fiscal stimulus, and we have to wait to see how it affects the economy. </p><h4>What opportunities do the 4G projects present for pension funds? What role do pension funds need to play in financing these projects?</h4><p>Pension funds are investing money in these projects, but the projects also need international financing. We are investing only around 1% of all our assets under management to 4G projects, which is quite low though the legal limit is 5%. We have compromised in recent commitments, and we currently have two projects worth around USD200 million. </p><h4>With four current players in the market, what opportunities are there for additional private pension companies in Colombia?</h4><p>This industry needs economies of scale, so you need huge volume. The complexity of the business is high and we have a huge responsibility, so some of the small funds struggle to produce strong numbers that reflect ours. As a larger firm, we can create efficiencies that translate into higher returns. We have a huge responsibility, and every market participant has to be solid. In order to achieve the size necessary to produce the best returns, a large amount of investment is needed. The break-even point for a new pension fund is four or five years. We certainly welcome increased competition, but are somewhat unique because the public pension funds system operates simultaneously. </p><h4>What are your targets and priorities for this year?</h4><p>We are looking to digitize our operations. All our customer interactions will be handled through a digital interface. This will be a more efficient and effective system. In four years, we want to have 95% of our transactions completed digitally. This is a huge investment in process. Customers demand innovation, and we need to be able to respond by providing a new platform. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-most-virtuous-cycle]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>BVC saw a 25% increase in trade volumes in YoY terms to January 2017. What was behind this?</h4><p>2016 was a transitional year for the financial market. In a positive way, a few of the uncertainties regarding financial investments in Colombia were resolved last year. This has led to more liquidity and better asset prices through the end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017. Even though the economic growth of the country was not particularly stellar last year from an investor point of view, it was still a turnaround year, which  makes 2017 positive in terms of investment prospects. Things like the tax reform and the peace process have been resolved, which puts an end to many of the uncertainties and apprehension for investors. We are on the right track and looking positive for 2017. </p><h4>What is your outlook on how the tax reform will impact the economy this year? </h4><p>The private sector would always like to see more reductions, of course, but the tax reform will make substantial progress in creating a path for reductions in the tax rate for corporations. An important point has been the elimination of the net worth tax for corporations, which was a considerable burden on corporations. This is the last year of that tax at a subdued rate. That is a positive signal for companies and will positively impact investment decisions. In 2018, the tax rate will come down overall, reaching 33%, which is reasonably competitive for a country like Colombia. A deduction in the VAT on the purchase of capital goods has been introduced as well, which is also a positive, lowering the cost of investment. </p><h4>How attractive is Colombia to foreign investors compared to other regional markets?</h4><p>Colombia has been doing an excellent job of differentiating itself and coming back from a relatively hidden position, so to speak. Today, foreign investors represent 25% of the volume traded on the exchange, whereas they were nonexistent eight years ago. Similarly, in the fixed-income market, and especially in government bonds, more than 30% of the stock is today in the hands of foreign investors, which was not the case five years ago, when it was merely 2%. </p><h4>What contribution can capital markets have on financing the 4G infrastructure plan?</h4><p>This is another positive development resulting from the more secure and stable environment in the country. The 4G projects will also make peace more sustainable by creating better roads and transport infrastructure throughout the country, integrating regions that have been marginalized for years, and decreasing the cost of accessing markets. As for the role of capital markets thus far, it has been rather small, and there is clearly room for more involvement. There will be a learning process, and that takes time; however, with global regulations that are bringing about more stringent rules and greater capital requirements for banks, we will see a greater need and involvement from the capital markets to make up for that. Once the first phase of investment is finalized, it will allow for a refinancing process that can easily be done in the capital markets. It has a long process, but for the coming five to 10 years the potential is there. In any case, we need to attract international investors. </p><h4>How protected will Colombia be from external shocks in the coming years?</h4><p>A small economy like ours will always be affected by international events and movements. With the decline in the price of oil, it has become apparent that Colombia cannot be that dependent on commodities. In that sense, Colombia must be the master of its own destiny. With the right processes and strategies in place, we can become a high middle-income country. Former president Uribe's greatest contribution to the country has been to create nation-wide security, which means that we can once again make long-term goals for the country. The economic effects are embedded in the improvement of security, and the political aspect is also important, which is why the peace process has been crucial. The task now is to make the country more efficient and competitive, to draw in foreign investors, to improve the transport and logistics infrastructure, reduce the costs of transportation in the country, and integrate economic areas, among others. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Bancolombia's strategy for implementing further technology in the Colombian market? </h4><p>My last responsibility for Bancolombia was as head of innovation. Therefore, I am aware of what is going on in terms of innovation and developments in the financial sector around the world. The financial sector is changing rapidly, but not just because of technology. People are also simply changing their behavior and their relationship with financial institutions. In the case of Bancolombia, we have been working on different ways of seeing our business, and this transformation to become digital has to be aggressive. </p><h4>Do you have any innovations in the pipeline for 2017?</h4><p>We have several projects, one of which is our digital bank, which we have been working on for the past 18 months and for which a beta version is already on the market. It is really a new way of doing business. It is separate technology and business model; therefore, we see it as a laboratory in which we test concepts before going to the market and incorporating what we have learned in the process. We call it “Nequi by Bancolombia,“ a separate bank. It is a bank that is all digital and mobile with no branches and is a new concept we are introducing. We are learning a great deal from our customers, which we will then incorporate. It has been a great experience; this is innovation. </p><h4>How does Bancolombia's “Human Banking“ concept translate into actual banking policies?</h4><p>We do more than live this concept—it is the foundation of how we conceive of banking: innovation and customer service that are based upon people. This means the responsible design and sale of products that people actually need—which are also the hallmarks of a sustainable institution. </p><h4>What effect is tax reform having on the banking sector?</h4><p>The tax reform project is now public, and its central elements from what we know are good. In general, the reform is intended to promote investment and reduce the tax burden on corporations, which is good. In Colombia, it is not just the rates, but the complexity of the tax code that has hindered investment previosuly.</p><h4>How is the sector responding  post peace deal?</h4><p>It will be positive for the Colombian economy. Because of the conflict, many regions in Colombia have not been a part of the economic development that the country has had in the past 15 years. Peace will allow economic actors to enter previously untouched markets, many of which the government has also been absent from. </p><h4>What are your strategies for expanding the bank's international presence?</h4><p>We have a presence in three other major markets after Colombia: Panama, El Salvador, and Guatemala. We are not planning any additional acquisitions, but do want to consolidate these operations. Our operations in Colombia are large and continue to grow as we bring new products and services into the market. We are also bringing our experience, products, and business ethic in Colombia to our markets in Panama, El Salvador, and Guatemala. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the bank and the Colombian economy in 2017?</h4><p>We see 2017 as a transition year. Growth forecasts are slightly higher than in 2016, though they will still be below our potential growth rate. As such, it will also bring opportunities for us banks and the economy in general. Infrastructure will also start to play a bigger role in 2017, as will exports. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Schneider Electric contributing to the digital transformation of Colombia's industrial sector?</h4><p>Schneider Electric is the global specialist in energy management and automation. A large part of this is done through our digitalization platform, EcoStruxure. People need to connect their devices, as the world has 21 billion devices connected and the number is only increasing. Approximately 5% of our global sales are related to R&amp;D, where we work in digitalization and the decarbonizing industry. One of those areas is connected products. How can we connect and bring information to users? How can we manage this information and these applications and industries with this process? And most importantly, how can I use the data and provide services in a digital way? Schneider Electric invests a lot in soft systems to collaborate with customers to increase the efficiency on that analytic base. </p><h4>How does Colombia's industrial digital transformation process compare to other countries in the region?</h4><p>Colombia is a country that has quickly adopted certain technologies, such as 4G, telecom, data center applications, free internet access, and mobile penetration. However, on the other hand when you go to industry we see a little bit of a lack of digital connections. On my network with key entrepreneurs, we are seeing that this is a concern, and people are looking to understand how they can invest more. There are some companies starting this journey of investment, collaborating with Schneider Electric to go on this digitalization journey. This can be seen in utilities, applications for oil and gas, and in buildings where we are looking to have more sustainable and green infrastructures. The standards are being pushed to ensure that companies can be more sustainable in their building management. Data centers are in various tiers, and there are innovations related to cyber security. </p><h4>How does the market go from understanding the importance of digitalization to actually investing in it?</h4><p>I love this country; however, its history has created a culture that does not take risks.This is why we can go in the right direction if the culture can be changed. Foreigners are the ones with whom we can collaborate to do this. In fact, Brazil had to go through a similar transition, but Colombia has an advantage: 65% of students here finish university, compared to only 20% in Brazil. The second difference is the gender balance. I work at engineering sites, which are generally not known for having a good gender balance, but here at Schneider Electric Colombia, 40% of our employees are women and this diversity contributes a lot to innovation. I love to work in a gender-balanced environment, and in Colombia, Schneider Electric promotes equality between men and women. Our CEO understands that gender diversity makes the difference between companies; therefore, we are moving in this direction, making Schneider Electric Colombia an important example for the region.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the remainder of the year for Schneider Electric?<br></h4><p>I hope the second half will be better. The first had a huge impact for several reasons. First were the tax increases because of the decrease in oil and gas prices; the impact on the market has been greater than expected. This has decelerated the economy. The second issue is the corruption that is endemic to Latin America. This started in Brazil, and our country was affected, but I am glad to see that there are efforts to fix this going on and that business is becoming more ethical; Schneider Electric is leading companies in terms of ethical responsibility. Third is the global environment. The economy is a little on edge right now, and issues such as terrorism are bringing uncertainty. This can be improved because we have elections in 2018, which is usually good for the economy in Colombia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[credit-for-one-and-all]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Banco Agrario de Colombia transitioning toward becoming a development bank? </h4><p>Banco Agrario de Colombia is a unique bank because we offer atypical services focused on the agriculture sector. We are also a public bank with specific clients. We realized there was something missing in rural financing when private banks were not able to give credit to rural people because of high risks and costs. We supply this financing. The bank is a sustainable bank, which it has to be in order to survive. But we also do this in order to follow a public policy. It is important to be a part of the development of the whole country. We are the most widely disseminated bank—with 750 branches in 728 municipalities—and in 454 of those municipalities we are the only existing bank. We have an important goal, which is to pay attention to the client while remaining profitable. We are not getting any financing from the state but are producing wealth for the whole country. Agriculture is one of the biggest sectors in Colombia and has a great deal of potential. The Colombian conflict was born of land distribution problems. Like in much of the world, large populations are migrating from the countryside to the cities; however, the actual wealth of the country, especially in Colombia, is in rural areas where there are a large amount of hydrocarbons and minerals. At the same time, there is a contradiction in that the highest poverty rates are in rural areas. It is important for us to analyze this, especially in the post-conflict era, where Banco Agrario de Colombia will take a leading role. </p><h4>What role must Banco Agrario play to ensure a successful post-conflict economy?</h4><p>An important step in this process will be focusing on much more social inclusion, not only because we want to give them access to credit for a better life, but also because giving access to credit for the rural population will help the development of the entire country. We irrigate money to rural areas in order to develop not only agriculture but also energy production and hydropower. One of the main ways of implementing this transformation is having a new model of attention and relationship with the client. The goal is not only to sell a financial product to the client, but enable the client to use this product to develop their lives and that of the country. The second most important issue is being closer to clients and farmers. We are the second-most widespread state entity in the country after the military and police. We plan to open new 130 branches, 95 of which are part of the “Banco Agrario Closer" model. </p><h4>What are some of your strategies for becoming even closer to your clients?</h4><p>In order to be more efficient, especially in giving credit, we want to decentralize and delegate these decisions to the regional level so people can more readily access them. The issue of technological modernization is also key; mobility means that people will go into the field using technology to make credit accessible to these people. Therefore, the volume of credit and financing the bank is taking care of is critical. In this line, we are developing a new application that can be used not only on smartphones but with any kind of phone. Another goal is to make our products relevant to local areas. This is why we are working to strengthen municipalities and local governments, providing credit for tertiary roads, energy, water resource management, logistics, market places, irrigation and collection centers, among other projects. </p><h4>What opportunities are there for foreign investment in Colombia's agricultural sector and rural areas?</h4><p>They play an important role. Foreign investment is incredibly important but a great deal still has to be done. Colombia has huge potential for agricultural business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[les-bons-comptes-des-bons-amis]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your priorities for the Central Bank and what legacy would you like to leave?</h4><p>Priorities are the same at every central bank in the world: to keep inflation low, the economy close to its potential GDP, and to avoid crises. Financial and real shocks permanently hit our economies in Latin America. Additionally, and due to peculiar historic reasons, Colombia is the only country in the world where the central bank is in charge of many cultural activities like libraries and museums. Paradoxically, this protects our monetary policy role since the country loves what the central bank does in this area. </p><h4>What is your strategy for reaching inflation targets whilst lowering interest rates to promote growth?</h4><p>Colombia is again a special country in this area. We did not suffer from hyperinflation during the 1980s, similar to Peru, Brazil, or Bolivia, but inflation was close to 25% for more than 20 years during the 1970s and 1980s. This likely means the reduction of inflation to 3% (our long-term goal) was costly. This produces inflation inertia, and changes long-term expectations even when shocks are transitory. Our strategy, then, like any other central bank under inflation targeting, is to float the exchange rate, use short-term interest rates to keep the economy growing under stable inflation, and avoid bubbles, which is not an easy task. Some temporary shocks (food prices and exchange rate devaluations) have recently hit the economy and expectations have increased much less than observed inflation, but communications will be essential to explain to Colombians that shocks are transitory as inflation returns to acceptable levels. </p><h4>Is your macroeconomic outlook more positive for 2017?</h4><p>The year 2017 will be better than 2016; however, we still have to make great efforts to reduce inflation and improve economic growth. Every projection says that inflation will be within the 2-4% range at the end of the year or, if not, during the first half of 2018. This is important since inflation was higher than our 2-4% range during the last two years. Economic growth was close to 2% during 2016 and will probably be higher in 2017. Oil prices increased, and the uncertainty produced by the tax reform (already approved) and peace negotiations (already signed) will not hit the economy this year. We also believe a peace dividend will bring economic benefits in the following years, mainly in areas such as tourism, trade, rural development, and foreign investment. Industry and agriculture will benefit from the recent large devaluation of the exchange rate. But growth rates close to 2% are not enough, and Colombia has to regain the growth rates of 4-4.5% reached in the last 15 years. We have to save more, something related to fiscal surpluses and the pension system, and we have to open a closed economy. In addition to tariff reforms, we also need to modernize agriculture. </p><h4>If there are cash flow issues, how well protected is Colombia compared to other countries in the region?</h4><p>Shocks are always an important reason to be worried in Colombia and Latin America, but I do not see important unbalances at this moment. Colombia has always had good macroeconomic management. We have a flexible exchange rate, which eases the adjustment of the whole economy to shocks, and the deficit of the current account moved from 6.5% of GDP last year to less than 3.5% (which is still high). Foreigners own close to 35% of some parts of the domestic TES market, another reason to keep our economy in good shape. Many banks are involved in the construction of roads; we just hope the Odebrecht news does not adversely affect road construction, though corrupt people should be imprisoned. People say banks standards are great, and we are trying to move slowly to Basel III. We are not there yet. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact does the ministry see the peace deal having on Colombia's GDP and the overall economy?</h4><p>The end of FARC as an armed group will boost long-term economic growth. It will reduce the destruction of physical and human capital, enhance confidence, increase productivity, and facilitate social cohesion, among other factors. In addition, honoring the agreement requires investment that will be concentrated on rural development and in regions where capital is scarce, generating economic returns. According to our calculations, which only take into account the fraction of total investments required that can be financed by the National Budget, those two factors would result in an aggregate benefit on economic growth of 0.35pps per year between 2017 and 2031. The cumulative effect of peace due to these two factors could imply, by 2030, a GDP 5.3pps higher than the one resulting from a scenario in which FARC continues to operate as an illegal armed group. One of the most important and positive effects of the agreement is that it will generate a regional convergence process. In fact, estimates show that the regions most affected by the conflict—most of which are also the poorest—will have an economic benefit three times greater than the one expected for the country as a whole. This is the case of regions such as Arauca, Vaupés, Caquetá, Meta, and Guaviare. Estimates indicate that the economic sectors that could benefit the most from the peace agreement are agriculture (1.5pps per year on average over the next 15 years), construction (1.2pps), and civil projects (0.5pp).</p><h4>How concerned are you regarding the protectionist rhetoric coming from the administration in the US?</h4><p>The US is Colombia's largest trading partner. US support of Colombia as an ally has been bipartisan, which is why, regardless of the party in office, we expect Colombia and the US to continue having a close and productive relationship. The meeting between President Santos and President Trump is a clear indication of this. In this context, the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement aims to improve the investment environment, reducing tariffs and other barriers to exports, expanding trade, and promoting economic growth in both countries. Recently, the US government expressed its will to renegotiate some trade agreements with economies in which the US presents a deficit in the trade balance. The latter is not the Colombian case; hence, we do not expect modifications in the existing agreement.</p><h4>What does the ministry view as the primary successes of the tax reform implemented earlier this year?</h4><p>The tax reform was a substantial effort to modernize the Colombian tax system. The goal was to make the system simpler, more competitive, and improve equality. We accomplished these three objectives. The bill approved by Congress in December 2016 is a comprehensive overhaul of the Colombian tax structure with a long-run perspective, focusing on competitiveness and on effectively controlling tax evasion. Thanks to the reform, tax returns are now simpler, which substantially reduced compliance costs and fully incorporated international accounting rules. In addition, the reform promotes competitiveness by reducing corporate income tax rates and eliminating the wealth tax in an effort to keep increasing formal employment, promote private investment, and boost the economy. Finally, the reform focuses on making the tax system more progressive, making sure that those who earn more pay more, protecting the purchasing power of vulnerable families and providing a level playing field for taxpayers. The approval of the reform reduced uncertainty and enhanced confidence. In fact, all three major rating agencies Fitch, Moody's, and S&amp;P have reaffirmed Colombian rating two notches above investment grade (BBB), and during the first half of 2017 Fitch returned its outlook of the country's debt ratio to stable. The government is now focusing on several key pillars for long-term economic growth: implementation of the peace agreement; execution of the 4G infrastructure investment plan; allocating more resources to education; and continuing with fiscal consolidation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do issues of formalization or financial inclusion here compare to neighboring countries?</h4><p>Colombia has a rate of approximately 76% financial inclusion, and there are eight financially formal commercial entities per 1,000 people. This means there are great opportunities for us in these areas, especially compared to other Latin American countries, some of which have nearly 100% financial inclusion. One of the most important things at the moment is working together with the banking association and public entities to create a public policy to promote electronic payments. In 2014, the government launched a new financial law, including the creation of a new banking license called the Sociedad Especializada en Depósitos y Pagos Electrónicos (SEDPEs) for entities that can raise funds from the public through electronic deposits and, in turn, provide transactional financial services such as payments, transfers, drafts, and receipts that encourage greater financial inclusion. On the formalization side, the government has created better instruments for small businesses. At the base, there are principal institutions and entities such as ours seeking to facilitate new models of payment. We have been working to create an aggregate base of formalized merchants and sales representatives, linking them with a formal payment system. Technology has allowed for a payment model for more efficient transactions. New innovations will help significantly, especially on the micro-commercial trade. A great deal of things have been done and many are still being done to bring Colombia to the same level as other countries in the region. </p><h4>What opportunities do you see for digital banking or mobile payments? </h4><p>In terms of innovation in this area, Colombia is one of the most advanced countries in the region; all the banks are involved in mobile banking. Seven of our clients, as well as the other main financial institutions, already use digital “smart wallets." The country wants to provide users with a better experience by making payment times faster. Colombia has the same technology as the rest of the world; the only restriction is the structure of the market. The potential is there and Colombia is catching up with the rest of the region. As for the challenges, public policies are perhaps the most important. For example, South Korean public policies in the 1990s changed the economy by introducing innovative systems. The challenge now is for the government, fintech companies, and banks to work together to meet customers' more sophisticated needs. If Colombia can overcome these challenges, it can be a leader. </p><h4>What are your strategies in terms of introducing new services and products?</h4><p>Our focus is on giving our users a better experience in the payment process. As for internationalization or international partnerships, for now we are mainly focused on Colombia and its needs. The market has faced many challenges and first we want to be strong here before forming international partnerships. </p><h4>What are your priorities for Credibanco in 2017 and 2018?</h4><p>For the remainder of the year, we have three main priorities. The first is to consolidate our business unit model, thus improving our approach to the market. The second is to transform our technological platform in order to have an open model to allow different companies, such as fintech, onto our payments network. The last refers to how we optimize the service level for our customers. Right now, we are in the middle of the process but should be finished by next year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main drivers behind your success in 2016?</h4><p><span></span>2016 was a good year for Grupo Nutresa. It was based mainly on good sales in Colombia, which is our biggest market and accounts for 60% of sales. Colombia is growing because of our strong marketing and channel development strategy and strong distribution network here. We have an omnichannel approach to the country. At Grupo Nutresa, we try to build knowledge about consumers, clients, and shoppers in order to create incremental value offers so we can maximize our capabilities. We know the consumer here well and are trying to go further than the competition to differentiate ourselves in the  channel in which we are involved. Grupo Nutresa has more than 16 brands worth over USD50 million per year. We also seek to combine the trends we have in Colombia with geographical expansion. We already have 9.2% sales in Central America, 8.2% in the US, and 8.2% in Chile. </p><h4>How will the peace deal affect Grupo Nutresa and Colombia's economy?</h4><p>This would give Colombia a better environment for attracting more foreign investment and reducing the costs of operating in Colombia. Above all, I trust peace would help us live together without the current fear and damage that is happening. As a company, we have been operating in this hostile environment for many years; therefore, we know how to work and manage a company in a turbulent environment. As part of the private sector, we are ready to create more opportunities and work on inclusive, productive programs with farmers, local communities, and other players.</p><h4>How will the peace deal affect Grupo Nutresa and Colombia's economy?</h4><p>There will be a positive impact. A country is never viewed the same when at war as it is in peace. Some investors have never been to Colombia because of the violence. We have foreign investors; however, only some of the otherwise available investors are coming here. The country needs structural tax reform to make Colombia more competitive for private companies operating here. We also need a wider tax base to capture those people who are not currently paying taxes. As things stand, a few people and corporations are paying most of the taxes and at a high rate. We need a system closer to that of Peru or Chile in which more companies and inviduals pay at more evenly distributed rates. </p><h4>How would you compare Colombia with its neighbors in its ease of doing business and ability to attract investment?</h4><p>We need to ease the international trade tariff situation, as we still have a high level of protection in place. We believe more open markets are important for the country. Countries such as Peru and Chile already have lower corporate taxes; therefore, the conditions affecting commodities in each country are different. Colombia's economy has been affected by low oil prices over the last couple of years. Whereas Chile has suffered from copper prices, and Peru depends upon gold and a mixture of other commodities, their situations are still different. Colombia has all the conditions to bring in good tax reforms and execute the reforms we need in international trade, in addition to implementing strong competition laws. In a peaceful environment, all this would mean the country has great potential to grow because of its large population. </p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017?</h4><p>The problem is that low oil prices over the last two years and dry conditions created by the El Niño weather pattern have led to high inflation rates in Colombia. Now that the weather pattern has changed and the economy has adapted to the lower oil prices, we expect that inflation will finish at 5-6% in YE2016. Inflation in YE2017 will be around 4%. This would put the country back on a better path. The exchange rate will also be more stable. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[through-thick-and-thin]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have trade relations between the UK and Colombia grown since BRITCHAM's establishment in 1981, and what role has the chamber played in that development?</h4><p>With time, there have been many sectors that have grown between Colombia and the UK, such as infrastructure, automobiles, machinery, and equipment for heavy industry, spirits, liquor, and pharmaceuticals. In terms of Colombian exports to the UK, we have expanded our trade volumes for petrol, coal, and nickel, and one of the most important exports of late has been palm oil, which has already seen great growth and potential for exporting to countries beyond the UK. That is one of the most interesting new products that we have been developing for the last 12-14 years. We see the UK as an important supporter and ally for Colombia. The UK watches LatAm as a potential region to invest in and sees Colombia as one of the most stable economies.</p><h4>What are some of the sectors that are particularly attractive to British investors? </h4><p>Definitely infrastructure, given the government's Fourth Generation (4G) Infrastructure plan. There are many companies interested in learning more about opportunities to invest. One such company is Holdtrade, which is developing an important rail project from La Dorada to the Santa Marta port.</p><h4>What advantages does Colombia have over other countries in the region for investors?</h4><p>When people make the decision to invest it is because we have economic stability, which is one of the most important issues for foreign investors. With the next structural tax reforms, we hope the government will help companies be able to define a strategy for investing here. We have a privileged location; therefore, Colombia is investing in ports to increase its competitiveness for goods and prices for internal transportation, distribution, and logistics. We do not have political problems in the way that Brazil, Venezuela, or potentially even Argentina do. By comparison, Colombia has been providing a source of stability and relatively important growth for investors. Our people are of course another asset, and international surveys regularly show Colombia to be one of the happiest countries in the world, making it easier to attract personnel from abroad.</p><h4>How do you foresee the uncertainty surrounding Brexit affecting trade and investment between the two countries?</h4><p>The potential effect of Brexit is an interesting subject of analysis for economists around the world. Colombia is a close ally of the UK, and we protect our allies. We suggest our government sit with the UK government. We have the EU trade agreement, which was negotiated for so many years that we hope to maintain it with the UK in a bilateral agreement; therefore, the negative effects on Colombian exports should be minimal. We have always had the visa procedure, so we are accustomed to it. The sterling pound has always been a strong currency and will likely remain so. We try to promote the benefits of an interesting trade relationship between the two countries, with more trade visits. Our top commercial partner remains, of course, the US, but we ask our entrepreneurs to come with us to the UK and be trained in industries like agribusiness and textiles.</p><h4>What can the two countries bilaterally achieve in the next year?</h4><p>We hope more Colombians will consider investing in the UK and participating in innovative and creative projects. In alliance with the Latam Business School, we are taking a group for special training and strategy in leadership, business success, business development, and human resources. We are also trying to move toward having short training courses for Colombians in different universities as well as visiting various fairs. One of our goals is to move into the agribusiness and manufacturing industries. Our engineers will have trainings with Durham University before the oil and gas prices return to past levels. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-lighter-brighter-day]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Grupo Aval's rebranding relate to its future strategies?</h4><p>We are often seen as a solid and dependable financial group, but not necessarily young or innovative. Thus, in the past four or five years, we decided to reach out to millennials—mostly through entertainment, but also through innovative products such as electronic wallets or smart-phone pay products. We were the first to offer a virtual wallet that accepts all the credit cards in the market and also wristbands that give users access to money and with which they can pay at concession stands during concerts, obviating the need to carry cash. Therefore, to go along with these efforts we decided to rebrand our logo to one that conveys a lighter, younger, and more innovative image. We are also big in mobile banking because we firmly believe that this is the direction the financial world is moving. We want to be a part of that—and be the innovation leaders in Colombia. So far, it seems to be working. </p><h4>What are your expectations from fiscal reform?<br></h4><p>After what was frankly a somewhat hostile tax reform in 2014, we were hoping for a business-friendly and integral fiscal reform this time around. It needed to reduce taxes on businesses and expand the taxpayer base. We also expected the VAT to go up; there is no other way to increase fiscal revenues. The government has insisted that the reason behind the need to raise these taxes is to finance the “post-conflict" cost. However, the reality of it is that at the end of the day there is a deficit that needs to be plugged, and that is just the iron rule of deficits.</p><h4>How do you see the peace deal affecting foreign investor negotiations and the overall economy?</h4><p>The peace deal will be better for investor confidence and for the country in the long run. If the deal had passed by referendum by a margin similar to Brexit—barely 60,000 votes—the government would have had great trouble implementing the negotiated treaty. </p><h4>What are your goals or targets in 2017 for Grupo Aval? </h4><p>We are targeting consolidated growth of around 13%. We also expect better performances in Central America than Colombia because the former has a different economy. In Colombia, we export oil and in Central America we import it, so low-cost oil is good for the latter. The other thing is that whenever the US economy rebounds, this is essential for Central America, which heavily relies on remittances from the US. In general, in all our markets we foresee better performances than in 2016, some growth, and controlled quality of our assets and costs of risk. There are also additional opportunities in Colombia from the infrastructure sector with the 4G Infrastructure Plan, which has already become a reality. Our banks have already offered about USD2.5 billion in financing, which will start being disbursed next year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What countries or regions have the most potential for strengthening bilateral economic relations?</h4><p>We have an agenda to diversify the country's export markets, as well as the exports themselves. The aim is to capitalize on the opportunities that other markets offer, such as Europe. We will maintain an intense commercial agenda with all our international commercial partners. Locally, we will strengthen the Colombian business community and the different regions of the country, with a particular focus on sectors that allow us to further develop supply chains. For example, our relationship with the UK is framed by the Commercial Agreement we have had with the EU since 2013. Almost 2.3% of Colombian exports, excluding hydrocarbons and minerals, are directed to this market, and we want this share to increase. In 2016, we exported USD348.7 million in non-mining products to the UK.</p><h4>What is your outlook regarding the future of regional integration and Colombia's role in achieving it? </h4><p>In 2017, we hold the Pro Tempore Presidency of the Andean Community, and in 2018 we will do the same for the Pacific Alliance. This will allow us to further boost the integration of our markets with those of our natural partners, increasing our value-added exports. The Pacific Alliance also has the objective of establishing a stronger platform with Pacific Asia, a strategic point for Colombia. That is why we will keep participating and working together to facilitate commerce between the members of these blocs, to remove the barriers that prevent fluid commerce, and to look for new areas where we can integrate even further. Of the USD2.39 billion we exported in 2016 to the Andean Community, USD2.18 billion were non-mineral and non-energy products. In the same category, USD2.16 billion of non-mineral and non-energy products out of a total of USD2.66 billion were exported to the Pacific Alliance.</p><h4>What has the ministry highlighted as strategic sectors with the most potential for growth, and how is it working to develop them? </h4><p>The ministry, together with the private sector, municipalities, and the 32 departments of Colombia, has designated six productive sectors as having strong potential: agro-industries, metalworking, industry 4.0, tourism, fashion and textiles, and chemicals. This is done with the aim of increasing our exports in non-mining and non-energy goods. We make a huge effort to work with the businesses of each region to increase productivity, innovation, and competitiveness. We offer the mechanisms to help them: resources and training for innovation and entrepreneurship, technology transfers, financing, the development of relevant human capital, and promoting regulations to improve quality and sustainability. </p><h4>In terms of developing Colombia's massive tourism potential, what are ministry's medium-term strategic plans for the post-conflict era? </h4><p>Peace brings big opportunities for tourism to Colombia, which today is the second generator of foreign exchange. We are preparing for the post-conflict era. We promote high-value products in tourism in the following areas: nature, health and wellness, culture, and conferences. For example, we are betting on bird-watching to increase. We have more than 1,900 species, 20% of the world's total, and 79 that are unique to us. In other areas, we have defined 12 tourism corridors that involve 311 municipalities with great potential. </p><h4>What are the ministry's immediate goals for 2017? </h4><p>The national government is optimistic for 2017 in terms of commerce, industry, and tourism. We will begin to see the results of the Productive Development Program; we will see businesses grow and be more productive and competitive. Our exports, particularly non-mineral and non-energy, will also grow. In terms of industrial production, it will remain positive. After two consecutive years of falling exports, in 2017 the country will export more. Private projections show that exports could increase more than 10%. We hope inbound tourism will be 14-18% higher than in 2016. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some important stories in Colombia not being covered by the international media? </h4><p>The biggest challenge is the need to get away from daily business and focus more on long-term trends. It thus becomes absolutely clear that Colombia is a success story. The people who have recognized this have decided to invest in the country. FDI grew in 2016, much the opposite to what it did in the rest of Latin America that year. The message is that bringing money into this country is worth the risk. </p><h4>Why is Colombia attracting greater foreign investment than its neighbors?</h4><p>Two reasons: first, the size of the internal market and an increase in domestic consumption levels. The proportion of poor people is half of what it used to be at the beginning of the century, and the size of the middle class has doubled. This creates a virtuous circle in the sense that there is more consumption, more investment, and better sales for companies focused on the local market. Consumption is not growing as strongly as in the boom years; however, Colombia is still an interesting place to be. At the same time, it is also clear that Colombia has advantages because of its geographical location as the crossroads of Latin America. </p><h4>What are some of the challenges the economy needs to address? </h4><p>Beginning with institutions, Colombia still has a problem with crime both in the countryside and in urban areas. There are doubts about the efficiency of the justice sector and the quality of police services, not to mention a lack of trust in politicians due to high perceptions of corruption. We also have to complete our investments in physical infrastructure; Colombia still has some of the worst roads in Latin America. There is a plan in place to fix it, but it needs to actually be completed. We also need rail services and to make use of the Magdalena River as an artery for transporting goods. Regarding education, we still have quality issues and rank low in the PISA tests given by the OECD. Attendance rates among young children are still lower than in most of Latin America. We also need to improve the legal framework and efficiency of settling disputes. We have to invest more in R&amp;D. The biggest opportunity we have is to develop our agriculture. We are one of the richest countries in the world in terms of arable land and water resources. It is absolutely mind-boggling that we are not an international power in terms of producing food. If Colombia were able to devote more than seven of its 25 million ha to agriculture, the country would be a different place.</p><h4>What sectors of the economy have been overlooked by foreign investors? </h4><p>Given our geography, the renewable energy sector has many possibilities. The north could develop important wind farms, while the center and east have the sunshine needed to intensively produce solar energy. Taken together, we could become a net exporter of energy to Central America, which already needs more electricity. </p><h4>What is your long-term assessment of the peace agreement for the economy?</h4><p>It will not be immediate and will have to be earned: this is the biggest challenge. We have to not only take care of the victims and make the right decisions for integrating the guerillas into society, but also—and especially—develop the countryside. </p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017? </h4><p>The economy should perform a little bit better, though not dramatically so. We could see an upside in terms of oil prices, and tourism revenues might increase if the infrastructure agenda is developed according to plan. In the case of Bogotá, we are watching for infrastructural investments, especially roads and the metro system. If we stabilize the political situation and achieve peace, there is a good chance the economy could grow faster than its current rate of 2.5-3%. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What regions are part of Colombia's strategy to diversify its trade relations?</h4><p>In contrast to ties with the US and Latin America, Colombia has had less historic ties with Europe and Asia. Therefore, this is where we see an opportunity. ProColombia, as well as the Colombian government, has been working consistently on diversifying not just the type of products and services we export, but also the markets we export to. In this sense, the UK, and Europe in general, are our main targets. Historically, we have had little trade with Asia and are working hard to change this. In 3Q2016, we implemented our first trade deal in Asia with South Korea. Now, we are in negotiations for a deal with Japan. </p><h4>What is holding back Colombia's trade with Asia?</h4><p>For decades Colombia did not look at trading with Asia because most of our trade was focused on our neighbors and the US. However, now we are betting really hard on Asia. We believe the Pacific Alliance will be of critical importance in connecting our economy more closely with Asia. In fact, when the Pacific Alliance was created, one of its main objectives was to connect the four Latin American countries of Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Chile with Asia. </p><h4>What has the most potential to help you diversify your exports? </h4><p>There are two points here. The first thing we have been working on is diversifying the economy as a whole. Historically, we have been more dependent on commodities and oil than we would like. Therefore, the Colombian government has been working on a new development plan to grow those sectors of the economy in which we are globally competitive. There are a few sectors like agro-industries, metal mechanics, tourism, and manufacturing where we believe we have advantages. Of course, commodities and oil are sectors of the economy that will be important for many decades to come; however, we do not want to depend on them too much. In the past, most Colombian exports were basic products and commodities without added value. That is something we are working on changing. We know that in order to reach our goals in terms of social and economic development as a country we need to export more and internationalize our economy. Otherwise, we will be too exposed to price fluctuations and the actions of competing countries.</p><h4>What investment opportunities does the peace process open up for the country, especially in terms of foreign investment?</h4><p>Many of the regions that were falling behind in terms of development as a result of proximity to the conflict are now open to the world. This is one of the reasons why we are investing so heavily in agro-industry projects, not to mention tourism. For example, the Guainí­a and Guaviare districts of the Llanos Orientales region. We are optimistic about the impact the development of those regions will have on the Colombian economy. At ProColombia, we are working hard to promote these regions internationally. This is the first time we have been able to do this and the first time we have seen international visitors coming to these parts of the country. Obviously, there is also investment coming from abroad, especially for agro-industrial projects.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for 2017?</h4><p>Although the country has some problems, this is nevertheless the best moment in Colombia's history. One of the great things about Colombia's economy is that even in the worse moments of civil conflict in the 1980s-1990s, we still had responsible economic management, which had a positive impact on the country's economy as a whole. Now, Colombia is the second-fastest growing economy in the region and has one of the better outlooks for 2017. Therefore, we are optimistic that 2017 will be great because it will be the first year of peace. We want to take full advantage of this momentum. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-new-continental-order]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways will UNASUR continue to support the ongoing peace process in Colombia, both with FARC and the newly opened negotiations with the ELN?</h4><p>Some UNASUR countries, such as Venezuela, Ecuador, Chile, and Brazil, are actively participating in this process. As Secretary General, I have been collaborating in Havana and, as agreed upon in the accord, I am responsible for contributing to citizen participation and democracy. Likewise with Uruguay we participated in defining the criteria for military de-escalation for the ceasefire, demobilization, disarmament, and reintegration. We are fully committed to the peace process. </p><h4>Through UNASUR and its South American Defense Council (CDS), what role can Colombia play in promoting and maintaining regional security?</h4><p>For UNASUR, hemispheric security no longer has to do with the strategic defense that for many years and during the Cold War defined the defensive criteria of the region against possible external interventions. At UNASUR, we are working through the South American Council of Defense, which brings together all the Ministers, the Center for Strategic Defense Studies in Buenos Aires, and the Defense College in Quito to forge a new concept of hemispheric security that is based on confidence and combating transnational crimes and citizen insecurity. It also includes protection from natural disasters and the sovereign defense of natural resources. We are working on a new articulation of concepts of defense, security, and justice as a part of our integral answer to new challenges. South America is the most peaceful regions in the world in terms of intra-state violence. </p><h4>How is UNASUR working with Colombia and other Andean Community countries to better promote development and cooperation between the two organizations?</h4><p>For two years now, UNASUR has been promoting a “convergence" process between the two mechanisms of sub-regional integration. In the past five months of convergence, we have found the Organization of Amazonia Pact with the Andean Community, Mercosur, ALBA, and the Pacific Alliance to increase our efforts to eliminate duplicities and specialize each process, all from the convergence blueprint that we built for the task. The results have been so positive that in the sixth convergence meeting we are extending CARICOM and SICA to include the Caribbean and Central America. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>2017 was a significant time for a first visit by an Irish President to a country with which Ireland has had warm diplomatic relations since 1999, but with which we have also enjoyed much older connections. The establishment of formal diplomatic relations between our two countries, in 1999, has done much to foster the reciprocal friendship between the Irish and the Colombians. Our relationships have widened and deepened through productive and mutually beneficial co-operation, particularly through academic and cultural exchanges, and, of course, through our support and commitment for the Colombian peace process, which has intensified in recent times and to which we remain committed.</p><p>Yet, there exists a long history of cultural engagement of the Irish with Colombia, which predates our formal diplomatic relations. Although geography, scale, and our respective historical journeys differ in some respects, there are significant aspects of the collective experience of the Irish and Colombian peoples that we share. The movement from a precarious society of tenant farmers to a smallholder's rural economy, albeit deeply influenced by emigration, and in recent decades urbanization, is the source of the deep changes in Irish political and social life.</p><p>We in Ireland understand the difficult and painful choices that peace and reconciliation can entail, and we also understand and were grateful for support that came to us from our friends at critical junctures on the path to peace. It is for this reason that Irish people have been so pleased to support Colombia in its ongoing journey. We recognize the differences in our two processes, but we believe we can make a contribution by making available our own experience of peace-building over the last 20 years and more. </p><p>I know that many groups and individuals have traveled between Colombia and Ireland in recent months to discuss lessons and parallels from our respective journeys. We will continue to provide that assistance in the coming, critical years, including through the trust fund that we have helped to establish together with our friends in the EU. This trust fund is just one element of the broader support that the EU has been providing to many hundreds of projects all over Colombia, with hundreds of millions of euros in funding. Ireland has been pleased to contribute to this effort over many years and will, may I say it again, continue to do so.<br>Our involvement in Colombia is no exception to our deep commitment to human rights and it is precisely for such reasons that our relationship with the Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights is at the center of Ireland's activity in Colombia. We have been pleased to provide it with financial support for its work with human rights defenders and victims in the province of Nariño as well as in drawing lessons from the peace process in Northern Ireland. </p><p>Nobody, however, underestimates the scale of the challenges that remain in relation to the implementation of the new agreement, including the transitional justice framework, disarmament, and the establishment of a safe and secure environment for all of Colombia's citizens. It goes without saying that Ireland remains available to support the people of Colombia in any way that furthers the goal of peace in this country.<br>All of us Irish would like to see Ireland act as a bridge for Colombia to the EU, a bridge that would contribute to advancing the development of its connections to the European region, and we would, in turn, welcome the opportunity for the further development of the bonds between us so that Colombia can act as a bridge for us to Latin America.</p><p>At this very important time in its modern history I want to convey to all Colombians Ireland's very best wishes for a peaceful, prosperous, and inclusive future. We are pleased, in Ireland, that we have been able, bilaterally and through the EU, to make our contribution to its peace process. Ireland is privileged indeed that Colombians have allowed us to share in their journey from darkness to light. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>On July 20, 2017, we celebrated the first Colombian Independence Day since 1963 without the shadow of an absurd war. Weapons were handed over to the UN. Stashes of weapons are being located and destroyed. This in an example of peace in a turbulent world and was recognized and applauded recently by the 15 member countries of the UN Security Council.</p><p>After many failed attempts, many believed we would never see this day; however, today is an irrefutable reality. This is not just the achievement of this President or this government; I want everyone to rid that idea from their heads. The peace of Colombia is precisely of Colombia. This peace belongs to each and every single Colombian; we must protect and defend it. This belongs to the congressmen who consciously approved the reforms and laws needed to pave the way to ratify the agreement to end the conflict and to start its rightful implementation.</p><p>Congress drew up the laws to put an end to a past of violence and is now dictating the laws to start building a future in harmony, civility, and coexistence. How was this accomplished? For instance, creating the integral system of truth, justice, reparation, and non-repetition; making it possible for those who abandoned the path of weapons to join democracy; and guaranteeing the stability of the agreements among many other initiatives approved during the past legislature. However, we still have a full legislature ahead, a legislature that Congress and the government must continue to advance to consolidate the new country that we can become after we are done with a civil war that lasted over half a century.</p><p>Moving forward, we will pass reforms of the greatest importance, such as a reform that will allow the investment of COP 1 trillion on tertiary roads, political and electoral reforms that will contribute to cleaning up and improving our democratic system, a statutory law for the Special Jurisdiction for Peace, and reforms targeting an integral rural development and a more balanced use of the land.</p><p>This is all a result of the negotiators, the public workers of the government, judges, the international community, artists, sportsmen, intellectuals, and every Colombian and foreign person who have added the grain of sand to make that we can live the moment that we are living right now. And of course, many thanks to the thousands of heroes in our Military Forces and the Nacional Police who have given everything to obtain the biggest victory that a policeman or a soldier can achieve: peace.</p><p>I am the first to recognize that insecurity is still a preoccupying factor for Colombians. That is why we have to make a huge effort to reduce the crimes that affect civilian security. We have to continue to reduce current homicide and kidnapping rates, which are the lowest in the last four decades. Even one homicide or a kidnapping is one too many. Another major challenge is drug trafficking; we are aware of the significant surge that coca fields have experienced in the country. Now, without the armed conflict with the FARC, we can be more effective in dealing with this issue and insecurity in general. We have set a goal to eradicate at least 100,000ha of coca: 50,000ha through voluntary substitution and another 50,000ha through forced eradication. Of the latter, we have already eradicated 23,000ha. We are also doing this via a special mechanism to monitor and prevent replanting.</p><p>No one has said the end of the conflict with the FARC will be complete peace or the beginning of paradise on earth. However, it is a milestone that no one can deny, and it is a factor to continue consolidating many other advancements that the country has had in the social and economic spheres in the defense of the rights and welfare of all Colombians.</p><p>Frankly, let us forget that these advancements were achieved during this years of government. But do not forget the common achievements that we have reached together. In a country such as ours there are many needs to attend to; we still have a great deal of work to do in many areas and we will dedicate this last year of work to making further advancements in even larger goals. But do not forget, do not minimize what Colombia has achieved in the last seven years. Colombia has changed for the better; Colombia is still changing for the better. And our task is to continue this path of progress to ensure that more Colombians have access to a better quality of life.</p><p>Seven years ago, our country had less than 19 million employed people. Today, there are 22.3 million, which is extra 3 million. Unemployment seven years ago was over 12%; today it is in single digits, as we promised. Seven years ago, the majority of the jobs were informal, without social benefits. Today, more than half the employed people in Colombia work in the formal sector. In addition, over 5 million Colombians have moved above of the poverty line in the last seven years. We achieved this with timely advancements in health, housing, education, public services, and access to culture and sports. Today, health is a fundamental right, and we have established almost total universal coverage. And also, there are no patients of first and second category level.<br>As for education, we are on the path to becoming the best educated country in Latin America for 2025. Before, basic education was not free, and children went to school for just a few hours. More than 1.2 million young children are now benefiting from the strategy of integral attention “From Zero to Forever," and over 8 million young people are studying in primary and secondary for free.</p><p>I know many citizens are worried about the deceleration of the economy. We are taking the right measures to ensure the economy is more dynamic and we hope the economy will experience an important surge in the second semester. Colombia suffered from the dramatic fall in oil prices, an important revenue source, last year around at the same time we experienced the worst El Niño phenomenon in our history. We grew less, but are still growing over the average in Latin America. We passed unpopular but responsible measures such as the tax reform, and injected resources to sectors that generate jobs and energize the economy such as housing and infrastructure.</p><p>On the other hand, inflation, which soared in previous years, is again under the 4% band. Exports in the first five months of the year increased 25% compared to the same period the year before. FDI, meanwhile, grew in 1Q2017 by over 8%. Total investment as percentage of GDP was also the largest in the entire region. Tourism is a sector that grows rapidly and hits a new record every year. Last year, for example, more than 5 million people visited Colombia and in the first half of 2017 the number of foreign visitors increased 46%, another fact that demonstrates the benefits of peace.</p><p>Colombia is changing and will continue to change. Do not ever forget this: we are one people. We are one nation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your priorities in the region?</h4><p>Central America and the Caribbean naturally relate well to one another. I like to think of the immediate region almost as an extension of our local markets, since it is an area in which we compete particularly well. Obviously, the US and Europe are significant markets; over 50% of what we import and export is to and from the US. We are probably the largest partner of the EU in Central America, which is significant in terms of our exports. We are also active with Latin America beyond the greater Caribbean area. Our relations with Chile and Peru are significant, and the likelihood of an agreement between Costa Rica and the Pacific Alliance is still likely, despite our significant deficit. Again, we are interested in pursuing trade relations with Asia. We have an FTA with China, which is huge. We also have a longstanding relationship with Japan that we are interested in strengthening. </p><h4>In August 2016, the Costa Rican-Colombian FTA went into effect. What short-term benefits do you expect from this agreement?</h4><p>Among other things, I am expecting to have a wide variety of industrial goods in better conditions for Costa Rica. Up until recently, Colombia had a huge internal market that did not make it necessary for the country to expand. They kept all of those products inside. Later, however, they made an upgrade, changed their vision, and found they could compete favorably in the external sector and have been providing these products ever since. It is positive to have them. On the other hand, just as with Mexico, we also share the greater Central American Caribbean basin, which means we have a lot at stake to deal with Colombia in terms of security issues, especially drug trafficking. They have been providing extraordinary resources to us in terms of public security through their police. We receive training from them, and their experience has been positive</p><h4>How will Costa Rica further support Colombia's peace efforts? </h4><p>We will continue to support Colombia, and I said this when I was there. I went to Colombia to show our support for President Santos' initiative and negotiations. I was very much involved myself in the Central American peace dialog in the 1980s, and I probably understand better than many others the effort it entails to craft these agreements. It is not easy; it is not a jolly experience. You have to take into account a lot of suffering and sensitivities. Nevertheless, I still believe it is better to live in peace than in war, and this 52-year period was the longest internal conflict ever fought in Latin America—two generations or more of Colombians that never saw one single day of peace in their lives. It was worth pursuing this agreement even with the difficulties we knew it would entail. At the same time, I have often reiterated that the final word is that of the Colombian people; this was a sovereign decision. The president was courageous in putting this in the hands of the Colombian people after it had been negotiated. It was a risky affair, but he did so, and given the rules of the game and the situation that the country had theretofore been in, it has to be respected. The Colombian people spoke through their vote and rejected the agreement, but I am encouraged by the fact that everybody has voiced their support for some kind of negotiation of those parts of the agreement considered unsatisfactory. That is not going to be easy to do, but I have a great admiration for the Colombian people and for President Santos. With the support of the other parties involved and the 50% of the Colombian population that supported the agreement, he will prevail. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Expectations for strong real estate market in 2018]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[olayinka-braimoh-ceo-of-hall7]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about Hall7's main operations since its establishment?</h4><p>Hall7 was established in 2013 and started business in January 2014. Our vision is to create diversified real estate developments that deliver value to stakeholders. Our stakeholders here are our clients, the vendors, and we design and develop projects that deliver value to these stakeholders. We mainly service the medium- to high-end real estate segments. Among our projects is the Brook Shore Residence with about 230 units. This project commenced in January 2014 and will be commissioned by December 2017. There are basketball courts, a mini golf course, a swimming pool, and a skate park. We also have another residential development, The Bridge, which we launched in May 2016. It is more contemporary in terms of design and is based on three principles: making money, saving money, and growing business. The value of the property will appreciate, making it an asset as well. Our projects are designed to satisfy critical areas of value addition.</p><h4>What can you share about the housing project you are developing with NNPC?</h4><p>Imperial Vista is a 216-unit development in the Kafe district and will feature unique architecture. We signed the project with NNPC to develop part of the project for its staff while the other half will be open to investors. There we will be a mini waterpark and it will be designed like a mini smart city. It will feature controls for all housing appliances, with automation and access, as well as smart TVs and more. We will light up the streets in a way that makes everyday look like it is a celebration.</p><h4>What is your strategy to be ahead of the competition?</h4><p>Our focus is never on our competition; our focus is our customers. For all our developments we look at dominating the market and becoming a market leader to dictate the pace and direction of development. We focus on what creates the most value for our customers. The strategy is quite simple; we must use our vision to dictate the market and not succumb to the market, thereby creating the demand within the market. One of the key things about our developments is that they are smart; we are developing smart developments that respond to a user's presence.</p><h4>Do you have any expansion plans and where do you want to be in two years' time?</h4><p>We will enter the Lagos market, which we have started planning toward. This is after the commissioning of the Abuja projects. In two years, we want to have completed all our current projects. This includes Brookshore Residence, The BridgePeridot, The Bridge Garnet, and Imperial Vista. In two years, we want to be established in the Lagos market. Once we deliver those projects we can focus on the Lagos market. The market is fairly huge and still open.</p><h4>How would you assess the real estate market today in Nigeria and what trends do you observe?</h4><p>Lagos is about 37% of the market, Abuja is 22%, Port Harcourt 6%, and the rest of Nigeria is about the last 35%. The Lagos market is obviously the largest market, while Abuja is the size that it is because it is the capital. There are many people willing to invest in the capital; this drives the market in Abuja. However, in Lagos there is a high level of private-sector activity. There are many foreign companies coming in and a high level of developments going on, as well as businesses that are not dependent on the government. The structure of title documents is solid in Lagos and Abuja, though the protocol is a little complicated in Port Harcourt. The titles department of the state government needs to look into this and work more on the title structure to make it easier for people to receive certificates of occupancy that would encourage developments in Port Harcourt. The market will eventually pick up.</p><h4>What trends do you observe in terms of activity in the sector and how would you define doing business in real estate?</h4><p>It is an interesting sector and the risk can be high at times. For example, in the last 10 years there were times when prices went up over 100% because of inflation in the sector. In our sector within the last 18 months we have seen the price of cement increase over 100%. The price of reinforcement has also increased over 100%. All these negatively affect the business. However, somehow we are able to find our way and forge ahead. What drives us is our vision, which sustains us in the midst of challenges that are meant to be overcome. The real estate market in Nigeria is growing; the housing segment that sees the greatest demand is low income. The market is promising and growing.</p><h4>What do you expect from 2018?</h4><p>2018 will be an election preparation year and we look forward to a better year. We hope there will be greater liquidity in the system and more flows. Our expectation is for 2018 to be much better than 2017. We are introducing new developments into the market, and with all the policies that are put in place currently we will have a more vibrant economy moving forward. The last few years have been challenging and we are optimistic about the future. If we managed to last 24 months, we can face the next year. If a company can do business in Nigeria it can do business anywhere in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Healthcare is a key driver of your growth in the UAE. What services do you provide to the market?</h4><p>We are the market leaders in healthcare logistics in the region. We provide solutions for any and all global pharmaceutical giants with Dubai acting as the hub. We work closely with the free zone and the Ministry of Health. We have expanded our healthcare facility in Dubai World Central three times, and the third and final phase has been completed in the 4Q2016. It is probably the single-largest healthcare warehouse in the region, with 25,000 pallet positions. The healthcare industry is growing fast in Dubai, especially in terms of postponement processes, which is becoming a key issue in healthcare globally. Every market is different and every market has different regulatory requirements. For manufacturers, it is difficult to customize products to suit all these different markets and regions based on their regulatory requirements; therefore, these manufacturers choose to instead postpone completion of the manufacturing process closer to the end market. The local standards entail a huge level of regulatory compliances and require similar levels of expertise, which is normally not available to your standard logistics company. Therefore, that is what we have been developing. We have done a lot of such value-added work for the Saudi Arabian market. Unfortunately, the Saudi government does not allow pharma products to come from Dubai; it has to come directly from the source. If the Saudi and Dubai governments could work together, it could open up vast opportunities across the board because Dubai's capabilities are far superior in many ways to European countries' capabilities.</p><h4>What solutions have you created for the renewables sector?</h4><p>Renewable energy is something we have developed globally. Our core business remains transportation, logistics, and warehousing, but we also created vertical specializations in renewable energy, fashion, automotive, healthcare, chemicals, perishables, and so on. So, we look into the unique needs of the supply chain challenges of a particular industry and create products and solutions that can deal with these. The renewables sector is developing here through Masdar initiatives in Abu Dhabi, for example. Renewable energy products have many requirements in terms of ensuring that the products reach the recipient undamaged and there are different warehousing processes that must be taken into consideration. We are looking at importing renewable energy technologies into this region from places like Germany. We intend to put more emphasis on this industry and focus on developing a solid supply chain for it.</p><h4>The government is pushing for more IT solutions and digitization, moving to paperless administration, and so on. How have you followed and supported these trends?</h4><p>We have a semi-automated process here in Dubai, and we do not need to invest hugely in automation because of the inexpensive labor costs. Our semi-automated structure suits our needs, and we do not intend to invest in high-tech unless it is genuinely necessary. In fashion, for example, technology makes a great deal of sense, but in automotive it does not. We manage the regional hub for Audi, VW, Ford, Toyota, and many other companies, and we are the biggest regional automotive logistics company. Some companies invest in expensive solutions because it makes them look good; however, such solutions are not always required.</p><h4>What sectors are you expecting to see growth from in the coming year?</h4><p>In chemicals, we are forming a new joint venture that will be announced in February or March 2017. In e-commerce, we are creating a platform in Dubai for the Middle East, which will provide e-solutions while also helping us create a fashion marketplace for emerging brands seeking to enter the Middle East market. In Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, we have our own entities. Taking our expertise in healthcare to Saudi Arabia and creating a fantastic last-mile distribution model for the country has been a great experience, and we will do the same in Kuwait as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the particularities of the UAE market compared to DHL's multitude of other operations?</h4><p>We drive our focus and strategy through four main pillars: motivated people, great service quality, loyal customers, and a profitable network. Our people are the core and backbone of this organization and we make sure that we have engaged and motivated employees, who can then deliver great service quality for our customers. We listen to them and make sure they have a good and prositive working environment. We are a truly global organization with a network that spans across 220 countries; however, we have a Global Standard Operating Procedure, which ensures that customers across the globe receive the same high-quality experience regardless whether they are in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, or the UK. Additionally, our IT platforms have all been merged, giving each customer an easy and uniform experience. We try to treat every customer with great care whilst being respectful of local laws, religions, and customs, and adapting accordingly.</p><h4>What is DHL doing to contribute to the UAE's national energy goals?</h4><p>DHL has been in the UAE and wider MENA region for 40 years, and we have managed to mirror the growth of the country by partnering and working with both the public and private sectors. Today the UAE is a logistics hub that connects East with West, and acts as a gateway into Africa, as a result of the world-class facilities and infrastructure of the UAE. Corporate responsibility is an important aspect of DHL's mission, and we want to add real value to communities here and around the world. We have a large variety of programs geared toward social responsibility, and we always strive to do as much as we can. In terms of environmental awareness, we are also continually looking at the performance of our vehicles, and we are analyzing our routes to see if we can minimize vehicle emissions. Between 2007 and 2020, DHL aims to reduce its global emissions by around 30%. To achieve this, we are adding newer and more efficient aircraft that have far smaller environmental footprints. As a company, we are always looking at what we can do for the environment, and though it can be challenging, we view it more as a responsibility.</p><h4>How would you evaluate DHL's relations with Dubai's government institutions?</h4><p>The UAE has officially launched the Authorized Economic Operator program. This makes the UAE one of only 63 countries that facilitate trade and customs and supply chains. Only a handful of companies have been chosen by the UAE government to represent certified economic operators, and DHL Express is the first and only logistics provider in the UAE to be chosen and certified. This relates back to the large amount of support we receive from the government. This certification means that we are recognized by customs as a trusted supplier and transportation company, and that the government views us as a market leader.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the logistics sector in Dubai?</h4><p>Thanks to its multimodal transport infrastructure, the UAE is a real a logistics powerhouse. Sea, air, rail, and road come together to make Dubai the perfect place for logistics businesses. Therefore, the future is bright, and I predict growth, especially with the plans and preparations for Expo 2020, UAE Vision 2021, and the 2030 strategy. The rest of the world is really at our fingertips here, and it is extremely easy to service. The UAE is also driving enhanced connectivity with Asia and Africa by introducing various strategic logistics solutions. I am optimistic about what the future holds for the logistics sector in Dubai, and investment opportunities will continue to grow. With a government that is so understanding and so dedicated to driving growth and spurring business, the future is extremely bright. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Dubai South diversifying the base of industrial companies around the free zone?</h4><p>Our role is to be a platform and catalyst for business, so we endeavor to do as much as we can for our client businesses. For example, for the aviation sector we invested in a VIP terminal for all of the fixed-base operators because it is quite a big undertaking for them to build one independently, and now they have a common terminal to ease operations and add value to their operations. These entities now have their own maintenance, repair, and operations facilities as well as warehousing, paint shops, and more; it is a platform for every business. This has helped generate a downstream industry in this particular sector. One of our current focuses is to look at the human side of our operations beyond our administrative role. In our residential district, we are focusing on creating happy cities for people to live and work in this area. We have, in effect, become a developer, creating the infrastructure to ensure a high quality of life. We are not the only developer, and we are still a platform for business. Having a fully developed infrastructure allows us to moderate the cost of rents. The next step will be to bring in  cost-effective schools and hospitals because we want to be competitive.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the zone's priorities and how that impacts the kind of people and developers it attracts?</h4><p>We would like to have a happy city. There are a few things that affect happiness; for example, people are not happy to sit in traffic after a long day at work. Secondly, we focus on cost and make it cost effective for people to live here in terms of the environment and access to education and health services. Having all of these facilities readily available should make living here more enjoyable. We also integrate many safety measures into our building plans; for example, we ensure that busy roads are away from living areas to ensure that children do not play close to traffic. Focusing on small things is one of the many things we do to ensure that our residents are happy.</p><h4>How does Dubai South ensure the airport is supplied with the right infrastructure?</h4><p>Dubai South, as an airport city, is designed to cater to the logistics needs of the airport. We are growing our logistics capacity, which will help smooth the movement of cargo and airfreight, and at the moment we are experiencing double-digit growth. Under general aviation, we also have double-digit growth. The number of free zone operations and our suite of services are growing very quickly, and we are now also incorporating the growth and development of the residential aspect into our strategies. We are enablers for what the airport requires in terms of services and what the airport could reciprocate in terms of business.</p><h4>What are your key initiatives for the rest of 2017?</h4><p>Our plans are dependent on the evolution of the aviation sector. For example, we have to have facilities ready for flydubai by end-2017. The airport is also being expanded from a capacity of 5 million to 27 million passengers, which will dictate the pace of our infrastructure development. It is really growing, and we have a new operator. Dubai South will be hosting many heads of state and dignitaries, who will be travelling here for the Expo. We have educational institutions that we will also help develop, such as the Emirates flight academy as well as other aviation-specific education facilities. Our housing will be ready by early 2019, and we have sold over 1,000 units already. Every year, Dubai South invests between USD1.4-1.6 billion in addition to private investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>E-commerce is a major trend these days in the region, and not just in the UAE. How has Chalhoub ridden the uptake across the luxury sector?</h4><p>We have seen a long-time resistance to e-commerce in the luxury market, but that is slowly diminishing and brands are taking up e-commerce. E-commerce now accounts for around 7-8% of the global luxury market, and we have already seen considerable changes in the UK and US, with the introduction of new technologies such as virtual reality. This has improved the e-commerce experience, and people today are involved with their digital devices, socially and in terms of consumer habits, particularly in this region where we have a young population with a high level of mobile phone penetration. Attitudes are changing too; shopping has always been considered a pleasure and a leisure activity for people in this part of the world. Also, in terms of payments, this market has not been keen on using credit cards and prefers cash. Organizing shipping to an address has also been an issue. However, today we are witnessing a greater level of e-commerce adaptability to the local market, with options such as cash payment on delivery. We only started our e-commerce drive three years ago and implemented the solution of payment of cash on delivery. We expected that to account for around 60% of online sales, but found it made up 75%, with a low rate of return. Globally, return is around 12-15%; however, we are below that even with a higher than expected percentage of sales for cash on delivery. We get a lot of repeat customers and their purchases are generally increasing. Another thing that triggered e-commerce for luxury in this part of the world is the exchange rate, which has made prices in the Middle East more expensive than in Europe and the UK.</p><h4>How are consumer patterns changing in-line with this trend?</h4><p>Today, consumers think and act differently, and they have different consumer habits and motivations. This is a world with less loyalty and more experience needed, more need for personal connection, but still with a desire for anonymity. E-commerce has provided a lot of answers and solutions for these consumers and the new generation. Of course, it doesn't have the human touch, but it makes things convenient. We still have much to learn from online e-commerce, and from more traditional offline brick and mortar commerce. We want to provide an omni-channel experience at the end of the day; we want people to navigate, whether they engage online or offline, no matter the location. Our customer is our center of interest, and that is who we engage with. We need to make sure we have a seamless experience uniting all our online and offline channels. We want the best of both worlds. We will probably have less stores as we move ahead, but with more experience, more investment, and more choices. We imagine that eventually some physical stores can be showrooms for our online offerings, and provide more meaningful online experiences.</p><h4>How is Chalhoub's e-commerce platform being connected to your brands?</h4><p>We put together a platform, and we felt the best way to get through to our clients would be through each one of the brands. The first to be plugged in was L'Occitaine in July 2015, which accounts for 14% of sales today. That's our largest single store of entry in the Middle East, both in Saudi and the UAE. Wojooh and Level Shoes followed in January 2016, and in November 2016 we plugged in Sephora, which we operate as a joint venture. For some of the lesser-known brands, the takeoff has been more difficult, because it is a question of trust and people tend to be wary of brands they do not know as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why has there been a shift away from public-sector employment in UAE nationals?</h4><p>This reflects the overall strategy and objectives that the government of the UAE has adopted over the last few years. Both the federal and local governments support and encourage entrepreneurship, through many different channels, to encourage people to move into the private sector. There has since been an increase in the popularity of the private sector and entrepreneurship as a career path among Emirati graduates.  According to the latest study, only 17% of Emiratis opted to work in the public sector compared to 53% in the previous study, while 26% said they wanted to start their own business. A further 22% said they wanted to work in the semi-government sector.</p><h4>How will sub-sectors, such as big data and renewables, be integrated into the curriculum?</h4><p>The objective of the government is to support and work toward creating a pool of talent for these sectors. This is complemented by international trends toward new technologies to which universities have to react. The UAE and Dubai is including these issues and these emerging specializations into its plans and it is the duty of universities to create programs in order to equip the students with the right skills and knowledge to complement the demands of the labor market. There are many formats and forums for this, and we strive to create an innovation-friendly ecosystem. For example, three years ago, TECOM Group created the in5 Incubator, an ecosystem specifically designed to launch ideas in ICT, where entrepreneurs are assisted from idea generation to market success. Following this, TECOM Group launched in5 Media, as part of its USD1.2 billion Innovation Strategy announced last year, to develop new business platforms to drive entrepreneurship and SME growth, and stimulate creativity and innovation across different sectors in the region. This should result in tangible innovations in both these sectors. In addition to this, TECOM Group launched the Dubai Institute for Design and Innovation (DIDI), which is just one of the elements that was launched in preparation for Expo 2020.</p><h4>How might the current infrastructure of the two free zones be developed to encourage business and learning?</h4><p>We try to create infrastructure that can cater to each industry. For media, for example there are studios, sound stages, and the ICT infrastructure. For education, we have specific infrastructure that caters to the requirements of academic institutions. With the growth of international campuses in the UAE, we also have infrastructure that supports robust connectivity with their main campuses. For example, Amity University came to DIAL in 2012 and immediately set up shop in one floor of a pre-built learning space, which was followed by an expansion the next year into a second floor, and, in 2016, it launched its brand new campus. Infrastructure has been put in place to help these universities be proactive and grow. We can now proudly say that we have five universities that have their roots in DIAC's main campus, and now have expanded to campuses of their own, including  Heriot Watt University, IMT, BITS Pilani, and Manipal University.</p><h4>How do you maintain standards in the education sector?</h4><p>Quality is a major concern in every field, including ICT, media, science, and education. We ask what programs they are offering and where they are coming from. Rigorous education licensing, accreditation, and high-internal quality standards also ensure that students receive the best learning services. We want to ensure that they are responsive to all the needs and demands of the market in terms of the programs of study they offer. We are also interested in minimizing unnecessary competition between universities; there is no benefit for our education sector to have large degrees of overlap where several universities compete for the same demographic of students. The international component is also key because it means that institutions are crafting curricula that have utility beyond the UAE. For example, the large number of Indian residents in the UAE has prompted our universities to develop Indian law courses, making the institutions the first to deliver law degrees approved by the Bar Council of India outside of that country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are KHDA's current plans, and how you are leading your strategy?</h4><p>Currently, the KHDA is placing a real emphasis on thinking ahead and making sure we are ready for the future challenges that will affect the education sector. Over the last 10 years, we have experienced rapid change. It is a challenging landscape, but one marked with opportunities. World Economic Forum data from 2017 suggests that 65% of children currently in primary education will eventually end up in professions that do not currently exist. To tackle the void of uncertainty that is coming, the education system needs to focus on teaching how to learn. In the future, students will have far more autonomy and flexibility over their preferred methods of learning. This shift in the traditional teacher-student power balance is inevitable, and it is something that we have to start focusing on now. Readdressing traditional methodologies is the way to do it. </p><h4>What can be done to attract and retain teachers in the UAE?</h4><p>The lack of teachers is a global phenomenon. Many governments try to fight it by stopping their teachers going abroad, or by pushing more and more people into the industry. This is not the case in the UAE. Here, the solution lies in rethinking the way we teach, harnessing new methodologies, such as digital or experiential learning and involving the whole community. If we are short of teachers, we should encourage the wider community to play a larger part in educating the younger generations. That said, Dubai is rated as one of the most attractive destinations for teachers, with an increasing number of British professionals, from various stages of their career, being drawn here because of the good reputation for educational excellence, as well as its high standard of living.</p><h4>Will the Teacher Licensing Program help achieve a higher quality of education?</h4><p>The recent Teacher Licensing Program will benefit qualified teachers who are already in the system, making them feel properly valued as well as offering some more tangible advantages, such as higher wages. It will therefore act as an incentive for non-licensed professionals to obtain their qualifications. The cabinet's target to have every teacher registered by 2021 will be a real boon for the education sector in this respect.</p><h4>How has the investment environment in the education sector developed over the past few years? <br></h4><p>The education sector has been consistently expanding. For example, in the past 10 years we have seen an average growth of around 5-7%. In 2017 alone, we have 15 new schools opening. Furthermore, the bulk of these new schools fit within the middle-segment, these offer an economy of scale for investors. Investors have realized that this is a safe investment, and because of this safety in investment we have started seeing a shift in the instruments of financing, with companies and pension funds channeling funds into the education sector. People are also placing Dubai within an international context and seeing how, compared to other cities, the regulations are more transparent.  </p><h4>What are your predictions for 2017 in the education sector?</h4><p>With the Expo 2020 imminent, our pace of growth can only increase going forward. We hope 2017 will match or preform even better than 2016, and by 2018 and 2019, we will see exponential growth. We are about four years into the preparations for Expo 2020, and have already seen rapid improvements in both physical and pedagogical infrastructure in schools and universities. In addition, the education sector has been highlighted by the government as an area of importance for the Dubai Future Accelerator, an initiative designed to help ensure our future generations are the innovators of the future. Five key areas were identified: mobility, the environment, safety and security, health, and education. The emphasis on the fifth point is crucial if we want to create the next generation of entrepreneurs here in Dubai. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Segiu Toma won bronze at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the men's judo. How can the Dubai Sports Council push for more UAE athletes to successfully compete on the global stage?</h4><p>One of our main objectives is to develop channels for young people to cultivate their sporting and cultural talents and aptitudes to enable them to achieve local, national, and international results. We have launched programs to help achieve this, namely the Champions Program for Academies, which has developed from one of the eight recommendations that came from the Sport Innovation Lab in May 2016. This program nominates and incubates talented athletes across a variety of sports, helping to boost their technical skills and introducing them to sports champions who have already represented the UAE, sharing their experiences of high sporting achievement. This will foster the environment required to support sports academies.</p><h4>During the summer Paralympics, the UAE took home seven medals. How are facilities for disabled athletes being enhanced?</h4><p>In the UAE, we believe that disabled people are an important part of our society and should have equal opportunities in all aspects of life, including sport. When the Paralympic heroes came back from the summer games, they were received and honored by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai and HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces. In terms of internal initiatives, Dubai Club for the Disabled is one of nine affiliated clubs of DSC, and it offers an array of sports. We have opened the first swimming pool designed to meet international Paralympic specifications, including safety systems, to host international championships. We also organize both the Fazza International Wheelchair Basketball Championship and the Wheelchair Basketball Championship in the Nad Al Sheba Sports Tournament (NASS). </p><h4>Involving women in sport is another unique challenge. Where is the drive coming from in terms of both mass engagement and professional development?</h4><p>Increasing the number of women engaging in sport is part of our strategic plan, and accordingly the women's sport committee has been formed to promote these two aspects. One avenue will be to organize sports events for women, one of which is the Sheikha Hind Sport Tournament, which will mobilize 500 staff members from government entities in Dubai. The events organized by the committee help to promote women in sport, highlighting opportunities to practice competitive sports in whatever capacity, which will ultimately lead to an increase in the number of professional sportswomen.</p><h4>How will the newly launched Hamdan Initiative develop and motivate the community in Dubai?</h4><p>The Hamdan Initiative targets the whole of society and aims to inspire a love and passion for sports. It is designed for people of different ages, young and old, and involves a variety of initiatives; one is a 92-km walk, covering the whole city by foot, over a series of legs, handing their walk over to other teams, who then hand it on to other teams. We have been involved on the corporate side, too. Adidas will provide stations where participants can go for a clinical survey that will assess their strength, fitness, and so on. We also have a walking program for elderly people to inspire them to stay healthier and feel better for longer. We also have a ranking system, giving five-star rankings to the top four or five events. Last year, we gave this award to Meydan, which organized the Dubai Cup, a golf and tennis tournament. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[going-the-extra-mile]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do all of Dubai Duty Free's businesses complement each other and its core operations?</h4><p>When we started Dubai Duty Free in 1983, our brief from HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, was that we would help promote Dubai and its tourism industry. Around that time the Department of Civil Aviation had built a leisure club; it was called the Aviation Club, and Dubai Duty Free was asked to manage it. We identified sport as a good route through which to promote Dubai, and we founded our tennis tournament and after that grew a number of other things. We built a 5,000 seat Dubai Duty Free Tennis Stadium, and we created The Irish Village and on the other a group of around 10 restaurants known as The Century Village. Finally, we decided to build a hotel, the Jumeirah Creekside Hotel, which last year had an occupancy rate of 87%. The Irish Village was named The Best Irish Pub in the World outside of Ireland in 2016. All of our businesses complement each other, and it is all part and parcel of Dubai Duty Free Leisure Group. We now have a second Irish Village, built on the new Dubai Parks and Resorts, where Bollywood, Riverland, Motiongate, and Legoland are, in addition to a new outlet mall.</p><h4>How has Dubai Duty Free implemented new technology, particularly in logistics?</h4><p>We have embraced new technology, for example our distribution center, which covers an area of 27,000sqm, is 95% automated. At the touch of a button, our staff in duty free know what stock we have at any given time. In our warehouse and distribution center, our staff activate the orders and a crane locates the individual items and delivers it directly to the operator. Without this level of technology we would not be able to effectively manage our business; last year we delivered 147,000 palettes of merchandise to our retail operations, all of which goes through police x-rays. This helped us turnover a total USD1.85 billion of business, and sold 74 million pieces of merchandise. We are also using technology to speed up the purchasing process with systems such as Samsung Pay. Technology is helping to make our country paperless, effective, successful, happy, and green.</p><h4>In terms of passenger numbers handled by the airport and your sales, how do arrival and departure passengers compare to transit passengers?</h4><p>Arrivals are 13% of our total business and the departing business is 87%. A large number of Emirates passengers are business transfers and would be included in the latter. The average spend of departing passengers is around USD36, which is good compared to many airports around the world.</p><h4>How will the expansion and capacity for a further 40 million passengers develop your business?</h4><p>At the moment we have 38,000sqm of retail space in operation. Of that, 2,500 is at Al Maktoum International Airport, with a capacity of 5 million passengers per year. By the end of this year it will be 26 million. Dubai Duty Free will have 4,000sqm of retail space by the end of this year and if you go forward to 2025 there will be a new terminal building at Al Maktoum International, two new concourses, a six-track rail system underground for passenger movements, three runways in operation, and the capacity of the airport will have risen to 135 million and Dubai Duty Free will have 80,000sqm of retail space. Around 72% of everything we buy and sell in duty free is bought locally from the agents, so we are contributing largely to the economy in Dubai. We are expecting that our business by 2020 will be USD3 billion a year in sales; it was USD1.85 billion last year. At the moment we have over 5,900 staff. By then, we will have 9,000. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Reaching  New Heights]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[reaching-new-heights]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In line with the innovation directive of the government, how are you trying to foster creativity in biotech and pharmaceutical sectors? </h4><p>We have positioned ourselves from the start as a vehicle and a bridge to innovation from West to East, hence the name NewBridge. We had successfully partnered with a number of global pharmaceutical companies whom elected to operate in the region through NewBridge services and resources. We are very focused on bringing innovative therapeutics or disruptive technologies that address unmet medical needs or improve the quality of a patient's life compared to the standard of care. What we do today falls right into the new directive by the UAE government of fostering innovation, because we offer the necessary platform and structure to these innovative companies to come to the region, partner with a capable regional company, and provide access to their innovation across multiple geographies in MENA. We are very proud to be operating from a country so progressive like the UAE, which offers the right business environment and acts as a regional magnet and hub for talent in the pharmaceutical field.</p><h4>Do you find that product penetration and market access is easier in emerging markets because the healthcare sector is smaller? </h4><p>Product access is not necessarily dependent on size of the market, it is more about the healthcare structure, market segments, the payers, processes and funding of medicines. For example, the MENA pharmaceutical markets hold great potential and is expected to be one of the fastest growing markets with an estimated CAGR of 9-11% in the period between 2015-2020. However, at the same time, there are many challenges that could stifle this growth such as the regulatory pathways, which can be long and arduous — although we have seen progressive efforts lately to improve that in a number of key countries. Reference pricing mechanisms and price controls also pose a risk, as does absence of adequate insurance coverage in many markets in MENA, leaving a big portion of its population to procure medicines out of pocket, which can be burdensome. However, as of late we have seen significant improvement on the health insurance side in some GCC countries.  </p><h4>How do you differentiate your services from the competition? </h4><p>We have the rigor of big pharmaceutical companies but the agility and entrepreneurship of small companies. We have very demanding standards and processes, crucial to operate in this industry, but at the same time, we can move fast in our decisions and be innovative and agile in our strategies. We also have institutional investors, mainly healthcare industry investors from San Francisco; the venture arm of Kuwait's sovereign fund, KLSC; and the Kuwait Investment Authority, KIA.  What this means is that we are institutional in the way we operate and in the way we are backed, and that is how we differentiate ourselves from competition with same business model.  </p><h4>Do you intend to conduct any mergers and acquisitions?</h4><p>The global pharmaceutical industry is very fragmented. For example, the market share of the largest pharma company in the world makes up less than 6-7% of the market. That has always been the case, and the reason behind the many mergers and acquisitions in this industry.  However, today companies realized that bigger does not necessarily equate to better. There are global biopharma companies with work force less than one tenth of big pharma, yet their market cap rivals their big pharma counterpart. For us, M&amp;As and inorganic growth are key strategic imperatives in our journey forward, and we have gone into several selective bids before towards that direction. We are active in this space and constantly looking for a good fit and opportunity, which will create added value to our portfolio as well as our company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There have been liquidity issues around construction and real estate, and although no large projects were cancelled, there has been a delay on some major real estate and a 92% decline on construction projects awarded in the 1H2016. How is the CSCEC maintaining activity during these issues around the sector?</h4><p>Due to the low oil prices coupled with a global slump, government expenditure was reduced. In the Middle East, the construction sector has slowed down to a certain extent and, as a contractor, we have been trying very hard to diversify ourselves. From our base in Dubai we are looking after operations in the GCC, which allows us to have some more choice. For example, for the past two years we have been doing well in the Kuwaiti market, which has helped us to balance the slowdown in the other countries. Over the past 10 years, we have established a reputation and long-term partnership with most of our clients. We are receiving tender invitations and signing contracts from repeat customers that include government developers and major private development companies. We are also trying to bring in project financing and funding to ensure the client can start the project promptly with adequate backing. Instead of remaining as a contractor, we are trying to become a developer as well.</p><h4>What specific sectors, both locally and regionally, look attractive for CSCEC?</h4><p>The real estate market is still quite active, and when comparing 2008 to today, there is probably less government involvement in this sector. Private investors remain very active and there is good reason to believe in the future of Dubai. There is transport infrastructure to be developed here, as well as a lot of additional tourist attractions such as Dubai Park and Dubai Water Canal. Once they start the new airport it will trigger more construction and attract more professionals to the region, the UAE, and Dubai.</p><h4>Out of the sectors of tourism, general infrastructure, transport, and trade infrastructure, is there a particular sector that the company will prioritize?</h4><p>As per the Chinese government's initiative for One Belt, One Road, we are very much interested in infrastructure. Megaproject infrastructure, like the Etihad Railway, ports, and the airport, is one of our core businesses. We have been following this market for many years within the region. Hopefully, with the improvements in oil prices, the government will have the luxury of a deeper budget in order to spark more investment in this sector.</p><h4>A 5% VAT will be implemented in 2018, with full integration by 2019. How will that affect your business?</h4><p>It will have a certain impact, and we are yet to understand the full and real impact. We have a general understanding that the consumer will probably pay for the extra 5% at the end of the day. However, in certain cases we are likely also the end user, so it is likely that our construction costs will become higher. All in all, it is likely that the end result will be an increase in company expenses. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Growth along the right lines]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[growth-along-the-right-lines]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has DLC evolved in the last years?</h4><p>Our first location in Dubai Galeria was established roughly 30 years ago, with two doctors and three other staff members. Today we have treated over one million patients across three branches in Dubai and a fully-fledged hospital with a total of 130 personnel. Dubai has developed and changed tremendously in every aspect over the last 30 years, and the health sector is no exception. We grew in parallel with the Emirate. When we opened there weren't any multidisciplinary medical clinics; they were largely single doctor operations that were run as such. The growth of Dubai and its large expat population increased the demand for the kind of multidisciplinary clinic model that we offered. When we started, Dubai had about 150 clinics. 30 years on we are the only one that has survived. The way we set up our health business is something that guaranteed not just our long-term survival, but our prosperity. Now there are 2,500 clinics in Dubai and the health sector has grown massively. It takes a while to establish your brand in the market, but we have achieved that over 30 years, and although we are not one of the largest, we are considered one of the best. We pay attention to health standards, quality, and customer service, and that has paid off. We would like to open another branch and a center of excellence, a European-style program, which would be the first of its kind in the UAE. We also want to build a new outpatient department that would also enable us to expand our inpatient department. </p><h4>How will you be contributing to and participating in Dubai's mission to become a medical tourism hub?</h4><p>Dubai has a lot of potential to become an international medical tourism hub. There are people living here and visiting from all over the world, and it is in a strategic location between Europe and the Far East. The problem is keeping up with demand, which is a good problem to have, but a problem nonetheless. For us to contribute to this medical tourism ambition, we have to grow, and grow quickly. Right now, we are trying to meet local demand, but eventually we would like to attract more and more foreign medical tourists. We have been looking into establishing a presence in the UK, as a gateway to the European market. Of course, medical tourism involves more than just medical care. It involves top-notch facilities, hospitality, tour packages, competitive pricing, transport, logistics, marketing and promotional activities, travel planning, visa issues, accommodating family members, and so on. Whatever we develop, we are certain to dovetail with the government's initiative; we will definitely be involved one way or another.</p><h4>Do you expect to see more M&amp;As in the UAE health sector?</h4><p>That is a general trend that seeks to create economies of scale, which can make operations more efficient through size, and also enable businesses to take on larger and more ambitious projects. However, we are not a part of that process and are not interested in either acquiring or merging, or in being acquired. Our growth has been organic and we plan to continue that.  </p><h4>Dubai's medical sector is expected to grow at an annual rate of 13% by 2021. What is your outlook for Dubai's medical sector in the long term?</h4><p>There is a bright future for the medical sector in Dubai, and its strong growth will continue. Considering the explosion of clinics and services in just the last 30 years, that phenomenal growth will most likely continue. We will continue to do what we have been doing for the past three decades. We have no intention of changing our policy or vision. It has served us and our patients well until now and will likely continue to do so in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the major lessons from the acquisition of Al Noor so far?</h4><p>Firstly, Abu Dhabi is a different business environment from Dubai. The differences are vast in terms of the economic situation, the regulatory environment, the government involvement, and the medical insurance market. We anticipated most of this beforehand, but the impact on the business has been greater than we expected. A major challenge has been the integration of the people and the distinct cultures of the two companies. We have retrenched over 400 people from the Al Noor campus in this integration and removed a lot of duplicate roles. Many of the facilities that we acquired need upgrading. The company was partially owned by a private equity company, which often results in delayed spending when they are going to sell it. We have also been working hard to get the right people in place in the right positions, which takes time.</p><h4>The Health Authority Abu Dhabi has reduced the insurance coverage for Emiratis under the Thiqa plan and for expatriates and their families under Daman Insurance's Abu Dhabi Basic Plan. What effect has this had?</h4><p>It has had a significant impact on our business and has made us reconsider future investments. Regarding Thiqa coverage specifically, which was announced on July 1, 2016, for all Thiqa members there would be 20% co-payment in the Abu Dhabi private sector and a 50% co-payment in Dubai. It is basically a directive to use government and semi-government (Mubadala) hospitals, which could be viewed as an anti-private move. We think that whilst a co-payment is an effective mechanism to manage utilization, it needs to be applied to the entire healthcare industry,  be enforced, and should exclude certain uncontrollable services. The only providers currently exempt from collecting the co-payments are the Cleveland Clinic and Mubadala facilities, which does not support a level playing field within the private sector.</p><h4>What initiatives could be taken to achieve a more sustainable healthcare system?</h4><p>To manage quality, you need a proper ethical framework and environment, this should be the main focus of the regulators. There is a lot of corruption and fraud in the Abu Dhabi and Dubai healthcare market amongst certain providers, such as payment for referrals, payment for tests, non-collection of co-payments for example, which Mediclinic does not tolerate or advocate. This is causing problems in terms of quality and in terms of cost. Incorrectly aligned incentives such as payment for referrals and tests results in overutilization and thus inflates the cost. The second issue is that prices are too low in the Abu Dhabi market and people need to realize that if they want quality healthcare they will have to pay for it. That is why only correctly priced medical insurance networks support patients visiting Mediclinic facilities in Dubai. You cannot get to Mediclinic if you are on a AED600 a year health insurance premium, it is quite simple to calculate that those metrics will never stack up.</p><h4>In what ways did the acquisition of Al Noor create more value for your shareholders?</h4><p>It actually lost value for our shareholders in the short term because we paid a high price for Al Noor, but that is what you pay for healthcare companies these days. What the acquisition did do was to give us the ability to list in London and to grow the business. We used to be listed in Johannesburg, but the capital markets are a lot more fluid in London than in Johannesburg. Secondly, we were looking to grow into Abu Dhabi, and Al Noor was looking to grow into Dubai, so it made sense from a geographic point of view. It takes a long time to build a hospital, so if you can acquire a facility, upgrade it, change it, it would only take one or two years instead of five. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Hill International's growth achieved during the economic downturn?</h4><p>At the outset of the economic downturn, we were well diversified and well positioned to tender for regional megaprojects. Recently, we worked on the Muscat and Salalah airports; have partnered with another company on the Midfield Terminal Airport in Abu Dhabi; and exclusively manage construction of the Bahrain Airport. We began working on rail projects such as the Green Line and the Losail tram in Qatar, in addition to three rail lines with a local partner in Riyadh. We also expanded into the health sector with 13 hospitals in Saudi Arabia, one in Kuwait, and another in Abu Dhabi. Whereas previously we mostly worked with private SME companies, there has been a significant regional push for large government-sponsored megaprojects, which forced us to reconsider our focus. By adapting to the market trends and diversifying our portfolio in the region, we were able to healthily grow in a period of economic uncertainty.</p><h4>How do regional conflicts affect operations in the Middle East?</h4><p>The conflicts and instability in Yemen and Syria, and before that in Libya and Iraq, have an obvious and direct effect on our projects in the Middle East. While conflicts have undoubtedly had their effect on the markets of the Middle East, the drop in oil prices in the last few years and the recent recovery of those prices also had an effect. However, I am hoping for the conflicts to find resolution by the end of 2017. We still have a presence in some of these countries and hope to be able to assist in the rebuilding process that inevitably takes place. </p><h4>Can you describe your operations in Dubai and trends in the region? </h4><p>One of our foundational partnerships is our 15-year agreement with ADNOC, which is tendered and renewed every three years. We do various projects with it, ranging from consulting services to project management. We are also managing other massive projects such as the Etihad Towers, the Hilton, the Nation Towers, the Sky Towers, and the Sun Towers on Reem Island. We are also working on 36 tower projects in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and have been in these locations for over seven years. One of our most exciting projects in the region is the KFD rail project in Saudi Arabia worth USD7.7 billion. In Dubai, the rest of the region followed; we have seen both clients and the market become more sophisticated and demand a new structured approach to professionalism and quality products. Dubai set this regional trend by insisting upon quality and efficiency at the beginning of the development boom and every individual project. Now, there is an emergence of local, highly educated engineers who know exactly what and how things need to be done and are executing their vision precisely. This is helpful for us because when the client understands what needs to be delivered, the processes and procedures are far easier and smoother to implement.</p><h4>How will 2017 look for Hill International?</h4><p>Our prospects are exciting and positive in 2018 and beyond. Megaprojects like the World Cup in Qatar and Expo 2020 in Dubai offer a great deal of potential. We foresee Saudi Arabia offering social projects such as hospitals and public housing as well as a renewed push for PPP projects. We also expect Oman to begin larger developments with direct private sector involvement. Currently, we focus on working with clients who require a high level of specificity on larger projects. If one is building their own house and know how they want it, then they do not need a partner. But if one is building a city, even if they have clear vision, they need partners. Current and future market booms require various infrastructure projects such as roads, hospitals, high-rise housing, and rail lines. As quality is the new currency, governments are looking more for partnership with the private sector to ensure efficiency and expertise. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key aims of your new initiatives?</h4><p>The UAE national space program consists of four main areas of focus or programs. Our aim is to build a sustainable and ambitious space sector in the UAE, which will promote scientific innovation and technological advancement. One of these areas is the national satellite program. We have been working on different satellite projects for the past 12-13 years including DubaiSat-1, DubaiSat-2, KahlifaSat, and Nayif-1. Currently, we have reached a point where we can develop and build our own satellites. The second program is the UAE national astronaut program, which started in 1Q2017. It is an initiative of the UAE government to launch a sustainable astronaut program, whereby we choose the best of the best. We will have an astronaut corps for the next 25-30 years. The third program is the Mars 2117 initiative, which was launched by the UAE government and will be led by MBRSC. It is a long-term plan that we call a generational plan because three to four generations will work to create a sustainable colony on Mars in 100 years' time. The fourth and final initiative is the Emirates Mars Mission. This will be the first object to leave Earth's orbit sent from a country in this region.</p><h4>How are you developing and training astronauts?</h4><p>Becoming an astronaut requires a unique and rare skillset. There are certain countries that have the capability to send astronauts into space as well as to train these astronauts. We want to do these things at the same time. We have to partner with countries like the US or Russia, or the EU, which have training facilities to train theses astronauts. At the same time, we want to work with these partners to bring those training facilities to the country or at least execute the proficiency training here so that we can do as much of it as we can in country. The first batch would be trained abroad, and the future batches and proficiency training will be conducted here. Before an astronaut goes up into space, he/she may have to be trained for at least two or three years just for that mission. We want to have a broad range of astronauts with a different range of skillsets, and then go from there; they could be military test pilots, scientists, engineers, and doctors, teachers, and so on.</p><h4>What are the satellites being used for these days? </h4><p>MBRSC had two goals when we first began the national satellite program. These were to first develop and train a team so they are able to build and design satellites in the UAE. At the same time, the goal was to develop satellites that would be useful to the UAE government and private entities, and provide a service. What we focused on developing was earth observation satellites rather than communication satellites as the latter already existed in the UAE. Our satellites take images of the globe that can be used for disaster monitoring, vegetation tracking, urban planning, and environmental monitoring, an example of which would be the water levels in dams after rainfall. These kinds of services are provided by DubaiSat1 and DubaiSat2. The difference in the satellite is the improved resolution of the images so the detail is much better.</p><h4>How do space ambitions fit into the happiness and smart city agenda?</h4><p>Satellite and space technology is in everything that we do today. Dubai seeks to be one of the smartest cities and looks to become a green city, with around 50% of all our power by 2050 solar. As an example, the easiest way to track that is to take an image of Dubai in February, take an image of Dubai in March, and then see if there are any new solar panels. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>From where have you seen the greatest need when looking at your clients?</h4><p>One of the greatest needs of our clients is operational efficiency.  We believe strongly in the return on investment in training. For example, in drilling, we create simulator scenarios using information and data from actual wells to train people to prepare for what they are going to encounter. We know that there are many challenges, such as stuck pipes that lead to downtime on a rig or challenges with competency in areas like managed pressure drilling (MPD), jack-up operations, operating cyber-based rigs, vessel operations, dynamic positioning, and working in teams. The industry in the region loses tens of millions of dollars annually due to downtime incidents that can be easily avoided by addressing the underlying issues around competency and people skills. Along with upskilling the veterans, we are working on building the talent pipeline. There are many people leaving the industry because of the ageing worker pool, and the industry will not be able to solve this problem without attracting young people. Young people have to be nurtured and brought up to speed on technology. This is where what we have set up becomes critical in shortening this learning curve. </p><h4>Has it been a challenge for you to train seasoned rig workers who are not used to such a practice?</h4><p>We are used to working with crews of various backgrounds, and we have always taken their experience into consideration when we develop our training programs. We look at the delegates coming into our course to evaluate whether our program is suitable. We also assess people once they have done the course and gone on board the rigs. We are looking at the full picture and evaluating how we impact operations and how we can be a real strategic partner. We want to 'connect the dots' for customers and have simple off-the-shelf products as well as our specialized and advanced courses. With 10 training centers around the world and thousands of industry veterans being trained every year, we do consider this our core area of expertise. However, along with industry veterans, we are especially interested in the nationalization programs and how we can be a part of it. In the rapidly evolving dynamics of the industry, we believe it is important to have a fresh approach towards the next wave of entrants. Therefore, we are keen to work with national, regional, and international stakeholders across the industry. </p><h4>What are the key programs that people are looking for in the maritime area?</h4><p>One of our key maritime programs is dynamic positioning. We are one of the few organizations in the region that have both basic and advanced dynamic positioning. In addition to the usual competency training that is common on the maritime side, we also have a large focus on human factor training. Some courses involve occupational psychologists to evaluate people and determine when maritime promotions are appropriate. This gives a well-designed 360-degree perspective on the individual so that they know why they are or are not ready to advance to the next leadership position. In any industry with assets that are extremely expensive, a great deal of objective evaluations is needed to know they have the best people running those multi-million dollar assets. That is something with which we can aid organizations through insights gained from over 40 years in the industry. We also do other courses for reducing fuel consumption and anchor handling operations, which increase operational efficiency and safety. We also try to help with safety at the ports and terminals on the logistics side. We are trying to do something proactive after the unfortunate Tianjin disaster, which resulted in nearly 200 casualties in China. We are working toward creating greater awareness around dangerous goods, and how to deal with them. It is critical for everybody to be more aware, from customer service to sales, to management. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-wide-portfolio]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nakheel is developing the largest mall portfolio in the Middle East and, with the retail sector maintaining growth at 5%; what is Nakheel's strategy in developing its mall portfolio?</h4><p>We are investing AED16 billion to bring our total retail leasing space to more than 17 million square feet, which will make us the largest retail developer in the region. First and foremost,  we are expanding to better service our existing communities, such as  Palm Jumeirah, Al Furjan, Discovery Gardens and International City.  Previously, these all needed enhanced services and facilities, and when we looked to introduce retail centres in these and other areas we had excellent responses from the retailers. With most of our retail developments — be they large-scale destination malls or smaller scale community retail developments — we have managed to secure a high level of pre-leases even before starting construction. For example, our Night Souk at Deira Islands was 100% pre-leased before construction began and we do not usually break ground with anything less than 70%. This has been most encouraging and is all part of our strategy directed towards enhancing our recurring income. We are increasing this stream of revenue through residential leasing, retail, hospitality, and F&amp;B. Our focus is on diversifying across the board and we feel positive about this policy due to the quality of our locations. In our sector you must have favourable locations, and we have that in abundance.  We are introducing new F&amp;B/leisure facilities in the form of Nakheel Clubs at some of our communities, complementing our existing, highly-popular Clubs at Jumeirah Islands and Jebel Ali Village. Overall, we have studied and planned for where we expect to be in 2020—with an AED7 billion bottom line. In terms of large-scale destination projects, we are currently developing malls at Palm Jumeirah, Jumeirah Village, Nad Al Sheba,and Deira Islands as well as further extending our existing Ibn Battuta Mall and Dragon Mart retail hubs, where significant first-phase expansions opened last year.</p><h4>What has been the key driver for Nakheel's diversification strategy?</h4><p>Markets fluctuate so we need a strong base to maintain growth. It's that simple. In previous years, Nakheel very much concentrated on taking on a good quantity of projects with an acute focus on development, but strategically we thought it essential to have diversity in our portfolio. We continue to move ahead with new retail, hospitality and residential leasing projects while also maintaining our core business of development.  We have more projects to be announced and are always open to new ideas as to how to further diversify the portfolio. We think that is imperative and we think long term because no business can succeed through shortsightedness. We are confident that the business is on the right trajectory.</p><h4>You continue to report healthy profits,  largely driven by decisions to invest in income-generating assets. How was this strategized and delivered?</h4><p>The strategy was to generate more recurring income and we have certainly moved toward that goal. We will see greater results as a result of that strategy by next year, and that will have a positive impact on the balance sheet and will ultimately replicate itself year on year. We have many projects under construction; for example, in Nad Al Sheba we have 1,400 new units in the residential segment.  In the retail segment we have Al Khail Avenue, Nakheel Mall, Deira Mall and The Pointe,  adding to recently completed retail projects  such as Jumeirah Islands Pavilion and Dragon Mart 2. On the residential leasing side, we have Golden Mile 3 on Palm Jumeirah, where leasing began earlier this year.  We have more than 20,0000 residential leasing units in the pipeline.</p><h4>Nakheel is planning to deliver another 5,800 hotel rooms and apartments leading up to 2020. How is the company differentiating itself in this competitive sector?</h4><p>When it comes to hospitality projects it's a matter of location — and we have very strong locations. We are concentrating on securing good returns by focusing on the mid-scale segment, for which there is a great need in Dubai, although we also have some luxury hotels in our project range, too. On The Palm we have the five-star St. Regis, plus we have a luxury hotel component in our new PALM 360 project. However, most of our expansion is on the mid-scale side.  Currently we have two hotels operating; one next to Ibn Battuta and one next to Dragon Mart, and we are more than happy with their performance. Construction has started on our hotel at Al Khail Avenue, for which Double Tree by Hilton will be the operator, and at two new hotels at Dragon Mart and Ibn Battuta Mall.    We have released a construction tender for our joint venture project with RIU Hotels &amp; Resorts at Deira Islands. The St Regis, part of The Palm Tower on Palm Jumeirah, is also currently being built. Overall, we are making big strides and are working hard to bring new names to Dubai to add variety to the existing players in the market. We are looking at partnerships and we are talking to new companies that are very much interested in cooperating with us on a similar model to our joint ventures with Spain's RIU and Thailands's Centara Hotels &amp; Resorts, both of which are under development at Deira Islands, our new waterfont city. The RIU is a new concept for Dubai: an all-inclusive, family beach front resort with 800 rooms. Our second joint venture, with Centara, is for a 550-room resort, also at Deira Islands.  We continue to explore new partnerships for hospitality where we bring in international, reputable brand to invest with us as partner, not purely as an operator.</p><h4>Why do you feel that the middle-income segment is becoming more important for the hospitality and residential sectors?</h4><p>With hospitality we believe catering for this segment is a must for Nakheel, as we are part of the Dubai Government with a key role to play within its strategy to bring 20 million tourists to Dubai each year by 2020.  This segment is a major focus for our hospitality business. <br> On the residential side, people have a lot of choice, and if they cannot afford it they can lease and have options to move. I think that is a different segment. We are focusing on niche markets within the residential area in order to minimize risk.</p><h4>Last year, Nakheel repaid a AED4.4 billion bond, issued back in 2011. What advantages has that given the company?</h4><p>We are now completely debt-free following full payment of our trade creditor in sukuk last August.  This repayment marked the end of our financial restructuring, which began in August 2011, with all creditor obligations now fulfilled. In a commercial sense we always look for the best option, and a bond is not the cheapest. We have a healthy balance sheet, a lot of assets, and a few banks have been in touch with us stating that they are more than happy to supply capital. When it comes to borrowing, banks see our vision, our strategy, our growth—they see that we are growing in a healthy and resilient manner. Our vision is to build a bigger portfolio and drive recurring income. We are diversifying more and more, and we are constantly looking at new ideas. It is important not to hedge everything on one strategy. The market may have cooled down, but we had the funds to pay our debt due to our continued diversity. For 2017 our recurring income will comfortably exceed AED2 billion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2016 saw a difficult period for the companies and ports that operate within the seaborne trade. How has the IMO incentivized activity while margins continue to be squeezed?</h4><p>We can all recognize that in these uncertain times, the only real certainty is that the way ahead will be challenging. As a United Nations agency, our role is not to incentivize activity but to develop and adopt a global regulatory regime for shipping that embraces the highest practicable standards of maritime safety and security, efficiency of navigation, and prevention and control of pollution from ships. This is backed by an extensive program of technical assistance and capacity building, to ensure that, once adopted, the standards can be implemented evenly and effectively. There is no room to cut corners when it comes to safety and protecting the environment. Statistics show a continuing upward trend in trade by ship. In 2015, estimated world seaborne trade volumes surpassed 10 billion tons according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development Review of Maritime Transport. Nonetheless, over-capacity has kept freight and charter rates low.</p><h4>How can the IMO ensure efforts toward sustainability are unified and bridge vested interests?</h4><p>IMO provides a forum where all stakeholders can come together to review proposed regulations and guidance. All member states have equal status at IMO meetings. And international non-governmental organizations, representing a wide variety of interests from ship owners to environmental groups, can participate fully in meetings as observers. When a technical sub-committee is discussing a very specific piece of technical regulation, all interests can be considered during the decision-making process. Shipping does need to meet the challenge of remaining sustainable while meeting the increasingly stringent demands of global society in terms of safety and environmental performance. The world is no longer prepared to accept services or industries that are simply cost-effective. We now demand them to be safe, green, and clean, as well as efficient. Through IMO, governments have sought to ensure that shipping responds to this challenge and the significant improvements in casualty and pollution figures from ships over several decades clearly show that we have achieved considerable success in this regard. What we see at IMO is a common interest in developing regulations that are applied globally to all ships, and we see a strong desire to work together so that no one is left behind.</p><h4>What can we expect from the thrust of the IMO's 2018-2023 strategic framework?</h4><p>The IMO has been undertaking an important strategic planning exercise to present the next IMO Assembly, to be held at the end of 2017 with a proposed new strategic framework for the 2018-2023 period. So far, a number of specific strategic directions for the organization have been identified. The first is a continued focus on improving implementation. IMO has developed more than 50 international treaties and related standards, which must be implemented by member states as they have the obligation to ratify and implement the international treaty instruments that are adopted as IMO conventions. We need to ensure that regulations are effectively, efficiently, and consistently implemented and enforced. A second major priority is new technology, so balancing the benefits against careful regulatory consideration, as mentioned already. In the future, I do expect technology will create a more interconnected and efficient industry, more closely integrated with the whole global supply chain. Responding to climate change will continue to be a vital strategic direction for IMO. IMO will continue to develop appropriate, ambitious, and realistic solutions to minimize shipping's contribution to air pollution and its impact on climate change. A further strategic goal will be to help international shipping operate more effectively from an administrative perspective. By this, we mean addressing things like arrival and departure formalities, documentation, and certification, and generally reducing the administrative burdens that surround ship operation. Finally, we plan to increase the overall effectiveness of IMO, and in this I include the member states,NGOs, donors, and the secretariat—indeed all the many stakeholders in the organization as a whole. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DMCA recently signed an agreement to work with DNV GL on smart shipping, digitalization, big data, and real-time information management initiatives. What brought that partnership about?</h4><p>To make Dubai a first-class international maritime gateway, we need to invest in the areas of research, innovation, and advanced technology while simultaneously promoting the sharing of knowledge and experiences. This includes addressing environmental, safety, and quality concerns in the local maritime industry. Combining all these factors has led to the birth of the DMCA's partnership with DNV GL. By working together, we will be able to drive growth and innovation at both local and regional levels, as well as ensuring the highest standards of safety and quality within Dubai's maritime community. The agreement reflects our willingness to optimize opportunities and leverage digital developments to create a sustainable, well-respected, and world-class local maritime environment.</p><h4>How do you expect the newly launched Dubai Maritime Virtual Cluster (DMVC) to increase cooperation and service provision between companies in the sector?</h4><p>The DMVC is an interactive platform developed to facilitate engagement and communication among local maritime clusters as well as members of the global maritime sector. These services include arbitration, training, classification, insurance, finance, brokerage, shipping, ports, shipbuilding and repair, licensing, the establishment of companies in free and non-free zones, marine recreational services, and others. We aim to boost the confidence of regional and international investors in Dubai as well as highlight the Emirate's position as one of the world's important maritime hubs and the role of the sector in the economic diversification policy. We believe that such efforts will result in substantial foreign investments that will influence further economic growth. Another is to raise the local maritime community's competitiveness in alignment with the Dubai Maritime Sector Strategy, facilitating access to our integrated portfolio of smart maritime services. And lastly, we hope to showcase our key initiatives designed to make Dubai the world's smartest and happiest city. Through the DMVC, channels of communication between influential global players will be improved, strengthening constructive cooperation to ultimately increase the quality of initiatives supporting innovation, research and development, disaster recovery efforts, maritime safety, carbon footprint reduction, sustainability, and key marketing activities.</p><h4>How has the maritime sector continued to be a significant part of the economy, despite global economic headwinds?</h4><p>Like all other sectors, the global maritime industry has faced strong challenges due to lower commodity prices and currency fluctuations. Despite the challenging conditions, DMCA's full-year and recent output illustrates our robust growth. We are optimistic about gaining momentum in trade in the mid- to long-term outlook and remain committed to deliver as per market requirements. Dubai will continue to have a flourishing maritime sector that aims to be one of the world's safest, sustainable, and integrated maritime destinations. This will be reinforced through the Maritime Sector Strategy; ensuring the local maritime sector remains competitive and maintains its development abreast of regional and global developments.</p><h4>What factors are you focusing on for 2017 and ahead?</h4><p>For 2017 and beyond, we are looking at strengthening several key components to further reinforce Dubai's global status as the fifth-most competitive and attractive maritime cluster in the world, according to a report released by Menon Business Economic Group in Singapore. In terms of the Dubai Maritime Cluster Office and the Maritime Creativity Lab, our focus areas are the interactive smart platform encouraging innovative ideas for developing integrated strategies to improve the performance, safety, efficiency, and competitiveness of the local marine sector. The Dubai Maritime Sector Strategy will continue to transform Dubai into one of the world's most important maritime centers. It will not only strengthen the key components of the local maritime sector, including ports, imports and exports, and financing services, but will also develop logistics and maritime services to maximize growth opportunities for ship owners, brokers, and maritime finance and insurance companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why are multimodal transport links important for trade, and what has been DP World's role in their development locally and globally?</h4><p>Connecting multi-modal transport, industrial parks, economic zones, ports, and terminals through a focus on infrastructure so that trade is enabled and business can develop is essential. The Jebel Ali Free Zone experience in Dubai is a success due to supportive infrastructure and government policies. Our flagship Jebel Ali Port together with the free zone has become a model for multi-modal transport corridors around the world. We have grown into 'knowledge exporters,' advising governments like Kazakhstan and Indonesia on how to develop local and regional trade. London Gateway and DP World Caucedo are other examples where a business park and a free zone were developed to support trade and business growth. Our experience has also taught us that soft infrastructure is every bit as significant as roads, railways, and pipelines.</p><h4>How have DP World's investments increased over the last two years?</h4><p>The acquisition of Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai and Prince Rupert in Canada were key drivers of our strong results in 2016. Also in Canada, we signed a long-term lease agreement for the expansion and operation of the multipurpose Rodney Container Terminal at Saint John, New Brunswick. We also partnered with Caisse de dépí´t et placement du Québec (CDPQ) to create a co-investment platform of USD3.7 billion. Meanwhile, we now operate the multi-purpose Port of Berbera in Somaliland and have an inland container and warehousing facility in Kigali, Rwanda. We also signed an MoU to develop a logistics zone near the international airport. Elsewhere, we signed a 50-year concession for the development of a greenfield multi-purpose port project at Posorja, Ecuador. We also started the construction of a new and modern logistics terminal in Lurin district of Peru. In Asia, we are involved with the government of Kazakhstan for the development of a special economic zone in Aktau, further boosting trade and logistics in the country. In July this year, we signed an agreement with the Indonesian government and port officials to advise on the development of the Kuala Tanjung greenfield port and logistics zone and Belawan port in North Sumatra. We also provide similar services under a separate contract with Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ) for the development of the Khorgos Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and Inland Container Depot (ICD). We signed an agreement with Taiwan International Ports Corporation to potentially develop Kaohsiung Port's Terminal 7. DP World Limassol, Cyprus was awarded a 25-year concession for the exclusive right to operate the multipurpose terminal. A new modern terminal designed to accommodate the largest operating cruise vessels is scheduled to open in the summer at DP World Limassol port. The new terminal consists of seven pods with an internal area of 7,000sqm. Simultaneously, P&amp;O Maritime Cyprus, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DP World Limited, was also awarded a 15-year concession to exclusively provide a full range of port marine services at the port of Limassol. In Russia, we formed a JV with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to invest in port and port-related assets. In May, we also signed an MoU with the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) to further develop the logistics sector in India. We will seek opportunities in the country worth over USD1 billion over the next few years. This will be aimed at development of port infrastructure of the Sagarmala project, creation of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, river transportation and cold chain storage, and investment in port-led SEZs, free trade zones, ICDs, and cruise terminals. These investments reflect market needs, and we will continue to develop trade solutions where our customers want us to be.</p><h4>What can other markets learn from your experience of developing inland ports and other complementary businesses?</h4><p>Having a dedicated industrial and logistics facility adjoining a port means greater efficiency for business. For example, cargo that requires processing can be handled within hours of arriving at Jebel Ali. The port is at the center of a sophisticated transport network, with excellent land, air, and sea connections. Al Maktoum International Airport already adds enormously to its logistical benefits, and this will only increase as the airport expands. We have also identified ways to diversify our business, which is essential to meeting the demands of changing and emerging markets. We seek to develop end-to-end value propositions for clients. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunity is there to integrate IT products into surgical prosthesis and diagnostic systems to increase patient provision?</h4><p>The electronic healthcare record (EHR) is moving away from being simply a data collection tool and toward supplementing the duties of an automated physician. The best EHRs of today, such as Cerner's, is similar to an on-call physician. Previously, if a patient was becoming sick, a doctor would have to look at a chart and look for trends in the vital signs to determine if there is a problem. Today with the vast power of computers and the excellent data that is collected throughout the care process, computers who are looking for trends can spot them instantly.  For instance, if there is information about the patient in terms of the strengthening or weakening of a particular body system, the computer can alter the physician or care team instantly versus waiting until a person reads the chart or visits with the patient.  Additionally, there are much more capabilities to send data from everywhere into the medical record.  From home, from schools, from clinics, etc.  This free flow of medical data from physician offices, clinics, and hospitals to one another and back into EHRs is called data liquidity.  Now, rather than doctors spending time questioning the patient and trying to read thousands of pieces of paper, the computer assists the doctor and their time is better spent analyzing various healthcare solutions proposed and discussing options with the patient.</p><h4>How do you balance the traditional aspects of healthcare with modern trends that embrace technology and innovation, and reduce patient-doctor contact time? </h4><p>Our philosophy is to give the caregivers as much direct interaction with the patients as possible and in this way minimize the impact of technology. Having the capability to absorb data in its liquid form is important because it will minimize repetition of data entry. In the healthcare industry, efficiency means the more patients a doctor can effectively consult, the better. That means that as an EHR provider we must make our system very fast, smart, easy to navigate, very intuitive, and simple for the physician to use. In the future we are going to see a shift to consumer-based healthcare where, like taxis and ride sharing companies, we must innovate and adapt to provide patients with more choice, flexibility, and ease without sacrificing quality. For instance, if a patient is ill and prefers to not leave the house, telemedicine will have to enable a virtual visit with a physician and deliver prescription drugs to the patient's house via Uber or drone. Another worldwide trend in medicine is the shift toward wellness and being able to impact a patient's wellbeing simply by educating them. Future consumer-based healthcare providers are going to be more focused on coaching and helping people achieve their goals rather than prescribing and diagnosing. Whereas large providers tend to make business decisions based on profit margin and typically evolve slower, in the near future there will be smaller and more nimble care providers providing efficiency and innovation at a lower cost.  This new ability and the popularity of preventative care will eventually be the primary focus rather than the focus on the more expensive, traditional procedures.</p><h4>How are you working with a fairly fragmented market, with 100 hospitals and 2,000 clinics across the UAE?</h4><p>Unlike the majority of healthcare markets where there are silos of information between the hospital and clinic systems, here in the region 100% of all Cerner clients leverage one system for all of their venues of care, including clinics, school health, home visits, etc.  allowing a seamless exchange of data. In our global experience and industry research, this is the most effective approach to digitalize healthcare. Otherwise when there is gaps in information, the patient does not usually receive the best outcomes. For example, if a patient comes into the hospital Emergency department with a headache we can immediately inform the doctor that the patient might be behind on their diabetes medication or has a chronic condition that they have not been treated for in the last six months.   The second strategy Cerner is deploying in conjunction with the first is an effort to proactively manage people's health. This translates to compiling information from all over the world to be analyzed and evaluated so that we can predict who will need care before they need it.  At Cerner, we call this system HealtheIntent®. HealtheIntent is a proactive health system that enables governments and organizations to gather data from thousands of individual sources and then use statistical analysis to determine and predict the risks of individual patients, allowing providers to match the right care programs to the right individuals, and helps to improve outcomes and lower costs for health and care.  For instance, HealtheIntent can help identify if the patient is at high risk of readmission within 30 days. If they are, HealtheIntent provides suggestive actions to take while the patient is still in the hospital so that the patient does not have to be readmitted again and again.</p><h4>Are there any dangers in deciding treatment and care based on IT solutions? </h4><p>Actually quite the opposite.  The average time it takes for new medical practice, that has been peer reviewed and published until it is at least 50 percent of the clinicians utilizing it in mainstream healthcare is 17 years It would be unthinkable to buy a cellphone or a car that is 17 years old, whereas the process for human diagnostics is using information that is almost two decades old. Another theory states that in order for physicians to keep themselves updated they must read 20.9 hours of medical journals every day2.  While both of these facts are staggering, modern HER technology has given birth to computers that can suggest things to physicians as well as monitor 100% of the data 100% of the time.  This additional oversight can monitor, diagnose and suggest treatment for the majority of common ailments, which account for over 30% of the total healthcare episodes of care3.  Furthermore, the study of genomics is advancing into the practice of personalized medicine. It is cheap and common enough to be readily available and sophisticated enough to indicate which medications and treatment will work or work better. The more genomics is integrated into EHRs the more developed and effective our systems will be. Cerner has great capabilities in this area.  The last hurdle in integrating these systems is how well it matches consumer demand. While big data and predictive modeling are important for providing the most technological advanced and sophisticated healthcare, customers want to turn on their smartphone and enter information about themselves, connect it to their EHR and have easy access to a personalized plan. This is what we foresee in terms of a consumer-based healthcare model. The biggest problem with current registries is that they utilize old information and are not updated fully and consistently. HealtheIntent utilizes a massive amount of integrated information that is added to every day from different inputs. For example, for the Ministry of Health we leveragedall of the data from the last 9 years and created a single, interactive registry system that is concurrent with data today and that keeps current as people edit or add new information.</p><h4>How does your company and your client's respective growths reflect the trends of growth in the healthcare sector in the UAE and the GCC?</h4><p>Although healthcare in the GCC is provided by the state, most governments are looking to privatize or corporatize. The problem is that we are spending a lot of time building systems and hospitals that are great in 2016 but may not viable in the future. Currently, insurance, customers, and hospitals are paying large amounts of money for new healthcare facilities where procedures are very expensive.. The whole provider based system of today is geared toward making more money. However, this is not sustainable in shifting economies, shifting consumer demands, and emerging market trends. A new way of thinking focuses on reimbursing wellness and preventative healthcare will slowly creep into today market.  By reimbursing wellness you are introducing an incentive into people's lives that will have a direct impact how healthcare is implemented. This practice is starting to emerge in many markets including the United States. While healthcare in the UAE and the GCC is “care" based today, it is evolving beyond this. In 2016, many of our clients came to us and asked us to provide higher-level services at a lower cost, signaling the beginning of the transition toward a value based market and this is where the consumer based system of tomorrow. Our future in the UAE and GCC will not be simply an EHR tool business, but as a healthcare partner helping with analytics, revenue cycle, preventative care and other specialized healthcare needs.  The shift toward highly centralized, highly digitalized, consumer based healthcare has begun.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Toshiba brand evolved in the UAE over the last 10 years?</h4><p>Toshiba is very strong in the region and has high brand equity. Customers trust us for the quality and reliability of our products and innovative technologies. Toshiba brand is well known in this region for mobile computing products and personal storage products via Toshiba notebooks, hard disks, and memory products. We are also popular in consumer electronics such as televisions and home appliances. Toshiba Gulf, based in Jebel Ali Free Zone, is a regional HQ for the Middle East and Africa. The role of this office is to ensure the introduction of the latest products and technology, which are a local fit to the region's consumer demand. Our unique selling point is the technology and innovation our products provide. All of the latest products are launched in line with the global launch. Usually, there is a time lag when introducing technologies in this part of the world. However, we have ensured that when there is a global launch, Dubai also has the latest product. One good thing about this city is that it adapts to new technology faster than the rest of the world. We have used Dubai as a showcase for our innovative technology and state-of-the-art products, and also as a logistics hub to cater to the rest of the Middle East and Africa region.</p><h4>Do you think the physical storage market will maintain its strength?</h4><p>The storage category is evolving into new technologies and products, incorporating these new ideas. With the demand for increased memory capacity due to the advent of smartphones and IoT devices, as well as due to the prevalence of social networking services and the production of videos and photos at an ever higher resolution, the volume of data generated worldwide is growing exponentially. Furthermore, these devices have increased the demand for storage with lower power consumption, along with the requirement of larger capacities. In 2007, Toshiba was the first in the world to announce 3D flash memory stacking technology. Recently, Toshiba released the 3D flash memory called BiCS FLASH. BiCS FLASH is a new generation of flash memory that is 64-layer and will boost storage capacity. In 1Q2017, we will launch a new innovative storage solution for the backup of smartphones. Canvio for Smartphone is an innovative portable storage device for backing up and charging Android phones in a single operation. Physical personal storage is still a relevant and important device to store precious memories and important data.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the IT sector in Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai is becoming a crowded IT market, with a lot of brands coming in and, perhaps, confusing the consumer. For example, you can find a smartphone for AED300 (USD81.7) and another for AED3,000 (USD817). Dubai is setting up a certain standards system. When that is implemented, the competition will be reduced and fly-by-night operators will be stopped. We need to work with the authorities to ensure that these cheap and low-quality products do not come and spoil the total user experience of the people who are tech savvy and want to adapt to new products and services. At Toshiba, our key pillars are storage, energy, and infrastructure. We need to develop these three key pillars in Dubai and the rest of the region. We are excited about our new products and technology that we will be launching in 2017, which will add value and enhance the customer experience in using the latest products and solutions. We are introducing Transfer Jet technology, enabling the high-speed transfer of large data files between two electronic devices with just the touch or close proximity of two devices. Toshiba is also excited about “Eyefi" connected features in our new memory cards, supporting embedded wireless communication and built-in data transfer. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Copying Documents, Leapfrogging Markets]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[copying-documents-leapfrogging-markets]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Xerox has been implementing a separation within the company. How are the two companies going to differ?</h4><p>There will be two completely separate companies. They will be self-managed, with separate boards and separate CEOs, and they will be focused on the traditional lines of the two companies prior to them coming together. There will be a Xerox technology business, which will continue to be called Xerox, focusing on document technology and the services associated with technology. The business processing services (BPS) will form Conduent, and that will continue to run as a BPS company.  Xerox itself has a legacy and a history of success in innovation, technology, and bringing new ways to address customer document technology requirements. That is really where we will continue to focus. From our point of view, as Xerox, it gives us focus and operational efficiencies and better use of our cash. Historically, we have invested significantly in innovation and R&amp;D on the technology side, and we will see that return, which will be hugely positive.</p><h4>How does that restructuring change your role, especially here in the Middle East?</h4><p>The UAE marketplace is eight million people strong, which gives Xerox Emirates huge opportunity to grow further and succeed. The separation allows us to look at different areas of opportunity, diversify, approach new markets, and differentiate our value proposition. We are a global leader in document management and document outsourcing; this separation will give us an opportunity to lead the UAE market with superior offerings of technology, solutions, and innovations that optimize document management in an increasingly interconnected, digital world.</p><h4>What is your involvement in cloud technology and security?</h4><p>Xerox technology and solutions enable higher productivity and efficiencies for document-driven business processes in a secure environment, including those that require integration to cloud technology. These enablements are touching everyday lives in educational institutions, healthcare facilities, banking and finance, and so on. For example, with the prevalence of a bring-your-own-device-concept in a majority of schools, universities, and educational institutions, the staff and students rely on a variety of handheld and smartphone devices for their day-to-day activities and functions. And our intelligent, multifunctional ConnectKeyR devices enable secure mobile printing and scanning over the cloud along with accounting control to the institution. We are also currently capable of offering and delivering enterprise content and business process management solutions, including software as a service (SAAS) on the cloud to support customers regarding their on-demand business requirements with faster implementation timelines and cost-effective services that do not require big initial investments.</p><h4>Why do you believe that the Middle East is an attractive market for Xerox?</h4><p>The key for this region is how quickly it adopts new technologies. Sometimes emerging markets are seen to be lagging behind more developed counterparts, but Xerox is instead witnessing a tendency to leapfrog. So you will see a particular industry trend that occurred in Europe five years ago that has not happened here because they jumped over that trend into the next. The uptake and ability to move the market is far easier here. For example, if you look at the uptake of our management services business, it probably got traction and became mature in a shorter space of time than it did in Western Europe and the US. The separation is good news for us as it allows Xerox to refocus on its core business. As a relatively young country, the UAE does not have the same legacies in terms of customs and procedures, and thus people are much more willing to change. The people who have chosen to make this home tend to be outgoing, adaptive, and welcoming to change, and as a result, Xerox has a receptive audience that is willing to embrace new technologies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When du entered the market, it brought a price-balancing element to the telecoms industry. How do you gauge the overall effect that du's entry to the market has had on prices for customers and businesses?</h4><p>When du entered the market in 2007 and started providing our services in mobile, we disrupted the entire ecosystem. This is normal as the market only had one player beforehand. Disruption does not mean simply undercutting prices; it is about looking at price differently. For example, du was the first in the region to introduce the pay-by-the-second billing system. People really feel that this is a much more honest and fair way to price. We also introduced the possibility of having different wallets, one for more time, one for more credit, and one for prepaid access, and choice is continuing beyond pricing now. Customers use technology in different ways, and this applies to individuals, families, friends, SMEs, large corporations, government departments, associations, and even nations. Nations and the behavior of their citizens are changing radically through the evolution of mobile technology along with the explosion of the Internet and social media. We have the perfect storm when you add these factors to the empowerment that will come from big data coupled with artificial intelligence and robotics.</p><h4>The smart city initiatives stem from the capture and analysis of big data across the Emirate. How is du engaging with this aspect to develop the Smart Dubai platform?</h4><p>Dubai, compared to other cities, has a lot of smart applications provided by multiple government agencies in areas such as immigration, utilities, transport, local government, and police. But having a lot of smart applications does not make it a smart city. It starts to become a smart city when all these applications talk to each other, and there is one platform where all this data is aggregated, processed, and treated. Through analytics, that data then becomes knowledge that can be used for better planning and leadership. People will be able to do things differently—more safely and more efficiently. People's behavior will then produce more data that allows the city to cater for its people even more. du had the privilege of being selected as a strategic partner for Smart Dubai. This means we will build and operate the platform for Smart Dubai, and we will contribute to the developments that are needed for this platform. By doing this, we are bringing a lot of partners into the equation with us. This means all the data that exists will be available, and young entrepreneurs will see the opportunities to develop new businesses. This will be the fertile ground for innovation and entrepreneurship, supporting the growth of smaller players in the market as well. The world is moving toward ecosystems that are not only multi-dimensional with multiple components, but that also have multiple stakeholders.</p><h4>What are your expectations at du for the next 12 months?</h4><p>Through initiatives in the UAE, we are creating momentum. The smart government and smart city concepts, the Blockchain Council, the Accelerator of the Future, the Museum of the Future, and even the hyperloop fast train are beyond the issue of whether one year will be tougher than another in terms of growth. We are extremely blessed with the level of leadership in the UAE, and we are all being pushed to do our best. Despite various geopolitical and economic pressures going on in the world, the UAE with all its initiatives is continuing along the path to create a new milestone in the history of civilization. I am privileged because I am in a field that is at the heart of this transformation, which is the digital internet space, but in any industry you can feel this happening. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[smart-happiness]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the standout developments from the 100 smart initiatives and 1,000 smart applications in their efforts to boost the economy?</h4><p>In terms of ICT infrastructure, we have implemented an artificial intelligence tool called Saad, in partnership with the Department of Economic Development, in the form of a new personal concierge that can reply to any business-related question. Recently, we started the first phase of registering businesses for this service and wish to use this technology across all government services. Furthermore, DubaiNow, a mobile app, unifies several government and private-sector applications, which means that people no longer need to go through hundreds of applications for government services. We consolidated almost 55 government private sector services through one platform. The overarching Smart City initiative is about unifying experiences, regardless of whether it is public or private, to create seamless, efficient, and impactful experiences. The launch of the Dubai Data initiative expands our services to all entrepreneurs and start-ups so that they can benefit from government data. For example, if you are an investor and want data about the city, our platform provides analytical tools to deal with big data and enriched data pulled from the Internet of Things around the city. Smart cities require both the public and private sector to achieve success. In 2015, we implemented Happiness Meters across over 500 government sector touch points. By mid-2016, we received an 89% happiness level, and now we are bringing the private sector on board with us for a more holistic picture of the city.</p><h4>How can technology be used to help achieve happiness goals?</h4><p>We launched the Dubai Blockchain Strategy in November 2016 with three main pillars: to have 100% of government transactions processed through Blockchain, to spark 1,000 new business opportunities through blockchain technology by 2020, and to create an international network through which tourists up to 27 years old can enjoy seamless entry and experiences within Dubai. This strategy is a very bold statement, and we are piloting over 17 projects across the city. The projects focus around trade licensing, digital ID, digital payment, e-ticketing, and other components of the financial sector. Leading companies such as Emirates NBD, Dubai South, and DP World are already testing blockchain technology. There are plenty of projects using blockchain technology, and Smart Dubai Office, in partnership with the Dubai Future Foundation, is unifying how blockchain is used.</p><h4>How do you draw a correlation between technology and happiness?</h4><p>For us, smart cities and happy cities are mutually inclusive, and happiness is attainable and measurable. If the technology will not bring added value, then it does not constitute a smart life. In May 2016, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister &amp; Vice-President of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, launched the Happiness Agenda, which is aligned with the federal happiness agenda. As a government entity, we need to focus on basic needs. Individuals want streets, roads, electricity, and water, as well as simple access to services. When we did our first snapshot of the service requirements, we segmented the community based on origin, as Dubai is a melting pot of ethnicities from around the world, to gauge the needs of the whole community as well as specific needs of each segment. For example, housing has always been the greatest priority for Emiratis, and locals traditionally preferred to live in villas. From the study, we realized the younger Emirati generation prefers apartments. Consequently, we are working with the construction sector to reflect these needs with diversity of housing options. We discover people's needs through technology and data, then make changes and implement policies to optimize happiness. Happiness is attainable and tangible; it is not just an abstract concept, and the Smart Dubai Office is working toward making Dubai the happiest city on Earth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the operations and innovative technologies of the new facility?</h4><p>The new facility has been split into phases due to the size of the project. We have opened Phase I, which is the buildings, new equipment, and two new production lines. Phase II will entail moving some of the equipment from the old facility to the new one. This way, there will be three more production lines, making a total of five. We hope to finish Phase II by 1Q2017. By the second half of 2017, the operation will be working at full capacity. We have incorporated a lot of technology into our production processes and operations. The equipment is highly automated, requiring less people and saving on water, electricity, and waste. We also have state-of-the-art water treatment incorporated into our plant to reduce water waste, recycling the water for landscaping and  car-washing purposes. We have plans to install 65,000sqm of solar panels, generating around one-third of our energy needs. Finally, the factory itself is going to be LEED certified and awarded a silver certificate.</p><h4>How would you assess the competition?</h4><p>Competition in the GCC's F&amp;B industry is quite intense because there are many players, although in carbonated soft drinks it is primarily two players. At the same time, the carbonated soft drinks sector is becoming a small part of the beverage industry. Around 20 years ago, it had the biggest share in the beverage industry, but today it is competing against juices, non-alcoholic beer, energy drinks, dairy-based products, and others like coconut water. The range of competition now has expanded far beyond just carbonated soft drinks. There are hundreds of different brands with  regional brands competing very effectively and aggressively against global multinationals.</p><h4>What is needed to strengthen Dubai's position as a manufacturing hub for the F&amp;B industry?</h4><p>The business environment in general is positive, and government services are accessible. The processes are transparent and efficient, and moreover the infrastructure that exists—whether it is telecommunications, transport, or banking—is very supportive. For example, there is easy conversion of currency with no taxation and easy transfer of currencies, which is great for trading and manufacturing. The greatest challenge in Dubai is competing in an environment in which many countries subsidize their industries through land grants, cheap financing, or energy subsidies on electricity, water, and fuel. Industrial land here is still expensive compared to other places, and prices are also subject to real estate speculation. Somehow, we need to shield the industry from speculation to encourage investment in industry. Also, the setup costs, such as connecting to the grid, can be very expensive for small business. Generally, we have been very successful and have found the services provide a big benefit to our business.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>2016 has been a challenging year for the region, but if we look at Dubai in the context of the region then we are doing very well. Dubai Refreshment is a significant player in the market, and we have an opportunity to strengthen our position. We have to be careful over the next several years because we have to control costs amid a difficult environment. The UAE will always have a bright future because the high-quality infrastructure, good standards of living, laws that encourage business, and established networks as a result of so many companies congregated in Dubai in particular. These factors created this incredible business environment that is difficult to replicate. So whenever there is an uptake, it will happen faster in Dubai and business will respond faster. With regards to our new facility, we have also set up the factory in a way that allows us to expand in adjacent categories easily. Once we get the base business running smoothly we intend to expand into other businesses. We have many different ideas on how we can expand. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[district-cooling-is-heating-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the cost benefits that Empower can pass on to developers when engaging at the design stage of their project?</h4><p>District cooling is more energy efficient and environmentally friendly compared to traditional air-conditioning systems. It is an integral part of Dubai's Energy Strategy and now one of the key components of all commercial and residential applications. On every project we are involved in, we ensure efficient district cooling service (DCS) for our customers by making it, first of all, energy efficient, and secondly, less costly than a conventional system. Our work includes continuous efforts from design to implementation in the development phase as well as ongoing services. We get involved with each and every developer by providing them with the necessary design guidelines for DCS and assessing any specific requirements for their development. We also make developers aware of sub-metering solutions, which help and enable them to measure district cooling consumption for each individual customer. Sub-metering solutions result in energy accountability, thus enhancing energy conservation. All these benefits can be achieved through proper planning and engaging right from the design stage of development.</p><h4>To what extent do you collaborate with municipalities or large developers in terms of retrofitting?<br></h4><p>Retrofitting is a complex task and more costly than what we conventionally do when we are working in tandem with the developers. It has certain challenges for which we need to closely coordinate with various authorities and the developers, and we have successfully handled these challenges in the past. We have connected some of the prestigious developments after retrofitting, for example Emirates Towers, Jumeirah Beach Hotel, Burj-Al Arab, and Emirates Academy of Hospitality Management. All these developments were connected with zero downtime of services, and with the support of advanced technologies such as Non-Destructive Road Crossing (NDRC). We are currently working on Madinat Jumeirah and will connect it to DCS during the current year.</p><h4>How do you balance keeping costs down, maintaining efficiency, and offering such a high service level?<br></h4><p>For us, the most important aspect is ensuring that we create capacities in line with project requirements. We do not have any spare or idle capacity, which has been one of the key success factors for Empower. We are also a cost-focused organization and have used technological advancements to maintain operational efficiencies and at the same time offer highest service levels to our customers. We have established a state-of-art Command Control Center (CCC), which provides us with real-time information on the demand and supply and consumption patterns in each and every building/unit, thus enabling us to deliver reliable and efficient DCS.</p><h4>People are increasingly using smart systems in their homes in the Emirate. Is that something Empower is looking to take advantage of?</h4><p>From day one, we have been using smart meters to measure district cooling consumption because we wanted to leverage the benefits of the latest technology. In terms of our operations, we needed a way to monitor even the most distant plant rooms. Previously, plant rooms required an on-site employee. Now, the advanced technologies and systems used by the CCC provide real-time access to information, and define supply and consumption patterns in each building or unit. This helps us deploy our resources effectively, specifically during peak summer periods. The CCC is one of the unique initiatives in the district cooling industry.</p><h4>How do you assess the competition within the sector, and areas for collaboration?</h4><p>Like any other industry, the district cooling industry has competition in Dubai and the UAE. Our view is that too many small players are not beneficial for the industry. District cooling should operate more like a utility, which will bring greater operational efficiencies and economies of scale, ultimately benefiting the customer and society in general. Sharing and leveraging mutual experiences and knowledge is an area where various DCS operators could collaborate for the advancement of the industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With domestic energy consumption rates increasing due to a growing population, will Dubai's production levels be enough to supply the growing demand?</h4><p>At the national level, oil production was estimated at around 3 million bpd in early 2017, which served not just domestic energy needs but also fulfilled the requirements of our trading partners. Dubai's population alone is expected to reach 3.3 million by 2021, jumping from the current 2.5 million, and then peak at 5.2 million by 2030. We are seeing increasing fuel demand for the automotive sector as well as for electricity generation and water production. ENOC Group has a long-term strategy to ensure that energy infrastructure and the value chain under its control can supply the energy and energy products necessary for Dubai's continued growth. Therefore, we are investing several strategic projects designed to bolster Dubai's infrastructure. Our E&amp;P arm, Dragon Oil, produces approximately 100,000bpd and has added a new segment to ENOC's business portfolio, providing a platform from which to pursue growth. Our Jebel Ali refinery capacity expansion will also increase volumes from 140,000bpd to 210,000bpd by 2020 and add several new products. On the retail side, ENOC is expanding its UAE network of service stations by 54 outlets between now and 2020, and we are continuously working on investment programs to ensure the efficient execution of critical projects and building infrastructure to support the energy needs of the Emirate.</p><h4>What are the key trends in the evolution of the retail sector within the oil and gas industry? </h4><p>Innovation and technology are key components that will drive the growth of the retail space within the oil and gas industry. Within the sector, we have seen several innovations that have helped speed up the refueling process at fuel stations. ENOC Group has been a keen contributor to the ease of services and launched some innovative payment methods. The Vehicle Identification Pass (ViP) for both commercial and individual use was first implemented in 2014 to speed up the refueling process and enables customers to better manage their accounts at each fueling transaction. Similarly, we recently introduced PIN-less and paperless debit and credit card transactions in of our service station network, which was a first in the UAE for fuel retailers. This will significantly reduce waiting times at ENOC and EPPCO service stations. Going forward, we envision self-checkouts in convenience stores to be big very soon. The evolution of Radio Frequency Identity (RFID) will develop into anti-theft, payment, tracking, stock keeping, ordering, and monitoring mechanisms.</p><h4>How are policy and regulatory factors impacting the energy industry?</h4><p>The November 2016 OPEC deal to reduce oil production for the first time in eight years steadied the international oil price. Another factor is the UAE Energy Plan 2050, which was launched in January 2017 to enhance the country's energy security. Dubai's announcement of the Emirate's plans for clean energy to account for 75% of its energy portfolio by 2050 preceded the national plan. As the key energy infrastructure partner to the Dubai government, ENOC has made significant contributions to support these strategies</p><h4>What are the key imperatives to attract young talent to the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>Emiratization is a key factor in the recruitment process to make the sector attractive to UAE nationals. This is a key priority as a national oil company operating across the international energy value chain. As our portfolio of services and operations continue to grow in Dubai and internationally, we look to ramp up our recruitment efforts to enhance human capital development and facilitate the growth of our organization. Attracting the right talent lies within the fabric of our organization and is a key contributor to driving success. Emiratization will remain a key priority for us as we continue to pursue new projects in Dubai and beyond and remain committed to reach a target of 50% Emiratization by 2021. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you plan to promote innovation as the driving force behind the future growth of DMC, DSC, and DPC?</h4><p>2017 is an important year for us across DMC, DSC, and DPC, especially as digitization takes a stronger hold in the media industry. Home to a number of “mobile-first" markets, the MENA region's share of views on mobile phones jumped from 11% in 2011 to almost 70% in 2015. This paradigm means that the industry is focused on younger audiences and new platforms for content. So, our main focus will be talent development and content generation. In line with TECOM Group's AED4.5 billion (USD1.2 billion) Innovation Strategy to accelerate new start-up development and foster entrepreneurship in the UAE, we are working on making innovation the fabric of the media industry through in5 Innovation Center for Media and YouTube Space in DSC. in5 will strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the UAE media industry by supporting freelancers and entrepreneurs in acquiring the right skills through mentorship, and providing them with the tools and advanced facilities. DSC's recent partnership with YouTube to open the first YouTube Space in the region will foster innovation from the most talented content creators and provide them with free access to high-end audio, visual, and editing equipment, in addition to training programs, workshops, and courses. So, we are focusing on enabling talents to utilize innovation in generating content that is in line with consumer behavior and has dramatically changed due to the digital revolution.</p><h4>According to the Arab Media Outlook 2016, digital is the fastest-growing segment and, within that, gaming holds the most value. What can be done to address the major challenges of lack of talent and start-up funding in the gaming industry?</h4><p>We are living in a young and dynamic region where almost 50% of the population is under 24 years of age, and technology platforms are a way of life for them as digital natives. With the rise in mobile adoption, gaming today has seen a huge shift from traditional consoles. The region's gaming industry is already worth more than USD1 billion and is expected to grow to USD4.4 billion by 2022. This alone presents a significant opportunity for professionals in the gaming industry. With an existing base of script writers, designers, producers, artists, and many more, Dubai is fundamentally well placed to bring together the best creative talent in gaming. However, more awareness needs to be created about professional opportunities for gaming enthusiasts in the region. Across our media communities, this creative talent and gaming enthusiasts provide a supply of innovators for our in5 Innovation Center, which will provide access to mentorship and funding as the gaming industry matures.</p><h4>The Dubai film industry is seeing outstanding growth, and last year blockbusters such as Star Trek were filmed in the Emirate. What does Dubai Studio City offer to international film production companies?</h4><p>DSC is made up of a global business community that has been catering to the production needs of the Middle East for more than a decade. During this time, we have invested in bringing cutting-edge facilities and services to companies from across the globe. We also proved that the city is a media hub through enabling the production of blockbuster movies here. In terms of design, the quality and size of our studios have a good reputation with Hollywood producers as they are built to international standards and capable to take any scale of production, be it film or television. The largest studio, at over 4,600sqm, outstrips many of those found in the biggest and most successful movie production studios in the world. We are also integrating innovation through our in5 Innovation Center and the YouTube Space Dubai. We have already positioned Dubai as a regional hub through offering an international audience and high standards of production. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Dubai stand out from other smart cities?</h4><p>What makes Smart Dubai different from any other smart city initiative in the world is that we have made happiness our goal; the Smart Dubai vision is to make Dubai the happiest city on earth. HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, has stressed that this is the government's objective and this makes our vision fundamentally unique; it inspires everything we do. One of the other factors that differentiates us is the customer-centric design principle to enhance the experience of the citizens and residents. One of our design achievements has been DubaiNow, which has received a number of awards, including the prestigious m-Government Award for the best one-stop shop. Our DubaiNow app consolidates over 50 government services. When we design services like DubaiNow, we make sure it is developed from the perspective of the customer. For example, people can search using terminology they are more accustomed to rather than having to use technical terms that reflect the way government entities organize themselves. Whenever we create a service ,we make sure we are listening to the market needs and assessing what customers actually want, which is then implemented through design. We use scientific methodologies in our designs, as well as testing and prototyping, and make sure that users test any new service before we make it live. It is about ensuring the government entities' efforts, initiatives, and projects are aligned with this vision of creating happiness.</p><h4>How are savings being made through smart city initiatives in Dubai?</h4><p>We wanted to understand the cash savings that our policy and initiatives have had, and commissioned a study by a third party specialist to measure and quantify the benefits and savings the government had made through Smart Dubai. The study found savings of AED4.3 billion (USD1.2 billion), of which AED1.2 billion (USD327 million) was saved in the government shared services area. That is a 300% savings on a spend of AED384 million (USD105 million). When it comes to infrastructure we achieved a higher saving on investment of 500%, with savings of AED1.1 billion (USD299 million). In smart services, we also achieved a very commendable percentage of 270%, which was a saving of AED443 million (USD121 million). We looked at the savings in four areas: software, hardware procurement, implementation costs and ongoing operational support, and improvement costs including all the maintenance costs, power, and consulting and professional services. The study shows that we saved roughly AED4.6 per AED1 that we spent.</p><h4>How does Smart Dubai Government's work make the Emirate a more attractive investment destination?</h4><p>Improving the efficiency of government helps to make Dubai a thriving business hub, making it as attractive as possible for people who want to do business. For example, the Saad initiative supports businesses by utilizing cognitive artificial intelligence (AI) to answer investors' questions about the legal framework, business activities, and how to do business in Dubai. It is the first service that utilizes AI within government procedures. Saad replaces the need to wade through documents, forms, and contact call centers to find out this information. It can give data-based statements in real time, vastly improving the quality of service. This is just one example of what we are doing in this domain to encourage investment. With the My ID system, someone can set up a business here without physically coming to Dubai. As well as these specific smart initiatives, providing the overall right infrastructure and smart services in the city creates a smooth and seamless experience, which will only help to attract business to Dubai. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[to-stay-and-to-grow]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is MetLife transforming its business to meet the evolving needs of its customers?</h4><p>Transformation is central to our strategy. Our goal is to offer customers truly differentiated value propositions that allow us to ultimately drive more value for our customers and shareholders. We do this through our range of products, ensuring they are accessible to the customer. This is being enhanced through developing our digital capabilities. We are investing in innovation, drawing particularly on the deep talent pool we have within our company. An impressive recent example of this innovation was the introduction of a customer service platform in the UAE. The platform was launched to enable ongoing digital engagement and dialogue with our customers. This unifies simple policy management and online payment, but also packages health management and wellness information with a unique health-tracking tool. Among many other examples is Turkey, where we are engaging customers through social media, which is applicable to that market due to Turkey's young and technologically savvy demographic. We now offer products through a social media platform. Product and distribution innovations like these that are simple, digital, and customer centric will ensure that life insurance companies remain relevant and continue to offer long-term value.</p><h4>The UAE has around 50 banks, roughly one per 200,000 people, while there are 60 insurers for the same population. How are you assessing growth opportunities in a relatively saturated market?</h4><p>The UAE market has significant potential for further growth and development, notably due to the low levels of life insurance penetration alongside the growing population. To be successful within the UAE market, companies must be financially stable in order to meet their commitments to policyholders and offer the service that their customers are demanding. As part of our business transformation we are refreshing our brand globally and our new tagline, Navigating Life Together, reflects the trusted partnership our customers tell us they want from MetLife. We are also well underway on our journey to innovate, whereby we will enhance the added value for both customers and shareholders alike. We were recently honored to win the Life Insurance Company of the Year award for the MEA region for the third consecutive year, at the 2016 Middle East Insurance Industry Awards (MIIA), organized by Middle East Insurance Review in UAE. This award pays testament to the efforts of our employees to continually innovate and serve the needs of our customers, and reflects the fact that MetLife has established itself as a trustworthy brand. MetLife Gulf also recently won the 2016 Employee Benefits Provider award by MENAIR, another great accomplishment, being one of the 12 insurance companies granted Participating Insurer (PI) status by Dubai Health Authority (DHA). Generally speaking, competition is healthy in all industries, as it provides the consumer with options and drives cost, product, and technology innovation.</p><h4>How is MetLife tackling the challenge of long-term economic, political, and regulatory uncertainty in EMEA region?</h4><p>We are caught between macro-economic volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and rising expectations on the part of our customers and shareholders. This makes it a challenging time to be in the life insurance business. To continue to thrive in this environment, we have had to respond effectively to these challenges and so recently refreshed our strategy to transform MetLife into the kind of company that can succeed in any economic environment while continuing to deliver superior value to our customers and shareholders. In EMEA, MetLife has a long-standing presence and is well diversified, which means that we are not overly reliant on any one market. While we experience headwinds in some countries, it can be largely offset by growth in other markets—we maintain leading positions in a number of growth markets in the Middle East and Central &amp; Eastern Europe, and continue to focus on attractive niche segments in more developed markets.</p><h4>While the UAE economy will still post growth of around 2.6% this year, both the country and the region are experiencing headwinds. Where is the company currently looking to invest in order to return strong returns for the stakeholders?</h4><p>The UAE is a key market of growth for MetLife. We look closely at potential growth opportunities in the UAE and continuously conduct customer research and analysis, including Net Promoter Score (NPS), to assess how we can provide value and differentiation to our customers. In addition to the digital innovation I mentioned earlier, some of our other investments include a simplified sales platform that enables a convenient, digitized, and end-to-end customer experience; wellness programs focused on education, prevention and screening; mobile e-services including submission and claims tracking and data analytics to help establish controls with our healthcare partners to minimize waste. We have been in the UAE since 1962 and we are here to stay and grow along with the country, our partners as well as more than one million customers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Climate change works on two platforms: devising and implementing government policy and targeting citizens and their attitudes toward sustainability. How are you using media to engage the public and gauge attitudes?</h4><p>Last year we established the National Environment Council and insisted that the private sector be represented on the panel, along with media representatives to make sure that we are aligned with the various social media channels and technology at our disposal. We have analyzed how we can utilize those tools and maximize the value that we can bring for ourselves, and also our target audience. We cannot underestimate the role of the media. Now we are working to portray the facts, figures, and the story through the media to make sure that we present the right message to the widest possible audience. Sustainability is not something that is limited to the government, or to the private sector; sustainability is a duty for each member of society and person on the planet. If we are talking about having a sustainable society, it is imperative that we make sure that everyone is contributing to this vision</p><h4>What is the importance of cooperation with international organizations and communities to your efforts here in the UAE?</h4><p>We have a number of international engagements that fit into the vision that we have outlined in the UAE. Our vision is to be the world leader in sustainability, and part of achieving that mandate will only be achieved through unfettered collaboration with overseas partners and organizations. This includes NGOs, the private sector, and other nations. We as a country cannot do it alone, and we have to engage with the systems already in place; if we do it on our own, from scratch, it is going to take a long time to reach global parity. The global targets can only be achieved through collaboration. We have to observe the international organizations to gauge where the world is, and what its targets are. We are really proud of what we have done within the field of renewables. If we compare where we started almost 10 years ago to the many others that started decades before us, we can understand how we are leading the whole sector. In the last year, we have achieved two world records when it comes to producing power from photovoltaic cells (PV). We achieved 2.99 cents per kWh and the other has not been officially announced yet, but we are looking at 2.45 cents per kWh, which positions us at the top. In terms of IRENA, it helped us to build capacity through devising policy and strategies for achieving our goals. Our vision now, moving forward, is to expand the contribution of renewables in our power sector, and we are looking at what technologies exist in the market to see how we can apply them to our own advantages to further develop the existing infrastructure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[eng-abdullah-al-swaha-minister-communications-information-technology]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The IT sector is one typified by constant change. How would you describe the role of the ministry in today's climate of rapid technological advancement and breakneck reform?</h4><p>In the midst of rapid technological advancements and disruptions, the ministry's primary role is to provide core enablers as well as a mature, dynamic, and favorable ICT ecosystem to businesses, citizens, and government so that we, as a nation, can achieve the highest social and economic impact from technology and more broadly from digitization. Indeed, the IT sector is witnessing constant change, and offers massing opportunities for the Kingdom. This has been recognized as part of the Vision 2030 and National Transformation Plan (NTP) 2020 priorities. Overall, our IT industry is growing; however, contribution to GDP remains modest at 0.4%, compared to 2% in best practice regional markets, and 15% in best practice global markets. This offers massive development opportunities. Furthermore, the IT market continues to be import driven, where 80% of IT spending in the Kingdom goes to companies based outside the country. Hence, this offers a massive localization opportunity. Finally, we still have major improvements to be made on trust and security. The Kingdom witnessed around a 1000 cyber attacks in 2016, targeting primarily foundational IT infrastructure and platforms. The social and economic reforms that the Kingdom leadership has lined up from the 2020 and 2030 horizons are expected to multiply the opportunities for the IT industry, thanks to increased digitization in citizens, business, and government applications an interactions.</p><h4>The IT sector has the ability to directly and indirectly employ vast numbers of people. It also has the ability to bring markets to SMEs and create new tools for society. Is the ministry involved in training and equipping Saudis with technological skills, and how is this best done?</h4><p>Building local skills and talent is among our top priorities as we currently suffer from a shortage of more than 50,000 specialists in our ICT workforce . It is also among our top priorities as it is a core enabler with a multiplier effect on the broader economy and its digital transformation journey. As such, we are indeed highly involved in fostering local ICT talent, and have successfully launched several talent development programs and partnerships with global IT companies to train more than 56,000 Saudi youths on key ICT skills between 2017 and 2020. We have also set up the National Information Technology Academy in collaboration with Saudi Aramco and signed multiple MoUs with private-sector companies to train and develop Saudi talent. We are also looking at new innovative approaches to foster, more broadly, digital talent across all ages as we strongly believe training alone is not enough; we need to develop a true digital culture in our people. Several flagship initiatives will be announced here very soon. To bridge the estimated talent gap, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT) is focusing on promoting ICT interest, elevating ICT skills, and ensuring ICT employability readiness. Among others, MCIT is mobilizing ICT providers and securing commitments to large-scale training and employment opportunities.</p><h4>Broadband provision is a key area under the NTP. What plans are being made for increasing provision to rural areas, and will the private sector take the lead? </h4><p>A nation-wide, efficiently deployed, high-speed broadband infrastructure is critical for Saudi Arabia, including in rural areas. One of the key challenges in infrastructure and communications is its large geographic spread, and NTP has set a target to increase broadband coverage to 70% of rural areas. We have been working toward this jointly with operators, regulators, and the private sector. The ministry has introduced a broadband stimulus fund to encourage the private sector to invest in broadband particularly in rural areas, and is working on establishing partnerships between municipalities and the private sector to accelerate deployment. In this fund, Zain has already been awarded the first phase and is on track to deliver the first milestone by the end of July. We are also collaborating with the private sector to evaluate regulatory mechanisms that will incentivize investment in infrastructure. We see the private sector as a direct stakeholder and partner in the ICT sector transformation as well as the overall national digitization journey. We expect the private sector to contribute to the country's national goals and as such to prioritize investments and resources on broadband provision to rural areas. We would also like the private sector to take the lead on piloting new technologies in fixed and wireless broadband like 5G, sharing best practices and recommendations for standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Standard Chartered navigating the digital transition?</h4><p>Standard Chartered is investing heavily in the digital space with the ambition to build the digital retail bank of the future. To support this ambition, last year the bank announced an investment of USD1.5 billion across its network to deliver a better banking experience to clients using digital technology. In the UAE, we have rolled out cutting-edge fingerprint technology in our mobile banking service and enhanced the online banking user interface so that clients can securely and seamlessly access their bank account balances, cards, and investments. We have also enhanced our fund transfer limits to suit the needs of our clients. The bank will also introduce voice biometric technology for phone banking services for clients by early next year. </p><h4>Do you think Islamic finance is being fully tapped as a market here?</h4><p>There are lots of opportunities here, not least of which is the government's determination to make Dubai the global Islamic finance center. Analysts say the recent slowdown in the growth of Islamic finance reflects more challenging economic conditions across a number of core Islamic markets—particularly in the GCC countries, due to lower oil prices. However, in many core markets where we operate, such as the UAE, the Islamic banking sector continues to outpace growth in conventional banking, supported by proactive regulations and strong retail client demand due to the inclusive nature of Islamic banking products. Sukuk issuance is also very successful here, with the Nasdaq Dubai overtaking London and Malaysia as the world's leading center for international sukuk listings, and we expect this to continue. We are committed to building our Islamic business here with the client needs in mind. We are the only bank that has a full Islamic retail arm, as well as financial markets, debt capital markets, and corporate banking.</p><h4>What macro-economic fundamentals make the UAE such a good market for Standard Chartered?</h4><p>For us, the UAE continues to evolve and extend its business and consumer offering, which in turn creates new opportunities for Standard Chartered to keep up with innovative financial services and solutions to meet our clients' needs. Undoubtedly the economy is a bit softer, but the response from the UAE has been to maintain its diversification agenda, which has already been in place in Dubai for some time. There are many ongoing infrastructure projects, world-class ports, airports, and free trade zones, all of which is complemented by rapid population growth.</p><h4>There are around 50 banks in the UAE catering to a population of 10 million. Do you think the market is reaching saturation point?</h4><p>Recent developments in the banking sector have signaled an increasing need for further consolidation to stay efficient and profitable. We continue to see interest for a range of financing products in the market. In particular, debt capital markets is an area where we see good business momentum in the region. The drop in oil, which resulted in a lower supply of capital, has given us the opportunity to tap our international network and attract investors from outside the Emirates. Another area of growth is wealth management, where there is a demand for tailored investment and insurance products. Our products are structured with the client in mind, which is one of the reasons why despite everything our volumes have picked up.</p><h4>Are high net-worth individuals getting more creative due to the weaker economy?</h4><p>With local stock markets being flat at the moment and global uncertainties adding to market complexity, high net-worth individuals are being forced to think of alternative types of investments. Real estate is one of the areas they are looking at the most. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of Mashreq Bank's performance during 2016?</h4><p>Mashreq Bank performed well in 2016 despite the economic hurdles the market presented in 2015. Mashreq Bank's corporate business is diversified across multiple industries, making it better positioned to weather storms than if we had focused on simply one sector. Our ability to do this is testament to our experience in banking and our transparency as an institution. We are aggressive in business, yet honest in addressing challenges, real or perceived, in an effort to become part of a stronger and healthier banking system.</p><h4>How will Samsung Pay be utilized, and what is the scope for similar technology to be used across the economy? </h4><p>Samsung Pay is a digital platform that allows users to store funds and purchase items directly from their smart phone. Mashreq Bank is Samsung's first partner for Samsung Pay in the region. In addition to that, this year the UAE Banking Federation is launching a national-level digital banking system referred to as a digital wallet where you will be able to receive, store, and remit money wirelessly. With a digital wallet customers will be able to send money from one phone to another. Customers will be able to pay for Dubai Metro, go shopping, and transfer money without using a credit card. Ultimately, we believe this type of technology will revolutionize banking and financial transactions in the market and around the world.</p><h4>This is still a cash-dominated society. What strategies will you implement to help this kind of technology develop as a sector?</h4><p>In order for cashless payments to grow, both the customer and the merchant must have the respective hardware (e.g. mobile phones and contactless terminals) infrastructure. However, for cashless payment products to be successful, the customer must adapt their thinking and behavior patterns to go digital and trust the new technology. On our end, we must ensure that this is a more flexible, convenient, and secure method of payment. We are optimistic about this trend because we are seeing it progress. At Mashreq, 85% of our transactions are taking place on our mobile banking platform, either from online, our smartphone app, or at an ATM. Several years ago, banking transactions only occurred in the branch with a banker. Today, Customers are adopting fast to new ways to pay without ever visiting a branch. Our customers are increasingly younger and increasingly looking to do business and execute transactions digitally.</p><h4>Mashreq saw 30% growth in e-commerce linked card business. How is the bank moving forward in line with this sector?</h4><p>E-commerce is exponentially evolving in the market. Companies like souq.com and noon.com are offering their version of global e-commerce portals and developing strongly in local and regional markets. The trend is increasingly moving towards online shopping, and more customers are adapting to such e-commerce platforms for their regular shopping. Banks will have to work to facilitate secure payments on both ends. The digitization of banking transactions will usher in a new era where banks will make less or no traditional transactions, which have been profitable in the past. Money saved from bank transactions will help customers maintain larger bank balances, which will lead them to look to invest their surplus capital. This will force the banks' business model to shift from conducting transactions to more advisory services and offering new services, products, and wealth-growing opportunities. We want to facilitate an environment where expat customers, instead of remitting money back home, will look to invest here in the UAE. We would like to offer investment opportunities that are so secure and attractive that customers will be willing to come back time and again. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[80% of Burundian trade transits Dar es Salaam]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[he-pierre-nkurunziza-president-burundi]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given that an average 80% of all Burundian trade transits the port of Dar es Salaam, what plans have been laid down to ensure healthy and even balanced trade between your country and Tanzania?</h4><p>It is true that most Burundian trade effectively transits through the port of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. This is not only due to the geographical location of Burundi—a landlocked country—but also reflects the close relations and cooperation existing between the United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Burundi. Both countries understand the importance of this relationship, and constantly endeavour to widen and deepen it. In the framework of the implementation of the East African Community Single Customs Territory, Burundi has tasked its revenue authority officers with ensuring that cargo heading to Burundi that transits through Dar es Salaam is swiftly shipped either by road up to Bujumbura through the Kobero-Kabanga One-Stop Border, or by train up to the port of Kigoma and thereafter to Burundian ports (Nyanza Lac, Rumonge, Bujumbura) via Lake Tanganyika. There are further plans to make the Isaka-Musongati-Bujumbura railway line operational in the near future. Burundi has conducted conclusive studies pertaining to safety on Lake Tanganyika, which gives ample room for both Tanzania and Burundi to take the lead in developing the Lake Tanganyika basin to enable the free movement of goods, people, services, and capital in the area to flourish, and through this uplift the standards of living in our region. To this end, Burundi has developed plans to diversify its export capabilities, and Burundian companies such as Brarudi have started exporting their products to Tanzania.</p><h4>What makes Burundi in particular an attractive market for businesses in Tanzania and vice versa?</h4><p>The United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Burundi have long-standing historical and cultural ties on which to premise multifaceted trading arrangements. Burundians and Tanzanians are close neighbors, both geographically and spiritually, and over the years both our peoples have developed a common understanding, as well as sharing the same vision and destiny. This shared cultural and social knowledge is critical for successful businesses.</p><h4>Tanzania and Burundi have long maintained ties, and the growing number of Burundian citizens living in Tanzania testify to this. What will be the focus of Burundian-Tanzanian relations going forward?</h4><p>The focus of these is obviously to strengthen and further diversify our areas of cooperation. Everything calls upon the United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Burundi to effectively implemement the East African Community integration agenda, which we strongly support as complementary to what we are doing internally to raise the standards of living of East African citizens in general and the people of Tanzania and Burundi in particular. We would like to see the United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Burundi take the lead in promoting Kiswahili and French through university-level cultural exchanges between teachers and students, as well as other professionals. </p><h4>What can be achieved, in real terms, for member states, through streamlined cooperation in the East African Community (EAC)?</h4><p>The East African Community Partner States have agreed on the scope of their cooperation in the framework of the East African Community (EAC) integration agenda in terms of political, diplomatic and judicial affairs, infrastructure, economic, social and productive sectors. In these sectors, there is a wide range of projects and programs, which, as partner states, we need to see implemented. In concrete terms, the EAC is now operating under a single customs territory, enabling the passage of goods with reduced transport costs and travel times. What is more, since partner states now operate in the EAC single market, there is now access to 160 million consumers. This is significant for both the private sector, as well as for micro and small businesses, which can prosper, create wealth, and boost job creation. Moreover, the East African Community Partner States have agreed to fast-track the implementation of projects and programs so as to achieve 17 sustainable development goals. Poised both as a single customs territory and a common market that aspires to higher stages of integration—the monetary union in 2024 and ultimately the federation of East Africa—the EAC is also set to pool its higher education resources, creating better mobility for university staff and students within the region. Such initiatives are definitely critical for the free movement of people, labor, and services in the region.</p><h4>What challenges do you expect to encounter during this path to integration, and how might they be overcome?</h4><p>The journey to integration is not a sprint. Nor does it happen overnight. Integration is a process, not an event. One of the challenges is to remain focused, keep the momentum, and sustain the process, especially by capitalizing on the acquis communautaire and achievements in different sectors of daily life. Hurdles on this journey are inevitable. We must consolidate consensus on critical issues and programs so that all the partner states grow at the same rate and sing together to the tune of sharing the same vision, objectives, and destiny. A saying in East Africa goes as follows: “If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together with others." Indeed, integration requires a constant spirit of togetherness and unity. There is a need for EAC to move as a block in the context of globalization and the regionalization of relations, including trade, to generate prosperity. The third biggest challenge is unlocking the potential of the EAC and eliminating all the barriers that impede cooperation within it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Established in 2009, Eptalex — MEG LEGAL SERVICES has extensive experience and a deep understanding of the legal and business environment in Dubai and the Middle East. How would you describe the evolution of the firm over these years?</h4><p>MEG LEGAL SERVICES is built on the complementarities of its team members in awareness and knowledge, and on a permanent quest for excellence. It has quickly become well known for its strong litigation and arbitration practice. Over the years MEG LEGAL SERVICES has been keen to strengthen its teams of lawyers, to widen its areas of practice, and to expand its international presence. Finally, in 2015, MEG LEGAL SERVICES, together with other law firms from different countries, founded the international partnership Eptalex, and thus became part of a network with offices in Beirut (Lebanon), Dubai and Abu Dhabi (UAE), Milan (Italy), and Johannesburg and Cape Town (South Africa). With a global perspective Eptalex is today affiliated with the Global Business Lawyers (GBL) Alliance, which gathers reputable, like-minded law firms in more than 30 countries with similar practice areas and services. Within GBL Alliance, Eptalex - MEG LEGAL SERVICES is the exclusive representative for Dubai. Moreover, Eptalex - MEG LEGAL SERVICES and Eptalex — MOHAMED ALZAABI ADVOCATES AND LEGAL CONSULTANTS (Abu Dhabi), are full active members of the Association of European Lawyers' Network and the exclusive Justinian Lawyers offices in the UAE. Today, Eptalex — MEG LEGAL SERVICES, due to its partners' expertise that spans over 45 years of excellence in providing legal services to regional and international business communities, repre-sents clients in the full range of business transactions, complex legal and factual disputes, and difficult regulatory and business issues.</p><h4>What are the main factors that companies seeking to do business in Dubai should take into consideration?</h4><p>There are many factors that companies seeking to do business in Dubai should take into consideration. The main four are, first, the place of conducting business: in general, companies can do business in mainland Dubai or in one the many free zones established in the Emirate. A company licensed to do business in a free zone cannot directly do business in mainland Dubai. Usually, companies aiming to execute contracts with government entities must be licensed to do business in mainland Dubai. Second, the local ownership requirement: in order to conduct business in mainland Dubai, companies can register a local company or a branch of a foreign company with the Department of Economic Development (DED). UAE nationals must hold at least 51% in local companies while a branch of a foreign company only requires a local service agent. Free zone entities can be fully owned by foreigners. Thus, a company seeking to conduct business in mainland Dubai must take into consideration the requirement of a 51% local ownership in case of registration of a local company, or the fiscal and financial consequences (on the mother company) in case of registration of a branch of a foreign company. Third, the contemplated activities: a company must choose its scope of activities from a list adopted by the relevant authority (the DED or the relevant free zone authority). Activities are classified in groups, and a company may choose a limited number of activities within the same group. Moreover, many activities require pre-approvals from other regulatory authorities. Finally, some activities may be permitted in some free zones, and restricted in others (like in the media sector). Fourth the regulatory framework: in Dubai, existing regulations are continuously changing, new regulations are issued, and the number of regulated sectors is continuously increasing. Companies must make sure to always comply with the relevant applicable regulations.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>According to the latest updates from the IMF, the UAE's economic growth will accelerate to 4.4 % in 2018, driven by a rebound in investment, manufacturing, and trade. Aiming to be a smart city, Dubai will see e-commerce connectivity as an expanding sector, which will be driven by the rapid proliferation of connected devices and services. It will have a direct impact on creating new business and job opportunities in the areas of health care, IT, logistics, media, and entertainment, as well as banking and financial services. With regard to the latter, it should be noted that in April 2017 the UAE formally committed to the Common Reporting Standard elaborated within the OECD. The implementation of the international standards will raise many questions from all the stakeholders that will be affected by it, such as financial institutions, companies, and individuals. Eptalex — MEG LEGAL SERVICES already addresses its clients' concerns, being aware of the complexity of the issues and the impact of international standards on international businesses. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[salahaddin-h-dardeer-president-saudi-aramco-base-oil-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Luberef's expansion at Yanbu to produce Group two base oil?</h4><p>We are doing a major expansion at our plant in Yanbu to produce Group-II base oil, which is amongst the highest quality produced in this region. Our production will go from 550,000 tons to 1.2 million tons. Of course, we did that because we are a leader in the Middle Eastern market, especially in the GCC countries, and we go as far as India, Pakistan, and Nigeria. We have a good name in the market as well as superior quality. We have no problem selling our product in the region or internationally. In that regard, the base oil industry is moving to a higher quality now, and we decided to develop an expansion to our refinery for this. Hopefully it will be on stream by the end of next year and we will be providing our customers with this high-quality product. This is a very competitive market, so concentrating on improving product quality is crucial. The Yanbu expansion is a capacity increase, and it will therefore also impact our revenues. It is important to us to deliver what the customer requires, as automotive manufacturing and all related industries are pushing toward higher quality. Group-I is no longer considered the highest quality, although it is going to continue for a while. Some parts of the US are moving to Group-III, which is much more advanced. We have to do this at the optimum cost and also generate more revenue. That is what the Yanbu expansion will bring to us.</p><h4>How have operations changed since oil prices crashed in 2014?</h4><p>The operation has not been impacted; we will have to continue producing. The changes in the market reflect that it is not only a drop in the prices; there is also a drop in the economy in general. We, like any Saudi company, depend on general market conditions; if there is a recession then it impacts the demand of base oil. Nevertheless, we are doing a great job, and I think that Luberef, in 2014 and 2015, made good money when comparing its size and business. Today, as we speak, base oil has the same problem as crude; the market is flooded. Whoever wants to survive has to ensure that they are producing to the highest quality.</p><h4>One initiative intended to overcome the impact of low oil prices is Vision 2030. How does Luberef position itself within these reforms and what are your expectations?</h4><p>When you say impact, it is positive and negative. There are some things that are not very clear as we speak, regarding some of the strategy. That being said, we built our strategy, and we have enough tactics to meet these strategies in order to expand our business, generating revenue and jobs for Saudis while adding value to society. If we do this, I do not think it will contradict or have an effect on Vision 2030. For example, today we suffer from counterfeit products, like everywhere else. Vision 2030 also talks about quality of materials that can be used in the country, so that helps us. 2030 talks about being innovative and technology creators and leaders in the market. All of these are a plus for us, even though today we are suffering for some of global trade deficit, when the market is open and everyone is allowed to import anything. Now, when we start focusing on materials, what we bring to the country, and what we export from the country, a company like Luberef represents high quality. This will help us, and it will also contribute to the success of Vision 2030. Finally, we are 100% Saudi here in our Jeddah operations and maybe 70% in Yanbu, and we want to see it grow. It is one of our main goals to employ Saudis; it is an important standard. We also need to keep a certain percentage for knowledge transfer. I do not think it will be 100% at any time, but to keep between five and 10% of people that carry the highest degree of international expertise.</p><h4>You mentioned Yanbu is coming on stream next year. What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We are looking forward to this expansion; it is a big achievement in Luberef history. When this comes on stream it means more exports to other markets, which is important to us. We will further grow the Luberef brand, and in the country, producing high-quality base oil at a higher grade, Group-II. It will be a great achievement and we are very proud. We will be open to other markets, we have been talking to customers about our new products, and we have almost everything sorted with contracts on hand. Because some of the product cannot be used in the nearby area, like the GCC, maybe we will go further to India or Pakistan, even Europe. It is a big challenge and a very exciting time ahead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai has focused its efforts on diversifying its economy through knowledge and innovation. How do these elements complement each other?</h4><p>Knowledge has always been central to economic development. Human capital and technological development are directly linked to increases in the productivity of capital and labor. However, this requires well-articulated, knowledge-based government policies and interventions, particularly within the fields of science, technology, industry, and education. The private sector has to be encouraged and empowered by the government to invest in innovation through a properly applied incentive system and conveyed vision. We have a very specific vision to become the economic, touristic, and commercial capital for more than two billion people, which will be achieved by promoting innovation, increasing R&amp;D expenditure, strengthening the regulatory framework for key sectors, and encouraging high value-adding sectors. The government has placed itself in the knowledge-based arena as an example to the private sector and other governments to translate vision into reality. According to World Bank's Knowledge Economy Index, which assesses 146 countries based on essential knowledge economy pillars, the UAE was ranked 42nd in 2012, up six positions from 2000. Moreover, when disaggregating the KEI into the main four pillars of the index, the UAE is ranked 13th on the ICT index.</p><h4>How is the DEC engaging with the One Belt, One Road initiative and how will Dubai benefit from it in the long run?</h4><p>The DEC has forged strategic partnerships with a number of high-profile economic decision-making circuits, major financial institutions, research and advisory centers in the People's Republic of China to cooperate and coordinate in many areas of common interest. Among those entities: Bank of China, China Development Bank, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, among others. We believe these partnerships would help involving Dubai in the 'One Belt' megaprojects.  Dubai has established itself as one of the main transit points for expanding the Gulf's commercial dealings with Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Western Europe. In the future, Dubai's role as a trade hub will grow, and the new Silk Road will attract more businesses to the Emirate. Dubai is a rapidly growing city within the region and is considered a logistic hub for China because of its location and the strength of its infrastructure. We see China's initiative as an opportunity to strengthen Dubai's role as a global hub for trade and logistics. </p><h4>From your perspective, what has been the impact of 'Dubai Law No. 22 of 2015 Regulating Partnerships between the Public and Private Sectors', one year after it was enacted?</h4><p>The government's embrace of public private partnerhsips has been overwhelmingly perceived as a paradigm shift in contemporary economic thought. According to international best practices, PPP is regarded as a exemplary method for governments to provide quality and efficient public services or infrastructure-related services in a cost-effective manner. Additionally, the PPP model can alleviate a burden from the public fund through tapping the private pools of finance especially in some structures that entail privately financed schemes. Through PPP, the granting agencies can transfer significant risks to the private-sector partner. Overall, all these elements will result in  cost savings and greater efficiency. This much-anticipated law has been seen as a vehicle primarily for alternative funding of infrastructure projects. PPPs have been used throughout the world, including the MENA region, for quite some time as a way of further promoting economic diversification and attracting FDI. It is still premature to assess its sum impact, but it clearly conveys a strong message on private sector involvement. The new law provides a mutually beneficial arrangement; the public sector receives innovative and experienced partners, which in return receive a secure source of revenue and gain access to a new market and the chance to expand their businesses. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the new bankruptcy law benefit the SME sector across Dubai?</h4><p>The new bankruptcy law will definitely enhance the ecosystem for SMEs in the UAE. This will impact the financial sector for both lenders and borrowers. Both sides will undergo a major restructuring in the way they operate. For the financial sector, the current situation will move away from dependence on guarantees and collateral from SMEs. Financial institutions will have to go into the details of how these businesses work and understand their operations more closely. With the insolvency law, if someone files for bankruptcy then it stops there. This will have a positive effect on the economy and entrepreneurship because people will be less afraid to fail. Alongside the insolvency law and the VAT, bookkeeping, forecasting, and creating a five-year plan will be more important.</p><h4>There are many new styles and platforms coming into the market, such as fintech. How can they be integrated successfully into SME financing while maintaining security and stability?</h4><p>Fintech has generated a lot of attention, but in terms of regulation many central banks are not yet ready for it. Our government is working on it, but generally the sector is a little foggy when it comes to fintech. There is always the fear among the banking sector about who can regulate these companies, in part because companies can be created anywhere in the world and operate here. It can be very difficult, but the best way would be for regulators to get involved sooner rather than later. As usual, regulation takes time. For example, Uber disrupted the taxi business, and regulators had to react to the market rather than dictate how it is run. The same thing will happen here. Entrepreneurs and innovators come up with ideas and explore new landscapes, then regulators come in later and get involved in a good way.</p><h4>How is Dubai SME working with the 350,000 SMEs in the country to adapt to new legislation?</h4><p>When we started in 2012, we had 1,000 SMEs, and by 2015 we had close to 4,500 companies submitting their financials to us. Change takes time, and with the insolvency law and the VAT, these businesses have no choice; they have to manage their finances in compliance with the law.</p><h4>What makes five-year plans so critical to the success of an SME?</h4><p>From our experience, SMEs usually operate on a three to six-month plan, which is not ideal. With everything that is happening with technology, oil prices, and regulations, it is difficult to have a five-year plan. It is hard, but this constitutes the difference between a good SME and an average one. At the end of the day, an entrepreneur is not starting a business for fun. There is a dream behind it that needs to be implemented according to a plan. Without proper planning, they are bound to fail. Globally, 80% of SMEs fail, but in Dubai it is about 65%, a much stronger figure. It is not only about money. Moving forward, Dubai and the GCC will be very competitive. In terms of staff, these SMEs often look at employees and assume they will leave due to a high turnover rate in the region. There is even a high turnover rate with senior staff. To increase retention, businesses should look at employee share options, long-term planning, buying, and the overall sustainability of these business.</p><h4>What can be done to incentivize people to start SMEs in nontraditional sectors?</h4><p>In terms of incentivizing, the government's Islamic economic and industrial strategy, as well as Dubai's SME rating strategy, is a huge help. As part of RATE SME, we look at whether it is aligned with Islamic principles and, if it is industrial, then it will be ranked higher. If you have a governance system and the SME is more environmentally and socially conscious, it will be ranked higher </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Roughly 3% unemployment rate among graduates]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[henning-jensen-rector-universidad-de-costa-rica]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is behind the success of the Universidad de Costa Rica?</h4><p>In the QS University Rankings published in mid-2017, we made a tremendous leap and moved up approximately 60 positions in the global rankings. This is due to many factors. One is that Universidad de Costa Rica does a great deal of international networking in order to be involved in important scientific and academic endeavors. The university has become extremely competent at research and also works with many universities in the world at the same level. The second factor is that we have made many investments. We are improving and expanding our infrastructure and this will be dedicated not only to conducting more classes, but also improving our laboratories and equipment. This investment will put us at the same level as widely acknowledged universities around the world. These are the key factors that have translated into our excellent reputation.</p><h4>What efforts is the university making to foster entrepreneurship and leadership?</h4><p>We have a strong commitment to this. In fact we have an agency called University Agency for the Management of Entrepreneurship (AUGE) that is the leading agency in the country in this field. It gets the highest level of external funding, and we are making a concerted effort to impart both hard and soft skills to our students and faculty members. Some of the projects carried out under AUGE have been extremely successful, and this plays a major role in fostering entrepreneurship. In mid-2017 we had a national meeting on entrepreneurship, specifically in the high-tech field, and there were over 300 participants. This is only one example of what the Universidad de Costa Rica is doing to demonstrate our commitment to new enterprises and endeavors. We are extremely involved in such projects.</p><h4>Has the university created alliances with the private sector to help ensure its students are employable?</h4><p>The level of unemployment of our graduates is low. It is about 3%, which is much lower than the national average. Again, this has to do with the university's reputation, which is an important determining factor. It also has to do with the fact we have certain ties with some parts of business and industry. However, we must significantly improve in terms of our formal relations with the outside world. We have a cooperation agenda with the government that covers the five public universities in Costa Rica, including the Universidad de Costa Rica. Through this, we try to have an impact on the country's productive center, both through the efforts of our faculty members, but mostly through our students. They are extremely engaged in community work and this opens the doors to different industries and productive sectors. This is one of the main reasons why our graduates have a low rate of unemployment. However, graduate employment levels do vary according to the different disciplines and professions. For example, in the engineering field we have an unemployment rate of zero, which is impressive.</p><h4>What are some of the specific relationships the Universidad de Costa Rica has with the private sector?</h4><p>One well-known sector is the food production industry, where we have a relationship with CINDE. We are greatly engaged with the food industry. We also work together with the government. For example, we just had a meeting with the ministers of agriculture and science to talk about their plans to create what they call added-value centers. It is only possible to add value if we add science and technology, and this is exactly what we do. We add the results of science and technology to the development of added-value products and services in different sectors of the economy.</p><h4>The university structure is linked to society through its autonomy; how do you support society through the university?</h4><p>The Universidad de Costa Rica is completely free to choose the kinds of programs that we develop. In that sense, we do what we believe is right for the country and the community. One of our main goals is to work for and preserve the common good. This means the common wellbeing and in doing this we do not care very much about the political evaluation some actors might have. What we worry about is making sure our activities have a positive effect and improve the circumstances of our communities and people. That is the main thought that guides our work and it is possible as a result of our autonomy. There are political consequences for us because we work in that kind of framework and are exposed to political criticism. We discuss ideas and try to develop projects and programs that are guided by this common good aim. We want to provide tools to the community in order to reach the common good. At times, we may be wrong, but common wellbeing is our motivation and it is clearly stated in the university's constitution. Having autonomy is extremely important in this regard because it means ideally we are not exposed to the vicissitudes of political commentary and pressures.</p><h4>What still needs to be done to improve education in Costa Rica and how can the Universidad de Costa Rica contribute?</h4><p>A simple and straightforward answer is that everything has to be improved. We cannot exclude any area from our efforts to improve because we are a university and one of the main components of our philosophy is to improve everything. We are always thinking about this and evaluating ourselves in this way. As we are committed to academic excellence, we have to continually strive to reach higher goals. In terms of the most outstanding difficulties I cannot see these separately from the whole education system here. We have deficiencies in our education system that are critical and have an impact on higher education. For example, we would like to see students coming from secondary school level that are more competent and better prepared for higher education. We want them to have better proficiency in mathematics, basic sciences, and also languages, not only Spanish but English as well. This is one negative aspect of the current education system that has an impact on higher education in Costa Rica. Another aspect is the increasing inequality in our country. The Universidad de Costa Rica is engaged in trying to improve the chances of young, underprivileged people in our society accessing higher education. We have special programs for this, for example for indigenous people and those in the poorest regions of the country. We work together with them to improve their opportunities to come to the university. Social inequality is an important challenge. In terms of internal challenges for us at Universidad de Costa Rica, we have to improve our culture of evaluation and our accountability, although we are already committed to this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the chamber implementing smooth and accurate administrative procedures to enable PPP legislation?</h4><p>We recently unveiled key objectives and initiatives in our 2017-2021 strategy, which is centered on creating a favorable business environment and improving ease of doing business within the Emirate. It is a customer-oriented strategy that aims to boost competitiveness and growth within the private sector in line with the Dubai Plan 2021. The strategy is supported by four pillars, which include promoting Dubai as a global business hub, creating a favorable business environment, supporting the development of business in Dubai, and becoming the best chamber in the world. When we consider the ambitious targets of the Dubai Plan 2021 and UAE Vision 2021, it is clear that PPPs are the fastest way to boost competitiveness.</p><h4>What efforts are there within government entities to adopt smart technologies and innovate internally?</h4><p>The UAE has emerged as a global standard bearer for e-government in recent years. The government was ranked the most tech-savvy in the region. The UAE's National Innovation Strategy will continue to help the country realize its ambition of becoming one of the most innovative nations in the world. The initiative requires all government entities to reduce spending and dedicate savings to research and innovation projects. More than 2,000 government services are mandated to be made available through mobile and electronic mediums, and the majority have already made that transition. The UAE has set a target for 80% of government services to be accessible by mobile devices by 2018. </p><h4>There have been several recent efforts to develop trade with Latin American nations. What role can the UAE play in developing this?</h4><p>Dubai's total non-oil trade with Latin America amounted to AED17.41 billion (USD4.7 billion) in 2016, a 29% increase on 2010. Yet when we look at the vast resources that both sides offer, you see the huge potential to expand the volume and scope of bilateral trade. Latin American countries are among the world's top agricultural exporters and stand to benefit from collaborating with Dubai on food security. The expansion of direct flights between Dubai and Latin America has opened the door to new opportunities for economic cooperation. Several Latin American governments have unveiled large-scale infrastructure investment plans to enhance roads, railways, ports, and airports across the region, which are all areas where UAE businesses can provide their expertise and investment.</p><h4>Along with China, the UAE is one of the largest sources of FDI in Pakistan. What impact will the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have on freight volumes and transshipment?</h4><p>We expect this initiative to be a game-changer for global trade, mobility, and connectivity. Given our strong trade relations with Pakistan and China, CPEC should positively impact the Emirate's trade with these countries, removing barriers and reducing transportation costs. CPEC is closely related to China's One Belt, One Road initiative, which seeks to link China to the Middle East through Central Asia. The UAE stands to play a critical role as an investment and trade hub along the New Silk Road with strategic access to the rest of the Middle East region, as well as emerging markets across Africa and South Asia. This corridor is also good news for GCC countries, as they will be able to transfer oil and gas to China through a 3,000km land route rather than a 12,000km sea journey. The UAE, in particular, is well-placed to benefit from this initiative, by helping China meet its energy needs, while enhanced connectivity is expected to strengthen trade relations between the countries. Dubai Chamber has made China a key focus of its expansion strategy by recently opening a representative office in Shanghai to explore the trade and investment opportunities in China that offer the most potential for its members. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the implementation of the bankruptcy law attract new business to the Emirate?</h4><p>The new law will induce a more efficient allocation of resources by facilitating the restructuring of companies and supporting troubled businesses, and thus ease the burden of asset erosion in both the corporate and financial sectors. This will lead to a reduction in the risks and cost of doing business in the UAE and give a fillip to investment both domestic and foreign. The new law is especially important to the small and medium enterprises since it will help reduce risks and ease credit conditions that have so far limited SME survival rates.</p><h4>What has been the private sector response to  the Business Dashboard and Saad platform?</h4><p>The Business Dashboard and Saad are two of DED's multiple initiatives designed to accelerate the transition of Dubai into a smart economy. We have also introduced a Hassle-Free initiative, which has streamlined and automated business-registration and licensing procedures, making them more efficient and less time consuming. The Business Dashboard complemented the successful migration of business registration and licensing services in Dubai to a fluid eServices platform through which investors can seamlessly engage with DED. Almost 99% of the business registration and licensing services are now available online in Dubai through the DED website and smart applications. Meanwhile, investors and entrepreneurs can submit their questions to Saad on the DED website in audio format or in writing and receive relevant and up-to-date information on business licensesprocedures and fees as well as step-by-step instructions on setting up a business.</p><h4>How will the UAE become one of the most innovative countries in the world?</h4><p>The UAE has utilized various elements to drive innovation in the private and public sectors, including an enabling regulatory environment as well as a strong information and communication infrastructure, support for R&amp;D and human capital development, and entrepreneurial capabilities and linkages to tap into global knowledge and financing arrangements. Both the Abu Dhabi and Dubai 2021 visions provide the vehicle for becoming a knowledge-based economy. For example, Dubai has embarked on an ambitious smart city initiative focused on harnessing the power of information technology in the provision of public and private services. A key step has already been undertaken as an increasing number of transactions and procedures and a comprehensive information system have been made accessible online. The greater the availability of these services, the more the reductions in the cost of doing business in Dubai will be realized.</p><h4>Dubai Smart Office has shown the link between big data analysis and happiness. How can happiness stimulate investment?</h4><p>Creating the happiest city is a complex challenge. We require state-of-the-art infrastructure, unique opportunities, dynamic customer engagement, and efficient service delivery, to name a few. When happiness becomes the central theme of policies, programs, and services of government bodies, the focus moves toward attracting investment and providing the best experiences for individuals, investors, and enterprises. The objective is a transformation, which requires significant investment but also opens avenues for sustained investment in excellence in the years to come.</p><h4>What made 2016 an attractive year for new licenses despite slower growth?</h4><p>What we witnessed in 2016 was the continuation of a long-term upward trend in issuing licenses. A number of factors are driving this, including the stability and predictability of the macroeconomic environment and the continuous drive to diversify the economy away from oil toward a knowledge-based economy underscored by innovation. In addition to the projects and initiatives contained in the Dubai 2021 Plan, Expo 2020 is attracting increasing levels of interest from the business community, especially in the context of the newly introduced PPP law and bankruptcy law. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Paraguay's FDI inflows dipped in 2014 and then picked up in 2015. What were the key drivers for that revival in FDI?</h4><p>The figures are positive, but more important are the trends. These have been consistently positive, which illustrates how Paraguay remains stable and has continuous growth, even though some years the growth rate can vary. Paraguay has come out of its shell as a country and is just beginning to become known as an investment destination by the rest of the world. We are making a big drive to become more widely known and have no doubt that if a company reviews Paraguay's offering it will discover that it is a formidable place for investment in three areas. The first is food production, the second factories, and third logistics. Paraguay is a hub at the center of South America, with a champion factory provision. Testament to that is the fact that we have attracted over 80% of the industries that have moved their operations from Asia to supply the Brazilian market.</p><h4>The natural point of trade between Paraguay and the UAE is food, especially since food security is a pressing issue in the latter. Is this the primary link between the two countries?</h4><p>Capital ultimately goes where it is going to make money and where investors feel their money will be safe. Paraguay has built a reputation for being a safe and profitable place. If you have these factors as your base you can attract attention to any area. We have established an apparatus to ensure that investments are secure and are now promoting the country with that narrative and declaring ourselves open for business with the UAE. </p><h4>Bilateral trade between the UAE and Paraguay was just under USD70 million in 2016. How significant is that for Paraguay?</h4><p>Bilateral trade is something that is going to increase in conjunction with investment in Paraguay. Simply put, we cannot export what we are not yet producing; instead, we have to look at the potential. When investors are looking at the profitability of opportunities in a country, they look at the stability and depth of the opportunities. Mature markets, for example, offer stability, but not the same growth margins. Paraguay, on the other hand, still has the potential to triple its agricultural output.</p><h4>There have been discussions during previous diplomatic visits about trying to eliminate double taxation between Paraguay and the UAE. How would that stimulate trade?</h4><p>It would stimulate investment, which in turn stimulates trade. So far treaties have been signed to eliminate double taxation with countries such as Chile and Taiwan, and they have been positively received because businesses can decide where they pay their taxes. According to these agreements, businesses just pay any unpaid remainder to their country of origin. This a very smart way to put Paraguay on the map. We have a 10% flat tax for businesses, individuals, and VAT, which helps to attract more investors without affecting our base, which is very low anyway. We are similar to the UAE in that sense, in that we have the lowest tax rate in Latin America.</p><h4>Can you give us insight into any deals you might be brokering during your visit to Dubai?</h4><p>We are preparing to lay the groundwork for a very strong diplomatic and economic trade and investment relationship with the UAE. It imports a lot of food that we produce, and to maintain that we have to stay competitive in terms of volume and pricing. We do not believe in subsidies; we believe in real competition. The Arab League as a whole imports over USD8 billion of chicken, beef, lamb, and other food products. We are very interested in tapping into that market because doing so will yield further investment, which gives more Paraguayans a higher standard of living. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE projects a growth rate of 4% for 2017. Which sectors will drive this growth and how will it contribute to the nation's ultimate goal of diversification?</h4><p>The non-oil sectors will provide the needed impetus to drive the country's economy this year and beyond. As the UAE steadily moves toward reducing its heavy dependence on oil revenues, we expect to see a number of relevant initiatives and programs designed to strengthen vital sectors such as renewable energy, tourism, education, science, innovation, and information technology dominating government policies and regulations. This is clearly evident in the country's Higher Policy for Science, Technology and Innovation, in which more than 100 initiatives worth over USD81.7 billion have been identified. These key initiatives cover the health, education, energy, transport, water, and technology sectors. 2017 will present broader prospects for growth in our local industries, thereby reinforcing the country's resilience to global economic changes and other evolving variables.</p><h4>How have the ministry's efforts to attract investors been reflected in capital inflows, and what is the UAE's current position in the global trade arena?</h4><p>In terms of FDI, total flows to the country in 2016 amounted to about USD10 billion. The size of cumulative investments, on the other hand, reached about USD119 billion. The policies and legislation the government is working to enact by 2017 will have a very positive impact on raising foreign investment flows into the country. Investment growth was not just limited to inflows, though; the volume of the UAE's outbound investments stood at USD9.3 billion in 2015, up from USD9 billion the previous year. This made the UAE the largest Arab foreign investor in 2015, with cumulative investments reaching USD87.4 billion. The country also maintained its prestigious position as a regional and global capital for foreign trade and an influential import, export, and re-export hub. The UAE's non-oil direct exports grew significantly in 2015, up by 22%. For the first half of 2016, the UAE's total non-oil foreign trade reached USD215 billion. This should grow by 5% in 2016, and 7% in 2017.</p><h4>What have been the main initiatives of the Ministry of Economy to boost the industrial sector to reach the target of 20% GDP contribution by 2021?</h4><p>We are deeply committed to helping young local entrepreneurs and SMEs to play a bigger role in the UAE's economic progress. The approval of the Foreign Investment Law also reflects the government's commitment to prioritizing value-added projects in industrial and other sectors.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of non-oil exports and which industries are leading the way forward here?</h4><p>We have made significant progress due in part to the government's bigger emphasis on knowledge, innovation, advanced technology, human capacity building, and scientific research. Our economic diversification efforts have already resulted in high-performing non-oil sectors, which stand to increase their aggregate economic contributions to 4.6% by 2020. The UAE's robust economic, trade, and investment relations with key Asian and African markets, as well as other countries, will drive our non-oil export and re-export activities in the short and long term. The rapid development of the industrial sector saw industrial investments increase from USD34.7 billion in 2015 to an estimated USD35.4 billion by the end of 2016, which contributed to around 12.1% of non-oil GDP. Meanwhile, tourism is another important contributor to the national income. It is expected to gain more importance and reflect the enormous potential of the UAE. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you see as your primary point of collaboration with the international community?</h4><p>We want to be the UAE's main partner in Central America and the Caribbean. Renewable energy is one of the aspects that we have discussed, unsurprisingly with Costa Rica's notoriety for being an eco-friendly country and producing 99% of its electricity from renewable sources. That is a valuable experience that we can share with the other countries. We want to work in bilateral cooperation on projects such as this, but also triangular cooperation, which is when two countries put capital and expertise together to help a third country. We have experience in doing projects like this with Spain and Germany. Broadly speaking, we want Costa Rica to become a destination for the development of good practices and give recommendations to other countries on how to achieve their respective aims. We started investing in renewable energy 60 years ago and have plenty of experience, particularly in hydro, which represents between 80-90% of our energy mix. Building this infrastructure is not done overnight, but leveraging our experience can help other countries meet their national commitments.</p><h4>Where else does potential lie to strengthen the UAE and Costa Rica's bilateral relations?</h4><p>We are trying to become more of a knowledge-based economy. We have the potential and the skills to do that, but we need to work in collaboration with other countries to strengthen what we already have. There is a lot of potential for investments from the UAE to go to Costa Rica in the services, real estate, or even agriculture sector. Likewise, a lot of goods come to this part of the world, bringing forth multiple opportunities in the field of logistics. It is our job as the government to open those paths for the private sector.</p><h4>How can Costa Rica work to help the region strengthen its food security? </h4><p>The main challenge is how to get the goods here on time. Connectivity wise, we have difficulties without direct flights and it takes the shipping industry two to three weeks to ship food products here. We have to improve that to firstly increase our own competitiveness, and also to develop the volume. Our quality is high, but we have to improve connectivity. We are still awaiting an Emirates flight to Panama or Costa Rica, which is being negotiated. This would be a great opportunity for our goods to be exported there. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai continued to lead the region in attracting FDI and climbed up in global FDI destination rankings in 2016. What is the outlook for FDI inflows to Dubai in the current global business environment?</h4><p>FDI plays a vital role in strengthening Dubai's economic sustainability and competitiveness. We remain positive about the outlook for FDI inflows to Dubai in the coming years thanks to high investor confidence and the Dubai Plan 2021, which is transforming Dubai into one of the smartest and most sustainable cities in the world. In 2016, Dubai ranked third globally, after London and Singapore, in the number of FDI projects, which is a clear indicator of a strong diversified economic growth. Dubai managed as well to maintain its leading position in the region and ranked seventh in FDI capital inflows despite the challenging global economic environment. Moreover, in a few years Dubai will host Expo 2020. The mega event has already created new opportunities for both leading global businesses and SMEs to be partners in infrastructure development and service delivery.</p><h4>The bankruptcy law has now been implemented and will presumably boost Dubai's Ease of Doing Business ranking. How does the entity envisage that this will affect the flows of FDI?</h4><p>There is no doubt that improved regulations address investor concerns and indicate maturity and an improved confidence in Dubai's business environment. Dubai has established clear FDI policy leadership and continues to lead with modern regulatory frameworks to keep pace with the economic shifts and new business models. We see a positive impact on FDI flows moving forward, as we work in close partnership with private sector leaders to introduce new future-ready policy levers and create new opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs.</p><h4>Dubai Investment Development Agency launched Dubai FDI Monitor in 2016. How is accuracy being maintained when investments are taking more unorthodox form; for instance, with freelance visas available, emerging sectors becoming more prominent, and companies that are based upon intangible assets?</h4><p>Dubai FDI Monitor maps out the investment landscape in Dubai through tracking, validating, and analysis of FDI flows as part of Dubai FDI's data analytics and foresight program. This is the first-ever FDI Monitor at a city level and the feedback on the reporting service has been extremely positive. As a service to foreign investors, we support decision-makers who will now be able to analyze FDI trends and opportunities in Dubai by sectors, geographic clusters, and source countries. The FDI results and trend analysis reports are based on international classification standards (NACIS) and fDi Markets data as well as our tracking technology and database. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the service provided is accurate and current, taking into consideration that the data is updated in real time. As part of our continual improvement process we are now tracking M&amp;As and new forms of investment, which both reflect the economic maturity of the domestic economic base and allow us to monitor FDI activities at joint ventures, strategic partnerships, alliances, sub-contracting, and license arrangements.</p><h4>Dubai has been moving up the Global Innovation Index, and now ranks as the most innovative Arab nation. Which sources, and channels, of FDI have been particularly pivotal in assisting that move?</h4><p>The UAE National Agenda 2021 is set to drive the knowledge economy contribution to reach 5% of GDP. The UAE Innovation Strategy and the Higher Policy for Science, Technology and Innovation played an important role in galvanizing efforts at the federal and local levels to climb up on the Global Innovation Index ranking. Major global players in the financial and ICT industries today choose Dubai as a regional innovation center. FDI into R&amp;D activities in Dubai was 1% of total capital flows in 2015 and it has improved dramatically to reach 5% in 2016. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[From One Hub to Another]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[from-one-hub-to-another]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which economic sectors of the UAE does the government of Uruguay see investment opportunities?</h4><p>We are currently in the process of further integrating Uruguay into the international arena, taking advantage of the new opportunities that Mercosur brings with it. When it comes to the UAE, we see great opportunities in terms of strengthening commercial trade between both countries. Uruguay is a reliable producer of food and services, and we see a wealth of opportunities in the infrastructure industry. Uruguay currently needs to invest in maritime, road, and rail infrastructure in order to strengthen our position as a regional hub, especially because our country is one of the main entry points for the South American region. One of the top priorities of the government of Uruguay is to attract investment to support these developments.</p><h4>Do you think the experience of the UAE as a hub for the Gulf can be of use to Uruguay's development model?</h4><p>There are many similarities between both countries; for example, we have a similar geographic size and location in relation to our respective regions, and we both complement the wider economies around us. A strategic alliance between the UAE and Uruguay would be of mutual benefit for both countries, allowing us to use our respective hub status to access many new markets. For example, through the UAE, Argentinian companies would have access to a broader market of 2 billion people, including India. Similarly, UAE investors in Uruguay would enjoy access to key Latin American markets.</p><h4>While Uruguay produces most of the food consumed by its 3 million people, the UAE is largely reliant on food imports. What role can Uruguay play in supplying food to the UAE?</h4><p>There are 3 million people in Uruguay, but the total capacity of our food industry actually enables us to supply as many as 50 million people with food. We have specialized our food industry and produce a large range of high-quality goods. For example, in the meat industry we have a traceability system that enables us to trace the genetics and journey information from all livestock, from the field to the shop, through a QR code system. We have also developed one of the highest-quality rice and soya industries in the world. In this context, new technologies played and continue to play a very important role for Uruguay's food industry. We have already held talks with the Ministry of Economy of the UAE to exchange expertise on the strengths of both economies.</p><h4>Uruguay and the UAE signed a double taxation agreement. What have been the main benefits of the agreement?</h4><p>In order for the agreement to be fully operative and assess its importance and benefits, we first need to boost trade and investment between both countries. We are currently working on a system of promotion and protection of investments between both countries. We have already created a legal base that should be the basis for starting more concrete work on investments. This was the reason behind our recent visit to the UAE alongside several Uruguayan companies. We have plans to organize a visit for some of our chambers of commerce as well as another government visit for 2017. We believe that these visits will strengthen trade and collaboration between both countries.</p><h4>How could Uruguay and the UAE further strengthen political and trade ties?</h4><p>The next step would be a free trade agreement (FTA). Uruguay has been one of the main promoters of the FTA signed between Mercosur and the EU. We are getting closer by the day to signing this. Chile and Uruguay recently signed an FTA, and our country proposed a similar commercial agreement with China. This is going through a revision process at the moment. The signing of an FTA with the UAE would be a very positive, commercial step for both countries. As I said, Mercosur has set up a new phase of development in which it is trying to further open its economies to the world, which is the way to go in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will your new vision determine your strategy for the upcoming years?</h4><p>We recently decided to adopt a new vision, which is to be a leading sustainable energy and petrochemical player offering diversified and high-quality products and services in Iran and the region, and to be recognized as the strategic partner of choice in the energy field in Iran. This vision converts into a strategy based on three pillars. One is to create value, which means finding the right investment opportunities. The second is to be a diversified business with a diversified portfolio of activities. The third is to build strategic partnerships with global players, building new competitive advantages and value propositions for future project execution and future business activities. We just started to implement this new strategy and plan to reach the goals that have been specified in this regard.</p><h4>How do you create value for your shareholders through your activities and subsidiaries?</h4><p>We have broken down the energy business into four Strategic Business Units covering the entire value chain, namely upstream, midstream, downstream and power &amp; utilities. Iran, like other countries, will gradually benefit more from added value in the energy sector. Our strategy has been to be present throughout the energy value chain, with help from the capabilities and expertise of our directors. We are well established in different parts of the value chain, such as drilling and well engineering services. Moreover, we are a qualified Iranian E&amp;P company that is an excellent partner for major oil companies that want to develop oil and gas fields in Iran. International oil companies must have a local partner to engage in E&amp;P activities in Iran. We want to be the partner of choice for major oil companies. We are focused on the E&amp;P business in Iran and have signed an MoU for three medium-sized oil fields with NIOC, to study these fields and to enter into tenders or direct negotiations. It is important for partners to know which companies are fully private. Most of the companies are prequalified by the Ministry of Petroleum, or are semi state-owned companies. There are only a few companies that are fully private, and PEDC is one of them. This is one advantage of working with PEDC. Another advantage is that we have the backing of Pasargad Financial Group. Their support makes us a reliable partner for foreign companies from a financial point of view. In addition, we have experienced people gathered in our company, with knowledge of the different segments within the Iranian energy sector. These aspects make us the right partner for international companies and investors looking to come to Iran.</p><h4>Iran is strategically located in the proximity of some big energy consuming countries. How can PEDC, as a trader in energy products, benefit from this?</h4><p>PEDC transports oil products between different neighboring countries. We import some oil products from the UAE and Iraq, and export them to Armenia and Afghanistan. Also, we import products from Turkmenistan and export them to Iraq. We have started this business to benefit from our geopolitical situation. PEDC possesses three power plants, located near the borders with Turkey, Iraq, and Afghanistan. We are seeking permission to export power from our power plants and directly export it to neighboring countries. In a few years, there will be opportunities to get involved in the trade of electricity, and we can benefit from our geopolitical situation.</p><h4>How do you reflect on the negotiations you have had so far with international companies?</h4><p>In upstream and E&amp;P, the government has prepared a solid ground for having mutual discussion with international oil companies. In power &amp; utilities, we are discussing with South Korean delegations that are interested in investing in power plants. Some investors are seeking long-term partnerships, while others are looking for short or medium-term partnerships, especially in the development of new petrochemical and refinery projects. We are optimistic about our negotiations with different foreign partners and are determined to establish and implement our plans. The E&amp;P business is the gateway for us to enter into long-term partnerships with international companies. It shows the credibility, competitiveness, and reliability of PEDC for possible international partners.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>After the reelection of President Rouhani, I expect that Iran will continue to develop positive relationships with the world. This will create a more supportive business environment in which we can work and conduct our business. We are going to complete our build-operate-transfer (BOT) project for laying a gas pipeline to export gas to Iraq. We have a project worth more than USD2 billion with the National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC) to build a 600,000km pipeline with five compressor stations for exporting gas to two Iraqi cities: Basra and Baghdad. We are going to complete this project by the end of next year and it will create more value and credibility for us. We aim to sign partnership contracts in the next year with major international oil companies to develop Iranian oil fields. In addition, we would like to enter into partnerships in our petrochemical and refining projects, especially in Siraf, where we have eight plants that each produce 60,000bpd of condensate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[jameel-bin-abdullah-al-molhem-md-shaker-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of Shaker Group's major achievements in 2016?</h4><p>Our major achievement in 2016 was entering the B2B segment of the air-conditioning's (AC) market, of which we are a key player in both residential and commercial ACs. We have been building a platform with our partners from LG to enter the market for big chillers and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) technology. In 2016 Shaker Group won two major projects. One of them was for the district cooling system for the Riyadh Airport renovation of the old terminals and the royal terminal. The second project was providing the chillers for the new government ministries complex currently being built. These deals are worth around USD20 million and that was the start to our penetration of this segment. The big chillers make up about 30% of the market and we expect this segment to grow further. Another key achievement and focus for us is the Multi V product, which is an advanced product from LG using VRF technology. We have done a number of projects using Multi V. for example, the Hilton Double Tree Hotel and Majdoul Tower both in Riyadh, the largest installation of Multi V in the Middle East. The Multi V system is modular so one outdoor unit can replace eight to 16 indoor units. This technology is somewhere between conventional AC systems and chillers. It is a new technology where LG's product has superior performance compared to the competition. This business is almost doubling YoY, and we expect it to gain traction going forward. In this respect, Shaker Group is number one in terms of market share for residential ACs, and we have also grown our appliance business.</p><h4>In what ways have you been accessing international partners, including LG, and representing them locally?</h4><p>Shaker Group started operating in Saudi Arabia in 1950, and over the years, it has accomplished a strong distribution, after-sales, and relationship platform. When LG wanted to enter the Saudi Arabian market in 1995, it aimed to partner with a strong companion like Shaker Group, the key player here. LG set a high objective of being number one in the Saudi market within five years, and they succeeded. The company heritage and culture of Shaker Group is to add a great value. Today, we are present in 25 cities and have a very wide distribution network with our partners. We cover around 800 stores Kingdom-wide. We have our after-sales in around 30 locations. In 1995, we started our partnership with LG just in the AC segment and expanded from there. Now, for the 16th consecutive year, we are the number one player in the AC segment with market share of 29%. The estimated total value of the AC market in Saudi Arabia is around SAR6 billion, and 55% of that value is intended for the residential market due to the sheer size of the country. Then, in 2007 Shaker Group and LG moved to localize the industry, and we wanted to bring the “know-how“ and production of AC systems into Saudi Arabia. So, we established LG-Shaker as a manufacturing joint venture with LG in 2007. At the beginning, we started with a small operation of around 150,000 AC units and now have much larger capacities. Today some 70% of the ACs we sell in Saudi Arabia are produced here under our joint venture, 51% is owned by LG and 49% by Shaker. LG-Shaker produces a wide range of products from window ACs to split, freestanding, and commercial units, as well as air purifiers.</p><h4>Globally there is a strong push towards energy efficiency and green technology in the home appliances and electronics industry. How much of a focus does Shaker Group have at the group level to show that you are the green partner of choice in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>In 2013 the government introduced new energy efficiency regulations. In Saudi Arabia 60% of electricity consumption in homes is through ACs. Therefore, improving the technology can save a lot of money in terms of the need to build new power plants and burning oil to produce electricity. Shaker Group wanted to move in this regard and this is how our acquisition of Energy Management Services (EMS) in Dubai came about. We are a 70% shareholder in EMS, which is a company that has been working with energy efficiencies in the UAE since the 1990s. Our focus at Shaker Group is to bring this value proposition to the Saudi market and also align it with LG-Shaker's key focus of producing highly efficient energy products. We want to bring a total solution perspective to the business community here, including developers, real estate, and even government entities. Plus with EMS we can come in at different stages of projects. Potentially, our input can drop the electricity consumption for a building by between 30% and 50% and improve its cooling capacities. We are currently meeting with one of the big retail chains to advise them on energy efficiency solutions for their existing premises. A lot of companies in Saudi Arabia are looking for solutions to reduce their energy consumption now. Cooling systems are key to this because 60% of a commercial buildings' energy consumption is going into cooling. We offer total energy saving solutions for lighting, sensors, cooling, and so forth for these businesses.</p><h4>Near-zero-energy buildings are not only about installing the right equipment, but also about the monitoring and maintenance of systems. How does your work fit into this segment?</h4><p>With Vision 2030, the Saudi government is putting a lot of emphasis on electricity deregulation and opening up the grid and the delivery of electricity to different players. The government is also very serious about looking at and incentivizing non-conventional and green energy sources, whether solar or nuclear, as alternatives to oil, we can complement this by introducing the concept of near-zero energy consumption. In the future we can then progress to the concept of positive energy where you can actually sell energy back to the grid in the deregulated environment, for large developments like mega-malls or compounds, this opens up their ability to produce their own energy and turn waste into energy. We can offer this through our partnership with Lockheed Martin and EMS, which is key for us as it gives us access to their global and regional platforms and “know-how.“ Currently, we are working with multiple key developers on numerous projects to give them these independent power sources.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>In 2017, the visibility is brighter, and the government's budget is higher than in 2016. We expect this to trigger the stabilization of oil prices. The government's drive to establish PPPs will bring more activities and projects in 2017 in many different areas such as health and education that account for 40% of the government's budget. On the consumer level we expect stabilization and we will be capitalizing on the key energy efficiency offerings we have. LG is the first company to offer the full line of split and commercial ACs utilizing inverter compressors. This Dual Inverter technology in the Residential ACs will give up to 53% energy savings and up to 60% faster cooling as per the international TUV Laboratory's certified tests, with a better and healthier operating environment. In addition, we are offering 10 years warranty on the inverter compressor. Those advantages respond to today's requirements of the Saudi consumers in terms of energy saving consumption.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your interpretation of the foreign policy of the country and its key challenges and priorities?</h4><p>Since Costa Rica does not have an army, our main foreign policy focus is multilateralism; we rely on international law and organizations to defend ourselves and promote our interests. As such, we have strategic bilateral relations with traditional partners like the US and the EU, and non-traditional destinations with whom we have tried to focus on three areas. One is Southeast Asia, particularly countries such as Brunei and Malaysia, who were never on the radar of previous administrations. Of course, China is another important player; until recently we were the only country in Central America that had diplomatic relations with it. There are other important areas such as Central Asia, particularly Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. The other region we have paid special attention is in the Middle East Arab countries, in particular the United Arab Emirates, where we are opening a new embassy. In fact representatives from the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development will visit Costa Rica in July, as will the Chambers of Commerce of Dubai and Sharjah, these are also direct results of President Solis visit to Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah in January, 2017. Before the end of this administration, we will have at least four new embassies in Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Abu Dhabi, and Australia.</p><h4>How is the government fostering multilateralism?</h4><p>Since we do not have a diplomatic presence in every ASEAN country, we will participate actively in the FEALAC meeting in Seoul at the end of August. We hosted the meeting in 2015, which is still the only forum for dialog between Latin America and East Asia; hence, the level of participation between the two regions must really be improved. Currently, one of our most important pillars is disarmament in all its forms, especially nuclear, which is why Costa Rica held the presidency of the United Nations Conference to draft a treaty to ban nuclear weapons, which approved a final text on July 7, 2017. The principals of democracy, freedom, human rights, and the environment are key to this. We have been critical of the Central America integration system and have pointed out the need for more transparency, accountability, and results. The reality is that the system is too big, bureaucratic, and inefficient. We had the presidency during the first semester of 2017 and worked hard on institutional reform, pragmatism, and closer relationships with observers. Security policies are also important for us, and drug trafficking in particular is something that is hitting the region hard. Costa Rica has been used for transit purposes, and we need to patrol more efficiently in the Pacific. The problem now is increasing local consumption. In Costa Rica, 65% of murders are drug-related. Therefore, we are working closely with Colombia and Panama to tackle this problem and be more efficient in the fight against drug trafficking. We have also established a closer relationship with the US, and President Solis has visited the White House twice within a period of six to eight months.</p><h4>In what way has the country benefited from abolishing the army, and what are the strategies to ensure security in the country?</h4><p>If you put yourself in the context of 1948, the pattern of Latin American dictatorships, and the civil war in Costa Rica in 1948 and invasion attempt of 1955, then it was a bold and difficult decision. We did it coming out of a civil war that only lasted one month but killed a lot of people. This made it even more difficult to imagine such a decision. That it was in the constitution merely a year later makes it even more difficult to imagine. However, this liberated a lot of resources that used to go to the military that could be now invested in human development, which makes the difference between Costa Rica and many other countries in the world. We defend ourselves by relying on international law; an example is our relationship with Nicaragua, with whom we have fought several cases in the International Court of Justice. Of course, we also need to have a strong solid relationship with our traditional partners while always adding new ones.</p><h4>Why is it important to make a collective effort to foster economic development and security in Central America?</h4><p>It is all about economies of scale, since we are small countries. Every medium-sized company sees Central America as a single market in their strategic business decisions. We have a lot of differences between our different nations that we need to iron out, however. In terms of business, the more unified we are, the better. In terms of international cooperation for development in particular, there are a lot of discrepancies. With the exception of Honduras and Nicaragua, most of the Central American countries are middle-income. This is a categorization that we fight in every forum, as it is an unjust and obsolete criterion with which to exclude from cooperation a large group of countries. Now, we have two giants before us; one is the climate change agreement and the other one is the 2030 agenda of sustainable goals. We really want to work in that direction with the cooperation of the international community, since we cannot do this all by ourselves. We have to be more innovative in terms of cooperation, not just giving money working together, sharing experiences, technical assistance, work on bilateral, regional and triangular cooperation, and in some cases money.</p><h4>Why is Costa Rica unique place to do business and invest in the region?</h4><p>Its human talent, without a doubt. You will find skillful, healthy people who learn quickly, are bilingual, and can learn other languages relatively easily. Corporate services is an area that is growing fast  and is an indication that companies come here for human talent did have confidence in us. This does not mean that manufacturing and agriculture are not important; simply that we are a diversified economy and open for business. We have our problems and need to improve the situation by reducing bureaucracy and giving faster responses to the needs of the international and local investor community. We are working hard on that. We know that employment is a number one concern for everyone and if we do not create jobs and unemployment remains high, then there will be a high social price to pay, particularly for young people, rural areas, and women. What you will find in Costa Rica are people willing to do business with higher standards and to help foreigners, whether they are tourists or investors. Our goal is not to compete with cheap labor; which moved to other countries in the textiles industry a long time ago. What investors should rely on are the testimonies of other companies that have done business for many years in Costa Rica. Another indication of how much people trust Costa Rica is that companies keep growing and reinvesting in the country. It is a stable country from a political, economic, and social point of view.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Partnerships key to success for Nigerian SMEs in 2017]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ifie-sekibo-managing-director-ceo-heritage-bank]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give some background into Heritage Bank's operations and major achievements?</h4><p>We looked at the business foundation of Nigeria when forming Heritage Bank and developing our business model, and observed that no family-owned Nigerian business had successfully transferred local ownership beyond the second generation. The complete business life cycle of Nigerian businesses was only three generations: the first started operations, the second oversaw the decline, and the third buried the business. We asked ourselves what we needed to do differently to correct this and allow Nigerian businesses to thrive from generation to generation. We saw that if we could show that generational banking is the bedrock of economic development we could have a real impact. Among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria, there has been too much of an individual focus, rather than a holistic or intergenerational focus. There is not enough focus on partnership among Nigerian SMEs and this causes ventures to fail. We need to expand this mindset to allow the Nigerian economy to thrive in a sustainable way. Business leaders can create a powerful legacy this way. Our contribution to this effort has been to change the mindset of business leaders in Nigeria. We have emphasized the need for businesses to change their approach toward their ventures, starting with simple yet fundamental things such as ensuring that financials are in order, a board is in place, that risks are shared; and that proper governance mechanisms are in place. This is why we focus so much on technology. With technological innovation, we can drive business. We need to have partnerships; we need to train people. We have to think completely differently as the environment has truly changed.</p><h4>What has been behind Heritage Bank's recent success?</h4><p>Truthfully, it is our people. This business is about the next generation, the young graduates. We started a graduate training program where we take in recent graduates and put them in a six-month training program. They develop ideas and concepts that we had never considered, and that allows us to drive innovation from the bottom up. We want to instil in our people a recognition that it is not about short-term profitability but about creating a legacy. When people think about Heritage Bank, we want them to think about all the qualities that define who we are and what we do, and that process begins with having the best people. By extension, this means that strong and visionary leadership is paramount. Every week we discuss leadership and the things that matter when serving people. We perceive our customers as only those who have accounts with us. We view everyone as potential customers and we treat them accordingly.</p><h4>What are Heritage Bank's expansion plans?</h4><p>Our philosophy does not rely on traditional banking metrics like growth in the number of accounts. It is based on how many businesses we can help develop in the next three years. We want to help develop these companies to the point where they are able to be publicly listed on the primary and secondary markets. We want to put businesses in a position to thrive, and from this our account numbers will increase. In the next five years, we want to see our clients develop from SMEs to being publicly listed on exchanges. We invest in companies that have ambitious visions because we want to see them develop into large and thriving firms that can bring transformative development to Nigeria. We work with our clients to develop plans tailored to their specific growth needs. If we facilitate the success of our clients; then, we are succeeding, and this is my key measure of success. This is not a conventional approach for a bank. Of course, we recognize the importance of sound business fundamentals; however, if we can help our customers develop, then we can be stronger and more profitable. We do not place money first but our customer because this is, in the long term, the best investment.</p><h4>In the long term, what will Heritage Bank's contribution be to the economic diversification of Nigeria?</h4><p>Our contribution to the health of Nigeria's financial sector will be long lasting. I recently pledged my support to the government's program on deforestation, because if we do not take care of the earth, the earth cannot continue to take care of us. The connection between planting trees and banking is not obvious at first glance; however, they are quite connected. The desert is encroaching in the north of the country, and if we do not plant trees and replace our forests then we will lose valuable and important land. There is also a cultural dimension. Most people relate forests with culture, and in our culture we are dependent upon our land. As a bank, if we provide our customers, SMEs, with good training then we will benefit greatly in the long run. We want to see the connection between business ventures and Nigerian society. When SMEs begin to understand that a simple change in their business model will both positively impact their businesses and the earth, then we can make businesses more profitable and sustainable.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>I am extremely optimistic. We came down from 7% growth a year ago to 2% growth and we will finish the year with somewhere between 3-3.5% YoY growth. This will be because the government has showed significant leadership in terms of tackling infrastructure issues. Infrastructure has such a large impact on business. We are also becoming much more efficient in terms of power consumption versus production. We have become more responsible in terms of energy use. By emphasizing efficient operations, we are reducing our energy usage and increasing productivity. I am certain that we will achieve much more in the years ahead and will see reasonable growth. In terms of the banking industry, we can easily climb above 15% growth; because technology helps us do business better. Our cost of doing business is shrinking. As more customers take advantage of our technology, our operations become more efficient; our operations and our profitability improves.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Having a wide range of activities across multiple sectors, how do you assess the role of family-owned businesses like yours in the diversification of the Qatari economy?</h4><p>Qatar has enjoyed rapid success, and the role of the family in Qatari business is paramount to this success. We have weathered the storm of globalization and commercialization of business by returning to our roots in developing a business through our family. The company was created and handed down to my brothers, and I am sure we will continue the tradition by handing over the business to our sons. The ability to have this fresh generation of minds has only helped to benefit the business while ensuring the success of our family and strengthening our family bond. The diversification of the Qatari economy has been rapid and heavily influenced by external involvement, so to be able to oversee a cyclical business evolution from a family perspective is something that we cherish and is also a good way to support young people.</p><h4>In a context of low oil prices, how have you shifted your focus to industrial areas other than gas?</h4><p>Low oil prices have had devastating effects throughout the global industry, but everyone must adjust, not just in Qatar. We have spent a greater deal of time observing rather than reacting immediately. Knowledge is the key to dealing with such changes and in order to change we need to first understand what is going on, what has been successful, and what has failed to challenge the new economy. We have had to change how we integrate new business, invest, and handle our internal processes to cope with the low gas prices, but we also have not stopped advancing our business into other areas, which are experiencing continued growth. The oil and gas industry is still lucrative even with current oil prices; we just have to accept low prices as the reality and adapt to what we have.</p><h4>Qatar seeks to become a tourism destination within the region. How are you contributing to the expansion of F&amp;B and hospitality offer within the country?</h4><p>We are continuously looking for new and fresh concepts to bring to Qatar. When tourists come to Qatar they are not only looking for some of the incredible hospitality offerings we have, but it is also enjoyable to see some familiar brands. The ability to integrate new concepts into Qatar while driving Qatari culture has been shown in some of the menus and concepts that provide Arabic fusion dishes. This has been incredibly popular, and we work diligently with global brands to create fresh dishes that have geographical tastes.</p><h4>What are your ambitions in the real estate division to continue growing your portfolio within Qatar and what markets are you targeting internationally?</h4><p>Internationally, London is a major interest to our organization. The British market continues to grow and offer opportunities that we want to continue to capitalize on. Qataris find London very appealing not only for business but also for social activities. Therefore, bringing businesses to this location will provide us with an immediate clientele. We are an organization that prides itself on ambitions of providing the highest quality of service to our clients. As the market changes with low gas prices, the economy has shifted from high supply and low demand. In order to be competitive and surpass our competition we have focused on the smallest details, such as our general services, preventative and corrective maintenance, and our amenities such as a world-class pool, gym, tennis court, basketball court, 24-hour security, and children's play area.</p><h4>Looking at the changing demands of the Qatari population, what new trends has the Group observed and how are you going to capitalize on future opportunities?</h4><p>Qatar is continuing to grow and develop toward the FIFA 2022 World Cup and reaching Qatar National Vision 2030. We are constantly trying to align with the Vision, while observing new and innovative ways to contribute to it.</p><h4>What are your expectations and plans for the year ahead, and where would you like to see this family business in the future?</h4><p>Multiple-year planning is essential to our business, so we are not just planning for the year ahead. The diversification of our business will continue to be a key movement in the organization as we look at alternative and non-traditional verticals such as education and community mall offerings. We want to continue to build our brand in line with Qatar National Vision 2030 and position ourselves as a prominent provider of high-quality services in Qatar and beyond.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the PMU's main academic strengths?</h4><p>At the very start, the founder of PMU, HRH Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd Bin Abdulaziz decided that the new institution should represent a remarkable addition to existing higher education institutions in the Kingdom. Therefore the design of the PMU system and academic programs followed the most developed and effective methodologies which resulted in a university encompassing the most effective learning environment. An outstanding academic strength of PMU is the adoption of the Core Curriculum which is designed and included in the curricula of all Colleges. The Core Curriculum is designed to enable the students to acquire the competencies they need to be successful in their chosen fields and to contribute to the development of their community and the Kingdom. These competencies are: Communication, Technological Competence, Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Professional Competence, Teamwork, and Leadership. PMU provides a learning- not teaching- environment that is student-centered and aims at developing the student as a whole person. A learning outcomes assessment process is continually applied so as to ensure that all objectives are successfully accomplished and required improvements are constantly introduced. By adopting a student-centered approach, we aim at enhancing students' abilities to develop as life long-learner and pursue improvement during their studies and long after they have graduated. PMU has experienced high graduate employability rates in the region. Our graduates have proven to join the workforce ready to function and perform outstandingly. This is not only related to knowledge in the subject matter, but particularly reflecting strong communication, adaptability, leadership and professionalism. Data is constantly collected from the job market and directly from Aramco, the largest oil company in the world but also our most eminent graduate employer. This reputation has consequently helped PMU build an institutional role in the region and we are currently partners of major companies like SABIC, in preparing their employees for education and training abroad. PMU employs highly qualified and experienced faculty from all over the world. As a result there are faculty from over 30 nationalities on campus. This fact has enriched cultural diversity on campus and contributed positively to the learning experience of our students. PMU is also flagged as an IT-based university. We have invested massively in our learning technology infrastructure during the establishment stage and are still investing to ensure our campus is continuously upgraded to the latest learning and teaching technologies available internationally. All our classrooms are infused with technologies, they are for example connected with Blackboard and Banner and are equipped with the latest conferencing technologies, smart boards and strong internet connectivity and are therefore known as smart classrooms. We also have advanced Course Management, Student Management and Administrative Management systems. The Learning Resources Center at PMU is not a traditional library but in addition to providing library services it provides learning enrichment and academic advising to the students. Therefore it is a learning hub for student academic projects, student innovation and research, student academic support and advising. Finally quality is at the core of our success. Key performance indicators are implemented down to the most particular details in program design and delivery, in assessment, in teaching and learning, in student employability rates and even in co-curricular programs design. We have recently succeeded in meeting all the requirements for the ABET accreditation. We are also accredited by the National Commission for Academic Accreditation and Assessment (NCAAA).</p><h4>What do you think about some of the changes that will arise for the Eastern Province?</h4><p>The Eastern Province is the most important industrial and business region in the Kingdom. It embraces the Oil industry and the main and longest oil reserves in the world. There are also the basic industries of the Kingdom represented by the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) and a lot of other industries such as food industries and manufacturing industries. As such, the Eastern Province is poised to develop more and more and will continue attracting more and more people to work and live in it. Therefore, there will definitely be constant progress and development in main and support sectors. This will be reflected in increased business, urbanization and a proliferation of recreational and service institutions. In addition there will be an increase in educational institutions including Colleges and Universities.</p><h4>What do you gain from your international partnerships and will you be looking more toward increasing the number of foreign students?</h4><p>We have international partnerships in many parts of the world. We gain international outlook to diversity and successful practices witnessed in different higher education institutions around the world. Currently we are establishing three Arabic Language programs, namely in Turkey, Kazakhstan, and China. We have developed international collaboration programs with a number of renowned universities, such as the University Of Central Florida (UCF), that houses the Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd Program for Strategic Research and Studies. We also have developed collaboration with the University Of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) that houses the King Abdulaziz Endowed Chair for Islamic Studies, and we have established King Fahd program for Dispute Resolution at Pepperdine. Regarding student diversity, the Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd Scholarship Program, which is implemented it in collaboration with the Arab League, has hosted more than 40 students from the Arab world on full scholarships and  the same program is now being established with Turkey and Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What are your expectations and key strategic objectives for 2018?</h4><p>In 2018 we will continue pursuing our roadmap that includes the establishment of a School of Architecture, the Prince Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz College for the Visually Impaired, the Medical School and the Teaching Hospital. By this we hope to continue serving education in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia and preparing global graduates that will assume leading roles locally and internationally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over the past year you have received many accolades such as 'Banker of the Year' and 'Man of the Year.' What is behind these great achievements?</h4><p>I do not view these awards as personal recognitions; they are a recognition of the work our team did in the previous year. We have been able to strike a strong balance between maintaining profit and doing things that are sustainable. We exist to make economic returns for our shareholders; however, there are other things that are important to us, namely issues around people, the planet, profit, and more. If there is anything that has enabled us to win significant accolades, it is the team I work with and what they have achieved as far as those elements are concerned.</p><h4>What advice would you give to your peers in the industry to achieve this success?</h4><p>The important thing is to have a well-rounded value system. We started our journey on sustainability-related issues around five or six years ago. Some people pay it lip service but it is important if a company wants to grow in a sustainable way, if it wants to have a better place to do business, if it wants to make sure that the communities that it operates in will benefit, and if it wants to make our country a better place. The whole idea for my colleagues and I is to pursue sustainable banking practices. My advice is simply this: Do the right thing. It is the right way to do business.</p><h4>What are the main factors behind the Bank becoming one of the top three banks in the country?</h4><p>From the beginning, we assembled a strong team and drove a culture of excellence. This ensured complete harmony in terms of the value system of the institution—something we desired from the start. We however had to break it down into bands of five years, each with stretching goals. We did not target being one of the top three in the first five years, but rather in the top 10. Right after that, we wanted to be in the top five and be seen and known as the world's most respected African bank. A great deal of what people do is as a result of their background, training, professional experience, exposure, and upbringing. We want our people to confidently stand toe-to-toe with other professionals in their field anywhere in the world.</p><h4>What strategy will you adopt to become the world's most respected African Bank?</h4><p>A company needs a solid financial background to be the world's most respected African bank. It must have strong numbers, a global outlook, and a strong presence on the continent. All of these have been achieved and our various subsidiaries are doing well. However, the second part—which is just as important—has to do with the softer issues around sustainability. This revolves around what we do with respect to the three elements of people, the planet, and profit and what we are doing with respect to the communities where we do business. This does not only involve Nigeria but all the markets in which we play. These are the things that ensure that a company will earn respect internationally, and today we are close to that objective.</p><h4>What are your current expansion plans?</h4><p>We have a hit map of places that we could possibly expand to. We have decided to slow down our African expansion and consolidate on where we currently are. Nigeria represents the greatest opportunity in the continent by far and a company has to be extremely strong at home before it ventures out. We are building and strengthening our business in Nigeria—the central point from which we drive our strategy for the rest of Africa and the other countries where we have a presence. We will add one or two new locations; though the contributions from all of those countries are marginal in comparison to Nigeria. We will, however do them over time.</p><h4>As the country recovers from the downturn, how have banks been hit and how are they doing now?</h4><p>The capabilities of banks now are much stronger than in 2007 and 2008. Any time we go through a recession, it has its implications on the industry, hence, there is a heightened risk level in terms of provisioning. We did not have the foreign exchange capacity and because Nigeria is largely import-oriented this introduced increased risk elements, particularly for manufacturing concerns and others that typically rely on imported raw materials. There is some increased risk from non-performing loans that are likely to season within the next 24 months, but this likelihood has dropped.</p><h4>What will be the role of banking in the diversification of Nigeria's economy?</h4><p>There are two schools of thought. Some say economic development precedes the development of the industry. However, in Nigeria and most of the emerging markets, developments in the financial services sector drive economic development. With greater financial inclusion, banks are able to access much more liquidity, which they can then pump into the real economy. As a result of competition and the greater skill levels in the industry, we are likely to see much larger banks in the next five years and these banks will push Nigeria's GDP growth to higher levels. If we go back 10 or even five years ago and look at the relative size of banks compared to today, it is clear that this is the case. The next five years will also be dramatic because banks are now deepening themselves in the retail market, providing better services, lending to individuals and customers, changing their operating styles, creating a stronger database, and creating all the relevant governance required to establish credit for individuals. All of these lead to the development of the economy at the end of the day. Apart from the banks, other institutions such as the pension funds are likely to start looking into opportunities for development in infrastructure and agriculture. All these will help Nigeria achieve double-digit growth, even without changes to the oil price.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the economy in 2018?</h4><p>2018 will be a much better year as the worst is over. Nigeria is expected to come out of the recession and we will begin to see reasonable growth as far as the markets are concerned. Banks will adjust from the seasoning of those loans that basically crystalized coming from the devaluation; however, if we look at the relative health of banks, some banks are strong and therefore have the capacity to push the market in terms of the economy. I believe 2018 will be a much better</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Coosalud is one of the largest insurance company in Colombia and a top-ranked Health Promoting Company (EPS in Spanish) according to the Ministry of Health. How did it gain its leadership position?</h4><p>We are a cooperative company—in other words, a non-profit organization. Coosalud has grown exponentially in numbers; however, our most important asset is people. Developing our human capital has really translated into huge gains. Our main objective is to help the poor population in Colombia. One of the primary things we do at health insurance industry is evaluate people's risk in order to minimize their threats. As a result, we have improved people's health by reducing deaths because of foreseeable diseases such as cervical cancer and certain cardiovascular illnesses, adding healthy years of life for Colombians. To develop our people , we have implemented some programs to boost happiness at work ensuring not only with competitive salaries, but also giving them tons of reasons for being proud at Coosalud's family. The monetary aspect is important, but being a part of an organization socially and environmentally responsible makes our employees feel satisfied. We believe that if the employees are happy at work, people with sickness and diseases will receive better and more human service. This has allowed us to achieve two milestones. First, our affiliates chose us as the best EPS in Colombia, and second, we were chosen by “Great Place to Work" as one of the top-10 companies to work for in Latin America.</p><h4>How would you assess the economic and social impact that Coosalud has had on the Caribbean region?</h4><p>The Caribbean coast is one of the most underdeveloped areas in Colombia. The poverty rate is high compared to other regions and it's an area where the rural population has few economic resources, and that's why our company has a huge impact, if people get sick , they wouldn't be able to afford the treatment in an easy way. Therefore , our strategy to focus on poor people has allowed many of them access to healthcare services. As a result, we have steadily reduced the mortality rates in that region and increased people's chances of employment. We also directly employ about 900 people. In addition, Coosalud has been one of the best health insurance companies (EPS) in terms of implementing the government policy to supply health services to remote areas with the poorest people, reducing mortality and morbidity indicators, and allowing people to be more productive and find better jobs.</p><h4>What are the key successes of the health system? What are the top challenges? </h4><p>The health system has been effective, particularly for poor people in Colombia. For instance, the infant mortality rate in the 1990s was over 27%, while by 2014 it stood at 14%. Additionally, The health system has private and public resources. This has allowed the system to cover wide swathes of the population; not only for higher income people, but also for lower income people through financial solidarity. Before the EPS law, about 60% of births were delivered in hospitals, the rate that is now 97%. On the other hand, EPS's affiliates have had huge challenges due to a lack of proper funding. In addition to ensuring against the health risk of a person, the health system also protects against financial risk, because the out-of-pocket expense is only 14%. The World Health Organization has it listed it as one of the best in the world. Without additional resources, this will generate a long-lasting recession in the system, which in the end worsens the overall quality. Despite these challenges, the indexes show that the health of Colombians is still improving year by year. To sum things up, the health system has been positive for the development of Colombia. With an average of USD200 annually, people in Colombia have access to a universal healthcare system, which attends to over one million people daily, compared to USD600 in Chile or USD19,000 in the US.</p><h4>What foreign investment opportunities are there in Colombia's healthcare sector?</h4><p>There is a huge opportunity because the healthcare system still requires more capital to stabilize its finances. There are currently 14 beds for every 10,000 inhabitants. However, 18 of the 45 best hospitals in Latin America are Colombian. Many international groups such as Sanitas have already invested in the country. The international interest for this sector is showing its huge opportunities. Colombia spends about USD20 billion on healthcare, a huge amount of money, which should mainly come from the government. This large sum should be very attractive for investors.</p><h4>What opportunities will result from the Colombia's peace agreement?</h4><p>It will certainly benefit foreign investors because rebel groups as the FARC were a hazard for them. The rule of law is guaranteed in Colombia, and this is a country that protects foreign investment. This post-conflict atmosphere will also generate a great opportunity to invest in all those under-developed areas where the rebel groups were previously present. In our sector, new hospitals and health centers will certainly be built in these regions. In the end, Colombia has a great opportunity to grow, and investors are welcome here. What's more, we are also trying to join the OECD, then I believe investors could look at the country as a real star in the global economy.</p><h4>What are your remaining goals for 2017?</h4><p>We are searching for a partner to provide us with the equity we need to grow in this sector. We have about 8% of the affiliates in the subsidized regimen over the country, and about 3% in the total industry. Our goal is to grow in both and penetrate the contributory scheme, where we are currently not active. We also want to improve our risk management programs to make an impact in our people's health. Our goal is to become a national and international standard in health insurance industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Bisha University branches at Tathleeth, Balgarn, and Al-Namas]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ahmad-bin-hamid-naqadi-president-bisha-university]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you give us a background to Bisha University and the role it plays under King Khalid University?</h4><p>In the 1980s Saudi Arabia only had seven universities, but with branches in many regions. Now the number of universities has increased to 28 distributed around the country. Some of these new universities started out as branches of the original seven universities. Bisha University was a branch of King Khalid University, although originally it was an education college that started some 20 years ago. When the Higher Education Ministry joined all these colleges into Saudi Arabia's higher education system, Bisha was put under the vision of King Khalid University. This continued until April 2014, when Bisha University was established. I became President in 2016. The most important part of my job has been to restructure the university's colleges. For example, I found we had three colleges in one with humanities, sciences, and IT disciplines all put together. Therefore, the colleges needed to be restructured and reorganized to put various disciplines in the right place. In 2017 we got approval for the restructuring of the university's colleges. Today, we have 15 colleges, including applied medicine, science, business, humanities, and more. Currently, we have 17,000 students at Bisha University, 80% of whom are female. Our headquarters are in Bisha, but we have three branches in smaller towns in the provinces of Tathleeth, Balgarn, and Al-Namas. In the future, these branches could be new universities in their own right.</p><h4>How important is a university like this for the town of Bisha and the other centers where you have branches? Does the university provide a learning ecosystem, development, and new business opportunities for these areas?</h4><p>People in these towns are all happy to have this university. We have received a lot of support locally for whatever the university wants to do. A university is important for local economic development. Having a local university is also particularly important for smaller towns to increase their opportunities to access higher education. Historically, students had to go to a bigger city if they wanted to go further with their education. However, now this is not the case because they have a local university in their hometown. Now parents are much more comfortable because their daughters can go to university nearby. There is a difference in culture between the cities and the regions in terms of education and male and female students sharing facilities, for example. In some regions this kind of facility sharing is not allowed. We have good female students at Bisha University and have established a talent center to discover and select students regardless of whether they are boys or girls. This is intended to create a good study environment for the future.</p><h4>Privatization is a major trend in Saudi Arabia's education sector now. How will this affect Bisha University?</h4><p>We have started our first strategic plan for the university and the most important factor is that our plan should match Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030. The most important element of the Vision 2030 for universities is how we will find other, non-government sources of income to develop our universities in the future. This is what we are trying to do at Bisha University. For example, we are free to create new academic programs that students pay for, such as higher degrees and diplomas. Bisha University also has the advantage of having good locations and we want to invest in these. We are discussing with businesses how and where we can invest. We are asking businesses from cities such as Jeddah to come to Bisha and invest, as it is a good center to develop your business in. We have many factors that make Bisha advantageous for business.</p><h4>Have you looked at attracting international students to Bisha University and is the university setting up any international partnerships with overseas faculties to share ideas and experience?</h4><p>We strongly believe that to succeed as a new university, we have to have cooperation and innovation with other countries and especially international universities. We have signed an agreement with the Malaysian Technology University's Engineering College and we will start by having an exchange of students, by sending 10-15 students there to do some training.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the next academic year at Bisha University?</h4><p>I am looking to the future in Bisha. I have been involved in higher education for more than 30 years and I want Bisha to be one of the leading universities not just in Saudi Arabia, but abroad as well. Having a smaller university with fewer students, rather than big numbers, can help us create a prominent and successful university. There are good examples of this in the US. Our academic staff is happy and dedicated to making this happen, because it wants this to be a top university, which is key for our success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Mining provides ample opportunities for logistics firms in Zambia]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[olivier-terra-managing-director-of-bollore-transport-logistics-zambia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Is mining still a significant sector for logistics companies?</h4><p>Yes that is quite true for Zambia. Logistics and transport companies are often heavily mining orientated because that is where volumes come from. In the mining sector, there are many local contractors, representing global brands, who rely on logistics advice to make a difference. We consult with them not only on transports and supply chain cost analysis, but also on customs formalities that go beyond clearing goods in and out of the country—how to manage customs risks, temporary import validities, how to optimize the use of bonded warehouses, and so on. But we also recognize different needs from our other Zambian customers: we have invested in value-added warehousing activities and geared ourselves to diversify our portfolio of customers. We have also developed a successful export business focusing on agricultural products and industrial commodities. Export companies seek deals in the region with DRC, Malawi, Eastern Congo, Burundi, and Rwanda, as well as to far-flung markets. We have solutions to export to all those places.</p><h4>What is the thinking behind the Chingola hub?</h4><p>Our logistics hub in Chingola was set up specifically to answer the needs of the Katanga mining business. It is a business geared around the movement of copper and cobalt, extracted from the DRC, crossing the border of Kasumbalesa, offloading in Chingola before sorting and dispatching along the Durban, Dar, or Beira corridors. The transport of these goods is a complex and sensitive process, and it was vital to set up a hub in the right location. Chingola, located in the Copperbelt, close to the Kasumbalesa border, is the ideal location. It is located next to our White Horse premises and is the meeting point for two fleets of trucks operating simultaneously—one carrying copper and other minerals from the Katanga province in the DRC and the other bringing supplies and consumables from South Africa. Cargo is transferred in our 18,000sqm secure warehouse facility.</p><h4>In terms of logistics, what measures would you like to see implemented by the government in the medium term to boost the sector?</h4><p>On a practical level, we need to work on improving border management and alleviating congestion at the borders. For this, first we need to fix the root cause of congestion. There are issues related to this; for example, of ISPs not being able to provide enough internet capacity to support customs' "paperless" system, Asycuda World. If customs wants to have an entry registered in one place and have it electronically assessed in another, it needs strong connectivity. We have engaged both customs and the Ministry of Finance through our Association of Clearing and Forwarding Agents (ZCFAA) and made proposals to streamline operations. In response, customs and the Minister of Finance have set up technical committees to oversee the progress of propositions made. Elsewhere, we see a stronger and more regulation-heavy approach from the Ministry of Transport, which recently introduced a measure to prevent trucks from driving at night and intends to impose a quota system for transport of bulk material on rail.</p><h4>Does Zambia have the potential to become a logistics hub for southeastern Africa?</h4><p>Given its geography, Zambia can play a vital role in the region as a transit zone for goods. However, to fulfill this potential, it is vital that all measures and regulations are carefully thought through and designed to facilitate movement of cargo. One such area that needs to be looked at is VAT on transit cargo. Transit cargo should not attract VAT, and in operations where we perform transit services in Zambia, it is essential that ancillary services on transit cargo also do not carry VAT. Otherwise, this would add unnecessary costs and make it less attractive for shippers and contractors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the fundamental changes implemented as part of the privatization process, and what lessons can the country learn from your experience?</h4><p>Privatization is a journey that starts with a vision and this vision starts with specific objectives to be achieved. SAUDIA's journey of privatization started with many cycles dating back as far as 20 years ago. There were some challenges then, however, and we set about a new journey eight years back. The approach of privatization has been focused on privatizing the subsidiaries of the group. There have been successes achieved in this journey so far. As we go, we learn from what has been achieved and we are building on our successes, adapting to new changes, reacting to the lessons that we have learned along the way, and continuing on this journey. Until now, we have two companies that are already listed, while some of the companies went with strategic partnerships. Privatization goes into a number of stages, starting with corporatization, governance, and then operational improvements. Ultimately, we reach the stage of an IPO if the company is in the right state and if the market conditions are favorable. As mentioned, we have two companies already listed; one company has already passed the stage of strategic partnership and is ready for listing when the market is right for that, while another two companies have undergone corporatization, governance, business improvement, and are now at the stage of having strategic partners. We already have a strategic partner for Saudia Private Aviation (SPA). The next step is to do the same for Prince Sultan Aviation Academy (PSAA) and for our real estate unit, Saudi Airlines Real Estate Development (SARED). We believe that Saudia Aerospace Engineering Industries (SAEI), another major subsidiary, can create huge value for the national program to localize the defense industry, manufacturing, and MRO activities. We are working with the government, having a dialog to see how we can contribute to this for the long-term sustainability of the country's aviation sector.</p><h4>As the flagship carrier of the country, to what extent are plans for future fleet and route expansion business-oriented decisions as supposed to satisfying strategic objectives?</h4><p>SAUDIA is the national carrier of Saudi Arabia, is currently in its 72nd year of operations and holds a unique position. Moreover, we have launched a five-year strategy that is really transforming SAUDIA into a commercial, competitive entity relying on its own resources. We have started this implementation, adapting elements of growth as well as improving productivity and efficiency, services, and overall customer experience. We are also adapting and redesigning products to cater for the needs and wants of the specific customer segments that we have identified. To support that, a number of enabling initiatives have been launched. Furthermore, while we are the face of the country in each of our destinations and have strategic objectives to satisfy in this regard, we are fully committed to being a sustainable and thriving business entity and the initiatives we have launched in recent years cater to this precisely.</p><h4>How much of your own growth strategy correlates to the expected growth of the Hajj and Umrah industry?</h4><p>SAUDIA plays a role in the government's National Transformation Program 2020 and Vision 2030. There are three major initiatives that require strong collaboration with SAUDIA. The strategy that SAUDIA has launched and adapted is fully aligned with the Vision and National Transformation Program. We are in dialog with different government entities and others to make sure that we fully align our programs together. Religious tourism is one of the major areas of collaboration, as the Vision calls for the number of Umrah visitors to grow to 20 million by 2020 and 30 million by 2030. This is a target we are all committed to working towards. This target will create opportunities, but at the same time will need significant investment, planning, and working together with a number of stakeholders in order for that to take shape. The plan to increase our fleet and establish new routes is part of this plan. There are many international markets which we already fly to, and seek to develop stronger ties with and increase flight frequencies and capacity, in order to transport and welcome more pilgrims to the Land of the Two Holy Mosques.</p><h4>In a regional aspect, do you see this is the main strength of SAUDIA in comparison with other regional heavyweights?</h4><p>I can identify three unique characteristics of SAUDIA when we compare it to others. One is the position of Saudi Arabia among the Muslim world, hosting the two Holy Mosques and receiving a growing number of pilgrims. The second unique attribute is that SAUDIA provides the most authentic service to Arab hospitality, Arab culture and values. The third element, when compared to other companies, is that we rely more on our nation's human resources. These are the three unique factors that differentiate SAUDIA from other players in the region.</p><h4>Looking ahead, what are your short-term goals and expectations for 2017?</h4><p>In June 2017 at the Paris Air Show which took place at Le Bourget airspace, we were honored to receive the Skytrax award for the 'World's Most Improved Airline.' Receiving the award is a testament to the hard work, commitment, and contributions from all SAUDIA employees. One key thing to note is that the company is changing. Everything we do—all services—is undergoing review and transformation. The airline's Transformation Plan was first instituted in mid-2015 and will carry on until 2020. As part of the SV2020 transformation program, we have about 140 active initiatives. Also, we are expediting our efforts to meet the ambitious targets while also overcoming the increasing challenges of the market with respect to competition, lower purchasing power, and the changing operating environment. One notable measure we have taken is to launch our own low-cost carrier, Flyadeal, which is expected to debut in late September 2017 and will further strengthen Saudi Arabia's ever-dynamic, and long-standing aviation sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook regarding foreign investments in the hydrocarbons sector? How has Colombia rebounded from recent challenging years?</h4><p>At the beginning of 2017, there was still a negative impact from the collapse in international commodity prices. There has been a strong decrease in prices since 2015-2016, which has led to an ongoing investment standby. These conditions have deferred investment in projects and new expansion plans. The initial impact on lower prices goes directly into the investment programs that have been executed over the last year. With lower investments, you will have a lower base of reserves, and will, therefore, see a negative direct impact on production. That being said, prices have stabilized at around a range between USD45-55 per barrel. With prices stabilizing, we will start to see investment programs recovering and regaining traction throughout 2017. The initial calculations from the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP) show that exploration investments are doubling in 2017. By the end of the year and for 2018, we can expect to see clearer results in terms of maintaining the level of production. The target for this year is 840 million barrels, but we expect that to increase as things recover.</p><h4>What are your ministry's strategies to further incentivize investments in the hydrocarbon sector?</h4><p>In terms of what we have been doing in government, the tax reform that was approved in December 2016 includes provisions that incentivize new investments. We have an investment instrument that was used in the 1990s for export promotion, Certificate for Tax Reimbursements (CERT), and CERT helps you get reimbursed for various taxes in cases where you can prove you're putting delta investments over the minimum commitments you have in the E&amp;P contract. Basically, what we are doing through this is creating financial incentives that will improve the break-even cost of new exploration and additional reserve projects. We're also doing a target incentive for mining to incentivize additional investments there too. This will improve the base of investments, and also hopefully expedite these programs. These will all be critical for investments going into 2018 and 2019. Another instrument that we have introduced in the tax reform is the reimbursement of VAT for offshore exploration. This is critical, because a new frontier offshore project in the Caribbean has long-term periods of exploratory phases, with nine-year averages. You will now be able to get reimbursed for your VAT the first year after you do the investment, which translates into ten years if the project is on time. The financial cost of a 19% VAT over ten years is huge. Hence, we are saying that as long as you keep this money flowing into the investment program, you can get reimbursed on year T+1, meaning the first year following the investment. We also introduced incentives for renewables, which will be significant in the coming years, given the fact that there is a huge opportunity in the market for incorporating new renewable technologies into the energy matrix of the country.  </p><h4>What impact are you expecting these measures to have on investments?</h4><p>The first calculations the ACP did in oil exploration show that we could double our investment from 2016 into 2017 from USD1.5 billion per annum to more than USD3.3 billion. Once the incentives come into effect, we will start seeing results as soon as 2018. The Colombian Mining Association also estimated investments of up to USD7.5 billion over the next five years, which is 10 times the annual average. Therefore, we are expecting a significant recovery of investments in oil and mining, and a lot of new resources coming into the energy market through new renewable investments.</p><h4>What developments are you expecting to be made this year regarding Colombia's offshore resources?</h4><p>It is important to note that from the National Development Plan, 2010-2014, Colombia sent the policy guidelines to develop this new frontier. Thanks to geological knowledge and higher levels of seismic activity, we hope that in the medium and long term, we can add new reserves to the country's oil potential. In 2017, we have five exploratory targets to be drilled throughout the year, at a cost of about USD700 million, a significant new frontier. It is one of the largest exploration programs anywhere in the world this year. For new frontier programs, you need to be very confident that you will find the resources you're looking for, and three out of three drilling tests we have done this year have shown that we do indeed have the resources there, namely Kronos, Purple Angel I, and Gorgon I. That's a high success rate. If these exploration campaigns in 2017 prove what we and the companies believe, it is a potential whole new frontier for gas and oil, and the development of offshore will become the biggest bet we'll have for the next years. The potential capacity of resources accounts for multiple times the resources we have today. It's early to talk about numbers as of yet, but the technical teams think we can double or even triple the country's reserves in the medium term, depending on long-term price signals in the market. So the potential reward is huge.</p><h4>What role must the energy and mining sectors play in the post-conflict era?</h4><p>The potential of the resources waiting to be exploited in these regions is critical. The aim is to be able to access these regions and do the studies and geophysical tests to see what is out there. The peace agreement will now allow us to be able to do this. The first obvious thing we need to do is access the territory once closed-off by the conflict and determine what resources are there. We also introduced something called “Works for Taxes" which are infrastructure investments that can be exchanged for the payment of taxes. It is similar to what the Peruvians did for their mining industry. This will give you the capacity to structure a portfolio of projects that need to be developed in the regions, some of which are tough to get into. Therefore, the energy sector will indeed be important in terms of economically opening these regions up and integrating them into the national grid. After five decades of internal conflicts and civil war, we need to understand that the relationship with the territories needs to be done more in a one-on-one, face-to-face way. The post-conflict peace process will necessitate a different way in which companies, governments, and territories relate and talk to one another. We will have to learn new ways to communicate and work together in this sense. It will take time, for sure, but we need new ways of relating to each other to implement and construct a lasting and sustainable peace.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do assess the contribution of ICIIC to the development of the chemical and petrochemical industry in Iran?</h4><p>Iran Chemical Industries Investment Company (I.C.I.I.C.) established by Bank of Industry and Mine. Our company produces linear alkyl benzene, which is the main raw material for powder and liquid detergent. To produce this product we use a technology that we originally received from an American company named Universal Oil Products (UOP). We signed our contract 25 years ago with the London branch of UOP because of the limitations of dealing with the US. Our original capacity was around 50,000 tons per year and we started our production around 22 years ago. The yearly demand in the domestic market at that time was around 38,000 tons. The remainder of our capacity was exported to countries like India and countries in the Persian Gulf such as Kuwait, Qatar, and sometimes Oman. Around 12-15 years ago, we did our first expansion project and increased our capacity from 50,000 to 75,000 tons per year. To produce linear alkyl benzene we used kerosene as the main raw material, which we received from Esfahan Refinery via a pipeline to our factory. In the process of producing linear alkyl benzene, normal paraffin is produced. Also at that time we increased the capacity to produce normal paraffin from 43,000 per year to 140,000 tons in our first expansion project. After that we also exported normal paraffin and not only linear alkyl benzene. In some countries like India, which do not have oil, normal paraffin is used to produce linear alkyl benzene instead of kerosene, which is a product from the oil refinery. When we completed our first expansion project we had already exported annually around 75,000 tons of normal paraffin.</p><h4>What is your strategy for staying ahead of the competition here?</h4><p>During the last few years we sold around 75,000 tons of linear alkyl benzene to the domestic market, with which we fulfill 90% of domestic demand. The consumption of detergent in the country has increased from 2kg per capita annually 22 years ago to over 15kg now. In some European countries consumption is even at 35kg. Before ICIIC was founded, all the linear alkyl benzene that was needed in Iran was imported, mainly from Spain, Italy, and Germany. After we started our production nearly the full domestic demand was delivered by us and the average consumption of detergent increased. In the process of producing linear alkyl benzene we use a dangerous hydrofluoric acid (HF acid) as a catalyst. The boiling point of this acid is 18 degrees centigrade and breathing air polluted by HF acid (Gas form) will absorb body calcium and would lead to certain death. Because using the HF acid as a catalyst is so dangerous, UOP improved its technology and changed the catalyst from liquid HF acid to another catalyst called DETAL. During the last 2-3 years we negotiated with UOP London to receive this latest technology. Because of the sanctions, every time it said it was ready, something happened and we had to wait. After the signing of the nuclear deal, UOP accepted to start negotiations about providing us with this new technology. This resulted in a contract that was signed in late 2016. We are now in the process of paying an advance to it and we have done a kick-off meeting with UOP people in Istanbul. We have arranged an appointment to have technical meetings with UOP London soon to train our technical staff and receive the new technology. We are now conducting our second expansion project, which involves the removal of the dangerous HF acid from our production process while increasing the capacity by around 100,000 tons per year. Once completed, we will be able to produce around 200,000 tons of linear alkyl benzene per year.</p><h4>What is the export strategy of your subsidiary Commercial Port Services?</h4><p>This company fully belongs to ICIIC and is located at Bushehr Port, on the Persian Gulf. It operates around 10 storage tanks. We send our product by truck from Esfahan to Bushehr. From there it goes to its final destination by vessel. We export to countries like India, China, Indonesia, and sometimes Turkey and Pakistan. We have some exports to Turkey by road as well, but mainly it goes by vessel from the port.</p><h4>Are there new export markets which you are targeting?</h4><p>We have some plans to develop our export markets and are looking for some African countries. When you go through the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea there are some African countries like Kenya and Sudan and we are looking for markets in those countries to develop our export market. We want to focus on the eastern part of Africa because it is important to be careful with the transportation costs. Our competitor is a Spanish company that also produces linear alkyl benzene. From Spain they use the Mediterranean Sea to transport their products so when we are going to transport our product we need to be able to compete. This is why we are looking to export to countries where we can compete on transportation costs. We have agreements with some experienced consultants to assist us in opening new markets.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>I am positive. Especially for petrochemical companies, the future will provide good market circumstances. Our product sales and exports increase every year and we believe that our second expansion project and the application of the new catalyst technology will allow us to increase our revenues.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the current economic situation of the country?</h4><p>As far as economic and social stability are concerned, the economic, social, financial, developmental, health, environmental, and educational situations have been subject to consecutive crises due to many external and internal causes. While the external causes are out of our control and we can only limit their repercussions, the internal causes compel us to tackle them with a transformational approach, which begins with an economic reform based on planning and coordination between the ministries and the digitization of various state administrations. We cannot go on without comprehensive, sector-based economic plans. Indeed, without planning, the state cannot stand tall, and a state without a civil society cannot be built. Investing wealth from natural resources in productive projects is at the foundation of a growing liberal economy based on individual entrepreneurship. Partnerships between the private and public sectors, within a targeted and developed financial vision, are also key. Moreover, investing in human resources, particularly in the educational and cultural sectors, contributes to building reliable generations to guarantee the future of the Lebanon we all strive for. In fact, the main wealth of Lebanon lies in the Lebanese diaspora spreading itself throughout the world, those to whom we owe the continuity and dissemination of Lebanon's message, as well as the resident Lebanese who are entitled to live in a stable political environment with a clean natural environment.</p><h4>How is your administration working towards combating corruption and ending illicit financial deals?</h4><p>Administrative decentralization, with its combination of flexibility and dynamism in providing people's needs and services while preserving its specificity within the formula of coexistence, must be a main axis, not only in application of the National Accord Document or in harmony with the nature of Lebanon, but also in line with the development of political regimes throughout the world. This socioeconomic reform can only succeed with the consecration of a transparent system by embracing the legal system that helps prevent corruption, by appointing an anti-corruption committee, and by activating control bodies and enabling them to carry out all their duties. The important point is that the Lebanese have faith in each other and in their state—a state that should be their protector and provider of their rights and needs, and in their president of the republic, the guarantor of safety and peace. These are the guiding principles of the presidency, during which I truly hope to achieve a paradigm shift in establishing a real national partnership at various levels of the state and constitutional authorities. In launching an economic re-invigoration to reverse the downward track, and in watching over the soundness of the judiciary, we will pave the way for the rise of a sounder citizenship in which every component of the nation feels reassured about their present, their future, and the fate of Lebanon.</p><h4>What message would you send to those discouraged by years of instability and turmoil in the country and the region?</h4><p>It is true that we were late in fulfilling what we dreamt of and struggled for, and for which many of our dear fellows were displaced in the four corners of the globe and many of our loved ones fell as martyrs, wounded, prisoners, and missing. Nevertheless, I am confident that all the Lebanese people, despite their awareness that the road is hard and long, have the determination, will, and courage to achieve together that for which we vowed our lives: a strong and unified Lebanon for all its citizens; a Lebanon of freedom and dignity; a Lebanon of sovereignty and independence; a Lebanon of stability and prosperity; Lebanon, the pact; and Lebanon, the message.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the main reason behind Rubu' Qarn's creation and what are its main objectives?</h4><p>The Rubu' Qarn Foundation for Creating Future Leaders and Innovators in the Emirate of Sharjah (Rubu' Qarn Foundation) was established in 2016 by HH Sheikha Jawaher bint Mohammed Al Qasimi, wife of HH the Ruler of Sharjah and Chairperson of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs. The initiative was conceived to be a platform that will nurture a generation of young leaders in the Emirate of Sharjah and aspires to achieve this by providing young people with a comprehensive array of age-appropriate activities designed to inculcate within them the values necessary to elevate the status of Sharjah at both the national and international levels. The Rubu' Qarn Foundation is an umbrella organization for four Sharjah-based government entities: Sharjah Children Centers, Sharjah Youth Centers, Sajaya Young Ladies of Sharjah and Sharjah Tatweer Forum. It unifies their respective activities to ensure that messages around innovation and leadership are standardised and tailored for the correct ages. Under Her Highness's guidance, the foundation will invest in youth capacity building and foster the talents of young people, with its overall aim being to contribute to the creation of a positive and developed society that leads to prosperity for all its members.</p><h4>How would you describe the key results of the four entities: Sharjah Children Centers, Sharjah Youth Centers, Sajaya Young Ladies of Sharjah, and the Sharjah Tatweer Forum?</h4><p>The Rubu' Qarn Foundation is a first-of-its-kind local and regional initiative that has a mission to build and develop youth over a period of 25 years. Its creation is significant because it focuses on multiple areas and develops a wide range of skills and capabilities that contribute to building knowledge-based generations. Its ultimate aim is to develop a cadre of young leaders for whom creating, shaping and developing the future will be second nature. One important aspect of the foundation is its commitment to ensuring that its participants receive development-appropriate input. Children aged between six and 12 years in the program enroll at Sharjah Children Centers, which are committed to delivering artistic and educational activities that encompass charitable, communal, and personal development aspects. Its remit is to prepare a generation of children who are united in responsibility, have an abundance of creative skills, who practice national and cultural pastimes and who are equipped with the necessary attributes to become good citizens. Teenagers from 12 to 18 years can join Sharjah Youth Centers, which not only caters for their more mature educational needs but also builds upon the ideas of good citizenship and the inherent values of religious tolerance, multiculturalism, and acceptance of others that are laid down by Sharjah Children Center. At this age, youngsters can also join organisations such as Sharjah Girl Guides and Sharjah Boy Scouts, which teach important life skills, run summer camps, and carry out community initiatives that strengthen societal bonds. Girls can develop the necessary attributes that they will need in their careers at Sajaya Young Ladies of Sharjah, which accepts 13 to 18 year olds and works to equip them with the skills they need to succeed in their careers. Lastly, from the ages 18 to 25 years, young adult program participants can join the Sharjah Tatweer Forum, a pioneering organization with a strong focus on local, regional, and global issues of importance to Sharjah and the UAE.</p><h4>What role does Rubu' Qarn play promoting the socioeconomic development of Sharjah?</h4><p>The Rubu' Qarn foundation believes that civic values and leadership are learned at an early age. It is committed to instilling social and communal values among children during their formative years and then developing these into their adulthood to equip them with the skills they need to best serve their communities in every way, including economically. By doing so, the foundation enables children to develop a mindset and set of ambitions, which they can use in careers that directly and indirectly positively impact their Emirate's economy. The foundation was founded on the principles of creating a cadre of young leaders who can drive the Emirate of Sharjah forward. One important specific initiative for young adults with respect to socioeconomic development is the Sharjah Leadership Program, which was established by the Sharjah Tatweer Forum. Aimed at discovering and developing candidates to become effective leaders of change, the program uses key training sessions covering appropriate management principles and experience-backed learning techniques, and has been formulated to develop leaders who are well informed and focused on the development of Sharjah. Organized under the patronage of HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah and Honorary President of Sharjah Tatweer Forum, the program is supported by the Ministry of Economy, Bee'ah Sharjah Environment Company, Emirates Islamic Bank, Sharjah Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Sharjah Business Women's Council, Petrofac, SNOC, Sharjah Islamic Bank, Etihad Airways, Sharjah Department of e-Government, and Sharjah University City. Graduates from the program have gone on to work in these private and public sector institutions, thereby creating a circular support system as they help to drive the Emirate's economy forward.</p><h4>What recent or future projects of Rubu' Qarn have excited you the most?</h4><p>As a nascent organization, the Rubu' Qarn Foundation has only recently commenced its program of youth leadership development. Its inaugural event took the form of a special session it conducted in partnership with the Emirates Youth Council, where it provided a platform for the country's youth to discuss their concerns and challenges. More than 30 young men and women aged 18 to 30 years participated in the discussions, along with a group of senior government officials and decision makers. Focused on the five key pillars of leadership and national responsibility, social cohesion, building a knowledge economy, creating a world-class healthcare system, and protecting the environment, the event saw the foundation explore in detail the aspirations embodied in the UAE's Vision 2021. The event formed part of what will be an ongoing initiative to engage the younger generation to actively participate in shaping the country's future.</p><h4>What are your expectations and biggest ambitions for 2017?</h4><p>The Rubu' Qarn Foundation formalizes and brings under a single umbrella what were before organized but disparate efforts from children and youth organizations in Sharjah to advance innovation and develop a cadre of leaders who will progress UAE society. It represents a new way forward in Sharjah and the UAE leadership's strategy to place the nation among the world's top countries and to ensure the wellbeing, security and stability for all its people. Areas that the foundation is focusing on for the future include entrepreneurship, leadership, creativity and innovation, STEM, 21st century skills, and linking Sharjah's goals with UN Sustainable Development Goals. Throughout the remainder of 2017, the foundation will be working to expand its horizons of cooperation, enhance its existing partnerships, seek new partners and develop more effective methods of communication with national, Arab, and international stakeholders. Rubu' Qarn is going through the process of formalizing a new strategy that will streamline the direction of all four entities into a unified vision, with the direction to be formally announced at the end of the year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Saudi health sector to be corporatized by 2030]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-khalid-bin-mohammed-al-shaibani-deputy-minister-planning-health-director-vision-realization-office]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Vision 2030 is a massive project, and it has sweeping objectives for the health sector. What has been accomplished regarding these goals over the past year since they were announced?</h4><p>This is the beginning of a long journey that will lead us to 2030. Our health sector has not had a substantial or significant reform since the ministry's inception. We have traditionally supported building more hospitals, more primary care centers, and more care delivery. Clearly we now need to shift the focus to the prevention of disease as the burden of disease will impact us like it has in other countries. The concept is a far-reaching transformation that engages almost every component of how we deliver care, from how we finance it to how we actually deliver care on the patient side. One of the themes of our transformation is collaboration with the private sector. We have identified more than 40 PPP opportunities. In the past few months we have studied them and set up a strategy and operating model for all these PPP initiatives. We have already released two out of nine major initiatives that involve clinical services provision in the country under the Ministry of Health (MOH). Clearly, as a massive health structure, we need to pilot our plan before we truly scale up and implement our plan across the board. We've looked at imaging, laboratory facilities, and the pharmacy segment. We've also looked at some of the services we have seen a large shortage in: rehabilitation, long-term services, and home care. We have also looked at issues like the large number of hospitals that are being completed, but have problems commissioning and operating. We look to the private sector to help us with that. Two hospitals have been released to financial, legal, and business consultants who will develop the complete package.</p><h4>Do you intend to take the road of corporatizing assets on the way to privatization as GACA has done, for example?</h4><p>Clearly the MOH today has a conflict of interest. It provides care through a network of more than 365 hospitals and 2,500 primary care centers. It provides care but is, at the same time, the governor and the regulator. That cannot be the case. We have plans in 2018 to separate this process so that the MOH will no longer provide care. The provision of care will be given to multiple corporates that will then compete with each other on the basis of quality of services and patient care, experience, and safety. We have started what we call the “pathfinder" engagement, in which HE the Minister initiated the road the corporatization. We hope that by 2030 we will have corporatized them and granted them autonomy. Doing so would reduce the level of decision-making to as close to the patient as possible and allow them to develop competitiveness. We hope that by 2030 it will be left to the decision makers to decide on whether or not to privatize that asset or keep it as a government-owned asset. It would be completely corporatized by then, but still a government entity.</p><h4>How will this change transform care in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We will integrate the different silos that currently exist in the system. Now, a patient goes through the system in a horizontal manner; we always have the problem of patients going to a primary care facility and being unable to get a referral to go to hospital. Instead, they skip the first step and go to a hospital directly, and that creates a huge burden on hospitals and does not utilize our primary care appropriately. Through a series of workshops over a period of five months, healthcare workers have designed six main pathways for our patient population. One of them is the chronic disease pathway. There is also emergency care in urgent settings, maternal and childcare, elective care, mental care, and end-of-life care. Corporates will be asked to roll out this model of care in different locations. For example, today we do not screen high-risk patients. With the new model of care, we will screen high-risk patients from home with primary care. This will create new categories of job opportunities for locals to track and find these patients and do the screening tests for them, thereby identifying their diseases early. If they have a disease, they can get them to the appropriate physician in the secondary hospital or the tertiary hospital. This is the concept of the integrated new model of care that we want to use.</p><h4>How will technology change the way the health system operates in the Kingdom?</h4><p>Technology will get patients, the population, and citizens in general to have healthcare on an application. They will be able to see physicians and get prescriptions through that application as virtual visits. We have a pilot where images are now being read in big cities in Riyadh and Jeddah. Patients have their X-rays taken and within a half an hour or a hour they are read elsewhere. A private firm will provide a complete solution, including the health permission systems, the hardware, software, data center, cloud, and all the tech infrastructure to our ailing primary care network that has no connectivity.</p><h4>What do you see as being the key milestones for 2017?</h4><p>The new model of care is the next big thing, and its rollout will start instantly without any delay. The corporatization of pathfinders and medical cities is another key move. The split of the ministry is even larger. The ministry will become a regulator, something we look forward to, while a large holding company will partner with corporates to manage provision. That is something we hope to see before 2020. In 2017 we will also see the development of a purchasing program, which is the nucleus for the national insurance program, which will basically purchase healthcare services based on value. This will initially fall to the MOH. By 2030, we envision nearly 30 million people who will be insured, both locals and expatriates. The rest are under the government through funds. As we develop the “sin" tax, which will levy premiums on sugary foods and cigarettes, for example, we hope to realize a strong health policy with every ministry helping to modify behavior, taxing junk food and subsidizing healthy food. Our government can bring about positive change. My goal is for a Center for Disease Control (CDC), and this will definitely become a reality by 2018. We have finished its operating model and organizational structure. We will need other entities as well—the CDC is one, the Saudi FDA, and the Patient Safety Center are others, which are being launched. We also have a National Institution for Health (NIH), which is a large initiative. That is specifically geared toward R&amp;D in the health sector. Many new entities will be developed and have positions of power as authorities in the healthcare sector. The Ministry of Health will oversee all these regulatory bodies. We would like to see that happening in 2017. There are 2,300 primary care centers today, and most of them lack internet access, and our goal is the accessibility of 70% of the population to e-medicine by providing the internet access to the primary care centers. We are truly scaling up the work in a massive way and using new ideas. This is the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Lebanon aims for 12% share of renewables in energy mix by 2020]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[cesar-abi-khalil-minister-energy-water]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main highlights and points already accomplished in the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for 2016-2020?</h4><p>The first NEEAP for Lebanon was developed for the period 2011-2015, where Lebanon was the first Arab country to have its NEEAP developed, published, and adopted by the national government. In June 2015, the LCEC organized an evaluation session of the first NEEAP with a wide participation of the different stakeholders, and based on this session, several modifications were introduced when structuring of the first version of the second NEEAP for Lebanon for the period 2016-2020. For the second NEEAP, work has already started seriously on four of the main initiatives, which are the building code, the minimum energy performance for home appliances, the labeling of appliances, and the pilot projects of energy efficiency in public buildings. For the national building code, there is a need to update the current version. The work is being done with several partners in order to include green buildings specifications within the national construction law. As for the minimum energy performance system (MEPS) and the labeling of home appliances, the work is being carried out on several levels through the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework to analyze the different set standards and their adaptation to the Lebanese environment, and to also identify key appliances to include in the regulatory framework. Finally, the buildings of the public sector are one of the largest consumers of electricity within Lebanon. This is why the NEEAP dedicated a measure for implementing energy efficiency pilot projects within public sector buildings in order to showcase the potential of energy efficiency within this sector. At this stage, visits to identify the key buildings are being carried out in order to identify the representative buildings while working at the same time to procure the needed budget and financing.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Lebanon's alternative energy, as well as for the goal of double the share of renewable energy to 12% by 2020?</h4><p>Lebanon announced the goal to achieve in 2020 a 12% of renewable energy in 2009. This goal is mainly dependent on the solar, wind energy, hydroelectricity, and biomass resources. The Lebanese government has issued the first licenses to produce electricity from the private sector for three wind farms in the Akkar region with a capacity of around 200MW. Moreover, the Ministry of Energy and Water has launched the request for proposals for the deployment of 12 solar farms with a capacity of between 120-180MW all over Lebanese territory. Both these projects are key milestones toward the achievement of the national target in 2020 as well as integrating the private sector into the renewable energy industry.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>This year, our ministry submitted an additional plan to cover for the increasing urgent demand during the summer season that was aggravated by the inflows of the Lebanese diaspora due to the sense of stability that was created by the election of our new president. Demand was already heightened by the continual increase of displaced Syrians. Hence, it was important to prepare a plan to cover this extra demand and increase electricity supply in Lebanon. The plan relies on several pillars starting with renewable energy projects. The second pillar was the rental of floating power production units with a capacity of 800-1,000MW and tying them to the existing grid in order to offer a fast boost to our generation capabilities. The role of the private sector was mentioned in previous plans of the Ministry of Energy and Water, and it is still an important part of all our plans. In line with these efforts, we are working on the integration of power plants of 1,000MW through the Independent Power Producers (IPP) modality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[shan-kamahl-mohammad-ceo-vcap-asset-managers]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can you tell us about your investment portfolio, and what rationale do you follow for your environmental, social, and governance (ESG) choices?</h4><p>VCAP Asset Management (VCAM) was a pioneer in launching ESG funds in Malaysia and likely ASEAN when it launched the Malaysian ESG Opportunity Fund in August 2015. In February 2017, VCAM launched the ASEAN-5 ESG Opportunity Fund. Both funds are equity-only funds investing in listed companies. We have not launched any wholesale ESG fixed income funds; however, that is something that we seek to do in the future. Internally, we have our own ESG framework that we have assimilated into our investment process when we look at our potential investments for our clients, be they through wholesale funds or private mandates. Even though we have our own internal ESG capabilities, as we are still a relatively new company with short public track record in the ESG space, we decided to use the FTSE4Good indices to provide increased visibility and confidence to our commitment within the ESG space. The constituent list that makes up the FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia Index and the FTSE4Good ASEAN Index provides investors with greater confidence that the ESG assessment is done by a reputable source. We can add further value to the FTSE4Good ESG process as we also actively engage with constituent companies to unearth more info that is beneficial to our overall assessment of the ESG factors of the company. At the same time, our in-house research and investment team are fundamental specialists and look at the various financials of our investee companies to assess the value of the companies at that particular time. VCAM is a medium- to long-term investor; at the same time, we acknowledge that with volatile market conditions, short-term positions can provide attractive alpha to our clients' portfolios. We do trade in and out of some of our core investment calls. There is a three to eight-year view and possibly a one to six-month view on the same security. We present ourselves as fundamental investors and believe we have to engage directly with the companies we invest or might invest in—I personally visit around 50 companies a year. Differentiating ourselves, we do not stray from our value system as we believe in investing in excellent management, good corporate governance and sustainable business models which include gender diversity and balanced board representation. We believe those companies will be around for a very long time. The simple premise of us looking at ESG is that we want to invest in a business that will not default or disappear. We expect all our investee companies to still be around in 50 years' time and beyond.</p><h4>How has ESG investing advanced within ASEAN?</h4><p>ASEAN listed and non-listed companies are still at an early stage of using ESG factors as part of their reporting efforts and also the way they run their business. Our engagement process and framework will help guide companies on the things to work on that can boost their ESG factor ratings. We give our views and reasons why we feel that certain suggestions are important. Then, we wait and also engage again with the companies to see if our suggestions are taken into consideration. If they are not, we check with the companies to understand why the recommendations were not taken into account and reflect it within our own framework and scoring system. This then translates to investment decisions that use our internal ESG ratings as a key indicator of the long-term potential of each company. Our investment process looks at ESG regardless of the kind of mandate we run. Our framework requires us to engage companies systematically and hopefully in a non-instructive and non-intrusive manner. We are honest with our views and make our general ESG expectations clear to the companies. Each company has its own views on specific ESG factors and deserves to be heard. However, ultimately VCAM has to decide on whether each company's value system and ESG efforts warrants new or continued investment into the respective companies. We are active investors and hope that we can be agents of change via the way we allocate investments. ESG is an important part of our investment process and complements our “bottoms-up," fundamental, kicking-the-tires approach to investing.</p><h4>You have expressed your interest to bring in more foreign funds into Malaysia to manage investors, family offices, and institutions from here. Could you comment on your strategy here?</h4><p>VCAM specializes in understanding ASEAN markets well. Our investing efforts are ASEAN focused and our engagement is ASEAN skewed. By understanding the ASEAN story best, we are able to find the best investments in ASEAN for our clients. For potential clients say in Japan, Europe, or even the Americas, it can be tough to find a “localized" manager that they can trust, has the appropriate processes in place, has sound financial footing, and is capable of providing attractive above-average active sustainable returns on their investments. We are such a manager and because of our focused approach to investing and being based in Kuala Lumpur, we should be a natural choice to investors, especially family offices and HNW individuals outside of ASEAN who want exposure to the region. Over the next two years, we seek to launch our ASEAN strategies, be it country, region, theme, asset class, or strategy-specific via UCITS or other globally acceptable investment structures.</p><h4>What is your vision for VCAP in the next three to four years?</h4><p>We aspire to be the ASEAN fund manager of choice for investors globally. Our primary ambition is to build a strong track record showing that despite turbulent cycles and increased global volatility, we are able to provide steady and sustainable above-average returns to our clients when they invest in ASEAN. A great deal of institutional money requires an official three-year track record. We have in fact taken a step forward and got ourselves standardized globally using GIPS in terms of reporting by end 2017. The Group has a 12-13-year track record of managing equity investments; however, as a company that takes money from external parties, we are only three years old. We need to keep our heads down and focus to give excellent returns and eventually investors will come to us. We are downside conscious and ensure that many of our strategies also focus on portfolio downside risk mitigation. Being tagged as an ESG investor is great; however, ESG has become part of our investment process regardless of whether a company wants an ESG mandate. We hope to launch a few more targeted products and hopefully have strategic tie-ups with like-minded asset management companies in Europe, the Americas, Hong Kong, and even other Asian countries as our focus is only sustainable ASEAN investing but our clients may want global sustainable solutions. Furthermore, we are implementing greater visibility of VCAM to the global investing public that wants sustainable investments in ASEAN. At the same time, building a target -appropriate distribution network that can cover regional and eventually global clients is also high on my priority list.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the only indigenous bank in the country, Investrust has a rich history in Zambia. How has the bank developed since its establishment?</h4><p>The bank has now reached a level of maturity. Investrust Bank was established 20 years ago, initially as a merchant bank and then as a universal bank, under private ownership. Around 2007 Investrust Bank was listed on the Lusaka Stock Exchange. 2015 was the peak of our expansion in terms of the bank's footprint. Prior to that, we spent more than five years investing in the network. We are a medium-sized bank with 27 branches, three agencies, and 60 ATMs across Zambia, making our presence here highly competitive. Another key factor for the bank is that there has been significant investment in various platforms, to a point where our capability is similar to foreign-owned banks. We have invested particularly in alternative channels such as mobile and internet banking.</p><h4>How do you seek to expand in the coming year?</h4><p>Now that we have built up our network, it is a question of sweating these assets to get a return. During the years of investment, obviously, the returns are quite challenged, and now we hope to reap the benefits through profits. The other consideration is that bricks-and-mortar are not the only form of expansion. Investrust Bank is one of few banks that offer agency banking and this will be quite defining moving forward, as it speaks to the financial inclusion agenda. We have some of the large retailers as our agents in communities where the bank is not directly present. They can open accounts for customers through our mobile platform and our customers can make withdrawals and deposits. These are mostly supermarkets, because we are aware that that is where footfall is, as well as other vendors and cooperatives. We try to select agents with high levels of liquidity so there are no issues in terms of offering the services.</p><h4>How has the middle market grown in the last two years?</h4><p>Prior to 2016, the Zambian economy was growing close to 7% annually. There was a bit of a slowdown in 2015-2016, but the middle market has been growing in spite of this. This is especially true of the productive sectors. The other factor impacting the middle market is the emergence of SMEs that we have seen over the last 10 years. Those businesses contribute to a large extent the rise in activity we have witnessed, not just adding to economic activity, but also to employment. A third notable factor is a growth in entrepreneurship; we now see people in full employment who are also doing other activities or investments at the same time.</p><h4>In what ways does Investrust, and Zambia's banking community as a whole, engage with the SME sector?</h4><p>If there is any area of opportunity and growth in Zambia, it is still the SME sector. Fortunately for banks, the fact that the Central Bank increased our minimum capital requirement in 2012 meant that financial institutions had to find better ways to make returns. Historically, banks sought to avoid the SME sector because of the associated risks; however, these capital requirements have encouraged us to look twice at SMEs and how we can offer further support. The second important consideration is that the largest contribution to GDP in most African countries comes from SMEs. For us, in the financial services sector there is always the desire to go where the flows are; therefore, we are opening more and more to SME markets. The third important thing to bear in mind is that the Zambian economy is a trading economy. Most of these traders have sprung up in the SME sector. Finally, it is important to note that multilateral institutions now better support these economies. There is funding from Europe that is specific to SMEs, through lines of credit. Investrust Bank has accessed these funds for on-lending to SMEs in specific sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Zambia moving to formalize economy through use of Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TPIN)]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[kingsley-chanda-commissioner-general-of-zambia-revenue-authority-zra]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the recent history of tax reform in Zambia?</h4><p>Zambia undertook major tax reforms in the mid-1990s with the aim of addressing tax policy and administration. These reforms resulted in the establishment of the ZRA, through the 1993 Act of Parliament, as an autonomous body to collect direct taxes (income tax), indirect taxes (excise tax, VAT, property transfer tax), customs, and the mineral royalty tax for the Zambian government in 1994. The mid-1990s also saw major changes in the mining sector tax regime. As part of the privatization process, the government instituted a low tax regime for mining firms. In 2006, ZRA carried out a diagnostic review of tax policy and administration in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to merge the VAT and Direct Taxes Division to form the Domestic Taxes Division (DOMT). In 2013, TaxOnline was launched, in 2014 several taxes such as VAT and Turnover Tax for the informal sector were introduced, and in 2017 a 5% surtax on imports of all locally manufactured products was implemented.</p><h4>How does ZRA work to bring Zambians into the taxed population?</h4><p>There have also been moves to formalize the informal sector through the use of the Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TPIN); all traders are now required to use TPIN for all tax transactions. Taxpayers are also able to register for a TPIN that allows them to access information about their taxes, make queries, and track the status of those queries. Other initiatives that are in place include simplifying the tax system, organizing business functions with a focus on taxpayer type below an agreed income threshold, simplifying business registration procedures and the tax codes applicable, undertaking research aimed at understanding the business climate to inform administration and tax policy formulation to reduce the cost of compliance, increasing taxpayer education and outreach such as the introduction of a call center, and finally, establishing collaborative relationships with other government agencies for the purpose of data sharing to assist tax enforcement.</p><h4>Fiscal tightening is a key part of governmental agenda and the economic recovery program. What will this mean for practice in the coming year?</h4><p>The economic recovery program is a laudable program. It is anchored on the principle of not spending what we do not have and not borrowing beyond our ability to repay. The implication of the recovery plan is essentially an implementation of a contractionary fiscal policy, that is, reduced government expenditure coupled with an increased tax take from the economy. For ZRA, this means an increase in its revenue targets as the measure will require increased domestically generated funds to finance government operations.</p><h4>How does ZRA work to tackle the issue of smuggling and tightening import and export duties on the border?</h4><p>In a bid to curb smuggling and illegal imports and exports of goods, ZRA, through the investigation department, has scaled up anti-smuggling activities through its mobile compliance unit. The authority has also enhanced collaborations with neighboring countries in order to undertake joint efforts and sharing of strategic information.</p><h4>What incentives is ZRA implementing to attract foreign business coming to the country?</h4><p>Liaising with the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA), ZRA implements the statutory provisions that allow for tax rebates or exemptions for foreign investors. Beneficiaries of these incentives are required to register with ZRA so that they can start fulfilling tax obligations, among them filing returns and remitting PAYE. From the year 2013, the tax incentive regime has undergone changes with emphasis on rationalizing most of these incentives. Currently, under the Income Tax Act, several incentives accessed through the ZDA are available, most notably, 0% corporate tax on income and 0% withholding tax on the dividends declared by a business enterprise approved by the ZDA and carrying on electricity generation or manufacturing activities in a rural area, multi-facility economic zone, or industrial park for a period of five years starting from the commencement of operations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Over 200,000 people visit Centro Fox every year]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[vicente-fox-former-president-mexico-director-centro-fox]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you decide to start an NGO, and what is the mission of Centro Fox?</h4><p>When I left the administration, I decided I wanted to do more for other people. My wife and I have three foundations that we have created and funded thanks to our donors. The core of what we do is around leadership; every year we have over 200,000 people that visit this center. We want to touch each and every one of them with leadership attributes. We implemented this in the form of education through seminars associated with different universities in Mexico and abroad. Secondly, we do some think tank activities and work on key issues in Latin America. All of this is addressed with high priority for people with scarce resources and who live precariously. We want everyone to have the same opportunities in life. The other two foundations carry out charitable initiatives and we sponsor a number of health programs, like tending to people who are paralyzed and are in wheelchairs.</p><h4>How are your various foundations funded?</h4><p>First, we have some generous donors. We approach foundations, friends, and corporations and ask them for donations. We are tax deductible in Mexico and also in some places in the US, which eases our fundraising campaigns in the US. Another source of funding is the conferences I give. In an average year, I give about 48 conferences and I donate what I get paid to the foundations. Other sources of funding include working with corporations and attracting FDI in Mexico and helping them to navigate our business environment to ensure that they are successful; the only thing we ask in exchange is that they become donors.</p><h4>To what degree is technology an important element in Centro Fox's work?</h4><p>Leaders need technology, knowledge, and capabilities. And they also need the capacity to innovate and create. We are trying to kill two birds with one stone. We try to build compassionate leaders; otherwise, they will not transcend. These leaders need to be of a high yield and capacity. And that is why out of the poor and the humble families we try to build and promote that kind of leadership that is compassionate and promotes the skills needed to transform society.</p><h4>What do you consider the Mexican economy's strengths and weaknesses?</h4><p>We are strong because Mexico is a successful nation and economy. We are the largest manufacturing hub in all Latin America. Manufacturing wise, Mexico is larger than the rest of Spanish speaking Latin America together. We are the most competitive manufacturing market in the world. Trump complains of Mexico taking jobs away from the US, but Mexico has gained jobs because of its capacity to attract investment. Just in the Bajio alone, we have 11 huge manufacturing automobile plants. We do not only have the three main US automobile companies, we also have Toyota, BMW, Mazda, Nissan, and all the rest. That shows the power of Mexico's manufacturing capacity and the competitiveness of the country. Now, Mexico is moving into the next phase which is a knowledge economy with technology, innovation and creativity. All of this is where we want to be participating and nurturing. Even though we have many universities providing students with engineering degrees, we are still lagging behind in terms of education as compared to other countries. Mexico still has big challenges to face, such as corruption. We must reinvent ourselves and eradicate this culture of corruption, and changing cultures takes years so we must make sure that our democracy fights against corruption, while transparency and accountability become the number one thing in Mexico.</p><h4>What is your perspective on NAFTA and relations with the United States?</h4><p>We had a great NAFTA for 22 years. This is a success story for the US, Canada, and Mexico. It benefits the US by having a huge consumer market in Canada and Mexico. Companies have become NAFTA corporations, in other words, they have increased its competitiveness by being present in the three countries. Working together is a great thing for the three of us but mainly for the US because it has the largest companies in the world. We are not the little guy in the backyard of the US. We are a solid and reliable partner of the US and Canada. Our trade balance among the three is the largest in the world and reaches a trillion USD trading a year and we are even. Mexico is proud of this and we recognize how successful NAFTA has been over the last 22 years. The difference of income between the Mexican and the US side of the border used to be 10:1; this is why the border is really an economic problem and not a political one. If you look at the border between Canada and in the US, there are no problems because the ratio is 1:1. Thus, my focus for the next generation is to reach the breaking point of 1 to 1. In other words, the income in each side of the border will be the same.</p><h4><br>What should the next Mexican president do to reassure international investors regarding US-Mexican relations?</h4><p>Well, it is not Mexico who caused this turmoil. It is the disrupter and the destroyer also known as Trump who decided to break all the written rules of the economy. He has harmed Mexico, their main partner too much, and he believes that by patting our back he can go back to how things were before. We were deeply offended and that will not change in the very short term. Now the beast has to be leashed. He has to be domesticated and educated on his ignorance. Otherwise, things will remain uncertain and corporations will hesitate to invest not only in Mexico, but also in the US.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[amir-rostami-safa-managing-director-safa-rolling-pipe-mills-co]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the contributions of SAFA Rolling &amp; Pipe Mills Company in the 25 years it has been operating?</h4><p>In terms of macro-economic data, we have contributed to Iran's economic growth in three different ways. One of them is job creation, as we have been able to create around 1,500 jobs. Another aspect to consider is that we have indulged ourselves in high magnitude investments in the downstream oil and gas industry. The same goes for the steel industry, for which we produce the highest quality using state-of-the-art technology. The third aspect is the economic value of SAFA Rolling &amp; Pipe Mills. The 2015 GDP figure of Iran was USD425 billion, of which around 40% was comprised by the industrial sector. With our production capacity of around 1 million tons, our contribution to Iran's GDP is roughly USD1 billion, which means our contribution to the industrial share of GDP is more than 0.5%. These three aspects illustrate our contribution to the domestic economy.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of SAFA Rolling &amp; Pipe Mills compared to other companies?</h4><p>We have a diversified product portfolio and can handle most of the requirements of our customers in terms of technical specifications. All the major international companies have their own standards and sets of rules. We are among the few companies that have been evaluated by international companies and have been approved as their vendors because of our technical know-how and quality. This is our main advantage currently. Next to this, our group has excellent research abilities in terms of marketing. We have positive credit ratings in the financial sector. Financially, we are healthier than our competitors in Iran. Also, we are experienced in outsourcing raw materials with steel mills in Europe, China, South Korea, and Japan. We have achieved to establish and maintain supply channels with our dedicated supply sourcing policies.</p><h4>How do you improve your technology and increase the variety of steel products you produce?</h4><p>SAFA Rolling is the result of a diversification strategy within SAFA Industrial Group. We sought more diverse applications than only the oil, gas, and energy segment. Hence, we expanded and diversified our products into different applications, particularly for the upstream segments. We have added value by producing, for example, OCTG casing and tubing pipes, a unique and highly added value product for drilling applications. Next to this, we are targeting refineries and petrochemical plants, surface facilities, field developments, offshore projects, LPG/LNG/NGL plants, pump stations, water treatment desalination projects, and trunk and flow lines.</p><h4>In which infrastructural projects are you currently involved?</h4><p>In order for the country to expand its pipeline infrastructure and networks, there is a need to construct around 40,000km of pipelines in both upstream and downstream. These include offshore subsea sour gas transmission, onshore networks, refineries, NGL, LPG and LNG plants, field developments, surface facilities, and crude oil trunk lines and flow lines.</p><h4>How do you seek to unleash the potential of new business opportunities after the lifting of sanctions and political continuity?</h4><p>The world's demand for energy is increasing with roughly 2% annually. It is essential to have a reliable energy supplier that can provide sustainable and affordable energy. Therefore, Iran as the holder of the world's largest gas reserves and the fourth in oil production, is focusing on magnifying its potential and  seeking to attract investors in the exploration and development of its hydrocarbon fields. The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) has developed a new scheme called Iranians Petroleum Contracts (IPC), a modified form of the 'buy back scheme' that offers additional incentives to investors. Combined with political stability, this will create a safe environment for international companies to invest in Iran's hydrocarbon fields. In terms of geographical proximity, it is an advantage to have a pipeline factory near the projects. About 90% of our products still go to the oil and gas industry. We also have capacity dedicated to other segments, such as the automotive and construction segments; however, this is still relatively small. The government has articulated a plan to attract around USD25 billion of investment in the oil and gas sector annually, and by 2025 the aggregate investments shall be USD200 billion. This underlines the importance of this market for us. Therefore, oil and gas will be the driving force of economic development, not only in Iran but in the region as a whole.  </p><h4>Which markets do you currently supply to and what is your strategy to grow your global footprint and increase exports?</h4><p>Based on our positive outlook for Iran, we will focus on the domestic market. Still, we want to diversify and expand our market positions in the region. We seek market niches that cannot be reached by our competitors. This will help us to outmaneuver the competition and become the number one player in the energy sector. We have targeted this market and have managed to obtain a substantial market share in the selected areas. For the next two years we will continue with our strategy, mainly focusing on the domestic market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Lebanese economy despite being known for its resilience in the face of ongoing regional conflicts suffered a USD3-billion balance of payments deficit and a 3% decline in customer deposit growth in 2016. Besides those, what have been the main factors that prompted the Central Bank to launch the financial engineering (swap operation)?</h4><p>The past few years have strained the Lebanese economy with political tensions, security challenges, and regional unrest, caused particularly by the spillover risks from the Syrian crisis. To date, Lebanon is hosting over 1.5 million Syrian refugees with a cost estimated at 5% of GDP. The Syrian refugee crisis has had negative impact on the Lebanese economy. The unexpected flow of refugees has strained already unstable public finances, service delivery mechanisms, infrastructure, and the environment. According to the ILO, an estimated 170,000 Lebanese have fallen into poverty, and the unemployment rate has doubled to around 20%. Overall real economic losses of around USD13 billion have been incurred thus far. The situation was also exacerbated by the political paralysis, which kept the country without a president for more than two years. In effect, the main economic indicators, namely foreign trade, tourism, investment, and consumption, have been steadily decreasing since 2011. As a consequence, the debt-to-GDP ratio has risen to around 144%; fiscal deficit has reached 8% of GDP, aggravated by the absence of a public budget for a decade now; GDP growth has decreased from 8% in 2010 to around 2% currently; the deficit in the balance of payments has reached USD3.3 billion in the year 2015, mounting to USD9 billion during the last four years; the country rating and outlook by relevant international agencies have been relatively unfavorable; the growth in bank deposits has been declining. Yet despite these challenges, the year 2016 ended with a surplus in the balance of payments of USD1.3 billion and a growth in deposits of 8% due to the success of the financial engineering of BDL. The Lebanese economy has remained resilient, with a real GDP growth of around 2% and inflation close to 0% in 2016. The achievements on the monetary front, particularly the stimulus packages that have greatly contributed to GDP and the financial engineering scheme, ensured that confidence in the Lebanese economy and the Lebanese pound remained strong. The policies undertaken by the BDL, to safeguard monetary and economic stability in addition to increasing the Lebanese national wealth; have proven to be major drivers of the Lebanese economy.</p><h4>Moody's admitted that the swap operation enabled BDL to boost its foreign currency reserves, increasing them to more than USD41 billion. What does this mean for the Central Bank and the economy in general?</h4><p>One of the chief objectives of the financial engineering that the BDL undertook was to strengthen the Central Bank's foreign currency assets. A strong balance sheet is essential to maintain exchange rate and interest rate stability, which is in turn necessary to achieve sustainable economic development. After the swap operation, BDL's foreign currency assets reached a historical record level, which confers stability to the Lebanese Pound and to interest rates. Other objectives that this scheme targeted include beefing up the capital base of banks, increasing the liquidity in local currency, improving the government debt profile by reducing the cost of borrowing, improving the balance of payments status through setting the means for increasing internal demand and productivity, targeting positive inflation rate below 4%, and finally improving the country's rating and outlook.</p><h4>Lebanon's economic growth is projected to more than double to 2.5% in 2017, according to an analysis made by Economena Analytics and 17 economists from different sectors. How does the BDL analyze these prospects?</h4><p>The BDL's outlook for the current year is a positive one. We expect economic growth to pick up even further, with estimated growth rates of more than 2% and inflation contained below our 4% target. Moreover, the recent financial engineering scheme has had a positive impact on both the monetary and banking fronts. As previously stated and in addition to the record level reached in BDL's foreign assets, the balance of payments has recorded a surplus of USD1.3 billion in 2016. The banking sector remains strong despite the pressing challenges that took some toll on its advancement. However, its performance remains healthy and enduring: total banking activity grew by more than 9% with total assets of banks exceeding USD205 billion in March 2017. Customer deposits have increased by around 8% to reach a new high of USD174 billion, with additional funds of around USD10 billion entering the banking sector. Lending activity recorded a 5.4% growth during 2016, with total credit to the private sector exceeding USD58 billion in March 2017. The deposit dollarization ratio registered a slight increase, reaching 66%, while the loan dollarization ratio continued its downward trend to reach 71% in March 2017, its lowest recorded so far. The Lebanese banking sector's high levels of liquidity enable commercial banks to finance the government and private sector needs while maintaining a stable interest rate structure. In terms of capitalization, banks' capital base has exceeded USD18 billion in March 2016, with an annual growth rate of 8%, which enables banks to comply with the new international capital, risk, and IFRS requirements. Our stimulus packages that have been renewed for the fourth consecutive year with an average of USD1 billion per year, have proven their worth, boosting the various sectors they target, contributing sizably to GDP and promoting job creation.</p><h4>Currently, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Lebanon represents 6.7% of national GDP. In which sectors do you see the most potential?</h4><p>The Lebanese knowledge economy has been a new and important driver of Lebanese economic growth. The BDL has placed more focus on further developing this sector. It has increased the margin of funds that banks could dedicate to the financing of this sector, by authorizing them to invest, with BDL's guarantee, up to 4% of their own funds, compared to 3% previously. To date, and after only three years of implementation, the Lebanese knowledge economy has attracted 800 startups, created 6,000 jobs, and increased national wealth by around USD1 billion. We expect this sector to grow by around 7-9% per year in the coming three years. We believe that this new growth model has the potential to attract investments to Lebanon, and mainly from Lebanese expatriates in the form of FDIs. With the former in mind, we are designing an Electronic Trading Platform that will provide the necessary equity and liquidity for SMEs and will boost investment in the Lebanese knowledge economy, since it will facilitate the access of people from around the world to the Lebanese markets. We hope that the SME stock market will be launched in parallel with the privatization of the Beirut Stock Exchange.</p><h4>In general what advantages and benefits offers Lebanon for investment and how is BDL working into attract those flows?</h4><p>BDL's efforts have been channeled in the past 20 years to build a prudent financial model, which has inspired confidence in the system. Over the past two decades, the BDL has been dedicated to strengthen monetary policy, push modernization forward, strive to achieve sustainable economic growth and financial sector stability, foster transparency and integrity through establishing best in class financial sector supervision and anti-money laundering capabilities and strengthen internal systems and processes. We believe that our banking model itself is the main attraction for investment, with proven resilience and competitiveness over time. Growing confidence in the system has continuously strengthened the Lebanese pound and the position of our banking sector both regionally and internationally. And as previously stated, we believe that the Lebanese “knowledge economy," that is rapidly growing, will be key to attracting investment flows, especially now that the ambition and innovative spirit of the Lebanese human capital has made the latter renowned across the world. The Electronic Trading Platform will surely be the tool that will attract those investments and help our capital markets grow and become regionally competitive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Colombia began setting up trade links with Asian nations in 2016]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[felipe-jaramillo-jaramillo-president-procolombia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook on the relationship between Colombia and its largest trade and investment partner, the US, in light of the new administration?</h4><p>The US is our most important trading partner and the biggest investor in the country; hence, it is of critical importance to the government and country in general. With the new administration, we are hopeful that things will continue to move forward in the right direction. Historically, Colombia has had a positive political, economic, and trade relationship with the US, regardless of whether Republicans or Democrats were in charge. We are hopeful that we will continue down this track of cooperation and deepen our trade connections.</p><h4>What other regions are part of Colombia's strategy to diversify its trade relations?</h4><p>In contrast to the US and Latin America, Colombia has had less historic ties with Europe and Asia. Therefore, this is where we see an opportunity. We at ProColombia, as well as in the Colombian government, have been working consistently on diversifying not just the type of products and services that we export, but also the markets that we export to. In this sense, the UK, and Europe in general, are our main targets. We know there are a lot of things we have that Europe and the UK need, and vice versa. We are optimistic about the trade relationship moving forward, especially after President Santos' official state visit to the UK in late 2016, which was the first by any Colombian president. In addition to all the political and state meetings that were held, the visit had a significant focus on business and trade. Beyond Europe, Asia is also important for helping us diversify our export market. Historically, we have had little trade with Asia and are working hard to change this. In 3Q2016, we implemented our first trade deal in Asia with South Korea. Now, we are in negotiations for another deal in the region—this time with Japan. It is risky to be too dependent on just a few markets. Since some sectors in Colombia are especially competitive in the region, we definitely want to strengthen our trade there.</p><h4>What are some of the main obstacles that have been holding back Colombia's trade with Asia?</h4><p>For decades Colombia did not look at trading with Asia because most of our trading was focused on our neighbors and the US. However, now we are betting really hard on Asia. We believe the Pacific Alliance is going to be of critical importance in connecting our economy more closely with Asia. In fact, when the Pacific Alliance was created one of its main objectives was to connect the four Latin American countries of Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Chile with Asia. This is definitely something we are going to be working hard on over the next few years.</p><h4>In terms of diversifying your exports, what sectors or products beyond the traditional exports have the most immediate potential?</h4><p>There are two points here. Obviously the first thing we have been working on is diversifying the economy as a whole. Historically, we have been more dependent on commodities and oil than we would like to be. Therefore, the Colombian government has been working on a new development plan to grow those sectors of the economy in which we are globally competitive. There are a few sectors like agro-industries, metal mechanics, tourism, and manufacturing where we believe we have advantages. We are betting hard on these with the objective of diversifying the economy. Of course, commodities and oil are sectors of the economy that are going to be important for many decades to come; however, we do not want to depend on them too much. It is important for us to diversify our exports to the world. In the past, most Colombian exports have been basic products and commodities without added value. That is definitely something we are working on changing. We know that in order to reach our goals in terms of social and economic development as a country we need to export more and internationalize our economy. To do this successfully we need to create products with added value. Otherwise, we are going to be too exposed to price fluctuations and the actions of competing countries.</p><h4>What investment opportunities does the peace process open up for the country, especially in terms of foreign investment?</h4><p>In the context of a post-conflict era, we have been talking consistently about a bigger Colombia. We believe that a lot of the regions of the country that were falling behind in terms of development as a result of their proximity to the conflict are now open to the world, including foreign investment and international visitors. Those areas have a lot of potential. This is one of the reasons why we are investing so heavily in agro-industry projects because those regions have a lot of potential in that sector, not to mention tourism. For example, the Guainí­a and Guaviare districts of the Llanos Orientales region. We are optimistic about the impact the development of those regions will have on the Colombian economy. At ProColombia, we are working hard on promoting these regions internationally. This is the first time we have been able to do this and the first time we have seen international visitors coming to these parts of the country. Obviously, there is also investment coming from abroad, especially for agro-industrial projects in those regions.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for 2017?</h4><p>Although the country has some problems—there is no question about that—this is nevertheless the best moment in Colombia's history. We are going to make the transition to peace and the economy has good momentum. One of the great things about Colombia's economy is that even in the worse moments of civil conflict in the 1980s and 1990s, we still had responsible economic management, which had a positive impact on the country's economy as a whole. Now, Colombia is the second fastest growing economy in the region and it has one of the better outlooks for 2017. Therefore, we are optimistic that 2017 is going to be great for Colombia because it will be the first year of peace. At ProColombia, we want to take full advantage of this momentum. We have three roles within this institution, and they are going to benefit greatly from this new context the country is in. It is our job to attract FDI and international visitors and to help Colombian businesses internationalize. Peace is going to be a great boost in all three of these areas of responsibility. We have very aggressive goals for 2017. FDI grew consistently in 2016 and we are aiming for even bigger growth in 2017. International visitor numbers are also increasing and are growing at three or four times the global average. So we are nothing but optimistic about the future. Of course we hope and expect that FDI and tourism will be of critical importance during this process of development. Our job at ProColombia is to promote Colombia globally, and there could not be a better time to do so.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[2017 Healthcare reforms in Saudi Arabia key focus of Al Dar Hospital]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-hussain-abdulghani-ceo-al-dar-hospital-medina]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Al Dar Hospital's background and what services does it provide?</h4><p>Al Dar Hospital and the healthcare business represent a sister firm of our holding company, AGH Group. The group developed the idea to invest in healthcare in 1982, and we established our first hospital, which had a 35-bed capacity, back in 1986. Between 1986 and 2003 that hospital was the main piece of our healthcare strategy. In 2003, we began to develop new plans and built a new main building here and began operations in our new location in 2007. Now, we are exploring options to expand the facilities further and there are several developments in the pipeline. In terms of our healthcare focus, we are a more general hospital in terms of medical specialties. We focus on providing as many specialties as possible, and we have three centers of excellence in the hospital. We have tailored our offerings to mirror that several diseases currently afflicting Medina's population, including diabetes, obesity, and heart disease and focus on offering excellent services in each of these areas. We also have a center for neuro and spine surgery and orthopedic surgery, which treats many of the elderly and road accident victims in the area. We have 260 beds, but in two years we will expand to 300. We have strong collaboration with the MoH through long term patient referral program. We receive MoH patients in the largest ICU unit in the region, with around 120 ICU beds, including those in the adult, pediatric and neonatal units. In addition, we have strong connections in Medina and Riyadh, reaching all the way the decision makers. We can participate with and give feedback regarding health care reforms and offer our 30 years experience in the business. At a group level, AGH Group is investing in healthcare, education, and manufacturing, specifically escalators and elevators since 1974.</p><h4>How much of your growth strategy is aligned with Vision 2030?</h4><p>We are trying to advance the cooperation between the private sector and the public sector in terms of providing healthcare, and this is a key part of Vision 2030. We support the Ministry of Health's goals, which call for the government to become more actively involved in regulation and oversight rather than ownership and operations of healthcare facilities. I see great opportunity to bridge gap in providing care including shortages in beds and manpower to operate medical facilities in Medina by implement this vision, but the mechanism is still in need of adjustment and development. Through our monthly meetings with the government, we ensure that our strategies and operations are highly coordinated. It will take time to implement all these ambitions, but the most important issue is the development of a clear plan of action. The government has introduced nine initiatives and areas of operation for privatization, but there are still issues that need to be ironed out. The government needs to figure out how it wants the private sector to begin carrying out its initiatives. We need a clear vision for how we are to proceed. The government still needs enact legislation that makes the tender processes clear. For instance, we are currently preparing a plan for operating the new Madinah General Hospital (500 beds) with our Canadian and Malaysian partners, however, unclear, and bureaucratic procedures are hindering the progress. The government wants to privatize, but it still needs to develop a framework for how to do it.</p><h4>To what extent are you targeting Hajj and Umrah pilgrims, and other international visitors?</h4><p>We are interested in offering our services to pilgrims coming into Medina performing Hajj and Umrah. We tend to make contracts with Hajj and Umrah companies, which allow us to integrate pilgrimage travel services with medical services. These people opt to receive medical treatment in Medina for financial and spiritual reasons. We want to focus on these types of projects to expand awareness about our healthcare system, but some legislation needs revision and simplification for us to be able to effectively implement this.</p><h4>What are your overall expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have great ambitions for 2017 emerge from our strength being a key player in reforming the healthcare sector in Saudi Arabia. However, we need to focus on other aspects to be an effective partner in the health care market. As a family business, we need to recruit the right people to take this family group to the next level. We need to go abroad as well as attracting global partners in healthcare to work with us in Saudi Arabia. We are still missing this piece. In terms of collaboration with MoH, we have concerns regarding taking this collaboration to next level. This include clear privatization plans, well defined mechanisms for hospitals operations, well defined national health care model, and accelerated payment system for MoH sponsored patients receiving care in private hospitals. Also, it is important to maintain the relationships and boundaries between care providers and insurance companies to ensure an effective financing system to avoid liquidity risks. On the international side, in 2016, we have tried to develop partnerships with firms abroad. We had meetings in Malaysia and North America to form collaborations with institutions in these countries regarding potential partnerships in hospitals management and operation. We went to Accreditation Canada International to receive international accreditation. We also have promising collaborations in the works for institutions in Turkey. We want to develop a consortium that includes international hospitals. We want to stimulate serious advancements in medical care and facilities in Medina including best available medical expertise to the local community by leveraging international connections. Looking ahead, before we expand we need to develop financing channels beyond the company, but this is unlikely. Perhaps I am being too realistic, but this is important. If we have a long-term vision and want to maintain our share, we have to be willing to trade equity for new investors or partners. We can expand our vision and our operations if we are willing to look to new sources for investment and partnerships that could reflect on a better quality of life in the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What products does World Panel provide for the Zambian market?</h4><p>In 2014, we launched our durable World Panel solar panels, devices that use renewable technology to charge mobile phones as quickly as an electrical outlet. The World Panel 500 combo-pack units with patented solar panel technology also come with a 5000-milliampere power bank and a 10-bulb LED light. The panels, once fully charged, have enough power to charge six regular cellphones or 20 hours of light using the LED lamp. They are waterproof and weatherproof and have a shelf life of between seven and 10 years.  Furthermore, this is a mobile solar solution, that can be used by both urban and rural people to charge their phones, thereby saving on energy consumption and costs. Our intention, through this product, is to reduce energy poverty amongst the poor people of Africa. Since we launched three years ago, we have had great sales, especially from institutions from the likes of NGOs dealing with increasing quality of life in rural areas. From an individual perspective, a few people in rural areas can afford the product, and this has been one of our learning curves. While the product is designed for the rural community, socioeconomic conditions do not allow them to purchase it. We therefore entered into discussions about how to make this affordable, and concluded by negotiating with the policy of zero tax on renewable energy products with the government. Since then we have been able to bring prices down dramatically.</p><h4>Is the product manufactured in Zambia?</h4><p>We have not yet been able to produce the panels locally, although this is our eventual goal. Our panels were initially manufactured in China, even though the patent is from the US. Now, however, we have moved the product fabrication to a factory in the US. This product passes global standards. The original inventor of the product, professor John Anderson, did a great deal of research in African countries such as Uganda and Zambia, and was able to verify the quality and the efficacy of the product.</p><h4>What is your view of the World Bank's Scaling Solar initiative, and its implications for Zambia's changing energy matrix?</h4><p>For us as a country, it is a positive initiative. For many years Zambia has depended on hydropower, and while this has in the past proved to be an effective source for powering the nation, we have seen how recent weather patterns have negatively impacted energy generation. Because of this, it has become crucial to think outside the box and to diversify. Zambia has abundant sunshine and is an open country on a plateau. However, there is also the question of how to improve distribution channels of the captured energy from solar in order to make sure this energy reaches everyone who needs it. The majority of our population remains without access to energy. This has led to massive rural-urban migration, as people come to towns and cities in search of basic amenities they cannot access in more far-flung parts of the country. This, in turn, has resulted in congestion and overpopulation in Zambia's urban areas. To combat this, we should not just look at major projects, but also medium and small projects that can be set up in rural areas. With renewable energy, the initial cost appears high; however, in the long term it pays off. That is one of the things that the industry and the government needs to focus on.</p><h4>Is the government right to invest in large-scale projects like the Kariba dam and Batoka gorge hydropower plants?</h4><p>Given the scenario of the global economy, as well as the particulars affecting Zambia, it is important that we have a balanced strategy. In terms of the medium and long term, Zambia will always benefit from abundant water, regardless of whether this is sometimes unpredictable in the short term. If we can capture this and generate enough cheap power for export, then that will exponentially improve our economic scenario. Zambia is surrounded by eight countries, the majority of whom need energy. If we can produce cheap energy and are able to link up, then our export potential will be immense. Therefore these megaprojects will be vitally important for the economy at large.</p><h4>What measures need to be introduced to boost investment, especially in smaller projects, in the country's energy sector?</h4><p>First and foremost, the government must create an enabling environment for investment, which is what it is working toward. It has to reflect on the overall strategy and see where improvements can be made in policy and practicality to encourage other external parties to collaborate. Elsewhere, we need to revise our tariff structure. Energy tariffs in Zambia are some of the lowest in the region and have remained at the same level for many years now, though they are no longer reflective of the current landscape or the national energy strategy. New investors coming into the market will be understandably concerned about not recovering costs. Secondly, in terms of procurement, tendering, and registering projects, it is important to improve the timeframe in which we are able to turn around proposals. The world is competitive and if we lag behind, then it is likely that developers and investors will turn their attentions to another, more easily available opportunity in another market. The way to create business is to be more proactive, more engaging, and quicker in our turnaround. That way we will boost investor confidence in our competence and our efficiency. Finally, frequent changes to policy do nothing to help attract investment. This has been part of the problem in the past few years, with the government changing its stance to respond to the immediate needs of population segments without considering the long-term impact.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can tourism boost Zambia's economy?</h4><p>Tourism is one of the key drivers of the global economy and has shown itself to be resistant to global shocks. Zambia is dependent on commodity exports, and, therefore, revenue generated through tourism can be used to insulate the economy when prices of these exports are down. Tourism is also one of the fastest generators of employment, and people working in tourist hotspots see the money being made in their area going back into their local community. Thus, tourism can help more vulnerable, rural populations. Relative to other sectors, it also has a short period of return on investment, and also creates a value chain that impacts food suppliers, transport companies, entertainment companies, and so on. Finally, tourism, in its essence, goes hand-in-hand with sustainability, concern for the environment, and best practices. We are lucky enough in Zambia to be blessed with tourism resources, such as the mighty Victoria Falls and abundant wildlife and 20 national parks. Zambia also ranks among the safest destinations here in Africa, with no incidences of terrorism and low rates of disease and crime. Zambians have been voted the friendliest and most welcoming people on continental Africa. Because of this, tourism in Zambia has been growing and contributing more to our GDP.</p><h4>How important are global forums and engagement with the private sector to market tourism opportunities in Zambia?</h4><p>We attend all the key events, and for the past four to five years we have been growing our presence at the key global tourism fairs together with the private sector. We always have a booth at the World Travel Market Africa in South Africa, and also participate in Indaba, the largest African tourism fair, and ITB Berlin, the world's largest trade and travel show. We have a strong presence at road shows in the UK and Europe, and also open up to new emerging markets such as India. Over time, the private sector has grown in its confidence of ZTA's marketing programs. However, it is important to stress that we are advancing in marketing to the middle level as business-to-business campaigns, but are not doing enough to boost our consumer level visibility. This is where the importance of a dedicated tourism budget comes in.  We are liaising with the government to revise these figures, as it is vital that we channel more public funds into boosting the sector. We are lucky in that the Victoria Falls destination speaks for itself, and we are often able to leverage on tourism marketing efforts from neighboring markets such as South Africa and Botswana.  Many tourists travelling to these regions will make a pit stop in Zambia to see the falls. While this allows us to benefit, it is not enough to be viewed as an addition, and we want to attract these tourists in our own right. We are optimistic, though, that with the tourism levy being introduced, we hope to increase funding that is pumped into the sector.</p><h4>How do you plan to boost the potential of adventure tourism?</h4><p>The first thing is to highlight adventure tourism as one of our specialized niches. It is important not to be too generic in the way we package our tourism offerings. On the one hand, there is leisure tourism, which attracts one market and deserves a dedicated marketing strategy; on the other, there is adventure tourism, which is its own entity. We want to promote Livingstone as the adventure capital of southern Africa. Aside from this, there is also potential in the northern territory, with activities than can be set up around the Kalambo Falls, the second-highest waterfalls in the world. In addition to the adventure sub-segment, we also want to boost business and conference tourism, and believe the development of a conference center at Livingstone will have a positive impact on this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important are PPPs in order to reach the objectives outlined by the ministry?</h4><p>In Zambia there are approximately 55 institutions that call themselves universities, but our research shows that only 19 of these are credible. A number of these institutions are in the hands of the private sector, demonstrating the commitment of the private sector to improving education and raising standards across the board. The Ministry of General Education encourages partnerships with the private sector, in particular for fast-track programs. On these programs, the public and private sectors work together to define certain areas in the system that need particular attention, such as boosting science and technology learning. We forge partnerships with private institutions such as DMI St. Eugene University and the Zambian Open University to fast-track teachers who can teach science and mathematics in schools.</p><h4>In what other ways is the ministry increasing emphasis on vocational skills teaching and other alternatives to a traditional academic approach?</h4><p>As a country, we have realized that we cannot move forward without a solid base in science and technology. The ministry has developed a new curriculum for lower education consisting of a two-tier system, with an academic line and a skills line. We offer a specialized program for young people to hone their skills in agriculture, mechanics, and so forth. This will feed into the training institutions run by the Ministry of Higher Education.</p><h4>How do you collaborate with other ministries to work towards long-term economic growth in Zambia?</h4><p>The Ministry of Education cooperates with other ministries, such as the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Gender. With the latter, we focus on improving education for girls. There is a high dropout rate for a number of factors, and we want to change this so that women can go on to play a more meaningful role in the country's development. We have partnered with the Ministry of Gender and the World Bank on a number of projects and initiatives aimed at keeping girls in school. We are also working closely with the Ministry of Higher Education on a skills development curriculum that links directly with the technical education system that it runs. We also partner with the Ministry of Health to run several awareness campaigns on sanitation and hygiene, and seek to work with the relevant ministries to launch programs on conservation and environmental issues.</p><h4>How much of the government's budget for 2017 is being channeled into education and education-related activities?</h4><p>In 2015, the percentage of government budget earmarked for education was 20%. In 2016 and 2017, this fell to 17.5% and 15.5%, respectively. This means we have to look more closely at where best to channel this funding. In the last few years our focus was on making education accessible to all, and reducing the walking distance of every pupil in Zambia to an average of less than 5km. We have now shifted our focus to improving the quality of education and facilities. We need more classroom space, better human resources, and indeed, to improve attitudes and mindsets surrounding education and its importance. Our aim is to create better facilities and then turn our attention to the content inside the classroom in order to reach our desired outcomes.</p><h4>How does the ministry incorporate e-learning solutions into its strategic plan moving forward?</h4><p>Technological innovations are key to boosting Zambia's education sector. Currently though, there is limited private investment in e-learning resources in education here, which hampers progress. Thus far, education has been viewed as an area of concern for the public sector. For instance, computers can be a vital tool in the classroom; however, we need a substantial amount of funding to ensure that all children have access to this resource. We work with partners like the World Bank to improve classroom resources, educational textbooks and so on, though there are still other areas in which we need to boost private participation, such as building laboratories. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what elements of public health policy do you attribute Zambia's considerable progress in improving healthcare?</h4><p>We have run a transformational agenda in line with the long-term aspiration of this country to become a prosperous middle-income country by 2030. In our pursuit of the African Union Agenda 2063, and sustainable development goals for 2030, our strategy shall be premised on strengthening health systems and services, using the primary health care approach, to enhance the wellbeing of all Zambians.</p><h4>What are the guiding principles of this agenda?</h4><p>In our quest to build a healthy and productive nation, we are emphasizing strong intersectoral actions to address determinants of health, such as water and sanitation, nutrition, education (especially for girls), household income, housing, and road infrastructure. We will continue coalition building to leverage resources for health. Nutrition will solve 60-70% of our health problems. Water and sanitation, including access to clean water, will reduce the number of children coming down with diphtheria. We are re-organizing our health delivery model to emphasize, in this particular order: health promotion, disease prevention, and curative and rehabilitative services in close-to-client settings. We are relocating the entry point to the health system from the curative-based platforms to promotive and preventive community-based care models as close as possible to the family. Our health system's agenda is premised on six key pillars: health services delivery, human resources for health, the health supply chain, information systems, infrastructure and medical equipment, and leadership and governance.</p><h4>How will you engage with key stakeholders to improve access to healthcare?</h4><p>Tied in with increasing access to healthcare for our people is an emphasis on health promotion, the bedrock for disease prevention. This is being anchored on strengthened collaboration between ministries, private sector, civil society, community-based organizations, media, faith-based organizations, academia, civic, political, religious, and traditional leaders and indeed the general public. We are strengthening the supply chain management from procurement, inventory management, through to storage and distribution. We have established regional medical stores hubs in four regions and within this year two more shall be established. The aim is to reduce the distances between transporting the medicines and supplies from the central medical stores to service delivery points. This approach is improving our last mile distribution.</p><h4>What measures is the government implementing to boost human capacity in health?</h4><p>To fix the health system in Zambia, we realized the need to invest in a robust human capital development plan and increase the numbers of people being trained. We are looking at innovative ways to train people, including e-learning and distance learning, as well as accrediting more hospitals as internship sites for medical doctors. The spin off benefit is that apart from providing training ground for the young doctors, we are also offering better staffing in rural areas. We have already accredited 11 such hospitals, and look to increase this number. In the meantime, we are building new health facilities. Since 2011, we have constructed and operationalized 14 district hospitals, while 36 are currently under different stages of construction. In addition we embarked on a construction of 650 health posts, of which as of end of 2016, a total of 275 were completed and are in use. We have also partnered with the private sector in the training of doctors, nurses, and paramedics to add to the human resources pool. As a sector we are prioritizing leadership and governance at all levels and capacity building intervention in collaboration with partners is being undertaken.</p><h4>How do you plan to continue attracting investors to Zambia's healthcare sector?</h4><p>Zambia is ripe for investment and development. We want to create a strong medical tourism base. Investors in medical services in Zambia will also be able to tap into other markets in the region, considering our strategic location as a land-linked country surrounded by eight neighbouring countries. As far as selling Zambia as a destination for international investment, we want to draw attention to our stability, strong democracy, and peaceful transitions between governments. We also want to emphasize our accountability as a sector by ensuring that the resources we receive from taxpayers and donors are being well distributed and accounted for. It is because of this commitment to transparency that our relationship with donors has been superb. They have confidence in us and our government. We receive tremendous support from key partners. We have strong bilateral and multilateral partnerships providing platforms to leverage resources and improve our resource base. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Zambia boasts some 19 national parks and 34 game management areas. What needs to be done to enable Zambia to reach its potential as a global tourism hub?</h4><p>Zambia is blessed with a wealth of natural resources. Our game management areas (GMAs) alone cover over 22.4 million ha. However, in order to fulfill its potential, the country must first improve its infrastructure, increase the number of bridges, and improve the road network, airports, and even airstreams. In Zambia, we have focused for a long time on Victoria Falls, as well as other national parks in the southern areas, while neglecting the northern circuit and western and eastern provinces. However, we have begun to realize the importance of developing hospitality services across the country, and the head of state himself is driving this momentum. HE President Lungu has transformed the Ministry of Tourism from a social ministry to an economic ministry. The fact that we now invest in tourism means we are on the path to reducing joblessness in the future.</p><h4>How integral is the private sector and FDI for tourism development in Zambia, and what partnerships have been made in this domain?</h4><p>Since I took up office we have engaged many people and interested investors from various parts of the globe. In Livingstone, we are developing a conference center with capacity of 5,000, as well as a five-star hotel facility. We offered 5ha of land to a Chinese investor in exchange for its expertise, signing an MoU to finalize the deal. Elsewhere, we have a group of financers from Saudi Arabia based in Dubai who will invest USD150 million in a hotel facility. Initially it was supposed to be in South Luangwa, but we seek to relocate this development to Kasaba Bay, an area that we want to develop. In general, we are aware of the important role PPPs can play in developing our tourism sector, and have come up with a business strategy we hope to complete by August 2017 that will outline our target partnerships and funding goals. These need to be assessed over a period of time, because we want to make sure we have the right end goals in our sights.</p><h4>What categorizes the government's marketing strategy to promote tourism, both worldwide and in Zambia?</h4><p>We have to embark on a vigorous marketing campaign by identifying critical markets. These critical markets include China, South Korea, India, and Russia, countries with large populations, and a high percentage of these who are interested in travel. Around 120 million people from China travel per year and 22 million head to Africa, which begs the question; why can't we tap into this market? Our approach does not ignore Europe; we have just signed a deal with the Madrid Chamber of Commerce, which will place electronic advertising in key places free of charge for two weeks in seven European cities. Zambians themselves should be interested in their sites, so we need to reach out through other government agencies and ministries, such as the Ministry of Education. Increasing awareness through marketing, as well as improving human capacity in tourism, will be key if we want to see success in this sector.</p><h4>Who are the main players that contribute to the Tourism Development Fund and what will be the areas targeted for funding?</h4><p>The tourism fund targets the construction and maintenance of hotels and lodges through a tourism levy of 1.5% for all accommodation and events. This money will be used within the ministry and our agencies to develop the tourism sector via product development, infrastructure, marketing, training, and research. We want this to be a conclusive development of roads and airports, and since we are constrained by limitations in our governmental budget, the only way to supplement this is through the Tourism Development Fund. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were Zambeef's priorities in 2016?</h4><p>In 2016, we focused on building on our core strengths and growing areas that we believe we are best in class. These include our retail and distribution activities, and the cold-chain food production that feeds into our retailing network. We also saw our wheat farming operation flourishing with yields as good as anywhere else on the continent. 2016 also saw a restructuring for Zambeef. We ended our relationship with Rainbow, taking full control of all our chicken operations, including our hatchery business and second stockfeed operation. We also took steps to de-risk the business and strengthen the balance sheet, by bringing a new partner into the business, the CDC Group Plc, which has a long and rich history in Zambia in terms of developmental projects. Many companies developed by CDC remain pillars of the Zambian economy. These include Kariba Dam, Chilanga Cement (now Lafarge), and Zambia Sugar. We ended 2016 with a strong balance sheet and in a strong financial position.</p><h4>Where will the funding from this partnership with CDC be channeled?</h4><p>The CDC funding allowed Zambeef to take full control over its chicken operations again, including our hatchery, broiler operation, and the new stockfeed plant. Careful planning has gone into the capital expenditure budget for 2017. The first area is our retail operations, in which we have budgeted to invest USD3.2 million this year in the continued aggressive expansion of our retail network, which is the engine room that drives Zambeef. In order to ensure the increased business from this retail expansion results in incremental business, investment will be made into the supply side of the business. The dairy division will have USD1.5 million investment, which includes the expansion of the milk processing plant as well as a new rotary parlor at the Zambeef Kalundu Dairy farm, which will enable our dairy operation to expand from milking 1,000 cows a day to 3,000 over the next few years. In 2016, we hit capacity at the Novatek stockfeed plant, producing around 15,000 tons of stockfeed per month. In total in 2016 we produced a total of 150,000 tons of stockfeed and we are the market leaders in this area. We are looking to expand within Zambia and the wider SADC/COMESA region. We will be bringing a second stockfeed plant on line in April 2017, which will require USD2.8 million of capital expenditure in the current financial year to complete. The new plant will have capacity for another 12,000 tons per month, and will almost double our stockfeed capacity. The next large capital expenditure will be USD1.7 million in expanding our chicken hatchery business. By 2Q2017, we will see increases from 250,000 day-old chicks a week to 350,000. Additional capital will be spent on expanding our pork and chicken processing operations as well.</p><h4>What advice would you give to other companies about creating a viable agribusiness model for the Zambian market? </h4><p>Long term it is important to think about being competitive in the wider SADC/COMESA region. A company needs to be efficient; it needs to know where it will sell its goods and secure its market and its supply. For Zambeef, it is the strength of our retail network in Zambia that has given us a platform to widen our market into the SADC/COMESA region. Zambia is largely self-sufficient in food, so if we are to grow the agricultural sector we need champions of the sector to be taking products into the wider region. Moving from our 15 million population base to serve the region's 450 million people will be the next driver of the sector. We are fortunate to have a pro-agriculture government. For example, the tax rate for agribusiness is 10% instead of the usual 35%, which is a huge incentive to invest in agriculture in Zambia. The government is also enthusiastic about encouraging agri-processing and is very supportive of the agriculture sector as a whole. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ministry working toward a “green revolution" in Zambia? </h4><p>The country has been talking about diversification for a long time and in September 2016 the president made a deliberate move in parliament when he announced plans for a “green revolution." In line with this, in 2017 we have seen the budget for agriculture grow by over 158%. To us, diversity does not just mean moving the economy from mining to agriculture, but completely radicalizing the agriculture industry. Currently, 70% of Zambia's working population is involved in some sort of agricultural activity, and agriculture only accounts for 9% of the country's GDP. My target is to increase this to 20% in the next few years, and we will do this by investing in research and extension services. It is important to make informed decisions about agriculture, both from an economic and a technical point of view, such as soil and fertilizer testing. Furthermore, we need to be able to track the income growth of farmers and measure the impact our reforms and energy is having on the sector. We will, therefore, compile a database. In the 2017 budget, there is a zero rating mechanization incentive for tractors and spare parts, which is important, because if we are going to diversify and increase productivity, we need technology. We also have plans to create about 20 bulk water sites as major irrigation points to support a number of agriculture communities. We intend for this to be the first part of a nationwide water infrastructure of canals and dams, managed by technological innovation, to cushion farmers from bad weather cycles.</p><h4>What incentives is the ministry putting in place to boost crop diversification?</h4><p>Zambia has been a monocrop economy for far too long. The majority of farmers in Zambia, close to 2 million agricultural households, grow mostly maize. To encourage crop diversification in 2017 we are supporting 10 crops with a smart subsidy of 75% for the production of orange maize, sorghum, millet, groundnuts, cotton, rice, soybeans, and cassava. In the past, the government has only procured maize, but as we encourage the private sector we must provide a market for all the other crops, particularly cassava, which can be used as a food source, as a starch in industry, and for export. One of the real pillars of my ministership is a new communication strategy in terms of transforming the food culture in Zambia. In this country, yellow maize is associated with hardship and poverty, because in the past when the country had tremendous challenges in producing white maize, yellow maize was imported into the country. We have to change that mindset and to do this we should call upon partners, stakeholders, and NGOs in food-related business to work together to change the mind-set of Zambians.</p><h4>How will the ministry increase Zambia's participation in regional markets?</h4><p>Our plans for free trade zones, particularly in Kasumbalesa, are coming into focus. The DRC is almost a part of Zambia in terms of food supply, meaning this market is huge, not just for large businesses like Zambeef but also for small farmers in poultry and eggs. We have an agreement with the DRC in regards to illegal trade along the border, which stretches almost 1,000km and makes it difficult for us to have formal trade. However, following discussions with the Minister of Finance we are debating how best to formalize this so-called “illegal" trade, by creating a free trade zone where everyone could be trading in a structured manner and with one currency, the dollar. Many companies have been reluctant to open businesses on that side of the border, because they are concerned about regulations and system frameworks for companies in DRC. With this, we could open up a booming market and considerable opportunities for Zambia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the departure of a number of major players in the industry in 2016 affect Zambia's tobacco sector?</h4><p>In 2016, Zambia Leaf and Associated Tobacco Company (ATC) left the market, and Alliance One, one of the largest merchants in the country, scaled down its operations, reducing its sponsorship of small-scale farmers. The direct impact of this was a dramatic drop in tobacco production. In 2013, we produced 45,000 metric tons, whereas in 2016 we produced somewhere in the region of 25,000 metric tons. However, as far as the TBZ is concerned, this downward trend will not continue. For instance, we already have several inquiries from some new companies interested in both production and manufacturing. There are some local manufacturing companies, such as Copper Leaf and Imperial, and we have also seen the arrival of Rose, a company that seeks to kick start small-scale farmer production, as well as assist large commercial farmers. British American Tobacco (BAT) also plans to enter the market next year, with plans to manufacture in-country, which will be a major boost to the industry.</p><h4>Aside from private-sector interest, what can be done by the authorities to further stimulate the tobacco industry in Zambia?</h4><p>The government's policy is to move away from copper production into agriculture as the mainstay of the economy. Tobacco is no exception, and it is clear that the industry is included in this mandate. We already see investment and commitment from the government. For instance, the government is opening up land for expansion in agriculture in each and every province. We would like to see tobacco being a part of such an arrangement. As other crops are grown in those areas, we believe tobacco should also be placed on the list of priorities</p><h4>Where is the tobacco exported to?</h4><p>Approximately 90-95% of Zambia's tobacco is exported. Our largest market is currently China, which means we are restricted to cultivating the style of tobacco preferred by the Chinese market. Roughly 60-70% of our crop is exported to China, and this is growing YoY. The entrance of China as a tobacco buyer in Zambia has caused great excitement among tobacco circles. Tobacco is bought from us mostly for blending, since our plants are renowned for their flavor and aroma.</p><h4>How does TBZ seek investment from foreign parties?</h4><p>As a country, we need more investors aside from the Chinese interest. We have had inquiries from other countries, such as Egypt. However, our aim is to attract as many investors as possible in the entire value chain: not just in cultivation or the export of raw materials, but also in production, marketing, and manufacturing as well. As a result of our successful marketing of the advantageous prospects to be found for investors in Zambia, we have seen companies such as BAT return to Zambia to start manufacturing cigarettes. Increased manufacturing will have a direct impact on tobacco production and on the growth of the economy. Currently, we only have one small processing plant in country and would like to see this change.</p><h4>What do you hope to achieve in the coming 12 months?</h4><p>We want to decentralize marketing so that farmers can sell their crops in the same areas in which they are based. We envision an ultra-modern tobacco flow in the southern province, and farmers in the south will not have to travel all the way up to Lusaka. By next season, they will sell their tobacco right where their farms are situated. We will launch something similar in the eastern province, updating the existing flow there and bringing it up to modern standards. We work hard to boost production in different regions of the country to reduce transport costs. That will also motivate those farmers who may be discouraged by the long distances to the market, and will therefore directly influence production. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your key areas of priority since taking over as CEO in 2015?</h4><p>Since 2015, there have been several developments at REIZ but I had three main priorities. Firstly, I placed emphasis on efficiency; prior to 2015, we outsourced the property management to another company. Now, we do this in-house, meaning we can swiftly deal with issues affecting our tenants and our properties generally. This also tied in with our second focus: costs. With partner property managers, we paid a fee for rental collection, property letting commission, and markup for payments on labor whenever they completed repairs to our properties. By doing this in-house, we were able to reduce our outgoing costs by almost 33%. Finally, I sought to develop our property portfolio again. Since listing on the Lusaka Securities Exchange in 1996, REIZ had consistently been adding new properties to its range; however, since 2012 we have not added any new properties to our portfolio, which means our market share has been shrinking. In order to reclaim this share, we will implement a five-year strategic plan for 2017-2021, which outlines our proposal to grow from 43,000sqm currently to 100,000sqm. While many developers develop properties hoping tenants will occupy on completion, we differ from others in that we will not break ground without having 60% tenant occupancy signed up from drawings.</p><h4>How do you evaluate your tenant mix, and how is this tailored to suit the demand of your properties?</h4><p>In retail, we want our tenants to fit the center. People do not come to a mall to see what they can find: their visit to a mall is targeted. We only have one shopping mall in our portfolio at the moment, Arcades Shopping Center. In the retail sector in general, while we see more international brands come in as franchises, we also see greater participation by the corporates themselves as franchises are phased out. We are in the process of having direct links with the key decision-makers of the brands arriving in Zambia to see how we can continue to collaborate. Our low rental rates allow us to achieve and maintain a tenant mix that is sustainable. On the commercial side of things, our tenant mix comes in two parts: the big box takers, with larger spaces for a longer period of time and at a lower rate, and the smaller customer. It is ideal to have a balance between blue-chip tenants and small-time retailers. What is more, we have a healthy variety of local homegrown Zambian and international brands.</p><h4>What specific expansions and development will the five-year plan entail?</h4><p>Firstly, within Lusaka, we want to expand the Arcades Shopping Mall from 19,000sqm to nearly 30,000sqm, adding 10,000sqm in two phases. Phase I, a total of 4,500sqm, is currently underway, and a further 5,500sqm will be added two years down the line. Outside of Lusaka, we seek to open in up-and-coming provincial towns, such as Choma in the southern province. We also look at border towns as we see great potential there. And finally, Solwezi is the new Copperbelt, so again, we will focus our attention there. However, in this market it is crucial to find gaps. For example, in Solwezi we will avoid retail as the mall market there is already saturated. Instead, we plan to build offices, residential, and industrial properties. In Lusaka, there are a number of warehousing facilities; however, most of these are not up to international standards. Many foreign brands are reluctant to invest for that reason. REIZ wants to pioneer high-quality commercial facilities in many regions of the country. We are pleased with government's drive to improve the road network, which will open much of the country to new development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given the importance of aviation in facilitating plans to diversify the economy into agro-industry and tourism, what is the government doing to advance this area?</h4><p>We recognize the fact that to truly open up the country and operate as regional hub in the very near future, we must invest in all four modes of transportation and make them available, accessible, and cost effective to support the growing economy. The current government has placed equal importance on all the four modes of transportation and investing in them as required to support the economic diversification agenda. Outside the capital, we are also making sure that policies and regulations to support various sectors are in place in order to create an environment for doing business. In the aviation sector specifically, we have enacted new laws that have streamlined and aligned our industry to international requirements, and we have signed bilateral air agreements and extended fifth freedom rights to ensure efficient passenger movements in and out of the country. However, expected increased flows of traffic, as Zambia becomes more of a tourist destination, demand improved infrastructure and we continue to do just that with the commissioning of the new airport terminal at HMNIA in Livingstone and new radar system at both KKIA and HMNIA. We are expanding and modernizing KKIA by adding a new airport terminal able to handle up to 4 million more passengers per year with many amenities such as airport hotels and shopping malls. The project is expected to be completed by 2020. We are also about to break ground on the new USD400 million Copperbelt International Airport in Ndola, which will have a capacity for 2 million passengers per year.</p><h4>How instrumental are PPPs for the government's large-scale transport projects?</h4><p>We are cognizant of the fact that we not only have limited resources, but our role is also to create environments where business can thrive. This is why we always encourage private-sector participation and open many projects up for this to happen. A dual carriageway to the Copperbelt as well as a greenfield rail project in northwest Zambia to open the Lobito Transport Corridor have been earmarked for private participation. There is also other substantial Chinese FDI channeled into the sectors that we hope will signal to many other players that such opportunities truly exist for partnership.</p><h4>How can rail bolster Zambia's connectivity with neighboring states?</h4><p>Rail transportation is a reliable mode of transportation and very cost effective. We believe that having good rail connectivity would truly benefit the aspirations of the country and connect Zambia to ports far and near. We have relied heavily on the Dar Es Salaam Port, which is connected via TAZARA, but we are also currently working on opening up the Nacala, Lobito, and Walvis Bay ports. Furthermore, we have plans to enhance and improve the operations of the existing rail networks in Zambia under TAZARA and Zambia Railways. Both the lines are old and have had a history of low recapitalization that we are turning around. To support trade with the Great Lakes region, we are also planning to modernize Mpulungu Harbor as well as construct a new rail line between Nseluka and Mpulungu connecting the current rail lines to the port to lower transport costs and also provide more options for transporting goods to the Great Lakes region.</p><h4>What is the motivation behind government initiatives to dredge Zambia's canals?</h4><p>Historically, the funding for opening up waterways has been negligible in Zambia; however, under the new government there has been an increased emphasis on water transportation as constructing roads over Zambia's many water bodies is costly. Instead, we will dredge these waterways and bring in the right vessels to transport people and cargo. We will rehabilitate many of our ports and harbors, such as Mpulungu Port on Lake Tanganyika. Here, the dredging equipment has been procured, and we have ordered some passenger vessels while we await funds for cargo vessels. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Different Needs, Different Solutions]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[different-needs-different-solutions]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Is mining still a significant sector for logistics companies?</h4><p>Yes that is quite true for Zambia. Logistics and transport companies are often heavily mining orientated because that is where volumes come from. In the mining sector, there are many local contractors, representing global brands, who rely on logistics advice to make a difference. We consult with them not only on transports and supply chain cost analysis, but also on customs formalities that go beyond clearing goods in and out of the country—how to manage customs risks, temporary import validities, how to optimize the use of bonded warehouses, and so on. But we also recognize different needs from our other Zambian customers: we have invested in value-added warehousing activities and geared ourselves to diversify our portfolio of customers. We have also developed a successful export business focusing on agricultural products and industrial commodities. Export companies seek deals in the region with DRC, Malawi, Eastern Congo, Burundi, and Rwanda, as well as to far flung markets. We have solutions to export to all those places.</p><h4>What is the thinking behind the Chingola hub?</h4><p>Our logistics hub in Chingola was set up specifically to answer the needs of the Katanga mining business. It is a business geared around the movement of copper and cobalt, extracted from the DRC, crossing the border of Kasumbalesa, offloading in Chingola before sorting and dispatching along the Durban, Dar, or Beira corridors. The transport of these goods is a complex and sensitive process, and it was vital to set up a hub in the right location. Chingola, located in the Copperbelt, close to the Kasumbalesa border, is the ideal location. It is located next to our White Horse premises and is the meeting point for two fleets of trucks operating simultaneously—one carrying copper and other minerals from the Katanga province in the DRC and the other bringing supplies and consumables from South Africa. Cargo is transferred in our 18,000sqm secure warehouse facility.</p><h4>In terms of logistics, what measures would you like to see implemented by the government in the medium term to boost the sector?</h4><p>On a practical level, we need to work on improving border management and alleviating congestion at the borders. For this, first we need to fix the root cause of congestion. There are issues related to this; for example, of ISPs not being able to provide enough internet capacity to support customs' “paperless" system, Asycuda World. If customs wants to have an entry registered in one place and have it electronically assessed in another, it needs strong connectivity. We have engaged both customs and the Ministry of Finance through our Association of Clearing and Forwarding Agents (ZCFAA) and made proposals to streamline operations. In response, customs and the Minister of Finance have set up technical committees to oversee the progress of propositions made. Elsewhere, we see a stronger and more regulation-heavy approach from the Ministry of Transport, which recently introduced a measure to prevent trucks from driving at night and intends to impose a quota system for transport of bulk material on rail.</p><h4>Does Zambia have the potential to become a logistics hub for southeastern Africa?</h4><p>Given its geography, Zambia can play a vital role in the region as a transit zone for goods. However, to fulfill this potential, it is vital that all measures and regulations are carefully thought through and designed to facilitate movement of cargo. One such area that needs to be looked at is VAT on transit cargo. Transit cargo should not attract VAT, and in operations where we perform transit services in Zambia, it is essential that ancillary services on transit cargo also do not carry VAT. Otherwise, this would add unnecessary costs and make it less attractive for shippers and contractors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Chabahar Port and infrastructure key to increasing exports]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-ali-salehabadi-chairman-and-managing-director-export-development-bank-of-iran]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you promote exports and enable investors and exporters through your services and activities?</h4><p>EDBI is the export-import (EXIM) bank of Iran. EXIM banks around the world are typically state owned and this is the case with our bank as well. EDBI was established as a body of the Iranian government to promote exports and enhance the economic relations between Iran and other countries. If Iranian companies want to participate in projects outside of Iran, we provide the financing to make this happen. We finance these projects as exporting services to other countries, especially neighboring countries. The strengthening of activities of Iranian companies in the region is important to the Iranian government. We also provide working capital to Iranian exporters of commodities or goods, and to projects that are export oriented. We provide them the facilities they need in order to shape the required infrastructure for exporting from Iran. There are important infrastructures in Iran that we must support, such as Chabahar Port in the southeast, which is important for the commodities trade. We can also facilitate other countries such as Afghanistan and India trading through Chabahar Port or use it to connect to CIS countries. EDBI financed the expansion of Chabahar Port together with the EXIM bank in India. In addition to providing loans and credit facilities to companies and projects, we provide services to exporters and importers. These include letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and assistance with money transfers and opening accounts with foreign banks in order to take the proceeds of exports in other countries. All these services are provided to both exporters and importers.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the JCPOA on your operations?</h4><p>After the JCPOA we were able to improve our relations with other banks. Right now we have around 120 corresponding banking relations. Before the JCPOA, all our foreign accounts were blocked. After the JCPOA we reconnected to SWIFT and can now exchange messages with our counterparts in different countries. We opened new accounts with different banks or reopened suspended accounts. We are now able to transfer money across the border, which is important as we can now take the proceeds of exports in different accounts. We can open and advise on letters of credit and can issue letters of guarantee and different facilities and services to other banks. One of the problems after the JCPOA is that we expected to reestablish correspondent banking relations with large banks like Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse. However, despite of the lifting of sanctions, they are not ready to have corresponding banking relations with us. These are the limitations and obstacles we still face. There are some issues related to the readiness of the Iranian banking system in implementing international rules and regulations. The biggest obstacle, however, is the fear that institutions have of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of Treasury. We have developed solid relations with many banks after the JCPOA and are waiting to reopen relations with large banks in order to provide better services to Iranian importers and exporters.</p><h4>How do you assess the efforts taken by the Central Bank of Iran to implement Basel II and III standards in the banking system?</h4><p>After the JCPOA, the Central Bank has focused on upgrading the working standards of the Iranian banks to international standards. The first step was implementing IFRS accounting standards. Since last year all banks have been forced by the Central Bank of Iran to issue their financial statements based on IFRS. This year there is a focus on increasing transparency and upgrading disclosure items in financial statements. These are important steps, as when we want to work with banks around the world, they want to know more about our financial condition. They want to see transparency, disclosure, and information on the structure of the bank and the assets, and the abilities and issues available in the bank. The next step is the capital requirement, which involves upgrading the standards of capital issues of Iranian banks in order to fulfill the Basel II or III requirements. In 2016 and 2017, our bank increased its capital by around USD300 million through the Iranian government. Following a law passed by the Iranian parliament, most state-owned banks received a capital increase, which is another important step in order to fulfill the Basel II and III requirements. EDBI was the first bank to fulfill the Basel II and III requirements in terms of capital. Our capital adequacy ratio was around 20%, and after this capital increase it increased to more than 25%, so we fulfilled the Basel III requirements for capital issues and other Iranian banks have done as well. All banks must have a rules and compliance department and an anti-money laundering department in order to fulfill the international standards. After the JCPOA, most—if not all—Iranian banks have upgraded their compatibility with international standards in terms of anti-money laundering and compliance issues.</p><h4>Why should Iranian exporters or foreign buyers look to EDBI as their banking partner?</h4><p>Our services are focused on supporting exports, so exporters concentrate their banking activities in our bank. When we issue a letter of guarantee we take just 2% as cash and 98% through other forms of collateral like a promissory note. This is a service that only we offer. We provide exporters with attractive loans as our goal is to support businesses. They come to us because of the preferable fees or rates that we provide them. EDBI is a development bank and the nature of development banks is to take more risks. Since we are a state-owned bank, the government takes on this risk in order to support the exports of Iranian companies. This is completely different to the activities of commercial banks that are more conservative on this issue and less prone to taking risks.</p><h4>How can EDBI foster its position as the bank of choice for Iranian exporters?</h4><p>Iran places some proceeds from the sale of crude oil to other countries into the National Development Fund of Iran. The size of this fund exceeds USD50 billion. Part of this money is deposited with our bank in order to support exporters through loans or credit facilities, which allows us to pursue our supportive goals. We have around 40 branches in all provinces of Iran and our personnel is highly educated to provide financial advice to Iranian importers and exporters. We have great relationships with our clients and always take suggestions and recommendations from them in order to further upgrade our services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[designed-for-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Zambia's media industry been affected by the economic slowdown of the past year, and what is Inzy doing to ensure it maintains its stable position in the market?</h4><p>The past year has certainly been a difficult one for the sector. The sad fact of the matter is that as money runs short, one of the first industries to see cuts is the arts. However, that is not to say my outlook in the medium term is negative. In fact, on the whole the scene is developing, albeit not at the pace that is ideal. In media, there is no room for stagnation; if a company is not innovative and forward-thinking then it can easily disappear. With the rise of social media, everyone is a blogger or a journalist, and there is no longer any differentiation between professionals and amateurs. To have a foot in this environment as a professional media outlet, it is vital to carve out a niche and set ourselves apart from the rest. Inzy has already made great headway in giving itself the edge over other productions. For example, we are responsible for the visuals for the winning presidential campaign, coverage that included all aspects of media production and development: brainstorming, design, photography, development, strategy, and execution, as well as media management in terms of media buying, too. This is not the first time we have been the manpower behind such a production either: we also contributed to Michael Sata's previous winning campaign. Such success is born not only of hard work, but also experience, resources, and capabilities. </p><h4>What is being done to capitalize on the growth of the middle-income segment in Zambia in terms of developments in real estate? </h4><p>As Zambia's middle-income segment becomes stronger and more impactful, demands in real estate change and providers and constructors have to adapt to this new scenario. People in Zambia have higher disposable incomes; travel and technology have become more affordable, people experience greater exposure generally, and the world is becoming smaller. Now, the average citizen does not just want a living space; they want a house that is part and parcel of a whole lifestyle. Furthermore, we are working with a singular set of characteristics that define a country such as Zambia. For example, unlike China or Dubai, usable space is certainly not limited here. Because of that, the traditional still tops the list: big houses and swimming pools. Here, there is no need to build up, and for that reason Zambia does not have skyscrapers popping up on every corner as is the case in other parts of Africa. However, there is still a housing deficit of 3 million, which means that for next few years there will still be room to maneuver within the market and there will still be demand for middle-income solutions.</p><h4>What impact, in real terms, can art have on the economy?</h4><p>For the economy, art is key. In the US, India, China, and Nigeria, one of the biggest exports is art, whether that be media, music, or films. Art can be social food, and that in turn feeds into the business landscape of a country, which means that art indirectly aids development and can also directly boost GDP. Because of this, our leaders need to prioritize art and to be seen in the public eye to be doing so. I cannot recall a single Zambian initiative in the arts that has come from public sector management, which leads me to believe art is not being prioritized. What is worse, it may be being overlooked. That being said, there are many astounding projects being launched with private-sector backing, and there are also plenty of self-taught and self-driven people trying to change this culture with their own resources. This alone, however, is not enough. We need support, platforms, and opportunities from the government and stakeholders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Provision of information services to individuals and industries is a positive step toward making information widely available to the people, to help with development on a wider scale. This is why this government has placed public access to information for a well-informed society high on its agenda. Information services have impacted on both individuals and industries in the country in several ways. Most importantly, these have empowered them to participate effectively in the governance and development of the country at all levels. Different industries in Zambia compete with each other, and the commercial advantage one industry can have over another depends primarily on its use of information services. For example, being able to extract information regarding what a customer truly wants and how to provide for that can provide a significant advantage.</p><h4>What was the result of the digital migration project?</h4><p>Zambia was one of the four SADC member states to partially migrate the terrestrial television broadcasting from analogue to digital by June 17, 2015. The ministry is implementing the project in phases; Phase I along the line of rail, Phase II provincial centers outside the line of rail, and Phase III remote sites to cover the whole country. Phase I is complete, with the installation of 10 new digital transmitters in Senkobo, Kalomo, Pemba, Kafue, Chilanga, Lusaka, Kapiri Mposhi, Ndola, Kitwe, and Chingola. In addition, each transmission site has satellite receiving system and fiber connectivity. Further, a head-end was installed in Lusaka to provide for the multiplexing, management and monitoring of the network. The project cost was USD9.5 million and the government has so far paid only about USD2 million, leaving an outstanding debt of USD7.5 million. A total of 14 television channels are currently being carried on the platform—13 local and two foreign.</p><h4>What about Phases II and III of the project?</h4><p>Phase II and Phase III are currently being implemented as one phase and the ministry has already awarded a contract of about USD273 million. The project will involve the installation of transmitters in 73 sites throughout the country; the supply and installation of studio equipment for ZNBC, ZANIS, and eight provincial broadcasting stations as well as expansion of the headed in Lusaka and the supply and installation of customer service center equipment for 12 sites; the rehabilitation of ZNBC and ZANIS Studios; the construction of six provincial broadcasting stations in Chipata, Mongu, Chinsali, Mansa, Kasama, and Kabwe; the construction of a National Operations Center at Mass Media Complex; and the supply of 1,250,000 decoders. The project, which is expected to take 18 months to complete, is financed through a loan from the Export-Import Bank of China. The process of migration from analog to digital broadcasting has and continues to offer numerous advantages in terms of spectrum efficiency, higher video and audio quality, and new business opportunities. A wider choice of content has also been made available to viewers, resulting in more channels.</p><h4>What is the motivation behind the National Film Policy, and what do you hope to achieve with its implementation?</h4><p>The aims of the policy are to promote and encourage the development and production of quality local films that contribute to the expression and preservation of Zambian culture, job creation, and economic diversification. We also hope with this new legislation to facilitate the promotion of a platform for the networking and distribution of film in order to penetrate the local and international market; encourage international exchange and collaboration amongst broadcasters, distributers, and filmmakers about the benefits of local productions; facilitate the review and enactment of laws that will promote and protect the development of the film industry; and strengthen critical skills in film development in order to improve the performance of the Zambian film industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Second Largest Integrated Copper Producer in Africa]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[steven-din-ceo-konkola-copper-mines]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are KCM's core operations in Zambia?</h4><p>KCM has major operations in four different locations. The three largest of these are in the Copperbelt in the towns of Chingola, Chililabombwe, and Kitwe. These include underground and open-pit mines, concentrators, a state-of-the-art smelter, and a tailings leach plant. In Nampundwe, just outside Lusaka, we run a small underground mine too. In total, KCM operations have been running in Zambia for nearly 70 years. Initially the company was run by private firms and then the industry was nationalized in 1970s during which period KCM was managed by ZCCM, the state-owned organization. Around 2000, these mining assets were again privatized and global miners returned to Zambia. In 2004, Vedanta Resources plc, a UK-listed company, took an initial shareholding in KCM and that stake is now up to 79.4% with the balance held by the government vehicle, ZCCM — Investment Holdings.</p><h4>What is the strategy and thinking behind the Konkola Deep project?</h4><p>In Chililabombwe we have a deep underground mine. The mine has three shafts and two of these shafts have been there for many years. In 2010, a new shaft reaching 1,500m — making it the second deepest copper shaft in Africa - was sunk and commissioned, enabling us to access deeper parts of the orebody, which ranks among the world's top 20 in terms of grade, with a delineated volume of around 300 million tons of ore. There are challenges to extracting ore from these depths, the most pressing of which is the quantity of water. Every day we extract 350 million liters of water from the underground mine — about the same amount that is consumed daily by the population of Lusaka and its suburbs. In addition to the 350 million liters that we pump each day from the Chililabombwe mine, we also pump close to 100 million liters every day from our underground mine in Chingola. All of this pumping requires power, which heightens our cost of production. Today about 30% of our power usage is used for pumping alone; it's a sunk cost that adds no economic value to our production.</p><h4>What strategy is being employed to cushion KCM from copper price volatility as far as possible?</h4><p>In 2016, we witnessed the lowest average copper price in 11 years. Although there has been a small uptick in prices, they will probably remain low for another 12-18 months before we see a significant increase. There is not a great deal that a copper producer like us can do to impact the price, because it's a reflection of global supply and demand, but in a low price environment there are three areas that a producer like us can focus on. The first of these is operational efficiency. For example, if a plant needs to run for 95% of the time for efficiency, then this should be maintained. Likewise, chemicals that are used for processing, need to be recovered at dosages which are as close as possible to optimum levels. In addition, there are a whole load of mechanical maintenance and copper recovery type efficiencies which can be optimized. Secondly, when prices are low, the producer needs to go out into the market and try to negotiate better prices for consumables and raw materials. We have liaised with our suppliers to see what we can do in terms of reducing our overall cost of production by looking at pricing and quality. The third area of focus, and one which has set us apart from other mining companies in Zambia, is volumes. In October 2015 when the power crisis hit Zambia hard and ZESCO declared “force majeure,“ rather than scale down our operations as other miners did, we pushed for higher, profitable volumes in order to reduce our overall cost of production. For us it was the right strategy and the right way to address a difficult period in our operating history.</p><h4>What measures need to be implemented by the public sector in terms of energy tariffs and mining regulation?</h4><p>The government needs to tackle several issues, and indeed, is already doing so. Regulations surrounding power factors—an indicator of how efficiently power is being used—need to be enforced to ensure that large users of power can maintain high-levels of efficiency. By way of background, we are the largest consumer of power in the country, so our ability to source reliable power at affordable rates greatly impacts our performance and our sustainability. I know that the Minister of Energy is eager to move towards a more cost-reflective tariff which takes into consideration the chain of sourcing energy, from generation all the way to transmission. I think it will be important to accommodate bulk buying rates and retail rates if Zambia is to continue to attract foreign investors into the sector.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Zambia's mining industry and for KCM in the medium term?</h4><p>On the whole the outlook is positive. Just last month, Mr. Anil Agarwal, the Group Chairman of Vedanta Resources plc, met with His Excellency Edgar Lungu the President of Zambia and made a number of investment commitments. One of these is to move production levels to 400,000 tons of copper each year, which would quadruple production over the next three to seven years. This extra capacity will come from a number of sources, including the Konkola deep underground mine. We are currently working with consulting engineers and mining experts to review the technologies we employ and to boost productivity. Most importantly, we want to mine deeper. So far our deepest level is at 950m and our target is a next development at 1,100m. This will be a game changer for KCM. We are already the largest integrated copper producer in Zambia and the second largest in Africa. Our smelter, one of four in the country, can produce 310,000 tons of copper every year. In my view, Zambia is well placed to increase its percentage share of global production, currently in the region of 4-5%. The first step towards achieving this is to fill all of Zambia's smelters with available concentrates and generate cash from sales for future mine development.</p><h4>How does KCM demonstrate its commitment to reducing its environmental impact?</h4><p>KCM is working towards addressing all remaining legacy issues in respect of environmental matters. We are determined to be best in class as far as the environment is concerned and we have invested a substantial amount toward reducing our environmental footprint and being a net-positive contributor to biodiversity. By way of example, we have built a smelter in Chingola that has a sulfur capture rate of 99.6%, second only to a smelter in Japan which has the highest in the world. We have replaced storage tanks and pipe infrastructure at our Tailings Leach Plant and de-silted our Pollution Control Dam. We have reduced by 50% the amount of water we consume across all our operations during the last three years, further enhancing our ability to attain zero discharge. These are just some of the important steps that we have taken to ensure we conform with Vedanta's Sustainability Framework and achieve best environmental practice. Aided by new technologies and processes, we continuously strive to achieve higher environmental standards. In terms of biodiversity, we are looking across the board for opportunities to revegetate areas of operations. In April we launched a pilot project with Better World Energy to plant Pongomia Pinatta trees for environmental remediation. The trees will revegetate tailings dam sites and can be harvested for bio-diesel production, to serve some of our energy needs. Pongamia is an ideal plant for recovering a variety of waste burdens and bringing soil back to life. We think the project can create at least 500 jobs in agro-forestry and farming, bringing employment for local people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the impact of your mobile app launched over two years ago?</h4><p><span></span><strong>STELLA SATA RUKAY</strong>I In 2015, we launched the Plan Store mobile app. The app made it easy for entrepreneurs to plan ahead, asking critical business questions and helping them pitch their idea to investors with realistic numbers. The development of this app was partially funded by a grant from UKAid through its implementing partners PEP-Z. The app has been downloaded and used by over 400 SMEs across the country. It has been an effective tool for entrepreneurs to receive intelligent business advice on pricing and many other excellent tips on planning their businesses. We have also helped over 100 entrepreneurs to create a comprehensive business plan or proposal following the use of the mobile app.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your program of business and entrepreneurship trainings for informal businesses?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SIMBA RUKAYI </strong>Following the success of the mobile app and our ability to give business development services to entrepreneurs, we wanted to extend our services to marginalized entrepreneurs who could not afford to pay for our services. We partnered The Stella Project, a not-for-profit organization co-founded by Stella and David Nelson Bassey, and were able to conceptualize a business and entrepreneurship training (BET) project for marginalized entrepreneurs. Through the BET project, we provided action-oriented and practical business and entrepreneurship training to 40 marketeers (market stall owners). This program was supported by the US government through a partial grant from the US Embassy in Zambia as well as the Twaala Restaurant.</p><p><span></span><strong>SSR T</strong>he BET project first targeted the most marginalized entrepreneurs in Zambia: marketeers. They are at the bottom of the pyramid of entrepreneurs, yet are extremely important to the economy. We also had a deliberate 60% target bias to women and young people because women and youth often do not get opportunities to improve their knowledge. We further provided an aftercare mentoring and support system for up to 12 months for each of the trained marketeers. This includes assisting them with creating accounting and financial managements systems, savings groups as well as value addition strategies. Those that have smartphones or children with smartphones were also shown how to use the Plan Store app.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for investing in business development services in Zambia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SSR </strong>The number one opportunity is that Zambian entrepreneurs have embraced the power of entrepreneurship and want to learn more about how they can improve and develop their businesses. As a result, entrepreneurs are willing to pay for business development services and so organizations can tap into this huge untapped market.</p><h4>What measures need to be taken to improve the current financing and banking systems for informal businesses in Zambia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SR</strong> The current banking system does not make it easy for an informal business to open a bank account. The banks either ask for too many documents due to the new Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, take too long to open the bank account, or have high fees or high opening balances. It is important to make opening a bank account both time efficient as well as financially friendly for informal businesses in order to avoid a situation where a business person keeps money in their shop or under their mattress.</p><p><span></span><strong>SSR</strong> For example, marketeers may not be high earning individuals but they run a highly liquid cash based business and making it easier to open a bank account and to manage transactions would result in their cash being in circulation. Lending to informal businesses must be with the end game of allowing the informal business to grow. It is important for finance and microfinance institutions to be interested in the development of the business and not to only focus on receiving interest. If institutions train informal businesses in financial management, the loan would be put to good use and would improve the overall financial position of the business, making it easy for one to pay back. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What recent projects has ZICTA launched in Zambia?</h4><p>ZICTA has been the government's implementing partner for a few years now. Following the revision of the ICT Act in 2009, our mandate expanded and we were able to help the government more actively implement some of its developmental projects in the ICT sector. From 2011, we started our drive to facilitate universal access, rolling out connectivity to underserved areas. Between 2012 and 2014, we installed GeoSIM sites in rural areas. Over the total period, we installed 204 towers that initially provided communication for 400,000 people, and has since generated over 1 million web subscribers. Another recent project is the national addressing project. In Zambia, we have witnessed massive population growth in the last 20 years. Many smaller municipalities began expanding rapidly, with urban areas mushrooming across the country. However, this was accompanied by a lack of corresponding organization and town planning. The Ministry of Lands had one record while the city council had another; there was no communication or overlap between the two systems. We realized this was not a desirable situation, and therefore went to UPU and were given guidelines on how to implement a national addressing program. Through universal access we reviewed the existing numbering system, coming up with a new, logical way of numbering houses and naming streets. We carried out this initiative in high-density as well as low-density areas, and have broken records as the first country to provide such a system in villages in Africa.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the Zambia National Data Centre (ZNDC) and what services will it provide for shareholders?</h4><p>The country did not have a national data center, and we realized this could provide vital services for the public and private sectors. We hope it will attract institutions to store their main databases at the ZNDC and offer backup to ensure business continuity. The center is being built and developed to tier-three standard, and therefore can provide globally competitive services for both the public and private sectors. To attract these business, we need to assure people that the system is highly secure. We were also acutely aware that the project would have to be commercially viable from the beginning. There are three sites located across the country, and for us to sustain global standards and best practice in all of these sites, we cannot afford to house information for free. We are working closely with Huawei, because it has the business expertise in this area. We have engaged other partners that can help us grow commercially as this is something new for us and capacity will not appear overnight. Our people are being trained and have been trained; however, implementing such a world-class initiative, and a first for Zambia, means we require time to develop and mature our capacity.</p><h4>What future initiatives does ZICTA have planned for 2017?</h4><p>We have been working tirelessly to ensure ICT literacy levels are boosted across the nation. We want to ensure our development is aligned with the goals set by the World Information Technology and Services Alliance (WITSA). WITSA tasked its directors with connecting all villages and schools to the web by 2015. In the last decade or so, the UN has highlighted that ICT access is a human right. We began a project to provide communities with access through schools, setting up ICT labs and ensuring that all tertiary education facilities had a connection. Since then, we have managed to set up connectivity at three public institutions, 69 colleges and universities, and about 200 schools, both primary and secondary. We are also constructing a computer assembly plant before the year ends. We hope these developments will inspire children who are coding software in class to see that there is a viable market and a future in the sector. Secondly we are working on setting up a standards lab in order to validate the standards of our equipment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the structural reshaping at Hai impacted its operations in Zambia?</h4><p>Changes to the structure of our organization have not altered our ultimate vision; rather they have refocused it to provide internet services for all of Zambia. In March 2015, Hai became a subsidiary of CEC Liquid Telecoms—a partnership between the Zambian-based Copperbelt Energy Corporation Plc and the UK-based Liquid Telecommunications—and subsequently the company rebranded from Realtime Technologies Alliance Africa Limited (Realtime) to Hai Telecommunications Limited (Hai). In Swahili, the second-most widely spoken language in Africa, Hai means “I am alive." This meaning ties in with our philosophy: to provide internet not just as mere connectivity, but as an enabler for our customers across the whole country, offering fiber in homes, which can be used to access a wide range of applications from business to social, health, and education. We launched an innovative product called Fibroniks, a service that offers unprecedented internet speeds of up to 100MBps. This project was initially piloted in Lusaka and we hope to roll it out to the rest of the country. In addition, we are also implementing long-term evolution (LTE) solutions, wireless technologies that we will be able to deploy to connect more users beyond the fiber reach. The performance of this technology so far more or less matches the success of our fiber. </p><h4>What support and legislative assistance have you had from the public sector here in Zambia?</h4><p>Broadly speaking, the Zambian government supports the development of the ICT sector. Indeed, the government is at the core of promoting e-governance—for example, both tax payments and the public procurement systems are now digitalized—and it is expected that this in turn will create demand for our services from the public. From a regulatory and fiscal perspective, in the last two years the government has continued to offer incentives to boost the ICT sector. For example, for the import of ICT products and services, customs duty is either zero rated or at 5% compared to the usual 15% for a number of sectors. However, regulatory fees and corporate tax have remained the same for the last two years. Regulatory fees remain high and corporate tax for our sector is the highest in the country. For profits of more than ZMK250,000 (about USD25,000), corporate income tax is charged at 40% in the ICT sector, compared to 35% for  other sectors. This should be an area of focus for the government moving forward to encourage homegrown talent in the ICT sector. The ICT sector plays a role as a catalyst by ensuring there is efficiency in all other areas of business. If the sector is given greater incentives, it will ensure that the whole country has e-platforms and this will improve compliance, and hopefully, in the long term, result in improved efficiencies and ultimately marked economic development.</p><h4>What will CEC Liquid's cross-continent expansion program mean for your operations?</h4><p>First and foremost, it is exciting that we are now part of a multinational brand. Before we were just a localized company providing services nationally, while now we can connect with the rest of the world and this gives us added advantages. For example, one of the industries that has rapidly capitalized on mass global digitalization is the financial sector. Here, ICT is not a luxury, but a critical component of business. We can connect multinational companies, such as banks and other financial services providers, not only in Zambia, but also across Africa and the world through our expanded network reach. </p><h4>What is your forecast for the year ahead?</h4><p>As a business our aim is to ensure we continue offering and providing our customers services that are relevant and satisfactory. ICT, and particularly the internet, is no longer a luxury; it is a necessity. In 2017, we would like to connect more users to the internet and make in the process realize our ambition to provide quality internet for all Zambian citizens. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Panama’s financial sector stayed buoyant in tough 2016]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[nestor-blanco-general-manager-scotiabank]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What trends are defining the financial sector in Panama, and how did the financial sector perform in 2016?</h4><p>The financial sector continues to be strong. At times, the short-term consequences of the slowdown in 2016 were visible; however, the overall growth trends of the country and banks' asset books were not significantly affected. In the medium term, we expect to see a healthy consolidation of the financial sector. There are 49 full universal local banks in this economy and compliance, regulations, and the cost of doing banking is increasing. Banks need a large revenue base to distribute those expenses, though that will likely take place in the medium term. 2016 was challenging; however, Scotiabank and the financial sector continued to do well. We continue to see a strong consumer side, with real growth though low margins. Despite 2016 being a tough year with the Panama Papers and so on, there is economic stability, the US dollar-economy, low inflation, low unemployment, and immigration, which in the long term will benefit the country.</p><h4>How did your acquisition of Citigroup in 2015 impact your operations in Panama and Costa Rica?</h4><p>It was a successful transaction. We have always been a conservative bank and that will not change; however, there is a global strategy to be bigger and better with credit cards. This transaction was mainly a bet on the country, its growth, and the credit card portfolio that Citibank had built. We had 28,000 clients before and now have over 100,000; therefore, it was also a customer base acquisition. The reason for the success is because the acquisition involved a bank that was well placed and well recognized for unsecured lending mortgages and another bank that was mainly recognized and successful in placing secured products like credit cards. The cross-selling potential of those two products is fantastic. We now have the product and our customer base grew correspondingly. It was coincidental that Citibank had decided to leave the consumer market in Panama. We are currently going through the integration process, which is a challenge with every acquisition, and everything is on schedule. Currently, both Scotiabank and Scotiabank Transformandose are in the market, though the latter will eventually merge into the Scotiabank branch.</p><h4>What is the composition of your client portfolio in terms of corporate clients versus private clients?</h4><p>This bank was established as a corporate commercial bank funded by Canada in 1974; however, its business started to change in 2007 and 2008. Currently, 65% of our assets continue to be corporate commercial book while 35% is retail. With our acquisition of the Citibank portfolio, the retail increases significantly in terms of customers and even employees, though the assets per se were not that large relative to what we had. My objective is to make that 65/35 closer to 60/40 and then work toward 50/50 to make it more balanced. We are betting on the consumer and on retail, and that needs to be bigger; however, that does not mean our focus on large corporate transactions and large commercial transactions will stop. We find this business relevant for the country. Our presence and role in lending for large projects is necessary as this country is growing; the government has invested in infrastructure and we will continue to be a part of it.</p><h4>How much is the financial institution investing in innovation?</h4><p>We have talked about classic banking up until now; however, the reality is that the consumer, banking, and generations are changing and we pay a great deal of attention to this. One of the key strategies and measurements of success for us globally as management and the bank is digital transformation. That is key, and we measure, create, and leverage IT. This is where our global capabilities become useful. We have five Digital Factories in Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Chile, and Canada where people design and think about how to be digital, how to be faster, and how to be better for the customer. There are natural challenges to this; in developing economies, we work to get the customer out of the branch and do things electronically. We are at a transition point, in which everyone has a cellphone that they use for many tasks but they still go down to a branch to register for a credit card. We need to think about this situation and understand how we can encourage people to use available channels to facilitate their lives.</p><h4>What are your main targets and objectives for 2017?</h4><p>Being in a solid, stable, and growing economy represents a challenge because targets are aggressive. We have low double-digit targets for almost every aspect of our balance sheet and earnings and we are on target. Our financial year starts on November 1 and we are doing well. Our goal is to continue to be strong participants in large development projects. A key goal this year is to manage growth and while maintenance the highest standards on control and compliance, which is absolutely critical. At the same time, we work on integration, which entails resources, people, decisions, stress, and deadlines; we are in a key year where we have to manage those things. There are growth expectations that I am confident we will meet; we are betting on the country. We are a patient bank, we are not in a hurry and are here to stay; at the same time, we have deadlines to meet for the integration and 2017 is a critical year for us. We also have a digital transformation agenda that is a key priority for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Filling  the Vacuum]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[filling-the-vacuum]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the driving force behind Vodafone's expansion into Zambia?</h4><p>Vodafone Zambia was a product of Vodafone and Afrimax Group entering a non-equity partner market agreement for Zambia with a clear vision of becoming the number one next generation operator in Zambia. The communications sector in Zambia has undergone a substantial shift, turning it into one driven largely by the growth of data services, proving research which suggests Sub-Saharan Africa is currently undergoing a mobile digital revolution with consumers awakening to the possibilities of 3G and 4G technology. Most smart-phone owners' usage patterns have increasingly become more data-heavy, with the quantity spent on non-voice activity rising noticeably. Against this backdrop, we entered the Zambian market in June 2016 with the launch of 4G LTE data services aimed at transforming the communication sector in order to bridge the digital divide, with an initial investment of USD40 million.</p><h4>What was the response to Vodafone's entry into the market from leading companies in Zambia?</h4><p>Since we launched, we have continued receiving overwhelming response from customers. The growth we have experienced in such a short period exemplifies the massive vacuum that has existed in Zambia's internet space—a vacuum we will gladly fill. In light of the overwhelming response we received, we established Zambia as the regional operational center of excellence of the Afrimax-Vodafone Group, servicing other markets across the continent like Ghana, Uganda, and Cameroon. This is testimony of the great skill-set that our local team possesses and provides a unique opportunity for the team to share best practice, transfer skills to other markets on the continent, and also provide job opportunities both locally and regionally as a way of enhancing talent development. To date, we have already exported innovative products and services to our operations on the continent and to the Global Vodafone Group. Currently Vodafone stands as the only international organization within the telecommunications sector, to set up its regional hub in the country—another first in Zambia.</p><h4>How can ICTs be harnessed to enable the youth segment, and what is Vodafone doing to spearhead this endeabour?</h4><p>Zambia is continuously embracing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as an enabler of social and economic development. The industry is growing fast and making a significant contribution to national trade and investment. In this market, 60-70% of the population is below 25 years of age, signalling an impressive pool of talent and immense capacity just waiting to be tapped into. To demonstrate the power ICTs have to transform and empower, we developed a free e-learning platform called JUMP, which is a tool for young people focused on education and entrepreneurship. The platform hosts video lessons from Zambia's most distinguished lecturers through the JUMP Academy. As such, we are making education accessible to young people who do not have the funds to attend varsity. In addition, we have content focused on entrepreneurship, self-motivation, lifestyle, and entertainment. In the entertainment category of the portal, we will soon imbed a music sharing section. Here, we hope to offer an online space to encourage local talent to upload video and audio content. Furthermore, we have a radical approach to human resources by employing top graduates who now account for 50% of the organization's staff compliment. We designed a program for Institutions of Higher learning in Zambia, and from there we handpicked graduates to become part of the business' “next generation" culture that is characterized by innovation and market disruption. As a result, we received the Africa Best Employer Brand award from the Employer Branding Institute for our dynamic work culture; this is uncommon for many corporates in Zambia and we hope to be an inspiration to others. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[wissam-edmond-chbat-chairman-board-lebanese-petroleum-administration]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The first oil exploration contracts are expected to be signed before the end of 2017. What strategy will LPA follow to evaluate the bids?</h4><p>After the signing of the decrees that were pending for three and a half years, we renewed the launch of the bid round and started with a new qualification round that resulted in eight new companies prequalified to bid. We added these companies to the group of companies that had prequalified in 2013 and these two groups will be entitled to bid. There are 51 companies in total, and these companies are classified into two categories: operator and non-operator. The operator has more skills and financial strength and the critical parameters have been defined as total assets amounting to more than USD10 billion and experience in drilling and completed developments in waters of more than 500m in depth given that our environment involves deep water. For non-operators, they should have total assets of more than USD500 million and established oil and gas production; they have to prove that they are producing because we want exploration and production (E&amp;P) companies. We currently have 13 qualified companies classified as operators while the rest are non-operators. We require a minimum of three companies that have to go into joint ventures to bid for one block. There should be at least one operator present among these three and the operator will form the consortium. The individual companies forming the consortium will have to pass each other internal controls prior to forming the consortium which would contribute having many companies not being able to be part of any consortium. The deadline to submit the bids is September 15 and a month after that the LPA will assess the results, prepare its report, and send it to the minister. The decision will be taken at the level of the council of ministers starting November 15, at least in theory. However, looking at the recent political developments with the parliamentary elections taking place in May 2018, this current government will award before year end as per the timeline set earlier (before year-end).</p><h4>As the regulator, how does LPA provide the companies a secure environment to invest in?</h4><p>LPA has a regulator role, though it does not regulate prices. Most of the regulators in any industry have a role in the pricing; however, we do not have such a role because it is different dynamics with oil and gas. Our role is to monitor, manage, and supervise the petroleum activities. The LPA is divided into six departments and each department is led by a department head, who is at the same time a board member, so we have six board members. For the last four years, our engagement with the companies was mostly promotional for which we used several tools. In addition, we have worked on transparency by announcing the intent to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The importance of EITI is that it puts for the first time three parties on the same table: the government represented by the ministry and the LPA; the companies that will operate; and civil society, which will monitor this activity and ensure that it is done correctly. This is the importance of EITI; it is a platform where these three parties can discuss. In addition, with regards to transparency, we have worked on a draft law with one of the parliament members and have made all the non-mandatory recommendations by EITI mandatory within the law. We are going above and beyond the EITI in terms of transparency and, if this law is passed, this summarizes what has been done on the legal framework.</p><h4>LPA included certain specifications in the exploration and production-sharing agreements to help domestic companies and the local market. What are the main highlights of these initiatives aimed at boosting the local economy?</h4><p>Mainly, after we have awarded the oil and gas companies, these companies will need to subcontract other services and we therefore have a model contract that is based on a production-sharing contract whereby companies will invest and then recover their cost from production. If we have a solid and developed service industry in Lebanon, this cost can be re-injected into the Lebanese economy and this will even further boost our GDP and improve the oil and gas sector. For example, to increase the local manpower in this sector, we added in the contract the requirement that local workers make up 80% of the workforce. This will be extremely challenging for us to monitor and for it to be achieved. Thus, this 80% can be done gradually, and companies have to demonstrate that they are doing their best to achieve this. In the event that they cannot, we can help with solutions for a period of time. Now, with the service industry incentives that we have done and the 80% local content, we seek to capture part of the cost into the local industries of the country.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>The main goals are to first award the offshore blocks, and we want to achieve this by the end of this year or the beginning of 2018. Our main objective for 2018-2019 is to have a commercial discovery. Once we have a commercial discovery and everything put in place during this time, we will then be able to start executing our medium- to long-term plans based on the discovery size and the potential for other discoveries as well. We are doing all the work to ensure we attract the best companies in terms of skills and experience in order to achieve our strategic goal, which is a commercial discovery.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>Zambia's ICT sector reordered stellar growth in 2016, expanding YoY by over 40% and accounting for 1.2% of the country's overall 4% GDP growth, according to the country's Central Statistics Office (CSO). Industry observers expect more big things from the country in 2017. With subscription rates increasing in a number of key areas, the country's ICT sector looks extremely strong moving forward, and leaders in the public and private sphere are anticipating more record-setting growth. </p><p>Beginning in the early 2000s, Zambia has tried to develop its ICT sector with a clear and focused policy framework. Since 2007, they have been implementing this framework, known as the National Information and Communications Technology Policy, and they continue to make great strides. The eventual goal of the policy is to develop a knowledge economy by 2030, grow public access to the ICT infrastructure, design and implement an appropriate ICT infrastructure and roll out widespread e-government and e-commerce capabilities, according to the United Nations Development Program. For Zambian ICT, 2009 was another watershed year, and this year witnessed the introduction of the ICT Bill, which paved the way for new regulation and activity; the Communications and Technologies Act, which gives the government greater purview in ensuring the enactment of the National ICT policy; and the Electronic Communications Act, which aims to create a secure and reliable electronic ecosystem for all stakeholders in Zambia. According to Zambia's Revised Sixth National Development Plan and the National Vision 2030, ICT and science and technology development will be core areas of focus, and internet access, e-commerce, e-agriculture, e-health, and e-education are set to dominate the agenda.</p><p>According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report (WEF) for 2016-2017, Zambia has 74.5 mobile telephone subscriptions for every 100 people and 0.7 fixed-telephone lines for every 100 people in 2015 compared to 67.3 mobile telephone subscriptions per 100 people and 0.8 fixed telephone lines per 100 people in 2014. As with most developing countries, mobile access has been growing sizable in recent years, while traditional fixed lines have grown more and more obsolete. The major gains, however, have been in internet usage. Between 2014 and 2015, the percentage of the population using the internet grew from 17.3% to 21% and mobile broadband subscriptions per 100 people jumped from 1 to 13.8. Bandwidth exploded, and in the same period kb/s/ user grew from 4.2 to 125. According to the 2016 figures from the Zambia Information and Communications Technology Authority (ZICTA), there are 12,017,034 mobile subscriptions in the country, representing a penetration rate of 74.93%; 101,407 fixed line subscriptions, representing a penetration rate of 0.63%; 5,156,365 mobile internet users, representing a penetration rate of 32.15%; and 35,919 fixed line Internet subscriptions, representing a penetration rate of 0.22%.  </p><p>Additionally, Zambia was ranked 116 on the WEF's Network Readiness Index for 2015, but it was ranked 61 in terms of its political and regularity environment and 39 in terms of its business and innovation environment. Its business usage was ranked 71 overall, while individual usage came in at 126 and governmental usage was 104. In terms of the economic and social impact information technologies have, Zambia is still ranked relatively low at 115 and 111, respectively, but improvements are being made. In terms of rankings, overall network readiness has been a bit unstable in recent years, but serious strides have been made in certain areas. Zambia's regulatory environment for information technology has improved dramatically, and the country is ranked 37 in legal system efficiency in settling disputes, 48 in challenging regulations, and 46 in intellectual property protection. Affordability remains an issue, and Zambia ranked 118 in prepaid mobile cellular tariffs, 131 in fixed broadband internet tariffs, and 96 in internet and telephone competition.</p><p>Some strides are being made in this area, however, and renewed competition amongst Zambia's three major data providers has stimulated a fall in prices. With growing adoption of smartphone technology, Zambia's three major data providers, Airtel, Zamtel, and MTN, have put a dent in prices. These three companies account for the vast majority of data services in the country—MTN controls 45.5% of the market, Airtel has 40.1%, and Zamtel has 14.4%—and they continually vie for the country's nearly 6 million internet users. Mobile network operators employed almost 1,400 people in 2016 and generated revenue of almost ZMK 4.5 billion, according to ZICTA. </p><p>Another key area of improvement has been in government usage, and Zambia ranks 57 in importance of ICT to the government's vision and 68 in governmental success in ICT promotion. The government has been developing and executing plans to deepen the penetration of technology into the lives of all Zambians, and it has been focusing particular effort on leveraging the private sector's know-how to improve usage rates. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Samson Longwe, the Managing Director of Hai, enumerated some of the ways the government has bolstered the industry. “Broadly speaking, the Zambian government supports the development of the ICT sector," said Longwe. “Indeed, the government is at the core of promoting e-governance—for example, both tax payments and the public procurement systems are now digitalized—and it is expected that this in turn will create demand for our services from the public. From a regulatory and fiscal perspective, in the last two years the government has continued to offer incentives to boost the ICT sector." These incentives have included lower import duties for ICT-related goods. However, Longwe is quick to caution that more can still be done, particularly in the areas of corporate tax and regulatory fees.</p><p>The Zambian government has continued to make strides in terms of making the country as attractive as possible for international investors and major multinational ICT firms. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Lars Stork, CEO of Vodafone Zambia, described the work Zambian stakeholders have put into the industry. “Zambia has undertaken rigorous and institutional reforms aimed at improving the attractiveness of the country to investors. From an ICT perspective, Zambia steadily continues to establish itself as an attractive investment destination in Southern Africa," said Stork. “With the immense talent pool in Zambia, its geographical position, plus favorable investor policy framework, the nation is in a position to become the Silicon Valley of Southern Africa—a truly technological hub driving the nation and the region into a bright digital future." By supporting the natural appeal of Zambia to international and homegrown investors, stakeholders of all kinds can serve as catalysts in developing Zambia's ICT ecosystem and knowledge economy.</p><p>Industry leaders are excited about the implications of the new Pan-African network for the Zambian ICT sector, and they foresee it having widespread positive impacts on the industry. Samson Longwe explained the importance of the network on Zambia. “By being more connected, the continent can develop at a faster rate," said Longwe. “Traditionally Africa sold its primary products to Europe and other markets, but it is expected that ICT will help provide more opportunities for intra-African trade. It is also high time in Africa to start adding value to its primary commodities in Africa and, with interconnectivity, the opportunities to do so will materialize." Leaders in Zambia's ICT industry expect big things from the pan-African network.</p><p>The domestic network is also expanding at an impressive rate, and MTN has built 163 Evolution 4G sites across the country, and it plans to complete 68 more in the near future. Additionally, the company plans to develop its 3G network even further, expanding its current infrastructure from 769 3G sites to 881 by year-end, according to the trade publication ITWEB AFRICA. MTN hopes to utilize its expanded network to capture more of market share, improving its already dominate position.</p><p>A new but integral driver of ICT growth in Zambia has been the proliferation of mobile banking. Though the majority of the Zambians have traditionally gone unbanked, new technologies are bringing finance to the masses. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Charles Molapisi, CEO of MTN, discussed the ways mobile banking and financial services are changing the ICT landscape in Zambia. MTN has more than 420,000 customers using its mobile money service, transacting more than USD800 million dollars a month. “We believe we can reach USD3 billion worth of transactions by the end of 2017 and 1 million customers," said Molapisi. “We are empowering Zambian citizens with financial tools and also supporting the government's efforts to increase financial inclusion." Innovative, market-changing platforms like MTN's mobile money system are transforming the IT space in Zambia, bringing the country to the fore in terms of development and penetration.</p><p>While progress has been made, Zambia's IT and telecoms industry has room for growth and improvement. Stakeholders in Zambia are working to develop the necessary infrastructure to transform the economy into one that is knowledge based. As the country continues to develop its innovation agenda, IT and telecoms are set to remain a priority. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Through which structures does ICCIMA serve its members?</h4><p>ICCIMA is the biggest official organization in Iran working under the laws passed by the Iranian parliament. We hold several elections after which specialized commissions are formed. Nowadays there are more than 19 specialized commissions consisting of elites from various economic sectors that offer consultation services to the Board of Directors. Experts gather suggestions, plans, and issues for economic growth and offer them to the members of the board of ICCIMA. These plans will later be suggested to three main branches of Iran, which are parliament, government, and judiciary. Moreover, ICCIMA has more than 200 economic formations with different fields of activity. We have an Arbitration Center to handle disputes among our members and also take care of international economic disputes and discussions. The formation of a public-private sector dialog council was one of the best and innovative of our activities during the past three years. This event is held once a month and consists of members from the private sector, cabinet ministers, chairmen of the parliamentary committees and judiciary assistants. This council is the best place for the private sector to meet government officials. It enables a dialogue about the economic problems and issues of Iran and provides a platform for suggestions that can boost Iran's economy and enhance its network of international relations. We also have a committee that aims to distinguish the business annoying rules, offers new economical rules and tries to facilitate the business environment for entrepreneurs. The chamber covers 34 province chambers and is an active branch of the International Chamber of Commerce. Every member of ICCIMA has an activity card with two verified signatures. One of the signatures belongs to ICCIMA, and the other one is the Ministry of Industry, Mine, and Trade's signature. This card is a certification that the company is allowed to engage in international business activity. The main purpose of ICCIMA is to facilitate the members' activities. Economic development of the private sector is our main mission and all of our members are covered by the full support of the chamber and all its committees.</p><h4>What are the main goals under the Ten-Year Vision, which was proclaimed in 2009?</h4><p>One of the goals of ICCIMA is to improve its own position within the Iranian government and to upgrade its international position as well. Internationally, we achieved some of our goals. For example, one of our members was elected as board member in WCF this year. Next to this I was elected as vice president of the Silk Road Chamber, and we increased our activity after JCPOA. We started our negotiations to make the best out of the situation and currently there are many national and international delegations trying to improve the interactions. We will soon reach a desirable position in the international economy. As a representative of its members, the chamber is determined to pave the way for the Iranian economic structure and to prepare the appropriate climate so that its members can participate in the various economic areas. We play an effective role in enhancing domestic business competitiveness at the regional, national, and international level. Also, we promote the economic and social status of Iranian economic activists, entrepreneurs and ICCIMA members. We hope to improve our international business climate ranking in the near future.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the lifting of sanctions on ICCIMA and its members so far, and which sectors will particularly benefit moving forward?</h4><p>The JCPOA negotiations showed Iran's inclination to interaction and dialogue. We strongly believe that all the issues can be solved through negotiations. The deal brought Iran into a new international situation. The signing of JCPOA lifted a heavy block from Iran's economy and opened new gates to international interactions. We had serious banking problems before which are going to be solved soon. We have seen eye catching progress already in the financial and transport sectors and a reduction of economic risks. After the signing of JCPOA, we received many interested foreign delegations and their high demands created problems for us in the beginning. An important point to mention is that the international market does not only have direct economic expectations of investments in Iran. With Iran's geographical situation and its penetration rate in the regional economic markets, Iran would be a great and secure path to reach other markets in the region, such as Central Asia, the Caucasus, Iraq, and some parts of India and China. We also have several huge but incomplete plans in Iran, which are seeing great enthusiasm from investors from all over the world. These projects have great potential and the government has motivational plans for them. Nowadays everyone is aware that the price of the energy in Iran is low and you can easily find young and educated. This can be counted as an attraction for investors. Geographically, Iran is located in an insecure area. Yet it is one of the safest countries in the region and this can be an advantage to economic investors as well.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017 and what are your goals beyond the Ten-Year Vision?</h4><p>I was chosen for this position after a semi-period election as my dear friend and colleague could not continue his activity for some reasons. After I was elected for this position, we decided to continue with the existing agenda and to add some new plans at the same time. The underlying vision of all the plans is to increase the share of the private sector in Iran's economy. The Supreme Leader of Iran issued a rule years ago. Based on this rule, a lot of factories and governmental economic sectors should be privatized. So not only am I determined to increase the private sector share in my term as president, also the government supports us. Another important point is that we should make economic activities clear, create economic competition in the private sector, and increase our knowledge about the challenges and the ways to cope with them through holding events and workshops. To reach this goal we have formed a specialized commission in the chamber to upgrade our international rank and to cooperate with the World Economic Forum. This year we participated in a questionnaire of the World Economic Forum. We seek stronger international interactions and believe that business is a two-way highway. Investment in the country will cause permanent mutual economic relations with other countries. Sanctions delayed our technical capability in some industries but we will soon solve this matter. We will renovate our technology and introduce the capacity and capability of Iran to the world to establish a permanent link with the international economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[New Kid On the Block]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[new-kid-on-the-block]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Dangote Industries fared in the Zambian market?</h4><p>We began our Zambian operations in July 2015, with Aliko Dangote and the President of Zambia His Excellency Edgar Chagwa Lungu officially opening the company in August 4, 2015. With the currency depreciating, the copper price dipping, and the market shrinking, it was not the easiest time to launch operations. However, in spite of these setbacks, the Dangote brand was well accepted in the country. Our arrival was hotly anticipated, owing to increased demand in the cement business and certain supply deficits that led to upticks in prices and delayed construction of roads and houses. With Dangote's entrance, prices have come down and stabilized. Stability was vital, as it afforded people the opportunity to plan longer-term projects more accurately.</p><h4>What opportunities does Zambia present for Dangote, and how have you tailored your products to meet these?</h4><p>When we entered the market, we did so with two types of products: Dangote 3X, our standard 42.5R product that can be found everywhere we operate, and a 32.5R product. In 2017, we then added a 32.5N product, looking to serve the growing demand in the road and home construction segments. Zambia also presents us with another key opportunity, which is the potential for export, with its eight bordering countries, many of which are not yet self-sufficient in terms of in-house cement production. Secondly, cement prices in these neighboring countries are higher, which means that, even with transport costs, our prices are competitive. The problems we face include instability in terms of legislation, for example, in countries like the DRC, as well as competition from well-established brands.</p><h4>What is the current capacity of the plant?</h4><p>The capacity of our plant is 1.5 million tons. We are currently operating below that, due to dampened supply following the recession and the rainy season. At peak months, however, we reach 80-90% of our capacity. Looking at the market we see that the overall cement production capacity in the country stands at 3.4 million tons, and we estimate that market demand in the country is about 1.5 million tons. Further capacity expansion will be driven by increased demand from the local market.</p><h4>What advances have you made in transport?</h4><p>We are working hard to ensure the utmost safety precautions are being taken in our transport division. We have put tracking systems in place, hired more trainers, and have seen a significant improvement in our drivers' behavior. At the same time, the road infrastructure of Zambia is difficult to negotiate and the building of new roads connecting parts of the country will surely increase commerce. The government is considering introducing a statutory instrument for heavy goods, forcing companies to move 35% of certain heavy cargo onto rail. This is an extremely sensible initiative in terms of protecting road infrastructure from continuous damage; however, Zambia currently lacks the rail infrastructure for the 35% target to be achievable. The government should start with 5% and then slowly increase this, eventually reaching the 35% target as the rail infrastructure and rail efficiency improves.</p><h4>What are Dangote's ambitions in Zambia for the medium term?</h4><p>We want to make our debut in the bulk market here, where currently we have a low profile, and are securing investments in order to effectively participate in this segment. We already have the product—our cement services high-end construction such as dams, airports and so on—although currently we only supply in limited quantities. In the medium term, though, our focus will be on market penetration. We still need to raise awareness about our presence and familiarize customers with our products. There is some user education required, which will be another of our key areas of concentration which also extends into learning and development and skills transfer of Dangote employees and partners. Finally, we want to use Zambia as a starting point to explore other areas in the region, such as Malawi and the DRC. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ZAMEFA has developed significantly since its inception in 1968. What have been the defining features of its trajectory?</h4><p>ZAMEFA was established in 1968, with the first production in 1970-71. The government had majority share in the company, with Phelps Dodge owning about 35%. In 1996, the government decided to privatize all its companies, including ZAMEFA. Phelps Dodge bought the government's stake and by 1997 it owned 100% of the company. This structure held until 2004, when Phelps listed ZAMEFA on the LuSE, floating some shares and starting ZAMEFA's history as a publicly listed company, albeit in private hands. In fact, ZAMEFA is the only surviving company in its original form from the privatization drive. Perhaps this success is attributable to the fact that ZAMEFA is a unique company, with a strategic location in Luanshya, just 60km from the copper mines. ZAMEFA can employ up to 360 people in successful years. At the moment we are undergoing a management shift, following a change of hands from General Cable to Reunert.</p><h4>What characterizes ZAMEFA's current operations in Zambia?</h4><p>We are situated in Luanshya, where we do our production, with a marketing and distribution center in Lusaka. We bring in our products from the Copperbelt and sell and distribute them here. We can produce efficiently in terms of sourcing raw materials, and although we have to stock components like plastic for insulation or center wire for armoring, the cost of doing so does not compare to the cost of stocking copper, which of course, being based where we are, we are not forced to do. Our exports are sent directly from Luanshya to foreign markets. We export regionally in South Africa, Botswana, Congo, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, and Ethiopia. Around 80% of our production is earmarked for export, almost all destined for within Africa. In the past we have also traded in Italy, France, and India. However, currently we focus more on inter-Africa trade. That said, there are many export issues within Africa; exporting to Ethiopia, for example, can be an arduous task, both bureaucratically and logistically in terms of regulations and even payments. Much of the time this involves transporting via third countries and offloading on ships, trucks, and so on. Inland transportation has not been such a problem. Our biggest market is South Africa, where we sell a large amount of copper rod.</p><h4>How do you continue to reach out strategically to partners in industry and what areas of growth will you focus on in the short term?</h4><p>Most utilities are moving out of copper and into aluminum, which will be a big challenge for ZAMEFA, because we do not have aluminum in this country and we would have to import it. We are preparing for this by focusing on product diversification with the wheels in motion for a project manufacturing medium-voltage cables. Everything we do now is low voltage; however, adding medium voltage would increase the range of cable that we could offer. Furthermore, currently all medium-voltage cables are imported, mainly from South Africa. If we can produce these, there will be a huge market open to us and this could also be a crucial stepping-stone into Eastern Africa. We are a member of COMESA and will be able to promote and sell this product in that market, since at the moment all medium voltage comes from Egypt. This project is the backbone of our strategic focus now in terms of diversification and product expansion. We also plan to expand geographically eastwards. The quantities of our exports are still small, though growth is rapid and steady. It does not rival our southern market yet; however, it is getting there. The fact that the South African economy is flat right now is also an issue and shifting to other markets will help us diversify risk as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the current areas of focus for the IDC?</h4><p>Our top priority is the transformation of SOEs into viable, profitable, dividend-declaring entities. We have certain enterprises that over the years have been in need of recapitalization, for example. Our second focus is to industrialize by partnering with the private sector in order to open the country up to new industries. Our third area of focus is forging strategic partnerships. We are not in the business of establishing SOEs, but rather collaborating with private sector parties that will take up majority equity.</p><h4>What has been your strategy so far to make SOEs viable, profitable entities?</h4><p>The IDC took over the shareholdings for all the SOEs in 2015. Following that, we spent most of 2016 getting to grips with our portfolio, the state of these companies, and what needed to be done with each of them. Since we are in practically every sector—financial institutions, mining, agriculture, and so forth—this portfolio is diversified and it is impossible to have a one-size-fits-all approach. What is more, each company is at a different stage in terms of experience, situation, and growth. Some companies need the kind of recapitalization that brings in new rolling stock. Elsewhere, other SOEs may need balance sheet restructuring, or may have legacy issues to deal with, or cost structures to re-address. Some companies need the IDC's help in the form of a guarantee to the bank to access funds for restructuring or for new equipment. During 2016 we also worked on establishing and positioning the IDC as a holding company, a process that included developing group financials and putting the necessary expertise in place. 2017 is the year in which we expect to reap the fruits of what was sowed in the previous 12 or so months, with many of our interventions beginning to take hold.</p><h4>What will be the pillars of your strategy to create the target amount of 1 million jobs in five years?</h4><p>Our strategy is aligned with the national government plan: the Industrialization and Job Creation Strategy, targeting jobs in agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, along with infrastructure development. This is exactly where IDC's priorities lie; therefore, we are confident that we can spearhead this mission, with each one of our partnerships resulting in employment opportunities for Zambians. In 1Q2017, we had a groundbreaking ceremony for a new tractor and agricultural equipment assembly plant, partnering with a Polish manufacturer that was signed on to supply technology and expertise. Jobs will result from this, not just directly at that factory, but also throughout the resulting value chain. This is how the IDC understands the president's directive, and is strengthened in its resolve to do all it can to activate such value chains.</p><h4>How do you work strategically to produce revenue streams to feed into the sovereign wealth fund?</h4><p>In effect, the dividends declared by the IDC will feed into the sovereign wealth fund; however, there is a fundamental precondition to this. First and foremost, we need a balance sheet and a group of companies that can deliver that dividend. For example, we hold equity in practically every mining company in Zambia through ZCCM-Investments Holding Plc (ZCCM-IH), and therefore we may be able to deliver a dividend from this group in the near future. However, looking at the bigger picture, in order to get to the point of contributing to the sovereign wealth fund, we have to transform all our enterprises into profitable businesses. Therefore, making these contributions is a longer-term goal for IDC. In this regard, we measure our success primarily by the number of SOEs we can put on the Lusaka Stock Exchange. Listing is the ultimate transformation. If we reach the point where we have the confidence in a company to list it on the stock exchange, and we are certain it will meet the transparency, governance, and management standards demanded of listed companies, then we know we have transformed it. From our point of view, Zambians can then truly say they own these companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What products does World Panel provide for the Zambian market?</h4><p>In 2014, we launched our durable World Panel solar panels, devices that use renewable technology to charge mobile phones as quickly as an electrical outlet. The World Panel 500 combo-pack units with patented solar panel technology also come with a 5,000-milliampere power bank and a 10-bulb LED light. The panels, once fully charged, have enough power to charge six regular cellphones or 20 hours of light using the LED lamp. Our intention, through this product, is to increase access to energy amongst the poor people of Africa. Since we launched three years ago, we have had great sales, especially from institutions such as NGOs dealing with increasing quality of life in rural areas. From an individual perspective, few people in rural areas can afford the product and this has been one of our learning curves. While the product is designed for the rural community, socioeconomic conditions do not allow them to purchase it. We therefore entered into discussions about how to make this affordable and concluded by negotiating with the government to come under the policy of zero tax on renewable energy products. Since then, we have been able to bring prices down dramatically.</p><h4>Is the product manufactured in Zambia?</h4><p>We have not yet been able to produce the panels locally, although this is our eventual goal. Our panels were initially manufactured in China, even though the patent is from the US. Now, however, we have moved the product fabrication to a factory in the US. This product passes global standards. The original inventor of the product, professor John Anderson, did a great deal of research in African countries such as Uganda and Zambia, and was able to verify the quality and the efficacy of the product.</p><h4>What is your view of the World Bank's Scaling Solar initiative, and its implications for Zambia's changing energy matrix?</h4><p>For us as a country, it is a positive initiative. For many years, Zambia has depended on hydropower, and while this has in the past proved to be an effective source for powering the nation, we have seen how recent weather patterns have negatively impacted energy generation. Because of this, it has become crucial to think outside the box and diversify. Zambia has abundant sunshine and is an open country on a plateau. However, there is also the question of how to improve distribution channels of the captured energy from solar in order to ensure this energy reaches everyone who needs it. The majority of our population remains without access to energy. This has led to massive rural-urban migration, as people come to towns and cities in search of basic amenities they cannot access in more remote parts of the country. This, in turn, has resulted in congestion and overpopulation in Zambia's urban areas. To combat this, we should not just look at major projects, but also medium and small projects that can be set up in rural areas. With renewable energy, the initial cost appears high; however, in the long term it pays off. That is one of the things that the industry and the government need to focus on.</p><h4>Is the government right to invest in large-scale projects like the Kariba Dam and Batoka Gorge hydropower plants?</h4><p>Given the state of the global economy, as well as the particulars affecting Zambia, it is important that we have a balanced strategy. In terms of the medium and long term, Zambia will always benefit from abundant water, regardless of whether this is sometimes unpredictable in the short term. If we can capture this and generate enough cheap power for export, then that will exponentially improve our economic scenario. Zambia is surrounded by eight countries, the majority of whom need energy. If we can produce cheap energy and are able to link up, then our export potential will be immense. Therefore, these megaprojects will be vitally important for the economy at large. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy is being employed to cushion KCM from copper price volatility?</h4><p>In 2016, we witnessed the lowest average copper price in 11 years. Although there has been a small uptick in prices, they will probably remain low for another 12-18 months before we see a significant increase. In a low price environment, there are three areas that a producer like us can focus on. The first of these is operational efficiency. For example, if a plant needs to run for 95% of the time for efficiency, then this should be maintained. Likewise, chemicals that are used for processing need to be recovered at dosages that are as close as possible to optimum levels. In addition, there are a whole load of mechanical maintenance and copper recovery type efficiencies that can be optimized. Secondly, when prices are low, the producer needs to negotiate better prices for consumables and raw materials. We have liaised with our suppliers to see what we can do in terms of reducing our overall cost of production by looking at pricing and quality. The third area of focus, and one that has set us apart from other mining companies in Zambia, is volumes. In October 2015, when the power crisis hit Zambia hard and ZESCO declared “force majeure," rather than scale down our operations as other miners did, we pushed for higher, profitable volumes in order to reduce our overall cost of production. For us, it was the right strategy and the right way to address a difficult period in our operating history.</p><h4>What measures need to be implemented by the public sector in terms of energy tariffs and mining regulation?</h4><p>The government needs to tackle several issues, and indeed, is already doing so. Regulations surrounding power factors—an indicator of how efficiently power is being used—need to be enforced to ensure that large users of power can maintain high levels of efficiency. We are the largest consumer of power in the country, so our ability to source reliable power at affordable rates greatly impacts our performance and our sustainability. The Minister of Energy is eager to move toward a more cost-reflective tariff that takes into consideration the chain of sourcing energy—from generation all the way to transmission. It will be important to accommodate bulk buying rates and retail rates if Zambia is to continue to attract foreign investors into the sector.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Zambia's mining industry and for KCM in the medium term?</h4><p>On the whole, the outlook is positive. Anil Agarwal, the Group Chairman of Vedanta Resources, recently met with His Excellency President Edgar Lungu and made a number of investment commitments. One of these is to move production levels to 400,000 tons of copper each year, which would quadruple production over the next three to seven years. This extra capacity will come from a number of sources, including the Konkola deep underground mine. We are currently working with consulting engineers and mining experts to review the technologies we employ and to boost productivity. Most importantly, we want to mine deeper. So far our deepest level is at 950m and our target is a next development at 1,100m. This will be a game changer for KCM. We are already the largest integrated copper producer in Zambia and the second-largest in Africa. Our smelter, one of four in the country, can produce 310,000 tons of copper every year. </p><h4>How does KCM demonstrate its commitment to reducing its environmental impact?</h4><p>KCM is working towards addressing all remaining legacy issues in respect of environmental matters. We are determined to be best in class as far as the environment is concerned and we have invested a substantial amount in reducing our environmental footprint and being a net-positive contributor to biodiversity. We have reduced the amount of water we consume across all our operations by 50% in the last three years, further enhancing our ability to attain zero discharge. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the industrial sector play within Panama's development?</h4><p>Unfortunately, it does not play a large enough role. Panama is different from its neighbors and is focused on services but not on goods. About 30% of our neighbor Guatemala's GDP consists of industry, in Costa Rica it is somewhere around 20%, and Panama it is only 5.5%. We have seen a decline in the matrix of our economy from around 17% about 20 years ago to 5.5%. Industry used to be the fourth-largest employer but today is around fifth, close to construction. Panama made a conscious decision to focus on services despite the fact that 80% of global transactions occur in goods in manufacturing while only a small part is services. Most of our GDP consists of things like logistics, banking, financial services, and legal services, which is only a small part of our economy. Perhaps less than 0.5% of our GDP is legal services and all offshoring services. We are in an unfortunate position today; however, we are proud to have a robust service industry and perhaps the best infrastructure in the region. As far as moving cargo, Panama is a logistic center, which has been the case not just in the last 30 years but for 500 years. There are about 6 million containers that go through the canal; the potential is so great but we are not capable of seeing it. Most of the raw materials that cross from one part of the world to the other in fact go through Panama, and we have spent the better part of 100 years watching containers go by. If we are to be a logistics point in the Americas or the world, we should think about adding value to some of that because moving things in the long term is not a sound business model. We will need to add value to the goods that are moved through our canal and that is where we need the industry to play an important role.</p><h4>What is SIP's mission and vision?</h4><p>We have been in business for over 70 years and have two main objectives: to safeguard the existing industry in the country and to incentivize new investment in the sector. For the first part, we need to be able to make our industry more competitive, so we organize several events. We can move our industry forward by transferring knowledge and bringing people in. We have a strong component, namely training, and we have added that into the services that SIP offers. The second component is to attract new business. We have to have legislation, which is what we are working on right now to incentivize investment in the industrial sectors. We have industry but it is not where it needs to be and it starts by changing how we present ourselves. We have been successful and so have hundreds of other people; we have about 130,000 employees in industry so it is a small component but it is there. Perhaps we need a policy and not just a law, as these are two entirely different things. One is a tool that is a means to an end while a policy aligns everything. Our neighboring countries are able to focus on industry; they have natural resources but no canal, and they have roads but they are terrible, so how are they able attract large industries such as pharmaceuticals, biotech, and electronics? We have two issues to work on: maintaining our competitiveness and working on getting new investment.</p><h4>What is your main target set for 2017?</h4><p>The number-one priority is a new piece of legislation that allows the local industry to increase its activity. That is my number-one project for the year and we are working closely on this with people from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The main markets for the air quality and energy saving division are China, India, and other countries with high levels of pollution. Thesan is a fully integrated player in the renewable energy division. We focus our attention and activity on the entire value chain, starting from the development of the project to the production of mounting systems and the construction of photovoltaic plants, including engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) activities. We also have a business unit that operates as an independent power producer (IPP), which is focused only on solar investments at the moment. Our operations started in 2010 with the development of 50MWp projects in Italy, and we later expanded, entering Romania before coming to Latin America, beginning with Brazil and Ecuador. We started operations in Ecuador in 2012, and after two years of development built seven projects under a government concession to sell energy at a preferred rate to local distribution companies. These were successfully completed and connected in 2014, and were one of the first solar projects financed by Corporacion Interamericana para el Financiamiento de Infraestructura (CIFI) in Ecuador. CIFI is an important player in terms of infrastructure financing and investment in Latin America and provided us with another credit line that supported the development of our business in the region. </p><h4>What is the importance of Panama, considering the group's regional and international activities?</h4><p>We have been in Panama since 2015, although it was too early as the main law that introduced tax benefits for solar and renewable energy had only been passed in 2014. By 2016, we had several projects under development, and we currently operate all the main business units in Panama, including EPC, O&amp;M, and IPP. We chose to enter the Panamanian market because it is centrally located, developed for the region, and has one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America. It also has infrastructure and an open economy similar to Europe or North America. Since it uses USD, there is no currency risk. We were coming to Panama regardless of whether there were any tax or incentives from the government.  Our first project here was a 10MWp power plant worth more than USD12.5 million. The plant sells energy to private (wholesale) clients under a PPA scheme. It was the first solar PPA in Panama providing 24/7 energy all year round. We signed 20-year PPAs at a price linked to local inflation so that companies can calculate the cost of their energy. We sell at a lower price compared to distributors and provide energy directly to the client. In order to back up our plant we signed a long-term backup agreement with another renewable energy generator. We have a 20-year commitment to this country, which means we consider it one of the most important markets in our portfolio.</p><h4>What distinguishes Thesan from its competitors in the region?</h4><p>We have in-house engineers and an R&amp;D team, both in Italy and in each country. We produce a part of the plant's aluminum mounting system that is designed and manufactured in Italy. We provide O&amp;M and EPC services as well as asset management. We have experience worldwide and in the region and have created great synergies with international and local financial institutions. We have a flexible approach that enables us to structure our operations to suit our clients' needs across the value chain, provide construction financing, and have extensive experience in engineering development as well as financial structuring and planning.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In addition to retail, which other sectors represent key areas of growth for Total's business in Zambia?</h4><p>After retail, the two key sectors are agriculture and transport. Developments in agriculture tie in with the government's targeted strategic approach in the next five years to diversify the economy. What is more, because of Zambia's geographical location at the heart of SADC and COMESA, transport needs to be boosted in order to successfully link the country up with its neighbors. The government plans for Zambia to become a hub for the sub-region, with all products, goods, and services in transit to neighboring countries passing through here. In line with this, Total has plans to harness the opportunities in this sector with tailor-made offers such as our Integrated Services Approach, which removes the burden of fuel management off the client, thus the client can focus on their core business and is guaranteed high safety level onsite, high quality of products, availability of products through reliable supply chain, and value-added services that bring improved cost management and savings. We have also introduced the TOTAL Card, a rechargeable, electronic card for purchase of fuel and goods in TOTAL stations, perfect for fleet management as it reduces incidents of fraud associated with fuelling and improves personnel safety by removing risks associated with carrying cash.</p><h4>Do you see the aviation sector picking up in 2018?<br></h4><p>With the government's determination to boost tourism in Zambia by implementing the Tourism Development Fund, which will support tourism products development, tourism infrastructure, and tourism marketing, this should reverse the trend in the last several years that led to major international carriers like British Airways and KLM abandoning this route. Also, with the planned reforms in the petroleum downstream sector, I expect a collaborative review of the supply and distribution scheme of aviation fuel with the stakeholders to address any weak points and offer solutions to strengthen supply of aviation fuel to all airports within the country at competitive prices. Lastly, the Ministry of Transport continues to discuss developments at KKIA International Airport, and there are plans underway for infrastructural projects in Ndola and in Kafue. In 2018, these benefits should trickle down into the system and we should see the aviation market doubling.</p><h4>What makes Zambia an important region for Total's overall operations?</h4><p>Zambia is an integral part of Total's history in Africa. We have had a presence here for 67 years now and we operated Indeni refinery, which was the only refinery in Zambia between 2002 and 2009, a government-owned holding in which we had a 50% share. From a business point of view, we also see Zambia as one of the countries in Africa that will experience exponential growth. Under its present administration, Zambia can realize its economic potential in the coming years. As a fast-growing company mobilized around a deep transformation journey, we have been preparing for this: we recently commissioned a world-class invariants compliant fuel depot in Lusaka, investing USD7 million in total in the project. Furthermore, our conviction that real growth will come from rural areas has led us to spend over USD30 million in the last three years purchasing and reconstructing sites in these outlying areas that lack fueling stations. As of today, we have about 52 active sites across the whole country. However, we are not stopping there, and in 2017 we have plans to invest USD12 million on constructing and buying new stations in rural and urban areas. We continue to develop expertise and build up capacities of the communities where we operate, with initiatives such as the Total Young Dealer Scheme, the Total Young Graduate Program, and the Total Start Upper Challenge for Young Entrepreneurs. We are also an active member of the Business-Linkages program, organized by PEP-Zambia and aimed at reinforcing links between SMEs and larger companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of partnering with the private sector for the government's plan for energy development?</h4><p>The government alone does not have the fiscal resources to invest large amounts of money directly into power solutions; therefore, it is vital to partner with the private sector, which has these resources and is adept at managing them. However, to bring these players on board we need to make sure the business environment is attractive enough, which is what the government is focusing on at the moment, with incentives and collaborations with the IMF and other global organizations. Many energy projects in this country have been made possible because of debt financing and grants from international partners. The budget we have raised for energy creation so far is around USD10 million. However, we estimate that to reach our target of 51% electricity penetration in rural areas we will need more than USD50 million per annum, and thus need to forge strong ties with external parties. Many of these, such as the EU, World Bank, and African Development Bank, have been supportive so far, and we have successfully packaged some attractive and well-planned projects in exchange for grants and concession loans.</p><h4>Can renewables revolutionize energy generation and access to energy in Zambia?</h4><p>If we want to industrialize the country and meet our pledge to generate 1 million jobs for Zambian people, then we need sufficient direct supply of power. For this, we need to unlock potential in hydro, coal, and nuclear. Solar energy is a complement to this. While it cannot support large-scale industrialization, it can play a vital role in unlocking the potential of rural areas, which may be 10-20 years away from accessing energy through the national grid. Off-grid solutions have revolutionized life in these communities, where people can now use energy to open small businesses and access technology, putting them in touch with the rest of the world.</p><h4>What is the importance of interregional collaboration in Africa's energy future?</h4><p>Regional integration is key for the energy sector because African countries have different potentials, volumes, and levels of investment. For example, Zambia could capitalize on its historical relationship with South Africa and tap into its surplus power to mitigate the effects of our crisis. We could also look east, where countries like Ethiopia are bounding ahead in terms of power generation. We have launched some initiatives to encourage such connectivity. One such transmission line is the Zambia-Kenya-Tanzania transmission project (ZKT), which is expected to connect Zambia to the Ethiopian grid in the long run. The planned project to upgrade the Kafue-Livingstone transmission line to 220kV will bring power into Lusaka and Maamba, as well as other provinces, and will enable Zambia and its regional neighbors in the southeast to trade excess power. There is another transmission line between Zambia and Zimbabwe that is instrumental in allowing Escom to bring in much of the excess power generated in Zimbabwe, and we are also in talks with South Africa and Botswana for further possibilities opening here. Finally, we are developing transmission lines to Ethiopia and Tanzania, and hope that in 2017 we will have the financing to complete these projects.</p><h4>What are the main goals moving forward for Zambia's nuclear development in the medium term?</h4><p>Our first step will be to dispel the myths surrounding nuclear energy that make countries very cautious about bringing nuclear into the mix. And for this, we must encourage education and build capacity. I hope to have created a policy and institutional framework that will allow us to bring in developers within the next five years. Now, we will focus on our collaborations with Russia and China, though this is just a starting point to allow Zambia to set sail on its nuclear journey. We want to start thinking about international standards we should meet to commit to nuclear in the long term: how to manage waste, or the eventual decommissioning of facilities, among other issues. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the landscape of Zambia's insurance market change in 2016?</h4><p>In 2016, there was a significant drop in new entrants to the market, which was influenced by the introduction of the new capital requirement regulation. Only one new insurance company registered in 2016, and at the end of 2016 there were 34 insurance companies, five reinsurance companies, and two reinsurance intermediaries operating in the country. This measure to increase the capital requirement was introduced to strengthen insurance companies and ensure liquidity in the insurance market. Considering that insurance penetration in the country is fairly low, the amount of companies servicing the market was far too high, and we now hope to see a smaller but stronger pool of providers that are able to innovate and provide new services to bring the uninsured population into the fold. The legislation has a grace period of two years, which will expire in September 2017, which has given companies time to adjust. The IAZ's mandate is to preserve and foster a favorable climate for the insurance business in the country, which is why we have been pushing for the new Insurance Act since 2012. Currently, insurance business in Zambia is governed by the 1997 Insurance Act, which has now become outdated for the most part. We have, however, received assurances from the Ministry of Finance and the Pensions and Insurance Authority that there will be progress made in enacting a new Insurance Act in 2017. </p><h4>What are the association's goals and strategies for increasing insurance penetration in the country?</h4><p>Over 95% of Zambians do not participate in the insurance market. The IAZ's target is to have at least 6 million Zambians covered by an insurance policy by 2019. For this, we need to rethink our insurance offering: Currently most Zambian citizens are employed in the informal sector, but most products available from insurers are conventional and only speak to people in formal employment. Microinsurance bridges that gap, catering for those with irregular income. We also look at certain positive insurance policies that can be made mandatory, such as compulsory group life insurance schemes for employers with a certain number of staff. Some of our members partner with mobile service providers, which will also help to open the market to the 11 million mobile phone subscribers nationwide. Finally, in more developed markets, insurers are visible and there is a high level of consumer education, but this is not the case in Zambia, we are trying to change that. A Finscope survey from 2015 found that 42% of Zambians had never heard about insurance. Therefore, the IAZ is mobilizing resources to push the agenda of raising awareness. </p><h4>What are the main challenges facing Zambia's insurance market? </h4><p>Aside from necessary changes to legislation, the other challenge is the issue of liquidity. Insurance in Zambia is not provided on a cash-and-carry basis, and by the end of 2015 we had a situation where 52% of premiums were with debtors. This means insurance companies are struggling to pay claims because their money is tied up in debtors, leading to a double setback of high debtors ratio and also stiff competition resulting in undercutting of rates. Prices are being driven down, and we are operating in a soft market with low rates and high-risk profiles. This puts a great deal of strain on companies, with many companies in 2015 not making profits from underwriting. Many managed to scrape through owing to investment income that cushioned their operations. The IAZ is working with the regulator to settle the issue of liquidity and debt management, keep it in line with the industry's growth, and prevent it from potentially stifling the sector. However, we are optimistic that with the new government policy direction of a homegrown economic recovery program and copper prices looking up, these are realistic goals that can be met. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your client portfolio developed in line with shifts in Zambia's macroeconomic landscape?</h4><p>Despite 2016's recession, JMAAC managed to grow by 20%. This can be attributed to the targeting of a new sector of the business community: the marketeer. Typically, classified as an integral part of the informal sector, market traders presented a great opportunity for JMAAC. Countrywide, there are 4 million people who make up this demographic. We launched a product that focuses on empowering marketeers and with this managed to penetrate the segment. To start, we conducted a study on the informal sector and realized that existing business models did not cater to the needs of these individuals. We launched products mostly in Lusaka, since this has the largest concentration of market traders and it is also easy for us to monitor from our head office. Thus far, we have been doing well, with minimal defaults. Sometimes repayments are slow, though they always come in.</p><h4>How did you reach out to this populace?</h4><p>These marketeers belong to both associations and municipality councils where they are able to acquire tenant agreements and operating licenses. To reach out to marketeers, therefore, we went through the Lusaka City Council and the biggest local market in Lusaka, Soweto market, before partnering with the Zambia Marketeers Association, signing a MoU that was beneficial to both parties. We began sharing our data, helping the organization to grow its database in terms of registered members. In total, we set aside ZMK5 million for microfinance lending to marketeers in 2016, part of the first phase of this project. The next step is to roll out this product to other provinces. We did not want to do so before testing the product in Lusaka to iron out any teething problems during the pilot. In fact, we made certain miscalculations the first time around, though we have rectified them, and we now have a better product that secures us and benefits the marketeer. Our first destination will be the North-Western Province, which is where the majority of Zambia's mines are concentrated and makes economic sense. In June 2017, we plan to drop down into the Copper Belt.</p><h4>Are you optimistic regarding macroeconomic factors and the measures being taken to reduce interest rates?</h4><p>We should see some improvement soon. The government has shown a more active stance, determined to fulfill its commitments and generate change, so we remain optimistic. However, the other factors that negatively influence these businesses are high levels of imports; few items are manufactured locally. An import ban would be a great suggestion; however, before we introduce a carpet ban, we need to carefully assess what our current capacity is. A country can only ban imports if it produces locally, so first the government must encourage local production with economic zones and other incentives. Then, it can ban imports, or at least increase taxes on imports.</p><h4>What strategy do you have in place to grow your portfolio over the next five years?</h4><p>2016 was a relatively slow year. While things are picking up, our studies show that for SMEs, obstacles remain in their paths to sustainable growth. Because we understand that the key is ICT, we target ICT companies and suggest collaborations in order to increase accessibility to finance. For example, we work to develop certain applications that will benefit marketeers, SMEs, and civil servants. In response to the government's request for more efficient tollgate fee collection and administration, we are developing an online product for this purpose. Eventually, users will be able to purchase a card from us and use it to pay for tolls. Once we turn away from the old-fashioned methods of traditional banking, small players and big players both stand to benefit from the new innovative business environment. We all seek new ideas, and such innovations will have a long-term, long-lasting impact. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the strategic thinking behind the development of the “Zambia Plus" economic recovery program?</h4><p>Over the last two years, Zambia has endured difficult times. The economy slowed to such an extent that real GDP growth was around 3%, debt levels were growing, and arrears were building. The economy was literally facing strong headwinds. When developing Zambia Plus, the main focus was to allow growth by setting the direction and benchmarks through a homegrown program, and making strategic decisions that would assist a recovery. Zambia Plus is fundamentally a homegrown program, where on the plus side we engage with cooperating partners who supplement our efforts to boost the economy.</p><h4>How has the economy performed since January 2017?</h4><p>Since January there have been some signs of recovery, such as stability in the foreign exchange, inflation dropping, and the easing of liquidity. In January 2017 our tax revenue collection was in excess of ZMK3.4 billion, which was above target, showing that things are beginning to turn. Challenges remain, such as access to liquidity, our profile in terms of the ease of doing business still remains low, and we are still continuing to battle with regard to the fiscal deficit. We are challenged in terms of how we maintain a consistent policy for recovery, particularly going into 2017. We have begun by addressing some of the critical decisions and issues that will unlock the movement and turn the economic wheels.</p><h4>What is the government doing to pay off its accumulated arrears?</h4><p>Since December 2016 we have raised financing of ZMK2 billion, and a big portion of that has gone into liquidating arrears. This is important because it gives life to the private sector to create and sustain jobs, and also creates the capacity for us to be able to collect taxes. Ultimately, clearing arrears is important, and this week, for example, we are paying almost ZMK150 million toward clearing pension arrears, lifting up the lives of our people who have worked so hard and still remain on the streets. In the budget for 2017, we have a provision for ZMK6.8 billion to deal with the arrears.</p><h4>What further revisions to policy are planned for the next year?</h4><p>There are some structural issues that we must attend to, such as the legal reform that is necessary to underpin fiscal consolidation. We are revising the Public Finance Act to ensure fiscal prudence and accountability. We are working on the budget and planning bill, the main objective of which is to assure the integrity of the budget process, participation, and execution. The ZPPA Act will also be amended to address leakages and overpricing in the procurement process. We will only make investments in projects if we can afford them.</p><h4>How is the Ministry planning to negotiate the upcoming support program with the IMF?</h4><p>We are taking ownership and responsibility for the execution of our own economic recovery program. External organizations, including the IMF, as well as the international business world, and the private sector, must feed into this program. In past years there has been criticism of the IMF in that they do not fit into the ideas of countries about how to reform their economies. It is not helpful to have ideas imposed on any economy from the outside. As members of the IMF we are entitled to drive our own economy, whilst accessing the opportunities that are provided to us by membership in entities like the IMF and World Bank. However, in order to address issues in the energy and agriculture sectors we need significant grant monies. To rely on the government budget alone is impossible. We intend to connect Zambia, Kenya, and Tanzania's transmission systems, but the Zambian portion of that would cost USD500 million. The EU has so far committed a grant of EUR40 million to this project, and we do not believe that one should have to walk alone in such projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the recent history of tax reform in Zambia?</h4><p>Zambia undertook major tax reforms in the mid-1990s with the aim of addressing tax policy and administration. These reforms resulted in the establishment of the ZRA, through the 1993 Act of Parliament, as an autonomous body to collect direct taxes (income tax), indirect taxes (excise tax, VAT, property transfer tax), customs, and the mineral royalty tax for the Zambian government in 1994. The mid-1990s also saw major changes in the mining sector tax regime. As part of the privatization process, the government instituted a low tax regime for mining firms. In 2006, ZRA carried out a diagnostic review of tax policy and administration in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to merge the VAT and Direct Taxes Division to form the Domestic Taxes Division (DOMT). In 2013, TaxOnline was launched, in 2014 several taxes such as VAT and Turnover Tax for the informal sector were introduced, and in 2017 a 5% surtax on imports of all locally manufactured products was implemented.</p><h4>How does ZRA work to bring Zambians into the taxed population?</h4><p>There have also been moves to formalize the informal sector through the use of the Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TPIN); all traders are now required to use TPIN for all tax transactions. Taxpayers are also able to register for a TPIN that allows them to access information about their taxes, make queries, and track the status of those queries. Other initiatives that are in place include simplifying the tax system, organizing business functions with a focus on taxpayer type below an agreed income threshold, simplifying business registration procedures and the tax codes applicable, undertaking research aimed at understanding the business climate to inform administration and tax policy formulation to reduce the cost of compliance, increasing taxpayer education and outreach such as the introduction of a call center, and finally, establishing collaborative relationships with other government agencies for the purpose of data sharing to assist tax enforcement.</p><h4>Fiscal tightening is a key part of governmental agenda and the economic recovery program. What will this mean for practice in the coming year?<br></h4><p>The economic recovery program is a laudable program. It is anchored on the principle of not spending what we do not have and not borrowing beyond our ability to repay. The implication of the recovery plan is essentially an implementation of a contractionary fiscal policy, that is, reduced government expenditure coupled with an increased tax take from the economy. For ZRA, this means an increase in its revenue targets as the measure will require increased domestically generated funds to finance government operations. </p><h4>How does ZRA work to tackle the issue of smuggling and tightening import and export duties on the border?</h4><p>In a bid to curb smuggling and illegal imports and exports of goods, ZRA, through the investigation department, has scaled up anti-smuggling activities through its mobile compliance unit. The authority has also enhanced collaborations with neighboring countries in order to undertake joint efforts and sharing of strategic information. </p><h4>What incentives is ZRA implementing to attract foreign business coming to the country?</h4><p>Liaising with the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA), ZRA implements the statutory provisions that allow for tax rebates or exemptions for foreign investors. Beneficiaries of these incentives are required to register with ZRA so that they can start fulfilling tax obligations, among them filing returns and remitting PAYE. From the year 2013, the tax incentive regime has undergone changes with emphasis on rationalizing most of these incentives. Currently, under the Income Tax Act, several incentives accessed through the ZDA are available, most notably, 0% corporate tax on income and 0% withholding tax on the dividends declared by a business enterprise approved by the ZDA and carrying on electricity generation or manufacturing activities in a rural area, multi-facility economic zone, or industrial park for a period of five years starting from the commencement of operations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the Zambia Plus program contribute to Zambia's immediate economic recovery and long-term growth?</h4><p>On November 11, 2016, the Minister of Finance outlined the budgetary policy for 2017. In this speech, he announced the Zambia Plus economic recovery program. Driven by Zambia and Zambians, but supported by the IMF and other cooperating partners, the program is both sound and revolutionary. Zambia is looking inside itself, seeking those domestic resources to develop the economy, improving resource mobilization from within the country. Additionally, higher levels of accountability in public expenditure will encourage private investment in the country. Scaling up government social protection will ensure that any austerity measures taken by the government will not have adverse effects on the poor and vulnerable. All these packages put together will be instrumental for reengineering our economy and moving our country forward on the path to prosperity.</p><h4>How confident are you about the new government's promises to transform a long-standing rhetoric of diversification into policy, action, and results?</h4><p>Economic diversification in Zambia has been on the cards for many years, though we have never really shown ourselves to be truly serious about it. Now, for the first time in the history of our country, we are seeing a more positive effort toward diversifying the economy. On November 26, 2015, the president held a press conference reiterating the drive to move Zambia from a copper mining economy to an agricultural economy. He announced a number of initiatives that have to do with improved agricultural activity, manufacturing, and value addition. Furthermore, in the past, our approach to economic diversification has been as volatile and as unpredictable as copper prices themselves. Each time we have slumps in commodity prices, especially copper, we start talking about the need to diversify the economy. Once the prices come back to higher levels, we forget about it. However, now, with the combined efforts from the government and external investors, we can see that there is more of a long-term and developmental approach. For example, a Zambian delegation has just returned from Israel, a country that is at the global forefront of agricultural development.  </p><h4>What are the main obstacles facing investors?</h4><p>The principal issue facing foreign parties considering investing in Zambia is the issue of policy consistency. When we talk about investors we mean long-term investors, not simply portfolio investors: people looking at agriculture, value addition, forestry, infrastructure, water, and energy. These are the kinds of investors we should seek to attract, since this kind of investment will form a solid foundation for economic growth. Because the gestation periods for these investments are much longer, there needs to be stability in government and government policies. Secondly, we also have to agree on the key sectors we want to drive. The mining industry, for example, has until now been a key focus, though this has not really stimulated growth in other growth sectors. Indeed, the sector still relies heavily on imports, and has not even aided in boosting local manufacturing.</p><h4>What can be done to boost local production in Zambia?</h4><p>The first obstacle to boosting local production is access to financing. Innovation is high; we have many entrepreneurs coming up with radical ideas in terms of value addition and processing. However, for the past few years, access to capital has been highly constrained and basically unavailable. We have only been a liberal economy for about 25 years. In 1991, the economy was 80% in the hands of the public sector. Because of this history, there have been some natural constraints in terms of how the financial sector creates the framework to support entrepreneurship. Our financial community includes 19 financial institutions, of which only one is a development bank. All the other 18 banks only lend money across the table for 12 months, which does not sufficiently allow for investing in value addition or manufacturing. Furthermore, interest rates have been prohibitive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the meetings in Egypt recently regarding the Tripartite FTA (TFTA)?</h4><p>The launch and signing of the TFTA agreement signify an important political milestone toward the establishment and operation of a fully fledged free trade area. It represents free movement of goods and services from the Cape to Cairo, bringing together a market of over 625 million people, living in one of the highest growth areas of the world with a booming middle class in 26 countries and a combined GDP of USD1.3 trillion, about 60% of the African continent's GDP. For Zambia, the TFTA represents a significant market for Zambian goods and services once effectively exploited. Total merchandise exports by TFTA members was USD145 billion and merchandise imports of USD211 billion as of 2014. This is a massive market for our finished and semi-processed goods and gives us the market access to our producers, which are struggling to secure a share in developed markets due to non-tariff barriers. The establishment of the TFTA will undoubtedly boost trade among the participating countries as a result of market expansion and contribute to the African Union Agenda of boosting intra-Africa Trade.</p><h4>What is the status of the 11 bills presented to parliament to consolidate private-sector participation?</h4><p>The 11 bills represent my ministry's aggressive agenda to reform the business environment. The bills relate to strengthening intellectual property rights, trade facilitation, re-engineering of the national quality infrastructure; aligning company law to international best practices and expanding access to finance for micro, small, and medium enterprises. The bills are at different stages in the legislative process. Most of these bills have been approved by the cabinet and are now undergoing legislative drafting.</p><h4>How do you expect international trade to evolve in Zambia in the next five years?</h4><p>The evolution of Zambia's trade in the next five years will be dictated by regional integration. The phase II negotiations under the Tripartite FTA framework and the Continental Free Trade Area negotiations will change the trade arena in Africa. Zambia needs to position herself to capitalize on this expanded market. If we do not position our industry to become a key regional player, we will be faced with high levels of imports into our country, which can lead to the death of local industry. We are confident that our experiences with COMESA and SADC FTA's have made us stronger. At the international level, the Economic Partnership Agreements with the EU and the implementation of the trade facilitation agreement present new challenges we must be prepared for even as we consolidate ourselves as a middle-income country.</p><h4>What are the comparative advantages of Zambia over neighboring countries and why should an investor choose Zambia?</h4><p>Zambia's comparative advantages lie primarily in its abundant resources. It has vast land, 752,614sqkm, with a population of approximately 15 million people, with over 70% of the population below the age of 40. We have vast natural resources in terms of minerals, tourist sites, water, and land for agriculture. The country has had a stable economy with growth averaging 6% over the last decade, stable inflation averaging 7% over the last five years, as well as a stable political and social environment since the country gained independence in 1964. In terms of doing business, we are ranked fifth in Sub Saharan Africa and third among the SADC countries, fourth in COMESA, and eighth in the whole of Africa, pointing to the conduciveness of our business environment over most of our neighbors. We share borders with eight countries, making us land-linked. The country's central location in the region gives it a competitive market. Zambia has no controls on prices, interest rates, or foreign exchange transactions, free repatriation of earnings and repayments, as well as security and guarantees of full and fair compensation for investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do the ministry's initiatives seek to underpin the country's role as a focal point for regional activities?</h4><p>Zambia is landlocked, surrounded by eight countries, and we view these eight countries as an opportunity for us to push our agenda in terms of foreign economic policy. As a strong member of COMESA and SADC, we consider ourselves as having an audience of about 850 million people within these regional groupings, which gives us a platform to be the focal point in the region in terms of foreign diplomacy. We look at a whole range of issues to strengthen our foreign economic policy. We seek to develop our Foreign Service Bureau, which aims to ensure Zambia realizes its priorities in its interactions with the international community. We also want to utilize the Foreign Service Bureau to attract professionals to work in order to adequately and sufficiently represent Zambia's requirements. What is more, Zambia is a member of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, a platform we take full advantage of in order to promote the values of pacifism and diplomacy throughout the African continent and indeed beyond. Our history as a country speaks volumes about our determination to advocate peace. We know that unless the region or the continent is peaceful, it is difficult for Africa to actualize its potential and fully develop, economically speaking.</p><h4>What are the pillars of the government's foreign policy to attract FDI to the country?</h4><p>We give precedence to regional and international cooperation. It is crucial to represent ourselves as a country that is open and conducive for investment in order to attract foreign interest. Peace and stability are a core part of this; we are one of the eight countries in Africa that has never experienced any form of civil strife. However, we also promote our national identity, our wealth of resources, and our people. The good investment planning that has been put forward by the government also speaks to potential investors in all sectors, for example in agriculture. Zambia is ready to receive FDI, and we will continue to open up various avenues to ensure that investment does indeed flow into our country.</p><h4>What were the fruits of the fourth African-Arab Summit held this year in Equatorial Guinea and what do such gatherings mean for Zambia's relationship with the Arab world moving forward?</h4><p>The African-Arab summit was paramount. In the past, Zambia as a country did not take the time to develop the corridor with the Arab world. Now, however, we have truly turned our attentions to opening up mutual relations with the Middle East. At this summit, the action plan for 2017 and 2019 was developed, and this in turn will help channel avenues of investment into Zambia. We have cooperated with the Arab world in the past, though our relationship has always been through bilateral aid, via institutions such as the Saudi Fund, the Kuwait Fund, and the Abu Dhabi Fund. Through these, we have been able to see areas such as agriculture, health, and tourism open up for Zambia. To be more specific, we will receive funding for the Sicomo Collabo Road in Western Zambia, a strategic road that could greatly enhance Zambia's connectivity with the rest of the world. In 2017, there are several meetings planned with our Arab brothers and sisters. I will travel to the Gulf in 2017 on a trip to cement relations between the Arab world and our country.</p><h4>With which other parts of the world is Zambia forging strong ties?</h4><p>We continue to strengthen our relationship with China. The historical ties between the nations go back many years: Zambia has supported and continues to support the One China policy, while China was instrumental in establishing TAZARA, which was a lifeline for the country in terms of imports and exports in the 1970s. Our relations with China were fostered under the umbrella organization the Forum for China and Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). Zambia also enjoys strong ties with many countries, such as the US, Germany, and Japan, and each is a unique relationship. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the upshot of the state visit by President Edgar Lungu to South Africa at the end of 2016?</h4><p>We reviewed a wide range of bilateral, regional, and international issues. We expressed satisfaction at the strong bilateral relations existing between the two countries, founded on longstanding historical, political, economic, and cultural ties. We noted with appreciation the vast nature of the bilateral cooperation, which includes, amongst other areas, trade and investment, energy, agriculture, mining, defense, health, education, correctional services, and transport.</p><h4>Economic relations between the two countries are growing stronger, with Zambia ranking as one of South Africa's top-three export sources in Africa. What can be done to further boost trade figures?</h4><p>In order to increase trade between the two countries, there is a need for regular interaction of business communities from both countries, as well as companies from both countries taking part in various trade and investment-promotion missions. There is also a need to ensure that the agreements signed on economic cooperation between the two countries are fully implemented. Finally, the business sector should be encouraged to take advantage of the South Africa-Zambia Business Council to explore ways to further participate in the economies of the two countries.</p><h4>More than 150 South African countries have set up shop in Zambia. What further measures can be taken to encourage Zambian companies to enter the South African market in a similar fashion?</h4><p>Through the established South Africa-Zambia Business Council, Zambian companies are encouraged to take advantage of South Africa's conducive investment environment, as well as encouraging partnerships or joint ventures.</p><h4>What practical initiatives are being launched to illustrate Zambia and South Africa's mutual commitment to regional integration, particularly in the SADC?</h4><p>The two countries regularly consult with each other on the political and security situation in the region and the continent. Furthermore, South Africa and Zambia have committed themselves to working together in pursuit of sustainable peace and stability in the region. With regards to regional integration, the two countries fully support the implementation of the SADC Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap. Both countries participate in the Tripartite Free Trade Area (TFTA), which demonstrates a strong commitment to strengthening economic regional integration. There are also calls from both countries to pursue the creation of the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) in order to boost intra-Africa trade, and industrial and infrastructure development, ultimately impacting on the lives of our peoples.</p><h4>How are the two countries working together toward achieving peace and political stability across the whole continent?</h4><p>South Africa and Zambia constantly engage each other in particular to share perspectives on peace and security within the continent, and are committed to African unity and the implementation of the AU Agenda 2063 and its Action Plan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the mutual benefits of a partnership between Zambia and the SADC?</h4><p>The SADC is an intergovernmental organization with broad political, security, and social economic objectives. The most obvious benefits of Zambia's participation are in the political and economic areas. Zambia benefits from the security cooperation amongst SADC countries, including the assurance of non-aggression from other member states and mutual assistance in combating cross-border crimes and illicit trade. Regional economic development cooperation also provides Zambia the opportunity to access a wider market for its products and investments in an integrated manner. The integrated market enables producers, traders, and investors to enjoy a tariff-free regime for products that originate from Zambia that comply with the requirements of SADC Free Trade Area. As such, Zambia enjoys an integrated market with the 15 SADC countries that participate in the SADC Free Trade Area, with a combined population of about 294 million. Other benefits include promotion of awareness of a common historical and cultural background with its neighbors; sharing of common political values, for example, through promotion of practices of democracy; and the enhancement of political influence in international forums. </p><h4>What is the importance of regional integration in Africa, and how does the SADC work to secure this?</h4><p>Regional cooperation and integration are important in Africa because of the benefits that member states derive from closer political cooperation and participation in expanded markets. Each country on its own is usually too weak to operate in the uncertain international political and security socio-economic environment. Cooperation in foreign and security policy enhances the influence of weak and fragile countries, when they speak with a collective voice in international political and socioeconomic systems, such as the UN, the EU, WTO, and globally dominant economies. The fragility and dependence of individual economies are reduced when a country participates in the international political and economic systems as part of a larger single-market entity. These are some of the reasons SADC was formed in 1992, with the purpose of promoting common action, to achieve prosperity and well-being of the peoples of southern Africa. </p><h4>What is the significance of the planned SADC, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and East African Community (EAC) free trade area for trade volumes in Zambia?</h4><p>The Tripartite Free Trade Area, comprising COMESA, the EAC, and SADC is significant in that it will create an expanded and integrated market that is bigger than the SADC Free Trade Area. The expanded market will comprise of 26 member states, stretching from Cape Town to Cairo. This will cover a population of about 600 million people and a GDP of USD1.3 trillion. The major expected benefits will derive from provision of continent-wide access to Zambian goods and services, which could stimulate trade, investment, and economic activities across sectors and contribute towards employment, wealth creation, and overall economic development. The tripartite is anchored on three pillars: market integration, industrial development, and infrastructure development. Cooperation in industrialization and infrastructure development from a tripartite context will, therefore, greatly contribute to social economic development, peace and security, political stability, and poverty reduction. </p><h4>What will be the future areas of focus for the SADC-Zambian partnership?</h4><p>The SADC Common Agenda derives from the SADC Treaty. The framework for cooperation and integration have, since the early 2000s, been the Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) and the Strategic Indicative Plan for the Organ on Politics, Defence, and Security Cooperation (SIPO). These present the twin pillars of the regional strategies, which are developmental integration—RISDP—and political and security cooperation—SIPO. The latter facilitates deeper regional integration through the creation of conditions of peace, security, and political stability that are conducive to the attainment of the social economic objectives. The two pillars are considered interdependent and mutually re-enforcing, and the SADC seeks to enhance the complementarity between human development and human security. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your economic platform centers on job creation, industrialization, and capital market development. How do you strike the balance between boosting economic growth and providing support for all Zambian citizens?</h4><p>The PF government has pro-poor policies and, therefore, we are aware of the urgent need to improve the living standards of our people, hence the unwavering commitment to forge an environment in which our people will be able to sustain themselves. We are therefore committed to achieving Vision 2030, which involves Zambia becoming a prosperous middle-income country by implementing programs that will address the poverty that many Zambians are facing. This will entail empowering them with the means to boost their productivity and to create wealth. We are already making efforts to improve the livelihoods of the Zambian people, especially the vulnerable, through various empowerment interventions such as social cash transfer, the farmer input support program, and the food security pack, including the school feeding program for our children. The government wants to see a vibrant economy for all. This is why our national development agenda, which is in line with the 7th National Development Plan, is skewed toward diversifying the economy away from mining to industrialization, agriculture, tourism, and energy, among other sectors. Once we attract investments to these sectors, there will be job creation for our people. As we build multi-facility economic zones across the country, massive investments are expected from both local and foreign investors, who will create thousands of jobs for our people. This has started happening and a classic example is the recently commissioned USD300 million Zambian Breweries Malting Plant in the Lusaka South Multi facility Zone creating jobs not only for small-scale farmer cooperatives but also commercial farmers who will be able to grow barley, which is a vital ingredient for beer brewing. Through the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), a number of companies have started responding positively to our policies of industrialization and job creation.</p><h4>You have outlined your commitment to an approach that is inclusive, integrated, and holistic. What is the importance of synergistic governance, and how will this manifest in your economic policy?</h4><p>Synergistic governance plays a significant role in our efforts to achieve national development. Everyone must rise to the challenge of creating wealth and jobs for our people. This is not only the responsibility of government alone but it calls for the combined efforts of private-sector players. My government has provided a conducive environment to ease the conducting of business. This is of course through an integrated, multi-sectoral approach that promotes synergies across sectors. It is for this reason that my government created the Ministry of Planning and National Development to effectively coordinate various sectors and consolidate linkages among government ministries to effectively and efficiently address developmental challenges collectively.</p><h4>How pivotal is innovation for your envisaged green revolution in Zambia?</h4><p>This simply entails changing the way we do things. Therefore, to achieve a green revolution in Zambia, it is critical to have massive innovation as this is the bedrock of development. You may wish to note that our people, since time immemorial, have used rudimentary tools in their farming activities and this has negatively impacted yields. In this regard, my government is changing the agriculture sector by making it more mechanized. We are focusing on mechanizing the sector to enhance production and this means that our small-scale farmers have to be empowered with agricultural implements and machinery. We will be partnering with the government of India in this regard. In addition, a company from Poland called Ursus has shown interest in setting up a USD100 million assembly plant for agriculture equipment in Zambia.</p><h4>In addition to your introduction of radical legislation that stipulates all government officials must engage in at least one agro-based activity, how else does your government propose fostering agricultural innovation in Zambia?</h4><p>There is a need for us to exploit seed varieties other than the white maize seed that our people have grown accustomed. You may also wish to note that we have already started implementing this. However, our diversification program with emphasis on agriculture requires us to enhance R&amp;D to exploit other seed varieties. In addition, our country has, for a very long time, depended on rain for farming activities, but we are now taking a shift to promote irrigation and our target is to bring 5,000ha of land under irrigation annually. The Ministry of Agriculture through the Irrigation Development Support Programme has since started developing irrigation schemes across the country. Besides, we are changing the way our farmers perceive farming. We want them to begin to treat it as a lucrative business, hence under the Second National Agricultural Policy (SNAP), the main thrust of which is increased production and productivity, we are promoting commercialization of agriculture among various other measures. Most importantly we need a massive injection of funds into the sector and to make credit facilities easily accessible to farmers.</p><h4>With increased global awareness of the importance of conscientious tourism, how do you plan to marry the momentous boosting of Zambia's status as a tourism hub in Africa with protecting the environment and mitigating the effects of climate change?</h4><p>My government recognizes the importance of conscientious tourism, particularly as this relates to balancing between increasing its gains from tourism development and protecting the environment and mitigating the effects of climate change. As articulated in the Ministry of Tourism and Arts 2015 National Tourism Policy, the ministry is guided by the principles of sustainable development as it plans and develops tourism. To actualize these principles, my government, through the ministry, will continue to apply the strategies of low volume, high-quality tourism products in all pristine and ecologically sensitive areas including planned and controlled mass tourism developments with potential to accommodate this kind of use. The ministry values synergies, hence its focus on multi-stakeholder approaches to ensure that all social, economic, and environmental concerns are carefully captured and incorporated in plans before implementation and, where relevant, mitigation measures are devised, adopted, and implemented. Currently, the ministry is crafting the National Tourism Development Master Plan (NTDMP), as provided for in the policy, which will be used as the overall development guide once completed. The first phase of the NTDMP focuses on generating destination plans for specified areas with tourism development potential and this process will be rolled out to other areas across the country. In addition, the ministry is collaborating with cooperating partners at bilateral and multilateral levels on development initiatives aimed at conserving and sustaining trans-boundary ecosystems using tourism as an economic driver, such as the Kavongo-Zambezi (KAZA) Trans-frontier Conservation Area (TFCA) and the Malawi-Zambia TFCA. The Zambian government through the ministry has also signed agreements with the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) for the protection, conservation, and management of World heritage sites such as the global wonder, the Victoria Falls. My government will continue to encourage key stakeholders in the tourism industry, especially the private sector, to switch from practices that generate adverse impacts on the environment to sustainable development practices such as the use of clean renewable energy (i.e. creating eco-lodges and hotels that will increasingly adopt and use solar powered lighting and cooking, solar motorcars for movement of clients on their premises), encouraging environmentally sound waste management, constructing appropriate paved or raised walkways or platforms to protect environmentally sensitive areas from negative impacts, purchasing organically produced vegetables and fruit from local farmers, and many more practices.</p><h4>How will your efforts to eliminate corruption and your zero-tolerance stance forge the way for a more transparent and unified Zambia, and what will be the consequences of this?</h4><p>I would like to state from the outset that corruption impedes any form of national development. If left unchecked, corruption can leave permanent scars that can be difficult to address. No country can achieve meaningful socio-economic and political development if its moral fabric is compromised. This vice must therefore be fought holistically, which means tackling related crimes such as bribery, money laundering, and drug trafficking, which siphons the country's collective wealth into individual pockets, thus depriving the Zambian people of quality education, health, infrastructure, and other vital basic needs. In order to be successful in this fight, concerted efforts must be employed and the fight against graft must be made at individual, community, and national levels. This fight is an onerous task that calls for concerted efforts. With the right attitude and unquestionable commitment, it is attainable. The fight against corruption is important to the promotion of good governance and integrity. To forge a more transparent and unified Zambia we need to promote a culture of maximum restraint anchored on national values and principles that are stipulated in the Constitution of Zambia. These principles and values include morality and ethics, patriotism, and national unity, including good governance and integrity. There is also urgent need for us to strengthen the Public Service Code of Ethics to address impropriety among our public service employees. This code of ethics espouses among other values honesty, excellence, integrity, accountability, loyalty, and selflessness. Similarly, it is imperative for the private sector to enhance corporate governance to govern the professional conduct of the corporate world. In case there are private sector organizations that do not currently subscribe to any code of ethics, it is imperative that they develop one and institutionalize it. As we fight corruption, it should be in our minds that “charity begins at home." If we are to win this fight, parents, guardians, teachers, the media, and traditional leaders including politicians must be involved in inculcating the principles of good morals and ethics among our children and youth by closely nurturing and monitoring their activities. This will result in us grooming responsible young women and men who will be able to manage the affairs of the nation with honesty, integrity, and respect inter alia. As a Christian nation, the church equally has a big role to play in ensuring that all of us move within the confines of the Christian values that we profess. Furthermore, my government's desire to embrace technology through the introduction of e-governance is also anticipated to give us results in our fight against corruption. With information, communication, and technology, the provision of services in public institutions will be automated, thereby minimizing corrupt activities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Zambia contributed to the African Union over the years?</h4><p>Zambia, through Dr Kenneth David Kaunda, was one of the founding members of the OAU in 1963. The OAU's main agenda was to attain independence for the whole of Africa from colonial rule. Zambia became a leading country in the liberation struggle of the southern African states: Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. With almost the entire African continent liberated, Zambia has continued to champion peace for the continent. Zambia was elected to the African Union Peace and Security Council (PSC) in 2016 for a three-year term and since then it has used the seat on the council as a strong advocate for peace and security on the continent. In 2016, Zambia hosted the PSC in Lusaka, where the Roadmap on Practical Steps to Silence Guns in Africa by 2020 was drawn up. It has also taken part in missions of peace-building in coordination with the UN and EU to discuss resolution of conflicts in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Libya, Mali, Burundi, and South Sudan. </p><h4>Following your championing of women as peacemakers, what initiatives have been launched by the AU to harness female potential across Africa?</h4><p>There can be no sustainable and lasting peace without the active involvement of women. Participation of women in conflict prevention, peacekeeping, and peace building is extremely important and cannot be overemphasized if we are to ensure success in Africa's peace-making efforts. However, female representation in peacekeeping and in protecting lives in challenging security environments is too low for comfort. Some initiatives have been launched by the African Union to empower women and involve them in peace-making. In 2004, the Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality in Africa adopted by heads of state and governments called on the need to ensure the full and effective participation and representation of women in peace processes, including the prevention and management of conflict and post conflict reconstruction in Africa and to appoint women as special envoys and special representatives of the African Union. </p><h4>How can collaboration between the AU and Zambia help tackle the challenges facing Zambia currently?</h4><p>The government of the Republic of Zambia under the directive of HE President Lungu successfully ratified and deposited a number of OAU/AU treaties from the time he took office as President in January 2015 to date. These include the following instruments that were ratified and deposited at the African Union Commission: The General Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the OAU; The African Charter on the Values and Principles of Public Service and Administration; the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Older Persons; the Protocol on the Establishment of the African Monetary Fund (AMF); and the African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection, among others. </p><h4>What areas will the AU-Zambia partnership focus on in the future?</h4><p>Zambia and the African Union have enjoyed a strong relationship since the early 1960s. Zambia is a founder member of the OAU and now the AU and is committed and consistent to the ideals of Pan Africanism. In 2001, Zambia hosted, in Lusaka, the historic Summit of Heads of State and Government, which led to the transformation of the OAU into the AU. Projects of focus that Zambia is involved in include the Integrated High Speed Train Network (IHSTN), which intends to connect all African capitals and commercial centers through an African High-Speed Train in order to: facilitate the movement of goods, services, and people, reduce transport costs, and relieve the congestion of current and future systems; hosting the Africa Centre for Disease Control (Africa CDC) in Ndola; the Economic Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC), whose headquarters are to be constructed in Lusaka; and finally hosting the AU Summit in 2022. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Far too often, the world views Africa through the prism of problems. When I look to Africa, I see a continent of hope, promise, and vast potential. I am committed to building on those strengths and establishing a higher platform of cooperation between the UN and the leaders and people of Africa. This is essential to advancing inclusive and sustainable development and deepening cooperation for peace and security.</p><p>That is the message I carried to the recent African Union Summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia—my first major mission as United Nations Secretary General. Above all, I came in a spirit of profound solidarity and respect. I am convinced that the world has much to gain from African wisdom, ideas, and solutions.</p><p>I also brought with me a deep sense of gratitude. Africa provides the majority of United Nations peacekeepers around the world. African nations are among the world's largest and most generous hosts of refugees. Africa includes some of the world's fastest-growing economies. We have the plans in place to build a better future. The international community has entered the second year of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, an all-out effort to tackle global poverty, inequality, instability and injustice. Africa has adopted its own complementary and ambitious plan: Agenda 2063.</p><p>For the people of Africa to fully benefit from these important efforts, these two agendas need to be strategically aligned. It starts with prevention. Our world needs to move from managing crises to preventing them in the first place. We need to break the cycle of responding too late and too little. Most of today's conflicts are internal, triggered by competition for power and resources, inequality, marginalization, and sectarian divides. Often, they are inflamed by violent extremism or provide the fuel for it.</p><p>The UN is committed to working hand in hand with partners wherever conflict or the threat of conflict endangers stability and well-being. But prevention goes far beyond focusing solely on conflict. The best means of prevention and the surest path to durable peace is inclusive and sustainable development.</p><p>We can speed progress by doing more to provide opportunities and hope to young people. More than three out of five Africans are under 35 years of age. Making the most of this tremendous asset means more investment in education, training, decent work, and engaging young people in shaping their future.</p><p>I travelled to Africa as a partner, friend, and committed advocate for changing the narrative about this diverse and vital continent. Crises represent at best a partial view. But from a higher platform of cooperation, we can see the whole picture—one that spotlights the enormous potential and remarkable success stories in every corner of the African continent.</p><p>With that perspective, I have no doubt we can win the battle for sustainable and inclusive development which are also the best weapons to prevent conflict and suffering, allowing Africa to shine even more vibrantly and inspire the world. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There have been longstanding close relations between Zambia and the countries of the former Yugoslavia. In what ways has the fruitful relationship between the two countries developed over time?</h4><p>Yugoslavia and Zambia have cemented a close relationship over time. Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to promote friendship with Zambia after establishing our diplomatic relations in 1995. However, between BH and Zambia, as with most African countries south of the Sahara, there has never been an exchange of official bilateral visits. In spite of this, officials from both countries have met before, most frequently on the margins of international conferences, and contacts between diplomatic representatives of the two countries have been exchanged elsewhere in the world. However, I am convinced that mutual cooperation would be highly beneficial to both parties, and am optimistic regarding the future. With boosted interest from both sides, the relations of the two countries will enter a new chapter.</p><h4>What measures can be taken by both governments to boost levels of trade and economic activity?</h4><p>Currently, there is limited trade between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Zambia and little mutual investment registered regarding initiatives in the economic field. We know Zambia is developing rapidly and has become one of the biggest construction sites in Africa. During the Yugoslavian period many companies from Bosnia and Herzegovina worked in Zambia, including Energoinvest. Today, Zambia needs researchers, experts, and operative workers in the mining industry to undertake operations like open pits and mining extracting. In this regard, it makes sense for us to strengthen ties in this area, since Bosnia and Herzegovina has many workers and experts of that kind. We would gladly cooperate between mining institutes and faculties. </p><h4>Bosnia and Herzegovina is enjoying stability after a period of conflict. Since Zambia is often seen as a haven of stability in the Sub-Saharan region, what political and ideological overlap exists between the two nations, and how is this reflected in the two countries' collaboration efforts?</h4><p>The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina ended nearly 22 years ago. Despite numerous tensions in the region that inevitably resurge from time to time, I am optimistic when it comes to the future. Two decades have passed since the war and we have achieved stability and security, even in the face of adversity, given that Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country with an extremely complicated internal structure, different nations and religions, and numerous domestic differences. There is a true consent within Bosnia and Herzegovina that our place, as well as the entire region, is in the EU. At times, it has seemed difficult to live in the Balkans and in Bosnia and Herzegovina; however, much can be learned from the people of our country and the way in which they have fought for national harmony. I believe that with Zambia experiencing similar peace and stability, even with a complex internal social structure, there is much that can be shared in these experiences. </p><h4>Tourism and cultural exchange have been pinpointed as areas of interest for the two countries. What initiatives in particular will be launched to support this venture?</h4><p>Both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Zambia have emphasized in their diplomatic correspondence the interest for cooperation at all levels, although so far concrete initiatives and implementation have not come to fruition. Mainly regional concerns were to blame for this. With Zambia as well as other sub-Saharan countries, except in rare instances, Bosnia and Herzegovina has failed to establish intensive cooperation, in spite of the friendly relations that have dated back to the time of Yugoslavia. We have a great deal to offer when it comes to culture and tourism. We are fortunate that our culture and arts are well developed, despite the comparative lack of financial allocation in this area. Many of our artists and cultural workers have won numerous awards and achieved global acclaim. We are nestled in the heart of the Balkans: blessed with spectacular mountains, valleys, lakes, and even a small coastline. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sydney-popota-ceo-real-estate-investments-zambia-reiz]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your key areas of priority since taking over as CEO in 2015?</h4><p>Since 2015, there have been several developments at REIZ but I had three main priorities. Firstly, I placed emphasis on efficiency, right down to the service we offer our tenants. Prior to 2015, we outsourced the function of property management from another company. Now, we do this in-house, meaning we can swiftly deal with issues affecting our tenants and our properties generally. This also tied in with our second focus: costs. With partner property managers, we paid a fee for rental collection, property letting commission, and markup for payments on labor whenever they completed repairs to our properties. By doing this in-house, we were able to reduce our outgoing costs by almost 33%. Finally, I sought to develop our property portfolio again. Since listing on the Lusaka Securities Exchange (“LuSE“) in 1996, REIZ had consistently been adding new properties to its range; however, since 2012 we have not added any new property to our portfolio, which means our market share has been shrinking in view of recent properties that have been released on the market. In order to reclaim this share, we will implement a five-year strategic plan for 2017-2021 which outlines our proposal to grow from 43,000sqm currently to 100,000sqm. While many developers develop properties hoping tenants will occupy on completion, we differ from others in that we will not break ground without having 60% tenant occupancy signed up from drawings.</p><h4>How has the company performed over the past few years?</h4><p>Since 2015, REIZ has seen great success: high turnaround on profits, making dividends to shareholders, and a static share price—except from a small slump at the end of 2015 from ZMK3.98 to around ZMK3.40. The share price has rallied in 2016 to close the year at ZMK5.50 per share with further increase recorded in 2017 to the current price of K6.00 per share. On the property management portfolio, it is still the same as it was in 2014 not having added any more properties. Our team has worked hard to reduce vacancies. In 2016, for instance, in one of our centers alone the vacancy rate had risen to 20% but was reduced to 6% within a short time. In 2015, we conducted a market survey to investigate two things: the tenant mix and the rental rates in our competitors' malls. We discovered that our Arcades Shopping Center in Zambia has the least number of national offerings and more local tenants. We also discovered that our rentals were below market average. We engaged our tenants and carried out rental uplift effective October 1, 2015. Although we increased rental rates up to 20%, we retained all our tenants, because even after this uplift, our rental rates remain below market average.</p><h4>How do you evaluate your tenant mix, and how is this tailored to suit the demand of your properties?</h4><p>In terms of tenant mix, it is crucial to get the right balance. In retail, we want our tenants to fit the center. People do not come to a mall to see what they can find: their visit to a mall is targeted. We only have one shopping mall in our portfolio at the moment, Arcades Shopping Center. In the retail sector in general, while we see more international brands come in as franchises, we also see greater participation by the corporates themselves as franchises are phased out. We are in the process of having direct links with the key decision-makers of the brands arriving in Zambia to see how we can continue to collaborate. Our low rental rates allow us to achieve and maintain a tenant mix that is sustainable. On the commercial side of things, our tenant mix comes in two parts: the big box takers, with larger spaces for a longer period of time and at a lower rate, and the smaller customer. It is ideal to have a balance between blue-chip tenants and small-time retailers. What is more, we have a healthy variety of local homegrown Zambian and international brands.</p><h4>What specific expansions and development will the five-year plan entail?</h4><p>Firstly, within Lusaka, we want to expand the Arcades Shopping Mall from 19,000sqm to nearly 30,000sqm, adding 10,000sqm in two phases. Phase I, a total of 4,500sqm, is in the process currently, and a further 5,500sqm will be added two years down the line. Outside of Lusaka, we seek to open in up-and-coming provincial towns, such as Choma in the southern province. Indeed, we will close some opportunities there soon. We also look at border towns as we see great potential there. And finally, Solwezi is the new Copperbelt, so again, we will focus our attention there. However, in this market it is crucial to find gaps. For example, in Solwezi we will avoid retail as the mall market there is already saturated. Instead, we plan to build offices, and residential and industrial properties. In Lusaka, there are a number of warehousing facilities; however, most of these are not up to international standards. Many foreign brands are reluctant to invest for that reason. REIZ wants to pioneer high-quality commercial facilities in many regions of the country. We are pleased with government's drive to improve the road network, which will open much of the country to new development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Saudi citizens training for technical and vocational work]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[he-dr-ahmed-bin-fahad-al-fahaid-governor-tvtc]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Vision 2030 has vocational training as one of its key goals. How does TVTC promote that through partnerships with the private sector?</h4><p>We are expanding our technical education and skills development in Saudi Arabia at a rapid pace. This requires good teachers and trainers with industrial experience, which we currently have in limited Saudi numbers in the Kingdom. We have created a company called Colleges of Excellence, and through this company we operate newly established colleges through international training providers. All of our international partners meet certain criteria that we have developed. They operate the college, prepare the students for the labor market, and help them to become employed. We pay the operators based on performance, while their costs are covered, which is advantageous for both parties. We pay per student but we also maintain an additional payment for graduation rates and students' employment. That means the operators must study what the labor market needs. We currently have 33 colleges operating on a similar basis, in partnership with operators from the UK, Canada, US, Australia, and New Zealand. From the US we have Laureate, which operates many colleges in different cities. We are still expanding in this operational model.</p><h4>Do you partner with specific firms or industries in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We have started strategic partnerships institutes whereby we work closely with local or international companies which work in Saudi Arabia, to prepare customized training for them. One example is Almarai, which is a very big company here. We have a strategic partnership institute with them whereby the company interviews the student — their future employees — and signs a contract with them. Then we start training based on the company's needs, and the company receives trained staff at the end. This means there will be no waste, as all training of this type starts and ends with employment. This is a win for the students, a win for the company, a win for us, and a win for the broader economy. The students in the partnership school get a monthly allowance higher than they would get at university. We currently have 24 colleges such as this one with companies like SABIC and Aramco. With Saudi Arabian Railway we have a college called SRB, and in this institute all the students are already employed by SAR. Under our Saudi vision 2030 and current National Transformation Program (NTP) we will increase the number of strategic partnership institutes to 35. We have targets every year and hopefully we will not only meet this target but exceed it.</p><h4>What is your target for annual graduate increases?</h4><p>Currently we have about 10% of the high school graduates, both male and female, coming to technical and vocational training. The government wants to have an average of 40% graduating from technical and vocational programs. The increase will be huge, not only with the incoming percentage, but also because we give diplomas and then bachelors, so turnover is high and we will need a greater number of students to achieve the 40%. The expansion will be huge, but we will not expand at the expense of quality. We will always focus on quality by ensuring we bring in an international provider to help give the training.</p><h4>How are you working to retrain government employees to use new technologies?</h4><p>We have two entities. In the kingdom, we have Institute of Public Administration, which covers all the administration development areas for our public staff. We at TVTC, provide needed technical and vocational skills development through customized training for all public and private sectors in the kingdom. We have a presence in all areas of the government in Saudi Arabia, and train both male and female students, although we still lack the amount of female participation we would like. Our training is demand driven, and we provide our students with offerings not only to attract them,but to help them work later. Some specializations that seem attractive, but have no jobs in the labor market, are not areas we will pursue. We are flexible enough to provide different training for different entities and we have the capabilities to do so. Sometimes we will provide training in the evenings if this fits in with requests. Also, we have created an entity called Riyada Entrepreneurship, with 39 branches across the Kingdom giving entrepreneur training. We now have more than 7,500 entrepreneurs across the country working in that field.</p><h4>What are your key goals for 2017?</h4><p>We need to expand and attract students. We need to compete to provide very good, high-quality training so that aviation, railway, and other industries are attracted. Last year we had a more than 30% increase in the number of students we serve, but we are not satisfied with this and want to have more. We are looking for any other opportunities to expand, although this must always be demand driven. One avenue we are pursuing is the fact that Saudi Arabia is now attracting some industrial companies within the auto sector. We have specialized automotive institutes. We have extensive experience with all kinds of models, so have already proposed training to match the auto sector and are ready whenever there is an opportunity. We are similarly ready in many other fields, such as maritime, for example. In addition to expansion, we are also seeking quality and international accreditation, which is very important for our colleges, and we continuously need to retrain our trainers, as technology is changing very fast. If the trainer does not know the technology they will not be able to train students in the most current areas. Mobile technology, for example, is changing fast and we have worked to ensure we maintain very capable trainers. When the government created the policy to make the mobile service only for Saudis, TVTC trained more than 50,000 men and women. We have collaborations with Huawei and Samsung, evidence that we are collaborating with the key players. We will always look to the labor market needs, maintain high quality programs, attract more investors to come to us, and collaborate with other entities whether those are in government — such as labor, job creation, and SME — or also with the private sector, a critical partner in our work. More than 50% of TVTC Board of Directors are from the private sector. Although we are public sector, we operate as this is the only way we can ensure that we exceed the minimum requirements of the labor market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Citizenship applications possible for Lebanese diaspora]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[gebran-bassil-minister-foreign-affairs-emigrants]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the most significant foreign policy achievements of the past year?</h4><p>Our foreign policy is dominated by the diaspora. It is truly influential in the formulation and shaping of our foreign policy regarding politics and economy. We are a small country that prioritizes preserving its modernity and entity as one country, united in how we are diversified. What we seek from our foreign policy is security and stability in the country. Our main messenger here is our diaspora, since it reflects the great image of Lebanon. We have been successful in terms of our performance and the progress we have made in gathering the diaspora together and making it more effective. We want to connect it with Lebanon and connect Lebanon with the world.</p><h4>Lebanon hosted the Lebanese Diaspora Energy Conference to motivate its diaspora to stay connected, encourage citizenship applications and voting, and invest in the country. How would you evaluate the results of the conference?</h4><p>The conference was successful; around 2,000 people participated from 100 countries. We launched many projects connecting them with Lebanon, setting up programs of Lebanese Diaspora Fund by Lebanese for investing in Lebanese resources. This is only in Lebanon to restore the identity and nationality of Lebanese people. This is why we granted, for the first time, citizenship to Lebanese descendants. It was not possible before; however, we have passed a law. This helps to solidify our identity and help people return to their roots when we are currently faced with a wave of displaced Syrians who have replaced the Lebanese. It is crucial for us to bring people back to Lebanon.</p><h4>What initiatives has the ministry taken or planned to take to build bridges between expats and their homeland?</h4><p>We have continuous initiatives; among them, for example, the restoration of citizenship. It is something that is ongoing and there are now people applying for citizenship from Latin America, Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and North America. There are powerful people, including politicians, ministers, businessmen, academics, and famous people, seeking citizenship. The idea that they can come to Lebanon without speaking Arabic, owning land or a house, and seeking citizenship or inquiring about how they can invest in or tour around Lebanon is how we can bring people back. We are talking about 14 million Lebanese compared to 4 million here—this is how large the diaspora is. For example, the Speaker of the House in Brazil participated along with 16 MPs of Lebanese origin in Brazil. These are people with success stories in start-ups, industry, commerce, fashion, and medicine. There are people who invested medical machines or found cures for diseases. There are people from all across the industry spectrum, people involved with electronics and robotics, even a handmade carmaker. There is a Lebanese individual who has produced 60 luxury cars. We are setting up diaspora houses to host and receive them. While some of them do not speak the language, and might be Portuguese or Spanish, they still have a common identity. This is what brings them back to the land, which we need to make more prosperous and stable within a turbulent region.</p><h4>Prime Minister Saad Hariri warned that Lebanon had reached a “breaking point“ caused by refugees. What role is the international community taking in this regard?</h4><p>Unfortunately, I do not see the international community contributing in this regard. The only thing we can request is assistance in encouraging Syrians to return to Syria. This is the best thing for them and for us, for the security and stability of Lebanon. We do not want a Lebanon that is falling apart, after what we saw in Syria. To date we see a change and a shift in thinking, though there are no tangible initiatives.</p><h4>What sectors are the most promising for foreign investment over the medium term, and what do you expect for 2017 in terms of inflows?</h4><p>Energy is a promising sector, as is everything that is related, such as oil and gas. We will hold bidding in September for the first in Lebanon. Electricity and water are other important sectors, as are IT and tourism. These all require infrastructure, which is another important sector for investment. Any expectations for investment influx in 2017 will largely depend on the events in the region, as well as stability in Lebanon. If summer 2017 remains uneventful, then I expect a large inflow and a major improvement.</p><h4>What are your priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our first priority remains the diaspora. We want to focus on bringing them back to Lebanon and granting them citizenship. It is also important to complete the many projects that are being implemented related to them. We want to win the fight against terrorism and 2018 is a reasonable year for this to be achieved, at least in Syria. We also want to see, with the new administrations and governments in Europe, a real move towards stabilization of the region. We need to get back on track to living together instead of fighting one other. This trend of Sunnis and Shias, as well as Muslims and Christians, fighting cannot be restricted to the region; it will only contaminate other areas and will be extremely dangerous. I see a comprehensive international effort to truly bring things in the region back to normality, diversity, and acceptance of one other. The eradication of borders and communities needs to stop.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mostafa-beheshti-rouy-member-of-the-board-pasargad-bank]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which banking segments, do you see the potential to grow your market share?</h4><p>We are trying to change our operating model to become a fee-based bank by providing advisory and consultancy services to our clients, both corporate and individual. We particularly want to concentrate on asset and fund management, because now that Iranian entities can operate outside the country, there are many clients who want to hold their assets in a mix of currencies. We are working on business models for fee-based services for our clients. Besides that, we are concentrating on digital banking and IT. Pasargad Bank has been a pioneer in developing virtual banking in Iran and we are continuing to build on that. We are developing new applications, for example related to the Internet of Things (IoT), such as operating all your banking through your Apple Watch. We are a technology-driven bank and are trying to use the best technology available in order to provide good quality services to our clients.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the re-entry of Iranian banks to the global financial arena, and what can you say to domestic and foreign companies that are worried about the remaining difficulties in payments?</h4><p>Since the signing of the JCPOA and its implementation in January 2016, Iranian banks have had positive experiences in establishing new correspondent banking relationships. Still, the big banks are not coming back to Iran. The reason for this is that some of those banks have been fined by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and have paid huge penalties. They have signed settlement agreements with OFAC and are scared of incurring new kinds of penalties, even though all the banking operations that are happening with Iran right now are fully legitimate and no longer under sanctions. One of the other major issues for overseas banks is the cost of compliance, which has created some hesitancy. Pasargad Bank has been able to establish around 60 new correspondent bank relationships since the signing of the JCPOA. We are dealing with trade finance transactions and opening letters of credit for our clients all around the world with the exception of North America. Pasargad Bank also has a strict compliance policy and sanctions screening process that has been in place for seven years. We have a compliance sheet for every foreign transaction, to ensure it is completely legitimate, there is nothing wrong with the buyer or seller, and the goods are not dual use commodities. We also open letters of credit under the ICC Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600) and all the information and documentation is provided to the advising and negotiating banks. We have seen a lot of developments since the signing of the JCPOA and we expect to see more, including larger banks with a higher capacity coming to the Iranian market. Probably the issues that remain, which are outside the control of the commercial banks, are those that need to be decided upon by entities such as the Central Bank of Iran (CBI). Iran is on the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) Grey List and we would like to see the country coming off that and getting onto the White List. This would help us to upgrade our relationships with our correspondent banks worldwide.</p><h4>How do you see Pasargad's Bank capital adequacy ratio and balance sheet?</h4><p>Our capital adequacy ratio at YE March 2017 is higher than the minimum recommended by Basel III. Furthermore, Pasargad Bank was one of the first banks to issue its accounts based on IFRS and we did this within the required time frame under Iranian law. The Iranian regulations state that every company should hold their General Assembly within four months of the end of the fiscal year. Only Pasargad Bank and one other bank were able to hold their General Assembly and report under IFRS within this prescribed time frame. The reason for this is that since its establishment Pasargad Bank has had an ambitious goal to be the first Iranian bank listed in the Fortune 500. We established our standards and internal processes in such a way that when the sanctions were removed, we were already ahead in terms of our compliance and practices, and in line with international standards. Even though we have been reporting according to Iranian financial standards, we have been preparing our accounts based on IFRS as well.</p><h4>How is Pasargad Bank working on its ambition of becoming a global bank?</h4><p>If we want to be listed in the Fortune 500, we cannot focus only on domestic banking. Even all Iranian banks put together are not big enough for this, so we know we have to become a global bank. We would like to have an international network in the form of branches and fully or partially owned subsidiaries. Our network could be in the form of a green project started from scratch or by acquisition and expansion of existing small banks in other countries. The most natural markets for acquisitions are the ones that have strong business ties and trade relationships with Iran, such as Turkey, India, and China. However, traditionally all international networks of Iranian banks have concentrated on trade finance activities and we want to go beyond this with our expansion. We want to change the whole environment and become active in the local markets in these countries as well. One of the pillars of our globalization strategy is having an international presence. The second element is we would like to open the ownership of Pasargad Bank to foreign investors and overseas banks. According to Iranian law, foreign interests can have up to a 40% share in an Iranian bank. This is something we would like to see happening in the future. The third pillar of our globalization strategy is for Pasargad Bank to be listed on one of the reputable stock exchanges outside Iran, in Europe or Southeast Asia. We know we have to wait for all the sanctions to be lifted and for the market sentiment to turn. We need two or three more years to start implementing our global vision.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[antonio-costa-prime-minister-republic-portugal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Portugal holds strong economic and cultural ties with Qatar. What is your assessment of the historic relationship between the two countries?</h4><p>Our political and diplomatic relations have traditionally been good. A few years ago, the diplomatic relations between the two countries were upgraded by the reciprocal opening of the respective embassies in both capitals. But there is still room for improvement, at the economic and cultural levels, for instance. Our aim is to keep reinforcing these relations, and I believe this is a common goal. My visit and the visit of His Highness the Emir of Qatar to Portugal in July will certainly contribute to reinforcing our bilateral ties, and I am certain other positive impacts will result from the launching of direct flights between our capitals, which Qatar Airways has announced.</p><h4>As both sides expressed their willingness to boost trade, what are the potential areas of cooperation to be explored between Portugal and Qatar?</h4><p>In the economic area, the biggest potential for improvement lies in trade and investment. Portugal's economy is very open, our conditions to attract foreign investment are competitive, and we not only offer a market of 10 million people, but also access to the largest market in the world, the European Union. Furthermore, we are ready to cooperate with Qatar in regions such as Brazil and the Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa, with which we have long historic ties and where we have a consolidated economic presence and deep knowledge.</p><h4>Portugal almost doubled the value of its exports to Qatar in the first half of 2016 compared to the same period last year. What opportunities do you foresee for Portuguese companies in Qatar?</h4><p>In 2016, bilateral trade was only USD46 million, which represented an increase of about 15% compared to 2015. Portuguese exports of goods to Qatar increased 61% in 2016 and are increasing almost 31% in the first three months of 2017. This reveals the interest of Portuguese companies in this market. In 2015, almost 250 Portuguese companies exported to Qatar. Therefore, we see a great deal of opportunities in Qatar.</p><h4>Qatar has earmarked Europe as one of the main destinations for its investments overseas. What makes Portugal a good opportunity for Qatari investors and what sectors are ripe for investment?</h4><p>In fact, in spite of a good political relationship, the economic relations between the two countries are almost incipient. We have in place a set of institutional agreements that provide the framework for private companies to do business. But we need to stimulate them, as there are many mutually beneficial opportunities to explore. Qatar may take advantage of the Portuguese experience in areas in which Portugal has made large investments in the recent past, such as renewable energies, construction, infrastructures, health, and environmental industries related to water, sewage, and garbage collection. Qatari investors have important stakes in EDP and Vinci Portugal and there is a recent case of an important Qatari investment in the Portuguese touristic sector. Besides tourism, many opportunities exist for instance in real estate investment and urban renewal and development. Qatar may also find it interesting to consider Portugal as a platform to address markets in Europe, Latin America, or Africa. There is definitely room for many mutually beneficial partnerships between Portuguese and Qatari companies to explore business opportunities that contribute to diversify the Qatari economy. The Portuguese government is also keen to help in that effort by exchanging experiences with Qatari authorities in areas such as start-up policy, public administration modernization or innovation policy. Lisbon has hosted last year and will host in the coming years the Web Summit, Europe's largest tech event. We expect more than 60,000 participants in November, hopefully also from Qatar.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Qatar's regional and international role in the coming years?</h4><p>Qatar has played an important role in the development and stabilization of the Gulf and the entire region. We are certain that role will continue and that Qatar will reinforce its important role worldwide.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Global Perspective]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-global-perspective]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you describe the evolution of Lombardi Aguilar Group?</h4><p>My partner Jorge Lombardi and I founded the law firm in 2006. We decided to set it up as a result of the investment boom in Panama at the beginning of 2000. There was a demand from foreign clients for more specific and bespoken advice when they entered Panama as direct investors. Usually, major law firms assisted with the formation of investment vehicles; however, there was a demand from clients for more specific advice when entering Panama. Sourcing talent is competitive in our field of work. Unfortunately, there is a lack of training programs for paralegal and law office management here in Panama. This is a market that private educational programs could capitalize on and benefit from the growth of the sector in order to make it more competitive compared to some of our rivals in the Caribbean and Europe. About 95% of our clients are from abroad. Around 20% of our clients are from the US and Canada. Another 30-40% are from Europe, the Middle East and the CIS, while the rest are from Latin America, specifically Venezuela and Central America. The services that are most frequently in demand are the formations of a corporate structure or deciding to set up a branch in Panama. Those are then followed by assistance in contracts for real estate, labor, as well as taxation issues.</p><h4>How do you position Lombardi Aguilar Group as a key asset for international investors?</h4><p>Unlike most local law firms, the founders of Lombardi Aguilar Group have an immigrant background. We are always aware of the perspective of the foreigner and try to find the best from Panama. We help clients avoid the pitfalls that have discouraged others. I am of Chinese descent on my mother's side while my partner is of Italian descent and we also belong to an international network of law firms that originally started in the GCC and Central Asia regions. That also gives us an advantage in assisting investors from regions that are traditionally not served by other Panamanian law firms.</p><h4>What is your vision for the law firm for the short and medium term, especially in light of growing competition in the local market?</h4><p>Our vision involves a two-pronged strategy. In the area of HR and talent formation, we have an internship program both with young lawyers as well as college students from Europe and the US. These interns seek exposure to the Panamanian business environment, Panama being one of the well-known emerging markets. On the other hand, we want to provide our local staff with an opportunity to be exposed to different ways of thinking and encourage diversity in beliefs among our staff. The other part of our strategy is working with groups, such as foreign bar associations and other international lawyer associations, in order to make presentations on how Panama compares to other jurisdictions. It is part of our strategy to become part of networks and new alliances with international firm associations. Because of greater regulations worldwide, there is a change in the market composition. There is an increase from countries in Latin America, in addition to the Far East. At this moment, though, it is still an evolving process.</p><h4>What targets and ambitions have you set for 2017?</h4><p>This year we have set a target to increase the number of jurisdictions in which we can provide investment solutions. This means obtaining what is called a company management license in the British West Indies jurisdiction. We also plan to further promote options in Panama for regulated entities, which can be available for public fundraising such as hedge funds and investment funds, rather than the usual unregulated company. We have to continue with training for our staff, not only in traditional legal areas, but also in the new transparency regulations for anti-money laundering and account record keeping, which Panama is becoming engaged in. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much is the government investing in MICE to further develop tourism in Panama?</h4><p>We have a Destination Marketing Organization (DMO) office and are investing in international firms that focus on the MICE segment, such as IMEX in Las Vegas as well as one in Frankfurt. The demand for events and conferences is growing and there is a great deal of potential here. We are definitely one of the most secure countries in the region and our hotel infrastructure and geographical position also give us an added advantage. There are five direct flights to Panama from various points in Europe that give us another window of opportunity within the MICE segment. Now, everything needs to be creative and of high quality. On the hotel side, for example, for events we have modern international hotel chains. It is also important to be innovative with the technology we provide for events.</p><h4>How can Panama market itself as an appealing destination for this niche segment?</h4><p>Participation in international fairs is extremely important; we regularly sponsor events like International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA), which gives us the opportunity to promote what we have in Panama. As a meeting destination, we have the Atlapa Convention Center as well as a new convention center in Amador that is currently under construction and will be ready by the end of 2018. We also focus on developing the interior of the country; we will have another two convention centers in Chiriquí­ and Herrera. We have six daily flights to Chiriquí­ from Panama City with Air Panama and Copa, which connects Chiriquí­ to the rest of the world so there is great opportunity there. There are also more than 10,000 rooms available around the country, plus 20,000 rooms in international luxury chains and middle-class chains in Panama City, which gives us many opportunities. For the MICE segment, the most important things are connectivity, hotel infrastructure, and locations to do events; we cover all three areas. We have different airports in the country and the expansion of Tocumen International Airport will be ready at the end of 2018, with 21 gates available in the new terminal. We will have to work with all our assets and put greater effort into promoting the locations and sponsoring events. We also provide incentives for certain groups and exhibitions. </p><h4>What is the importance of the new Amador Convention Center, and how will it stand apart from Atlapa?</h4><p>Amador will be a completely different and modern convention center, with more room for exhibitions. Atlapa, for example, has an amphitheater with a capacity for 2,800 people; however, there will not be a theater in the new convention center because we want it to have more space for exhibitions and larger events. The important thing with the two convention centers is the opportunity to sell Panama as a whole because Panama is not only the Panama Canal. We have culture, history, and adventure. In every single province, there are unique attractions; for example, in Chiriquí­ there are mountains, beaches, and cold and hot climates in the same place.</p><h4>Which countries or markets do you target?</h4><p>We definitely target Latin America; however, the US is the most important area we have to cover. There are also many decision makers in Mexico as well as in Central America. However, as we are growing, we see great opportunities in Europe. Europeans are starting to look at destinations in Latin America because of security issues elsewhere. For us, the main target is the US and then Latin America. We would love to have a 20% increase in the number of rooms for groups and conventions by the end of 2017. We look at the long term and what we are working on now will show results in four to five years. Our regular partnership with ICCA helps a great deal and the most important focus is on technology and medical events. We work closely with medical organizations to attract such events to Panama. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[To A New Level]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[to-a-new-level]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment in the current status of the education sector in Panama?</h4><p>The Ministry of Education has made a general diagnosis of the different problems that the educational sector has faced for more than a decade. To this end, it has incorporated national and international researchers and technicians to make alternatives solutions, creating a modernization plan for the national educational system with the different sectors and actors that are linked to each other. The big national challenge has been to have reliable and timely information for decision making for every problem. That is the progress we have made: clarity in weak processes. We have located bottlenecks and critical points on which we must act and we are at this stage intervening in the most significant components.</p><h4>How can education be a driver for Panama's economic growth and development?</h4><p>We intend to raise the educational level of our people. The country will be able to count on more interested young people doing science and they will develop research that will offer solutions to the national problems in health or agriculture, among others. In addition, the Ministry of Education is working on solid training for professional and technical field, a new opportunity on high school education, which will bring well-qualified workers to the service sector, which characterizes our country. We are betting on having more scientific, engineering, and technical vocations. Both components are driving the national development and pushing economic growth.</p><h4>Are you creating partnerships with international institutions for bilingual programs allowing future generations to have easier access to international markets?</h4><p>President Juan Carlos Varela plans to send around 500 Panamanian public school teachers to study in the US, Canada, and UK universities each year, over the five years of his term in office. This initiative known as Panamá Bilingüe is meant to increase English competency among Panamanian students and improve English teaching capabilities in our country. Panama Bilingüe, under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education, recognizes the powerful strategy of having international collaboration as integral element in the 21st century. This strategy of dealing with international institutions like embassies, universities, colleges, and other business companies opens a panorama of mutually beneficial partnership programs since it allows for our teachers and students to explore other possibilities. It also shows these institutions that we have the human resources who are capable of getting better opportunities and are hungry to learn, advance, improve, and grow. The partnership helps us establish connections that may take future generations out of our country and help them to have access to a broad range of educational experiences. The relationship also proves the myriad ways in which international partnerships enhance, and even transform, the institutions that participate in them, aiding in long-term goals of internationalization and preparing students for entry into the global workforce. Future generations will have access to international markets because the active methodologies learned and applied by the teachers impact students' learning and give them the tools to develop life skills to improve their knowledge and capabilities to be competitive in the global market.</p><h4>What are the ministry's priorities for 2017?</h4><p>The priority at this moment is to create the Information System and Indicators of the educational sector, with a robust platform that systematizes and integrates all the components. This solution will be automated and will allow communication between each tool and module so that appropriate planning of all educational processes is carried out. In this system, the financial and budgetary component has renewed the programmatic structure by results and the 2018 planning, will work in these terms. The systematization and automation of critical processes is our top priority for 2017; this will solve a number of relevant and timely flow of information issues. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the mission and vision of CONALAC?</h4><p>CONALAC represents all the laboratories in Panama. We are in charge of issuing certificates for new lab technicians. We also create specialization fields in accordance with the needs of the country. We investigate and certify the labs every year, both in the private and public sector. We conduct the ACCP test, which is the test for certification we give to new medical personnel. This test is done every year and new professionals have to pass this test in order to start working. Both the public and the private sectors use excellent medical equipment. We also train personnel to use this equipment. The public and private sectors compete with each other when it comes to attracting new employees. Some of the companies are extremely competitive and possess technologies that are not shared with anyone else. There should be greater investment in preventive medicine and medical research and investigation. The number of medical emergencies is increasing, and it is easier to prevent them instead of treating them. Currently, because of migration, diseases such as malaria, syphilis, and tuberculosis are growing in Panama. Diseases such as diabetes are much easier to prevent than treat. CONALAC plans to draft a proposal to conduct tours in other provinces and work together with the Ministry of Health and Social Services to gather census data in terms of people's blood levels, such as glucose and cholesterol. In 2016, CONALAC organized a conference in which 300 representatives from all over Latin America came together. They all focused more on the investigative area of laboratories. We have an agreement with the National University to deal with external quality control. It sends information regarding the areas in which it has gaps in, so we can address them.</p><h4>What are your main priorities for 2017?</h4><p>The main focus for 2017 will be to look at weaknesses and try to fix them. We will try to reach more areas. Now, coverage is limited and there are areas that qualified personnel cannot reach. We will continue to work with the Ministry of Health and Social Services to train and certify more qualified personnel. We will also do our best to elevate the image of medical lab workers in the public eye. These workers are employed not only in hospitals but also in blood banks and other sectors as well, and it is important that their profession is regarded highly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your critical assessment related to the latest developments of the medical sector in the country?</h4><p>According to 2015 WHO health indicators, Panama invests 7.2% of its GDP on health; however, a high percentage of that is for salaries and state payroll and the Bay Sanitation project. Thus, the state must see health as a basic need to generate opportunities and professional development in order to provide a better quality of life for the citizens. We have 1.7 physicians, 1.4 nurses, and 2.2 hospital beds per 1,000 people. These numbers clearly demonstrate a real need in healthcare in our country.</p><h4>What are the clinic's fields of specialty?</h4><p>The CMC offers all services of a second-level hospital in Panama: emergency room, critical care unit, hospitalization, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neonatology and delivery, surgery and outpatient surgery, hemodialysis, radiology, imaging including ultrasound, digital mammography, tomography and X-rays, respiratory therapy, and more. It provides a number of specialties: internal medicine, pneumology, urology, neurology and neurosurgery, ophthalmology, gynecology and obstetrics, neonatology, interventional radiology, pain management, anesthesia, cardiology, nephrology, intensive care, and orthopedic surgery. We hope to include neurocritical care and a pain clinic in 2017, which are non-existent services in the province today. Recently, in conjunction with the LACIPA group, Dr. Richard Altieri successfully performed the first bariatric surgery in Colón, incorporating this new surgery into the hospital's product portfolio. There are plans to work with a group of cardiovascular physicians and thoracic surgeons from Texas on diagnostic and treatment projects for cardiovascular diseases. </p><h4>How would you assess the quality of medical equipment used in Panama's clinics and hospitals?</h4><p>Panama's health sector does not regulate the acquisition of medical devices; therefore, any company can import medical equipment for private clients. Hundreds of companies in Panama sell medical devices. Due to the influence of the US on local physicians, mostly of whom studied there, cutting-edge and avant-garde technology is usually acquired. The Centro Médico del Caribe recently purchased the following equipment, which differentiates it from the other private hospitals of Colón: a monitoring center for critical care, Wi-Fi with five monitors including IBP and BIS, Mindray Model T5/Hypervisor, advanced mechanical ventilator IMT BellaVista 1000, Siemens digital mammograph, Siemens Emotion 6-slice Tomograph, Stryker hospital beds, a nurses' call system with blue code, Mindray HyLite LED surgical lights with integrated HD camera and screen, and a Mindray Unibase 30 electronic surgical table. They are unique products in the province of Colón.</p><h4>How does the medical center promote knowledge and awareness about the importance of preventive medicine among the local population?</h4><p>One of the investments of the technological sector that go hand in hand with the promotion of wellness and preventive medicine was the use of social networks as a tool to raise interest in society: Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. These communication channels share daily messages aimed at raising greater awareness on topics of interest such as diabetes, chronic diseases, nutrition, exercise, family balance, and so on. In addition, and no less important, is the subject of a physician who, with the exception what is happening in Panama City, is a recognized and implemented figure in the Centro Médico del Caribe that is focused on primary care and preventive medicine. We are the first private hospital in Colón with a permanent biomedical engineer and the first hospital in Colón with a competent staff in radiological protection. We have a training agreement for professionals in radiology technology with the University of Santander and a strategic collaboration with INCAE-Seminars of Quality Hospital Management in Costa Rica and Honduras for administrative and managerial staff.</p><h4>What are your short-term expansion and consolidation plans?</h4><p>The mission of greatest relevance for this year is to conclude the expansion works on the second floor and to offer more spaces for outpatient procedures, other specialty clinics, and any service that the hospital can provide. We want to get the ISO9001 certificate for the clinical laboratory area and we will create a blood bank. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Panama for Acino? Why did the company decide to base its regional operations here?</h4><p>We have two operations in Panama. One is our regional office for Latin America while the second is our subsidiary in Panama. Our subsidiary is new; previously, we only had a distribution business in the country selling directly to distributors. Then, in 2016 we decided to establish ourselves as a Panamanian company for the local market. I am the legal representative of both companies. There are a number of reasons why Acino has its regional headquarters here. Panama is a strategic location in the Americas. It is easy to get to Panama for business. It is also relatively straightforward to establish a company here. Our regional management company has had an easy process attracting people to come here and work for us. Having both foreign and Panamanian staff is another plus. On top of that, Panama has the Canal and we have our distribution center in the Colón Free Zone. The geographical proximity of our operations within Panama is an advantage for managing our business.</p><h4>Which specific pharmaceuticals segments is Acino focusing its activities on in Panama?</h4><p>The private pharmaceuticals market in Panama is worth around USD300 million. That is a relatively small market compared to the rest of the region. Nevertheless, it is an attractive market that has double-digit growth annually. There is also a relatively sizable institutional pharmaceuticals market here. We estimate that the institutional market is more or less the same size as the private market. Panama also has a growing and an aging population, which is why Acino decided to establish a fully dedicated Panamanian company. We currently focus mainly on pain treatments and anti-infectives. We also have some over-the-counter (OTC), cardio and gastroenterology products. We are focused on more acute treatments.</p><h4>How is the company positioned to promote a new “culture of prevention" within the country?</h4><p>In 2016, we started some initiatives to run educational programs for the general public. We picked a few topics where we felt Acino could add value to the general population. We organized meetings with physicians to educate people on certain behaviors and the importance of prevention, for example, on ways to avoid developing type-two diabetes, improving eating habits, and the importance of exercise. Basically, we work on a program of health consciousness. To our surprise, the feedback was great and many people were interested in attending the doctors' presentations. The difficulty in promoting prevention is talking about it in a way that people can understand and can realistically embrace in their day-to-day lives. This depends a great deal on the people who conduct the prevention courses. The other initiative we did was directed more at healthcare professionals. We invited international speakers to talk on certain topics that we felt were important to the healthcare profession. It was mainly specialists talking to general practitioners about recent findings and new studies. The idea is to transfer knowledge to the local market.</p><h4>How can Acino maintain a leading position and solid reputation not only in Panama but also at the regional level?</h4><p>First of all, it is about quality and being ethical. We have to be conscious about the long-term impact that our company has. It is essential that we are conscious about the importance of this industry and deliver quality products while acting in an ethical manner. This approach will guarantee the future success of our company and our industry.</p><h4>Where do you see increasing demand for Acino's products at the regional level?</h4><p>Currently, we completely cover the Central American region. We have several export markets in the Caribbean and are also present in Ecuador. Acino is currently the fastest-growing retail pharmaceuticals company in Central America. No other company is growing faster than us in the private pharmaceuticals market. The institutional market is not audited so we do not know the exact figures for that segment. We want to maintain our high growth rate. We are making important investments in the region, such as establishing new legal entities in Panama and Ecuador. We are also bringing in more products to the region and investing in continuous medical education. We want to extend the reach of our Swiss-based quality products across the region. There is great demand and a great perception of our products in the region.</p><h4>What are your main goals and ambitions for Acino in 2017?</h4><p>We expect double-digit growth of around 20% for the region. This is roughly triple the growth of the pharmaceuticals markets we are present in. This anticipated growth is mainly based on the investments we have made, the new products we launch in the region, and our past good growth. In addition, we plan to expand in the region. I am positive in terms of Central America and even more positive about Panama. The overall environment here is promising for Acino. The overall environment here is positive. We  see Panama being one of the top two drivers of growth in Latin America again in 2017; it is probably in second place after the Dominican Republic. We have expansion plans for Colombia, Peru, and the Dominican Republic in the near future to complete our Central America and Andean region business.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[miguel-largacha-martinez-president-porvenir]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the current rate of private pension penetration in Colombia? What are your strategies for improving the penetration level?</h4><p>The Colombian population is around 48 million; however, only a little more than 8 million regularly contribute to any form of pension fund. The main issue keeping people from contributing is the informal economy. Colombia still has an enormous amount of people in the informal sector, and we need to move them into the formal sector of the economy. This is not pension reform, it is labor reform. Two important laws regarding the reduction of taxes for payrolls have been introduced, and we are excited by the impact they might have. Tax reform is key in ensuring the SMEs thrive and do their part to strengthen the formal economy. In terms of market education, we launched a campaign called Familia Porvenir. Familia Porvenir is an initiative based on digital technologies in which we wanted to explain to Colombians how pension funds work and how they benefit their future. The family proved to be a great model for explaining this, because every member of it has a different set of topics and priorities regarding pension funds that relates to each segment of our clients. We developed a robust digital strategy along with a webserie that explored pension funds through this kind of narrative, always in a simple and entertaining language. This effectively engaged an audience that is otherwise rather difficult to reach, and it was met with a great deal of success. It was a ground-breaking strategy for a financial services firm in Colombia. This strategy allowed us to raise awareness about financial education and receive widespread recognition throughout the market.</p><h4>How do you see this year's tax reform impacting the formalization of the economy?</h4><p>The main intent of the tax reform was to offset the losses in government revenue from the oil and gas sector. Oil contributed about 20% to the government's revenue, and the government felt something had to be done to replace this. This has meant an increase in the VAT from 16% to 19% and a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 40%. We have to reduce our corporate tax rate. The other main issue is to reduce the loopholes in our corporate tax laws. The government is expected to boost GDP by 2.1% over the next 3-5 years. Increasing tax rates, however, has the potential of increasing informality and incentivizing tax evasion. Our economy is known for its informal transactions, and higher tax rates will only put more pressure on people in terms pushing them into the informal sphere. The real story is that the Colombian economy is still absorbing the huge shock from depressed prices in the oil industry. It has made some progress, but there is still a large deficit in the external sector and in the public finances. The market was not expecting such a large increase in the VAT; it was only anticipating a one or two percent increase over a couple of years. This surprise was positive for the markets because it was perceived as a serious step to addressing a dire fiscal reality. Many of the major ratings agencies thought it was a positive development, giving us more time to make the needed adjustments in public finances. The tax reform wasn't enough for the government's current needs, but it was better than the markets expected. Our local bonds and the peso increased their value accordingly. The labor market in Colombia has been resilient to the economic shock that has hit Colombia in the last three years. Unemployment has stabilized at around 10% recently. The most interesting thing to realize is that the labor market has not been affected much by the shock, because of where the shock originated—the oil sector. The oil industry is capital intensive and labor plays a much smaller role, meaning the direct impact on the labor market was not huge. Informality has been improving, and it is currently below 50%, which is better than our historical figures. Informality is variously defined, but it is decreasing.</p><h4>What is your short-term outlook for Colombia's economic situation and its impact on private pension funds?</h4><p>We have achieved high returns on capital for our affiliates over the last year. In the first quarter of 2017 Porvenir's largest Mandatory Pension Fund has yielded an effective annual rate of 14.57% and the industry's has also had a good performance (13.67% to March of this year). The markets are responding well, but there is always the potential for changes. However, up to now things have been great. The US economy has also been growing quite well and the equity markets are reaching new heights. Within the pension fund industry, there is an important variable that will determine the bulk of the sector's development, and that is informality. Informality is improving, and we are in a wait and see mode to determine if informality will stabilize at current levels or if it will display more volatility. The Colombian government has introduced a new fiscal stimulus, and we have to wait and see how it affects the economy.</p><h4>What opportunities do the 4G projects present for pension funds? What role do pension funds need to play in financing these projects?</h4><p>Pension funds are investing money in these projects, but the projects also need international financing. We are investing only around 1% of all our assets under management to the 4G projects, so it's quite low. The legal limit is 5%; therefore, it couldn't exceed this. We have compromised in recent commitments, and we currently have two projects worth around USD200 million.</p><h4>With four current players in the market, what opportunities are there for additional private pension companies in Colombia?</h4><p>This industry needs economies of scale, so you need huge volume. The complexity of the business is high and we have a huge responsibility, so some of the small funds struggle to produce strong numbers that reflect ours. As a larger firm, we can create efficiencies that translate into higher returns. We have a huge responsibility, and every market participant has to be solid. In order to achieve, the size necessary to produce the best returns, you need to invest a lot. The breakeven point for a new pension fund is four or five years. Of course, we welcome increased competition, but we are somewhat unique because the public pension funds system is operating simultaneously.</p><h4>What are your targets and priorities for this year?</h4><p>We are looking to digitize our operations. All of our customer interactions will be handled through a digital interface. This will be a more efficient and effective system. In four years, we want to have 95% of all our transactions completed digitally. This is a huge investment in process. Customers demand innovation, and we need to be able to respond by providing a new platform.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the agro industry here in Panama?</h4><p>Panama, in the past, did not invest seriously in developing a solid agricultural system, especially in R&amp;D. Our mission is to boost the agricultural performance of the country. We are interested in self-sufficiency for the people of Panama, and our vision is to establish ourselves as the best agricultural research institution in the country. This segment of the national economy is one of the most challenging, and in the past, the government appointed many politicians to solve the scientific issue. However, the industry does not need politicians; we need producers and experts who can address and solve the issues related to the current crisis that the sector faces. We are fully operative and all our departments work tirelessly to implement a new strategic vision to be achieved by the end of 2030. We would also like to promote a new law to be applied to the industry. We are currently investing over USD15 million in infrastructure, including new laboratories. We are building new factories for seeds and a new research institute in Azuero, as well as five new laboratories in the district of Divisa in the center of the country. We are currently planning the construction of a new plant for seeds in the region of Darién. An Electron microscopy laboratory is another focus, and we are currently implementing new solutions, in particular in the area of Chiriquí­.</p><h4>There is a lack of qualified people in every segment of the national economy and agriculture is no exception. How is the institution working to address this issue?</h4><p>We work with the Agricultural Technology Fund (FONTAGRO) to address this issue, and collaborate extensively with many institutions. The greatest problem and issue, with regard to research and knowledge transfer, is that when we develop new products and new solutions in Panama, producers are not willing to accept them. We need to educate producers about new solutions and be viewed as a reliable partner for the community of producers here. The solution is to work with international institutions to develop a new center of excellence. That is what our neighboring countries are doing, and we do not want to be the exception. We have grants for students to promote the agricultural curricula among local students. This is part of our mandate; we have to improve the quality of human capital in Panama not just for the other segments, but particularly for agriculture. Without human talent, the sector cannot develop. We work with National Secretariat of Science, Technology and Innovation (SENACYT) on a specific program to promote knowledge transfer in the development of highly qualified researchers to be employed in the agricultural sector. The average age of all the people employed in the sector is 50, and we need to convince the young to start working for the development of the agricultural segment. Another challenge is related to internal migration. As the capital grows economically, it becomes more appealing for people living in the outskirts; no one is willing to work to develop the agricultural segment in the country. Something must be done to solve this issue. </p><h4>What are your priorities for 2017?</h4><p>2017 will be a challenging year. By law, the country has certain limitations to build infrastructural projects and these will be stuck until 2018. Our target is to conclude all our current infrastructure projects in Panama. By 2018, all our facilities under construction today will be fully operational, at least on the R&amp;D side. One of the priorities for 2017—and probably one of the most important projects in the agro industry—is the establishment of the Panama-Israel Center of Excellence. As a result of our collaboration with Israel, we will be able to impose ourselves as a hub at the regional level. This is something that is extremely important and I want to develop it starting from this year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the results of the large-scale urbanization in the country and how is the Ministry of Housing positioned in this development?</h4><p>The Ministry of Housing brings together several institutions that have to do with real estate development, the public sector, and the private sector in Panama. The related institutions include the Ministry of Public Works, the Institute of National Aqueducts and Sewers, the Transit Authority, the National Environment Authority, and the Ministry of Health, which all have something to do with the development of infrastructure within Panama City and throughout the country. Within the Ministry of Housing lies the Vice Ministry of Territorial Ordering, where approvals for preliminary projects—be they state projects or private initiatives—are given. From that perspective, the Ministry of Housing plays a key role because this initial process depends a great deal on private developers. If that body is not alert and responsive, developers lose a great deal of time, which translate into a loss of opportunity and money. In addition, there is the issue of territorial ordering, which also involves, within the Ministry of Housing, the territorial ordering of cities so that developers have clear regulations on what they can or cannot do in a particular area of the country; this was not the case with previous administrations. This is an area created in the 2009-2014 administration and started to have greater relevance in the development of the country because we are bringing order to cities. The ministry has also been a project manager in general to help both private companies and the government reduce the housing deficit; it also plays a key role here. We have created what is called the Solidarity Housing Fund with funding from the Panamanian state budget that provides assistance to families buying their first home. When we arrived at the administration in 2014, the aid given to such families was USD5,000. In December 2014, we modified the terms of the benefits and raised it to USD10,000. In addition, up until 2014, the sale value or mortgage of a house was USD40,000 and we subsequently raised it to USD50,000, which represents greater benefits. We also expanded the range of development projects.</p><h4>Which are the most representative projects that are being developed in the sector?</h4><p>When the government took office, there were approximately 147,000 families that did not have a house, were living in rentals, living with their parents, and so on. This is why the government of President Varela has promoted important housing projects. For example, the conditions of the Solidarity Fund for Housing have been improved, from 74 promoters to over 525. In addition, we have increased our initial goal to build 25,000 housing solutions within five years up to 100,000 houses. This is extremely important because it will not only give a boost to the economy but will encourage both public investment by the government and private investment to reduce the country's housing gap.</p><h4>What are your goals and targets for 2017?</h4><p>At the end of 2016, the Ministry of Housing had managed more than 55,108 housing solutions throughout the country. The goal for 2017 is to add 26,000 more housing solutions to that figure so that by the end of this year we have managed over 80,000. To manage means that we have complied with all the administrative procedures and that the housing solutions are in different stages. We also seek to increase project investment from the government from USD1.6 billion to more than USD2.1 billion at the end of the year. This would be a historic investment because over five years the average investment in housing was between USD300 and USD400 million, and we have multiplied that investment by five. In 2017, we hope to leave 81,000 homes managed throughout the country to reach the goal of 100,000 homes by 2018. Finally, we expect to deliver 40,000 completed homes to the beneficiary families by the end of this year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is your sector evolving? What are the main trends you are trying to capitalize on?</h4><p>Since 2014, things have definitely slowed down. 2016 was a hinge year where the changes that we began seeing in 2014 and 2015 materialized. In 2016, we saw the lowest growth in construction in every statistical category but growth will increase in 2017 and 2018 and things will pick up again, albeit at a much slower pace than in the last 10 years. It is currently a great moment to buy beach properties from certain developers; there is an oversupply near the beach. More established developers are more organized, can maintain their inventory, and offer properties that are better integrated with other amenities and they will do fine for 2017. We are involved in a few iconic projects. The business we do here is mostly high-end residential and hotels. In high-end residential projects, the demand for 2015 and 2016 was steady, especially in Santa Maria, where we are doing most of our business. In spite of the slowdown, Panama is growing steadily at around 5-6%, especially in comparison to the region. In 2017, people will be more positive and less cautious. They will start investing a little more than in 2016.</p><h4>Are infrastructure projects an appealing segment for your business?</h4><p>Infrastructure is an interesting market; however, it is largely a government investment and before 2014 bidding for these projects was not completely transparent in Panama. In addition, the payment process tends to be long term and inefficient. We have the knowledge and capacity to do large infrastructure projects; however, we are conservative with the projects we choose to participate in to protect our liquidity. Right now, the liquidity of MAR AZUL is strong given the opportunity we have to weigh in all these factors of working in a public-sector project vis-í -vis the private sector with predictable processes and steady cash flows.</p><h4>How do you differentiate your company in a relatively small market?</h4><p>We are a service company and not a construction company, which marks the difference for clients because we are 100% focused on the management of projects, technical inspection, and tailored solutions. Panama has always been an attractive market and clients have the opportunity to choose amongst local and international competitors. Offering quality and personalized service is critical to serving this market, which is why we invest in our processes and management system. We have been ISO 9001 certified since 2012 and have invested heavily in IT tools such as our construction management software and the continuous training of our associates. We have to protect our position in Panama, though we also want to expand into other countries. Colombia represents an appealing market: We have just opened an office there for project management, a service that is not well established yet in Colombia. We want to introduce project management, especially in areas like Cartagena, Barranquilla, and Santa Marta, where investment in tourism infrastructure is starting to pick up. Costa Rica is also on our radar for future growth. It is a market we are very much in touch with, and I have an excellent connection with key local architecture firms.</p><h4>What are the most important targets set for 2017?</h4><p>My main target is still Panama, which is where all my business is. We are planning to diversify our sources of income in Panama. We have been concentrated in hospitality and residential and some commercial real estate. In the residential sector, we have focused on the high end and are now in conversation with a few developers that do middle-income housing, which we will probably pursue. We also want to diversify our income by pursuing other, more specialized areas in the construction sector. We are also working on entering the Colombian market, where we still need to build relationships and gain the trust of potential partners, which we managed to achieve in Panama. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[its-who-you-know]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you brief us on Spatium's business?</h4><p>
	Spatium is a business center with two locations in Panama City. We provide comfortable spaces to work in, with all the furniture and also with all services included, such as receptionist, cleaning, drinks, internet, and meeting rooms, among others. We also have virtual offices, which is the current trend in Panama. With a virtual office, we provide clients with support services. For example, a client in Italy does not need a 24-hour office here, and we thus provide a commercial address and attend to their phone calls.
</p><h4>What are your expansion plans in Panama and the region?</h4><p>
	Currently, our two locations in Panama are full. We are doing extremely well in Panama. Large companies today seek to reduce costs wherever possible and by hiring us and cutting down on a large office with six or seven spaces, they can save about 60% with Spatium that they can spend on marketing and other things. In May 2016, we opened our second location in Obarrio, Panama. Here, we have the capacity to have 15 companies or enterprise offices as well as a conference room with the capacity for 30 people. In 2017, we will open our third and fourth locations in Bogotá. The third will be located in an area north of Bogotá, in Chico, while the fourth location will be located in Santa Barbara in Bogotá. We expect these locations to have double of the space of our current ones. Bogotá is a new market for us and we have been looking into this the entire year. It will be interesting for us and we want to expand in South America first, and Colombia will be our second country. My brother, Gabriel Montiel, and I want to franchise this business model in two years from now; we are committed to this project and are currently working on that. By that time, we will have six or seven locations around South America.
</p><h4>How do you shape your competitive advantages to maintain a leading position in the local market?</h4><p>
	The greatest value we provide companies is networking opportunities. We provide our clients the spaces to learn and get to know and put into practice making useful professional relations. We offer training spaces, bringing in people recognized in specific areas to our Spatium community for free. For example, we recently had Carlos Rosales from Neurosales, an international sales specialist from Venezuela who came and provided free training to our entire Spatium community. We are always on the lookout for the best benefits for our Spatium community.
</p><h4>What is the composition of Spatium's portfolio?</h4><p>
	Our most typical clients are SMEs. They are not yet a full corporation but have three or four employees. They seek to cut costs and are the ones that can benefit the most from our model as they seek to save money; we can give them benefits that no one else can. The SME segment is the one most interested in networking. For example, we typically announce the entry of a new Spatium client through email marketing; we promote their business to the entire community. In South America, these are our most popular clients. In addition, large companies are also reducing their costs and see Spatium as the best way to do so. We currently have two international companies from the US in our offices; everyone wants to save on operating costs.
</p><h4>
	Where do you see increasing opportunity for your business to be replicated?
</h4><p>
	I believe Bogotá has a large market and we expect to have five or six locations there. We also look at countries like Chile and Mexico. Those are the countries that are on our minds for 2019. In 2017, we want to consolidate the market as the best business center providing the most benefits to the SME community. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you apply your company's values of efficiency, productivity, and readiness for the future in Panama?</h4><p>The greatest challenge in this business is trying to create capacity when volumes are down and being prepared to take care of the capacity when volumes go up. The trick here is to create capacity in a way that can match demand without spending a large amount of money. What we have done in many cases in our terminal is to use the same footprint that we have and add more technology. In the end, it helps to move more cargo to the same terminal. We seek to do a little bit through more advanced technology equipment to lower costs. The biggest problem that we have is that Panama's population is only 4 million; therefore, we cannot compete with larger markets. The challenge is to predict what is next and sometimes we hit the target and sometimes we get close and then adjust. We cannot, however, just invest a large sum of money and wait for the market; we have to create capacity and normally it takes 18-24 months to create capacity and a new dock.</p><h4>How is the company positioned to boost the development of Colón?</h4><p>When we started in 1995, we had no idea what corporate social responsibility was. All we knew was that people lived there and we wanted them to work with us so we decided to have a two-phase program that focused on giving people the best place to work and a great place for them to live. We focused on our people and then looked outward and built hospitals and schools and invested in baseball and soccer teams, as well as in education. We need to keep the people of Colón in Colón, because if they all migrate elsewhere, we will not see the benefits. We are involved in many activities and are the biggest in Colón in this respect. The most important thing is that our people now run operations in Haiti, Colombia, and Vietnam because in the end the idea was to offer a career and not just a job. This has worked and is one of the things that we are truly proud of; all the other parts such as equipment, cranes, and technology can easily be found in any part of the world. The part we are concerned with now is that the type of labor we need requires another level of education that we are not getting. This is the biggest challenge; how we do the job on the existing education level. We need more than what the schools give us; we need what the market demands.</p><h4>What are your targets, priorities, and ambitions for 2017?</h4><p>We need to consolidate our logistics hub but change the concept a little as we have to go more into developmental high-tech products as the real cost of labor in Panama makes the prices of products uncompetitive. We need to look into products where we add labor costs. This is where we are talking about high tech. We also have to look at electronic services such as Amazon and Alibaba because all companies need a place where they can dispatch orders. In Latin America, having a Miami zip code is a bonus; customers send everything to the Miami zip code and everything gets forwarded to their country. Why can't we do this in Panama and become a major center of distribution of e-commerce as well? The free zone concept is there but it will not grow much more. We need to have free zones, added value, e-commerce, an airline hub, as well as cargo as we do not handle enough. The dream is to consolidate this and not just have each sector grow individually; when we put it together the package and value proposition that we can put into commerce—this is the ideal scenario. This is great for business because that generates cargo. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the defining trends emerging in the logistics and shipping industry in Panama and the region?</h4><p>The speed of change in the shipping industry today is fantastic. Things are happening so rapidly and we see forced consolidation within the shipping industry. Panama is the epicenter of transport and logistics for the Americas and beyond; our footprint here certainly touches most major global trade routes. The expansion of the canal has its own consequences; larger vessels can now connect Asian production with the US without breaking the supply chain for transshipments. This means there is now less demand on transshipment ports in the Panama Pacific. Larger vessels are more efficient so bigger vessels going through the canal are great for Panama. The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) reflects this in its tariff pricing to ensure that mega-vessels, the Neopanamax vessels, have certain discounts and concessions. As the trend for transshipment goes down we then see the demand to “top off“ those large vessels increasing. Panama as a nation needs to go beyond its paranoia about port capacity and look to add greater value to the supply chain. This is why the priority and focus for Panama for the future needs to be focused on logistics, hence our economic approach two years ago to develop the lands at Corozal into a global center of excellence for logistics. At the moment, we are facing a difficult situation whereby many of the stakeholders feel we need to build ports. We do not need to build additional ports; we need to ensure that our ports are well connected, efficient, and can handle larger vessels; the focus needs to be on sustainable logistics to drive greater opportunities for industry in Panama. Port capacity does not drive global trade; it is a facilitator.</p><h4>How is PPC positioned to add value in logistics?</h4><p>From an efficiency point of view, we have invested USD1.5 billion over the 20-year period during this concession. While ports in the US are all scrambling at the moment to be able to handle large vessels, PPC is already there. We were perceptive and prudent enough to invest early and have the capability to take the world's biggest vessels, even though these cannot go through the canal. Neopanamax vessels with 13,000TEU capacity are the limit that can go through the canal. We can already take 18,000-20,000TEU vessels at PPC. We have the water depth, the outreach on our cranes, the infrastructure, and yard capacity today to handle the vessels of tomorrow. We need to move on as well and create lateral expansion. PPC shall move into logistics and the pressure is on to develop warehousing and supporting activities and see how we can contribute to the new, much needed logistics landscape here. There is a need to look at inventory holding in terms of better inventory management and setting up manufacturing and production. We now have our eyes on a completely different market and this is where Panama will sustain its economic advantage.</p><h4>What are your priorities at PPC for 2017 in terms of boosting efficiency and expanding the port's operations?</h4><p>We have the hardware and the infrastructure; now we need to look at labor flexibility. With larger vessels there are naturally more peaks and troughs. Rather than carrying heavy gangs of workers through the troughs we need to be flexible. For example, we need to be able to put six instead of three cranes on large vessels; this requires more personnel and resources at certain high points within the week. We need to be able to flex our capacity up to handle multiple Neopanamax vessels simultaneously. My challenge is to work with our unions and employees to make sure we continue to adjust our business to handle larger vessels with significantly more peaks. I am confident that our investments made shall ensure the future of our port for the next generations to come. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define the main trends emerging within the Panamanian maritime sector?</h4><p>Today in Panama, we see modernization efforts underway at practically every maritime terminal. The modernization and/or expansion of the terminals is associated with the servicing of vessels expected to call on our ports as a result of the expansion of the Panama Canal. We also see infrastructure renovations due in certain terminals that are reaching the end of their useful lives. Finally, the construction of Minera Panama, the largest private project in Panama, is currently underway. This investment and pole of development will have a positive impact on the economic development of the country. This includes the construction of a marine terminal for the loading of copper concentrate—to be exported to various global markets—and the unloading of coal to generate electricity at the project's thermoelectric plant. These new development opportunities in the country go hand-in-hand with maritime infrastructure developments of the first order. IMI is present in such emblematic projects.</p><h4>How is IMI committed to the development of Panama and the regional maritime sector?</h4><p>IMI is 100% Panamanian, with its base of operations in Panama, from where we manage and operate our local projects and projects throughout the region. Our commitment to the maritime sector is to contribute our knowledge and technology in the development of each engineering and construction project, applying knowledge and techniques using the most advanced methodologies at the global level. Our company is dynamic, flexible, and fully committed to the development of the country.</p><h4>In 2016 IMI constructed the first Automatic Stacking Crane system in Latin America at MIT. What is the importance of this project?</h4><p>This project, executed for MIT, is the first automatic crane system in Latin America. With this, Panama is the forerunner in the utilization of cutting-edge technology that in the years ahead will be applied in all terminals in the region. IMI is recognized for being a company of high technical capacity and is part of a company group comprising Salfacorp and Conconcreto that is publicly traded, to which end we follow strict financing rules and regulations. Being able to tie together all of IMI's experience in Central America, the knowledge and experience of our associate companies in South America, and our presence at a global level in markets in Asia and North America enables our company to have a technical and management capacity of the first order.</p><h4>What is the importance of the energy segment in the expansion of your operation in Panama?</h4><p>IMI has placed emphasis on developing business in this area. We are currently developing the design and construction of a maritime terminal for the unloading of LPG in the Dominican Republic. Our associate companies are firms where most of their construction experience is in the area of energy. Adding this to our own experience allows us to develop successful projects alongside both our clients and our associates. Our company is currently analyzing engineering and construction proposals for GNL projects and other energy types in Panama and throughout the Central American and Caribbean regions.</p><h4>Where does the company see growth potential, not only in Panama but also within the region?</h4><p>As part of our expansion plan, we are currently looking at various countries in the region, such as the Dominican Republic and El Salvador, among others. IMI has the capacity to cover operations over various regions, which gives us the opportunity to analyze projects in South America such as Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p><h4>What are your targets, ambitions, and goals that the company has set for 2017?</h4><p>Our upcoming goals are to continue working closely with our clients as we continue developing our work and we finalize our projects successfully and, above all, with zero accidents. In the medium term, we seek to continue expanding our operations to other countries in the region. On another note, we hope to incorporate additional high-tech equipment, which will further diversify our engineering and construction capabilities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the expanded Panama Canal reshaped the international maritime and logistics landscape?</h4><p>Panama has played a vital role in the logistics sector at the regional level and in this context the expansion of the Panama Canal was another boost to the many private investments in the maritime logistics and infrastructure industry in the country. It was truly a vital complement to the millions of dollars in investments from maritime operators as well as those companies operating within the sector. Subsequently, reports from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean have positioned Panama as the main logistics hub in the Americas. This was a result of the joint efforts from the many parties involved in that. We can proudly say Panama is the efficient merging of public investment and the belief of the private sector in the development of a common goal and idea: Panama becoming the main logistics hub in the entire region.</p><h4>How do you encourage cooperation between the private and public sectors to empower the performance of this strategic segment of the national economy?</h4><p>The AMP facilitates maritime trade in the country. Our administration also works toward facilitating formalities for our users in other organizations; for example, the Maritime Chamber of Commerce closely works with the Migration Authority, the Customs Authority, the Ministry of Environment, and so on. This close cooperation with other organizations in the country has been a key enabling point for the development of the industry and the execution of common goals.</p><h4>What is the commitment of the ministry in the development of human resources to serve the local maritime industry?</h4><p>We emphasize the importance of education and the need to promote studies in maritime and logistics sciences. We talk about international know-how transfer through partnerships. Our administration supports and promotes the development of human resources; it is important for young people in the country to see the many opportunities around these industries. The better qualified they are, the greater success they can achieve.</p><h4>Can you share some details of the recently approved collaboration between AMP and the Port of Hamburg?</h4><p>One of the top projects for President Varela this term is the development of a maritime port for cruises in the Pacific in the Amador area. In this context, we started joint work and efforts to lift a sheet with the support of the Presidency Project Unit. This will lead to an international tender process for the construction of that port. We have seen great interest from architects and dredging companies in this project. A visit to the Port of Hamburg was envisaged within Panama's potential in the industry and the efficiency of the human resources of the public sector. The Port of Hamburg is one of the best examples in terms of port management and we signed a cooperation agreement with it to emulate its operations and facilitate the technical capabilities and regulations for the successful operation of this new maritime port in Amador. There will be no exclusivity whatsoever in terms of only a cruise operator monopolizing operations in this new facility.</p><h4>What are your main goals and ambitions for 2017?</h4><p>The most important activity for this year will be the celebration of the World Maritime Day in October 2017. At the same time, we need to emphasize the message that Panama has proven its technical capability and strength as international service platform, especially in sectors such as maritime and logistics. We will also leverage resources from the maritime industry to have a positive and valuable impact on local communities that require the support of the state. This administration has managed to establish within all tender contracts a percentage that needs to be allocated to the development of social maritime projects in the local communities. It is extremely important for us to integrate economic development with the social and sustainable development of our people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the benefits of being headquartered in the industrial park of Costa del Este?</h4><p>This industrial park in Costa del Este was a small urban area built around 20 years ago but is now virtually surrounded by one of the most exclusive zones of the city. The industrial park has gained a great deal of value. It is not large but there are advantages of having our headquarters here. Properties in this area of the city have become expensive, which has created an entry barrier to the industrial park either to buy or rent while offering similar services. We are vertically integrated and prefer to handle our operations ourselves if we can. At times, we do not have the capacity to serve all of our customers; however, we know we can do at least a portion of the business.</p><h4>What is your ideal customer profile?</h4><p>Our ideal customer would be industrial based, mostly handling equipment, either construction, medical, technological, or other. It would have repeat business to satisfy annual needs and replenish stock. We care about every customer; however, we particularly serve repeat customers with whom we can mutually grow and create win-win, long-term relationships. We enjoy providing complete services for our customers, including door-to-door service from anywhere in the world to Panama and vice versa. The energy sector has been interesting and 2016 was a great year for us. We hit both our renewable energy and combustion-based energy niche in 2016, more than which we have done in previous years.</p><h4>How will the expanded Panama Canal affect your business?</h4><p>The expanded canal will be of advantage to national freight forwarders; however, we also need to wait to determine how it will help and how much it will benefit us. Now that bigger ships can pass through the Canal, companies can consolidate scales at better rates. With ships over 10,000TEUs, there are better rates coming to Panama. We will also see more public and private special incentive zones and industrial parks being built. For companies that want to ship, segregate, redistribute, and re-export across the region, the expanded canal will be a great advantage. For the national market, we need to keep in mind that even though the canal has been expanded, generating more income for the government, a great deal of the cargo does not stay in Panama. Many national and multinational freight forwarders will probably not directly benefit from this, because much of the cargo will not enter the country and remain on board, and others will just be transshipped to other ports. We have not seen an increase in business yet, because national customers will not import more just because bigger and more ships can pass through the canal or because the volumes have become larger. We have to wait and see how it affects us. It has just been a year so far; however, we personally have not seen a direct impact on our business.</p><h4>What is your short-term strategy to become a leading player in this market considering the competition in Panama?</h4><p>In the national market, there is a great deal of competition, and we consider ourselves one of the top five national freight forwarders in the country. Being a vertically integrated, asset-based company puts us at a competitive advantage compared to many other companies that may be able to broker the same services but not have complete control over them. In 2016, we had 13% growth turnover wise, which is great compared to the industry average. In 2017, we need to maintain that rate. That is our priority: to maintain that growth and keep that pace going. We handle a large amount of project cargo and saw plenty of unexpected business at the end of 2016, which was advantageous; however, we need to come up with strategies to maintain that 13% growth into 2017 and make it sustainable. </p>]]></richbody0content>
