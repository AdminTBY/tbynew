		<title><![CDATA[5% Growth]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ettore-nicoletto-ceo-santa-margherita-gruppo-vinicolo]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to Santa Margherita's growth in 2018?</h4><p>Achieving 5% growth when a global economy is slowing down is a phenomenal result. Our growth is due to a combination of elements: new acquisitions and further expansion into key large markets like the US or Canada, where we have enjoyed another robust year of growth.</p><h4>What is Santa Margherita's value-added proposition in the wine sector?</h4><p>Santa Margherita has always been at the forefront of innovation, starting from 1952 when together with a few other wineries we discovered the potential of Glera grapes and hence Prosecco. In the 1960s, we practically invented a new way of making wine by an innovative process that became a new product called Pinot Grigio. Within Santa Margherita, there is a great deal of creativity and inventiveness that constantly helps product development. Particularly in the Veneto region, we are now adding to the value of our portfolio, which is composed of Pinot Grigio, Prosecco Superiore DOCG, and other local varieties. The competitive advantage of a group like ours is that our efficiency, effectiveness, and growth are a result of the portfolio of products that we offer. We have depth and geographical breadth, and we represent the most renowned wine growing regions of Italy. As a group, we work as a one-stop shop: one will have access to the six most important wine growing regions of Italy through a single supplier. This gives us a strong competitive advantage against our peers.</p><h4>Are you planning any new acquisitions in the short term?</h4><p>We have our eyes on new opportunities and are keen to explore new ideas. However, we also need to digest what we acquired in 2017. In order for us to integrate new wineries and systems in an efficient way, we need time. First, we have to complete the integration processes of the two new wineries we have, and then we can look elsewhere, not only in Italy, but in other countries, in particular the US, the largest market where we have a branch that markets all our wines.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on your export strategy?</h4><p>We are seriously looking at selling through the direct-to-consumer channel in the next few years, particularly in the US. The US market is still the largest market in the world for wine and one of the most lucrative due to its value chain, and we aim to be an even more significant player in that market. This means thinking about the transformation the market has undergone over the past few years. There is growing demand for sought-after wines that are not available from current lists. Consumers are looking for something special and unique. Direct-to-consumer channel is a way to satisfy these needs. We can do it through e-commerce, purchases made at tasting rooms at wineries, and clubs. That is different from our three-tier system in the US. Our strategy is to invest in a winery that will allow us to access the end users, which is something we cannot do as an importer. For us, this would be a way to learn a new method of consumer interaction in a much closer way. It would also help us better understand the market. It's imperative for Santa Margherita, which also has a strong foothold in the US market, to explore new channels.</p><h4>What does Santa Margherita do in terms of sustainability and innovation?</h4><p>We like saying we were sustainable before the word even became popular because it has always been a part of our culture. Our main winery runs on biomass, a renewable source. We produce 20MW, supplying energy to the winery and the glass-making factory, positioned 600m from our winery. This makes our winery unique. If you consider semi-vertical integration, on one hand we have a supplier of glass that works on clean energy and is located next to our winery, which saves on carbon emissions. On the other, the wine is processed using green energy. We calculated the carbon footprint of our Pinot Grigio, which is less than 50% the average carbon emissions in the wine industry. 10% of our total production is carbon neutral, and that is mainly what we sell in Canada. As far as our practices in vineyards go, currently 50% of our farming is organic with no chemicals used. Instead, we use natural compounds to help vines endure or prevent diseases. Where chemicals are necessary, since you cannot implement organic farming in all stages, we make a concerted effort to reduce their usage. We also reuse carbon dioxide in winery operations. We have patented a system at our Franciacorta winery that completely reduces the use of sulfur dioxide.</p><h4>In Italy, wine tourism is worth EUR2.5 billion, and it attracts a total of 14 million tourists per year. Veneto attracts a third of these numbers. What initiatives are you taking in this regard?</h4><p>We have a great deal to offer as a region. More can and should be done to create some ports of entry where tourists check in and are guided to what is available in a given wine-growing district. Once the tourist arrives, regardless of their disposable income, they should be offered different entertainment options or programs. This is on offer in Napa Valley, for instance, but not across Italy. As far as Santa Margherita is concerned, we are serious about hospitality because a winery experience is a magical way to make consumers fall in love with your wine. We are well equipped in all six regions where we operate with a hospitality team and a national coordinator. Not only do we simply do conventional hospitality through tours, but we also organize many events to attract people from all walks of life so they can understand our philosophy. We believe this is the best way to communicate the brand. A direct experience lasts forever. Hospitality and tourism are important levers for us in communicating the winery and the brand, and we will continue to invest in this with the same determination.</p><h4>What is your take on the Prosecco Hills gaining UNESCO World Heritage Site status, and how can Santa Margherita benefit from it?</h4><p>This is an incredible opportunity for the territory. It's an enchanting area with an incredible landscape, and additionally it produces a wonderful wine that has enjoyed incredible success over the past 10 years. These are all the ingredients for an extremely successful story. The difficulty lies in the fact that we have to create a network and a system to collaborate with one another. Consortia will have to work on a plan that requires the help of all the players in the region, which should put away their individualistic approach and work as a system, network, territory, and community. If we can manage this, we could double or triple the economic importance of the area.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for 2020?</h4><p>I am hopeful we will close another good year in 2019. Everyone feels a sense of precariousness due to trade dispute between China and the US. Even wine can be impacted by it. Then, there is the Brexit issue, which is extremely important since the UK is one of Italy's main wine export markets, particularly for Prosecco. The scenario is uncertain, but I am optimistic, and based on the signals from the markets in which we operate, 2020 could be a year of some growth and consolidation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will OTL Africa focus on this year?</h4><p>Policy-induced shrinking margins in some markets is shifting focus to alternative products, market segments, and opportunities which we will highlight. LPG and lubricants are significant drivers in view of increasing penetration in large markets like Nigeria and the rest of the West African region, with about 900% growth in the last ten years for LPG. We will also explore solutions in distribution infrastructure including depots and pipelines. Sourcing and pricing of petroleum products is always an issue, and we will be shining a searchlight on how the Dangote refinery will impact the product supply chain.</p><h4>How much will the Dangote refinery reduce Nigeria's dependency on imports of refined products?</h4><p>At this point, we can only make assumptions based on what Dangote says. The refinery is said to have a capacity of 650,000bpd, while the volume of crude oil designated to be adequate to meet daily local supplies in Nigeria is 450,000bpd. The Dangote refinery could potentially meet the local petroleum product needs of Nigeria and the West African region. However, a great deal depends on the policy, which is why one of the things we are doing this year is holding a policy roundtable for the Nigerian downstream markets.</p><h4>Who will you have at OTL on the public sector side?</h4><p>All the industry regulators will be on hand to provide insight into operations and policy.</p><h4>What outcome do you expect from this year's event?</h4><p>We want to be able to achieve increased competitiveness in markets across the continent, driven by certainty of policy. If after this year's events and over the next one year African governments begin to look more actively to opening up the markets, we would have been successful in driving that narrative. Everything now is business promotion, business interaction, and ensuring that opportunities are expanded for the stakeholders who attend our events.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the OTL Africa's annual resolutions?</h4><p>Every year, at the end of every event we have key pointers to what the industry wants. We put these pointers together in the form of resolutions, which use to drive advocacy over the course of the year. In driving that advocacy, we push out these resolutions to the relevant government authorities who take it as the basis for engaging with the public. Beyond that, we also try to hold them accountable by identifying specific strands of these activities that tie with the expectations the government has set relating to these resolutions. By doing that over a period of time, we can actually get them to develop policies driven by stakeholders' yearnings. Even if the authorities were not thinking of it, we can remind them, and they are able to go back and take a look; thereby, some progress can be made.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been Ashghal's role in developing Qatari infrastructure?</h4><p>Over the last 15 years, Ashghal has continued to enhance the development of efficient and sustainable infrastructure for Qatar. Ashghal's undertakings include a wide range of infrastructure programs being implemented across the country, which will deliver some of the largest expressways and integrated infrastructure projects providing new, free-flowing roads linking ports and logistical locations. The infrastructural benefits are already becoming visible through the completion and opening of some major expressway projects in recent years. These projects include Al Majd Road, a major contributor to the country's land transport and the current boom in internal and external trade, Lusail Expressway, with its iconic, award-winning arches 5/6, and Sabah Al Ahmad Corridor, which was launched earlier in 2019 and is currently underway. Our local areas infrastructure program continues to maintain the road and drainage network across Qatar through the development of infrastructure to serve residential areas. Thus far in 2019, Ashghal has completed over 125km of roads and awarded projects in several areas in Qatar, at a total value of QAR3.2 billion (USD878 million), to serve 3,090 land plots. In addition to upgrading and developing drainage network in various areas, Ashghal is focusing on the operation and maintenance of the country's road and drainage network, while ensuring the delivery of quality services in managing these assets. Furthermore, we are working with the relevant authorities to deliver essential public building projects within the healthcare and education sectors. </p><h4>What opportunities do you offer to the private sector?</h4><p>Ashghal is continuously tendering new projects for local and international companies to participate in. In 2019, Ashghal plans 55 new projects worth QAR18.8 billion (USD5.16 billion), which represents an opportunity for local and international investors and companies. In addition, Ashghal participates annually in exhibitions and conferences aiming to highlight its current and future projects and attract foreign companies to participate in them. In addition, we organize roadshows to brief interested and experienced local and international companies on related projects and their components. To encourage participation of local firms, in collaboration with Qatar Development Bank, we launched the Ta'heel initiative to rehabilitate and accredit existing national factories, allow Qatari manufacturers to help implement Ashghal's engineering and construction programs, and include national companies in our approved supply chain. Ashghal had successfully qualified 107 Qatari suppliers and approved 152 items to be used in infrastructure projects in various sectors by March 2019. </p><h4>What is the relevance of new technologies and innovation in terms of developing state-of-the-art infrastructure in the country?</h4><p>Through all our programs, projects, and services, Ashghal aims to promote best practices, encourage innovation, and adopt new technologies, focus on environment and sustainability, with utmost emphasis on health and safety performance to improve the sector and create a knowledge legacy that can be utilized and developed over the long term. Among ongoing initiatives, Ashghal is implementing building information modelling (BIM), a collaborative method for the design, construction, and operation of assets using 3D models and tools. Ashghal is pioneering the lean construction initiative at a large scale in Qatar, which brings more value for the customer and contractors. It also improves our project delivery performance. For sustainability, we promote crumb rubber recycling, using it as a modifier into asphalt concrete mixes for use in road construction projects. Recycled construction materials, such as asphalt waste, demolition waste, and iron slag, are also used for road projects to reduce the import rates of gravel and bitumen and the cost of projects. Ashghal uses approximately 60 million tons of demolition waste in its road projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What recent economic and market trends have you noticed in Sharjah and how have they impacted the construction and real estate sectors?</h4><p>Al Thuriah specializes in offering turnkey solutions to institutions and investors by combining real estate development, construction, leasing, and facilities management into one seamless service. The real estate sector in Sharjah remains healthy in terms of demand and supply; however, the price volatility of the neighboring Emirates has an immediate effect on Sharjah's market. We have noticed that end-users and investors have numerous choices in terms of payment schemes and limited time offers, but at Al Thuriah, we decided to focus our efforts on better living standards. All our projects feature superior living spaces that are 50% more than the usual market sizes along with premium finishes and amenities. In turn, our products fulfill the requirements of modern living. Notably, Sharjah recently granted foreign nationals the right to buy long-term leasehold properties, and it has proved to be a great stimulus for our industry. </p><h4>What is the status of your La Plage Tower and Sahara Tower 6 projects?</h4><p>La Plage Tower and Sahara Tower 6 are the only projects in our portfolio that are for sale as individual apartments. Sahara Tower 6 is the final jewel of the Sahara Complex, which turned out to be a success for residents of Dubai and Sharjah. Sahara Tower 6 is designed with deluxe spaces and the highest standard finishes. The final tower in the series means all the improvements learnt throughout the years were incorporated in its design and execution to create our best product yet. Sahara Tower 6 is due for completion during 4Q2019, 60 days ahead of its official completion date. On the other hand, La Plage Tower was designed to set a new benchmark in high-rise residential living. The tower offers 90 different floor plans that will cater to various cultures and tastes. The concept of exclusivity was the foundation of our approach and design. The tower is split into three sections that are slightly different from one another. The project features 2m-wide terraces and 1.5m-wide windows to ensure optimal utilization of space and offer the best views. La Plage Tower is on sale now and slated for completion in 4Q2022.</p><h4>How are you working to increase sustainability in your projects?</h4><p>Sustainability is a subjective word. At Al Thuriah, sustainability means keeping the same standards throughout a project's life cycle. To achieve this, our facilities management subsidiary weighs in during the design stage for valuable insights and recommendations. Furthermore, we keep a sinking fund that accumulates yearly for every project in order to take immediate action in case of wear and tear. Keeping a hands-on approach with a preventive mindset is the key to ensuring long-term sustainability.</p><h4>How will the change in visa and investment opportunities for foreigners benefit Sharjah?</h4><p>The approval to allow foreigners to invest on a long-term leasehold basis opened a new pool of end-users and investors. Our target market increased 10-fold overnight which greatly benefited all developers and the Emirate as a whole.</p><h4>What kind of AI or machine learning solutions are you using? </h4><p>Real estate is a long-term business which requires short-term and long-term analyses. Machine learning does not help in creating future assumptions; however, it does help in comparing current data with historical data to establish a baseline.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2019?</h4><p>Our primary goal is to complete our transition to an international Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, which will create a coherent journey for our customers and reduce the operating time to complete tasks. The ERP system will also allow all our companies to share data on a single platform and improve our processes, resulting in greater efficiencies and customer care. We have a healthy backlog of projects, but we will continue evaluating new projects and partnerships in the near future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the establishment of Arada and Sharjah's real estate market?</h4><p>Arada was established with the vision to create communities that inspire, excite, and engage their residents. These are communities that are well designed, contain every amenity you need, and are available at an accessible price point. We are not targeting the high-end luxury space, though we may do so in the future. Instead, we want to create communities that people can afford. With that in mind, we decided Sharjah was the ideal place to start because we saw a gap in the market for quality communities. The thinking of Arada's leadership was to create a community where one could live, work, and play. As a result, we launched our first project, Nasma Residences, in March 2017. Its success convinced us to open our second project, Aljada—the Emirate's largest ever lifestyle megaproject—which was launched by the Ruler of Sharjah in September 2017. If Nasma Residences is a well-designed community, Aljada is a well-designed city; it is a completely inclusive space, spread over 24 million sqft. Included within the master plan is a commercial business park, which will incorporate a free zone; two retail boulevards that stretch the length of the development; three international schools; several specialized hospitals and clinics; and four hotels, one of which will be The Address, which is a result of our partnership with Emaar. There is also the Central Hub, an entertainment district designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, which includes entertainment, sports, retail, and F&amp;B options overlooking a showpiece fountain.</p><h4>Are you implementing a smart city system in either of your developments?</h4><p>We want all of our units to be smart, and that includes lighting, air conditioning, voice control, and security. We started this process by adding this technology to apartments in Aljada as part of our value proposition. Before we announced that, we had already sold more than 1,000 units and did not increase the price after adding that feature, as we wanted to maximize value for our customers. We are also making Aljada a completely smart city because that is the future, and we need to embrace it. We have a blueprint for what we want to include, though we are also flexible. We are including areas such as traffic management to make people's lives easier and are incorporating smart waste management and smart metering to reduce the cost of electricity and water. We have partnerships with big brands and are in talks with Siemens, Alibaba, and many other partners. Sustainability is also our core value; our irrigation system runs on recycled water and the Central Hub is powered by solar energy. We have allowed for 5G cabling provisions and are in talks with Etisalat for that. This is a game changer for wireless connectivity, and will also benefit AI, providing a backbone for the smart city. Based on our studies and planning, we expect about 70,000 residents and 30,000 visitors and workers in the business park.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for 2019?</h4><p>Our priority for 2019 is to deliver on our commitments. We have sold well over 3,500 units in a little over two years; no developer in Sharjah has achieved this level of sales in such a short time. We owe everything to our customers for having placed their faith in us. We also want people to experience our amazing facilities before they move in. That is why we are opening an experiential center in our Central Hub in Aljada in 3Q2019. We will hold weekly indoor and outdoor events there, most of which will be free. We are a new company and working in tough market conditions, but we're doing things differently and exceeding expectations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[clear-goals]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Gama Aviation has been operating in Sharjah since 2008. What is your outlook for the future of the private aviation industry?</h4><p>We are part of the global group of Gama Aviation companies. We operate in excess of 230 aircraft and have been in the UAE since 2008, operating out of Sharjah from the beginning. The current facility, Gama's VIP terminal at Sharjah Airport, opened in 2014. We have had a great opportunity to work with the Department of Civil Aviation and Sharjah Airport Authority to stimulate business growth at Sharjah Airport, specifically in the business aviation services sector. We manage aircraft, charter them for third-party clients, provide maintenance for our own and visiting aircraft, and handle all the VIPs who use Sharjah as their gateway to Dubai and the Northern Emirates. We have proven that Sharjah's unique location and ease of use make it a popular hub for private jets. We hope to promote more awareness about Sharjah and the great benefits it provides in terms of its openness to do business and grow. We are extremely aligned in terms of how we position ourselves from a pricing point of view. We have shared objectives in terms of creating value for visitors to the Emirate. We have done a good job of getting regional clients to use Sharjah, though our aim is to get visitors from East Asia, Europe, and the US to understand what Sharjah all is about.</p><h4>What is the status of your Business Aviation Center project, and what are some of your key recent developments?</h4><p>We came to an agreement regarding the long-term lease and exclusive arrangement with the Airport Authority, went on to do feasibility studies, and received internal approval to go ahead with the project. We have made excellent progress, though we are perhaps slightly behind. This is not a bad thing, as it has allowed us to ensure we are solid internally. In terms of other developments, we continue to see strong growth in the FBO and maintenance activities segments, the latter being our best performer in 2018. There are about 300 private jets in the region, and Saudi Arabia controls 35% of that market. The idea is to leverage the scale we can achieve in Saudi Arabia to stimulate aircraft maintenance in Sharjah because there are no business jet maintenance facilities in Saudi.</p><h4>Is it easy to find the talent in Sharjah and the UAE?</h4><p>Finding the right talent has always been and will remain a significant problem for us. This issue is present across the Middle East where the majority of experienced aircraft engineers are expatriates. Excellent strides have been made in terms of investments in universities and training facilities in the region but due to international regulatory issues, it is not easy. We do invest in training people; our strategy is to employ talented people and up-skill them.</p><h4>Where do Gama Aviation's clients come from?</h4><p>From a management point of view, our clients are generally GCC nationals and corporates. In terms of maintenance, our clients are extremely varied, though definitely with a bias toward the GCC. Saudi Arabia is a large market of ours.</p><h4>How do you plan to expand your client base?</h4><p>We are building a large hanger, and we will need more aircraft to fill it up. Our aim is to create a huge temperature-controlled hanger facility and encourage clients to store aircraft in our hanger. Demand for parking spaces is greater than the hangar space available at Sharjah Airport. We will place our current clients into our new hanger and encourage others from the UAE and the GCC to use it. All the hangers in Dubai are operating at full capacity, and there is no business jet hanger available in Saudi Arabia. Gama Aviation will cash in on that opportunity and then scale up the range of its services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was AAA established and what have been its notable achievements? </h4><p>AAA is part of a joint venture between Air Arabia and AAG-UK. It is currently the largest multi-crew pilot license (MPL) training program in the world open to national and international students. The UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) has played an integral part in our success by embracing new innovative programs. GCAA is truly proactive in pioneering numerous aviation-related developments in the region. Moreover, we owe our success to Air Arabia's continuous support. Initially, many airlines did not accept the MPL program because it required it to be linked to an airline. Thus, the program's deployment is one of the greatest achievements for AAA and it is an achievement we share with the UAE. </p><h4>Do all your students go straight into Air Arabia? <br></h4><p>Yes. The MPL program is a four-year program with two years of academic training and another two years of practical training with Air Arabia. That is what makes the qualification so valuable.It is not just a theory certification; it also includes 1,500 hours of Airbus A320 experience. There is almost no airline in the world that requests more flight experience than that. Furthermore, students also acquire an Airline Transport Pilot's License (ATPL), the highest license one can get. This makes our graduates highly sought after around the world. </p><h4>How many pilots and other instructors do you employ at AAA? </h4><p>At present, we have 20 in-house instructors and another 28 through our international partnerships and associations. We started with seven employees and have grown gradually over the years. In the past three years, however, there has been a global shortage of instructors. We strive to retain our instructors as airlines around the world try to hire them by offering higher salaries. At present, we are successfully managing the situation, and AAA is opening multiple hubs worldwide. We are extending our flight training capabilities by opening facilities in the Philippines and Australia, where our first batch of students have already gone. We will likely open two more hubs in Eastern Europe and North Africa. Notably, we have a great partnership with the Etihad Aviation Training Center.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the aviation industry in Sharjah? </h4><p>The industry has grown considerably over the last 15 years; growth in the last five years has also been reasonable despite the challenges. Everyone has been anticipating economic development as growth was minimal. Sharjah, however, has conducted studies and one of the signs of growth is that the new airport project has been approved; this demonstrates the Emirate's continued focus on aviation expansion.</p><h4>What other projects does AAA have under development? </h4><p>Besides having satellite locations, there will be a possible investment in full-satellite branding somewhere in the world, though this is still being carefully studied. Looking toward 2020, we plan to combine pilot licenses with a degree, like an MBA in Aviation. Sharjah, in general, is also investing vast amount of resources in education. We still have to work out the details of our program with the Ministry of Education and are looking for a local Sharjah university to partner with. If the process on this becomes complicated, we may decide to go international.</p><h4>What are AAA's goals and objectives for 2019? </h4><p>We are way ahead and already planning for 2023. In 2019, we will form many global satellite associations for AAA and partner further with Air Arabia on a bigger development for the future—those are our two main goals. We also have a five-year plan, which includes a virtual reality program, expansion plans, and larger investments within the organization. The main reason we are branching out to multiple locations in different parts of the world is to diversify the risks.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the milestones and achievements of Sedar Global?</h4><p>Sedar Global is a family-owned company; it was established by my grandfather in 1892. He started expanding the company by entering the commerce, trade, and industry sectors. We also work in paint, construction, general trade, building materials, and properties. In the early 1970s, with the emergence of aluminum, we introduced vertical blinds, and in 1979, we built a factory that helped us expand in the Gulf region and beyond. We added more products together with window coverings, such as awnings, curtains, roman blinds, and wallpapers. In 2014, we started considering expanding beyond the Gulf and started to sell franchises. It took us about a year after we developed the concept in 2014 to develop the necessary elements for a successful franchise; we are renowned throughout the Mediterranean. In 2016, we opened our first factory and showroom in Egypt. We have participated in several specialty exhibitions, including in Singapore, Turkey, and Germany. We are pleased with the results of our efforts. In less than three years, we have covered a fairly large area. We currently have five factories in the Gulf region and beyond, 26 showrooms, and over 1,000 staff. We have many contracts with high-reputation hotel chains and clients and are the sole supplier for many hotels.</p><h4>What are some recent developments for your portfolio?</h4><p>Being the third generation of a successful business, we have our ethics. We do not care about competition. We have our own training academy for sales and technicians, and we never badmouth other companies. Our recent portfolio includes our franchises at the top of the list, and this gives us a strong push for more global activities. This has been fairly successful in a short period of time. We are the sole supplier for many institutions and business. We even export our products to Canada. Before focusing on franchises, we were taking on projects in Russia, CIS, Africa, and Europe. We are also planning to establish franchises in Africa. Egypt and Morocco are two countries we are focusing on.</p><h4>How will AI change your operations and the industry?</h4><p>It is important to stay up to date with the latest technologies. This is why we created our own IT unit. Our IT employees are always working on developing innovative products. Our pride is the Spine program, which monitors all activities of the company. Whenever any client enters a showroom in Cairo, for example, we will know what they looked at and what they ordered. This is something that was developed by our own IT team. We have a partnership with Somfy, a French company specializing automation. We are the only company that offers a 10-year warranty for motors. People are becoming increasingly interested in home automation for not just curtains but lights and more. All our showrooms have e-catalogs, and all our salespeople are equipped with tablets that contain a list of our entire product range because it is impossible to display all our products. At present, our priority is to develop an e-commerce solution in line with the clients' needs.</p><h4>What are your goals and priories for the coming year?</h4><p>Our slogan is “the client is king." The client is at the center of all our actions. Notably, we were one of the first companies to establish a customer satisfaction department. The department stays in touch with clients to ensure everything is in order. If the client is not satisfied, we follow up with it immediately. Our idea is to not just satisfy people but to impress them. Our goal is to stay up to date with the best and latest selections and options. Moving forward, we have plans to inject new blood into the company. We see 2019 as the end of the crisis, and in line with this, our aim is to launch our e-commerce platform by the end of the year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an introduction to the company and its evolution?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DHARMDEV BHATT</strong> We started the company with 10-12 people, and today we have around 165 people, with four units in Sharjah and a 20,000-sqm production facility in Ras Al Khaimah, which will be sufficient for the next 10 years. We continue to grow and incorporate new technologies into our business. Initially, we focused on meat and dates and subsequently moved into other sectors including coffee, spices, cosmetics, and pharmaceutics. We do vacuum packaging and modified atmospheric packaging, where there is nitrogen flushing to ensure extended shelf life. This is the reason why we have a loyal customer base. Our clients are extremely pleased with our price, service, quality, and consistency. We have all the required certifications for quality controls, including an effective environmental management system. We are also extremely stringent in terms of quality control, which gives our customers greater assurance. We have introduced technologies that no other regional competitor has, as we focus a great deal on innovation.</p><h4>What have been some of the company's recent achievements and how are you expanding?</h4><p><strong>HARISH TAHILIANI</strong> We have been in a continuous expansion phase and have reached many new markets. We are also coming up with the consumer brand pack. Our company is 32 years old, and while we were formerly only active in the wholesale business, we are now entering consumer packaging as well. We have one project in the Hamriyah free zone that is almost 50% complete. This is a silo project for the storage of pulses with a capacity of 52,000 tons. The commissioning of the silos has already started. By the end of 2019, we will have completed the project and become the first company to make a silo in this region specifically for pulses. We are the second-largest company in the world in terms of pulse production. We have 18 lines for manufacturing under one roof and have dedicated separate lines for different lentil types. Our annual production is about 200,000 tons.</p><h4>What is your short-term plan to expand within the region?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DB</strong> Our products have great demand across the Middle East and Africa. We export all the way to Egypt, providing foil for cheese triangles that in the past only a few European companies were able to provide. It is extremely complex, since it is extremely thin and needs to have a ceiling that maintains the moisture of the cheese. We have our own warehouse and three marketing managers in Saudi Arabia. We won the Saudi government's dates tender, which was extremely prestigious and worth AED4.5 million. The Saudi government hands out dates to many charities, and we supply the packaging material, which has given us a bigger name and reach in the Saudi market.</p><h4>Are you planning to introduce any lines of foods or spices?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HT </strong>This facility was relocated in 2006, and we have not stopped introducing new lines and expanding ever since. Our consumer packaging line has been a work in progress for some time and we will soon be launching it. In fact, 60% of brands in the market buy from us, and we were keen not to disturb that arrangement and compete with our clients. However, we realized consumer packaging is the future. Our current business model does not generate the kind of returns that are present in consumer and retail packaging.</p><h4>What steps are you taking to be more environmentally friendly?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DB</strong> Almost all our waste materials can be recycled for different applications. It is a misconception that plastic affects the environment; what is important is to know how to use and recycle it. We have our in-house recycling facility, and our products do not have adverse environmental effects since no dangerous materials are used. Notably, our products can be recycled to make plastic bags. The government has put in place compulsory biodegradable bags, so all shopping bags will have a D2W mark, which means they are biodegradable within six months to one year. Monolayer is now compulsory in the UAE, so one cannot sell regular plastic films for commercial use. They have to be biodegradable.</p><h4>Is the company considering a more digitalized future? What are your goals for 2020? </h4><p><span></span>HT The processing of lentils is extremely traditional, which makes it hard to implement digitalization. The processing line requires six days to produce the final product. Nonetheless, we are improving efficiency by increasing the number of sorting machines and at present, we have 20 sorting machines for 18 lines. Our vision is to be a one-stop shop for our clients. We aim to achieve the highest standard of manufacturing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>GFI was established in 1992. What have been some of the company's key recent achievements?</h4><p>GFI has achieved a number of milestones over the years, in line with its mission to offer innovative, quality, and trusted products that address our customers' health and wellness needs and make a difference in the lives of not only its consumers but its partners, employees, and the members of the local communities we serve. In fact, we are the first in the Middle East to launch a range of healthy chicken burgers and nuggets. Our Healthy Farm brand has been locally and internationally recognized by different award bodies. Our Plant Protein Burgers were even named the 'Most Innovative Halal Product' at the Gulfood Innovation Awards 2019. Similarly, our brand ZING and Aqua Kale Portions have also gained significant traction. All these accomplishments have helped boost our efforts as we strive to become the best frozen food company in our target markets, guided by our core values of commitment, achievement, teamwork, and entrepreneurship. </p><h4>Are you planning to expand your operations in other regions?</h4><p>We are now in talks with several manufacturers in China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Japan to co-manufacture our Healthy Farm products. Similarly, we are exploring opportunities in the US. </p><h4>What challenges have GFI overcome to maintain its position within the industry and region?</h4><p>GFI's strength is its innovation culture, business acumen, and willingness to understand consumer needs. All these strengths mean it can offer excellent products and solutions and stay ahead of the curve. In recent years, we have witnessed a growing shift in consumer preference, as consumers have become more discerning when it comes to food choices. Apart from being health conscious, modern consumers are also concerned about other issues such as animal welfare and the environment. To keep up with this trend, we have come up with our unique 'Never from Meat' platform to offer delicious and nutritious plant-based products. </p><h4>Recently, GFI launched new plant-based burgers. Can you tell us more about your strategy and your local presence in agronomy?</h4><p>We offer plant-based burgers to address the rising demand for healthy and environment-friendly food products. We produce our newly launched burgers by using significantly less water, land, and energy. The process also releases fewer greenhouse gas emissions. It is important to support plant-based foods as it promotes better agricultural practicises. Our plant protein burgers can be eaten by everyone, including vegans and flexitarians, those who adopt a plant-based diet but occasionally eat meat. In the UAE, 40% of consumers are open to choosing meat alternatives for health, animal welfare, and environmental reasons. They opt to go for plant protein food products not only to improve their health but also to reduce their carbon footprint. Furthermore, in line with the sustainability efforts, we are also running a huge aquafarm in the UAE where kale, a healthy superfood, is grown in water instead of soil in an organic way. On this farm, kale is rapidly processed and formed into Aqua Kale portions, which are then frozen to preserve their freshness, increase shelf life, and maintain nutritional values.</p><h4>How is the company utilizing AI and machine learning?</h4><p>GFI always keeps abreast of the latest technological innovations. We are currently leveraging the power of blockchain technology for our Healthy Farm products.</p><h4>Last year, you received the UAE Innovation Award 2018 and the World Food Innovation Awards 2018. What does this mean to the company?</h4><p>Our new products and innovations continue to draw attention at the regional and international levels, and we will continue to innovate to meet the health and wellness needs of our customers. Take for example our revolutionary 'Never from meat' plant-based protein burgers, which include superfoods such as kale and quinoa. Our commitment to promote the health of our consumers is also aligned with our 'Nothing to hide, the choice is yours' promise. Moving forward, we will continue to do more for the health of people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief overview of the company?</h4><p>Al Douri is a modern enterprise with an inspiring and proud heritage that goes back to the 18th century. A dynamic and forward-looking company, Al Douri specializes in manufacturing, distributing, and retailing premium-quality food. The company stands out for delivering the freshest products by leveraging state-of-the-art production technologies. Since the group's establishment in the UAE in 1979, it has successfully diversified and expanded its portfolio to cover more than 1,000 SKUs. </p><h4>What is the significance of the UAE and Dubai to your business?</h4><p>The development and expansion of the group over the years has been in line with the development and expansion of Dubai, which continuously accomplishes unprecedented achievements in various fields. Since its establishment, the company has set strategic plans to gradually become a leading global food industry company. Al Douri Group has gained a significant market share in the regional coffee and nuts industry. To support our ambitious growth plans, we have made a series of investments, such as opening a modern and fully automated nuts factory, the inauguration of new coffee production line in Dubai to manufacture and package coffee products, and expanding our production lines in the confectionery sector. At present, we export to over 30 countries.</p><h4>What challenges are you facing?</h4><p>People are always looking for something new, and we stay abreast of the latest trends, continuously upgrading our products to cater to consumer demands. Snacking has become one of the major foods and beverage industry trends globally, and so has being health-conscious. At the heart of Al Douri Group is its advocacy of a healthy lifestyle. From innovative and healthy nuts to homemade and 100% natural products, the company provides a wide variety of healthy products. The tech-savvy world prefers everything on the go, and food is no exception. Ordering food and grocery through mobile apps that provide interactive menus and fresh food has become an integral part of modern urban life. Al Douri Group believes in innovation and the importance of adapting to consumer needs, and has taken a series of initiatives to have a strong presence in the e-commerce world.</p><h4>Do you have any expansion plans for your retail shops?</h4><p>We do have an expansion plan for our retail business in the UAE. In 2018, we launched a new model called shop-in-shop, which is designed to provide the experience of traditional market shopping inside hypermarkets. In 2018 alone, we expanded to around 14 units in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Al Ain, and Ras Al Khaimah, with plans to expand further in the UAE. Another aspect we are working on is Al Douri Gourmet, a specialty shop where 60% of the products will be made in front of the customers. We have witnessed an increase in demand for such shops from Europe, the US, Australia, and Canada because people around the world are always looking for something new and authentic.</p><h4>Does the company have any plans regarding AI and digitalization?</h4><p>In early 2018, we implemented a new system in partnership with Microsoft; it improves the performance of our sales, procurement, distribution, and warehouse departments. Our new fully automated coffee factory is considered state of the art, and it only requires two people to operate. We always explore new cutting-edge technologies to increase productivity and improve customer service.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>Expansion, offering new products to customers, increasing our product reach, and maintaining world-class service standards have always been our priorities. As part of our expansions plans, we are going soon to launch our new franchise system. Also, we plan to open offices in Africa, the Levant, Europe, and North America. Recently the group announced its new visual identity, which goes hand in hand with its ambitious expansion plans.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess 2018 in terms of publishing prosperity and cultural output?</h4><p>In 1982, His Highness envisioned having an event to support publishers and started the Sharjah Book Fair mainly for locals and Arab publishers. In the first year, there were around 100 publishers; it was extremely small with a limited number of visitors. His Highness went out and purchased all the books from the publishers and donated them to public libraries and others. The event eventually went from being a local exhibition for books to being the third-largest international book fair. We are currently working on Phase I of SPCFZ with 600 offices over a total area of 100,000sqm and 40,000sqm of buildings. We provide a center for publishers to do business locally and internationally.</p><h4>What are the current achievements of SPCFZ?</h4><p>We did the operation of the city itself over the past 14 months and have been putting in place the policies, alliances, and partnerships with companies and organizations that interact with customers. Our mission is to support the businesses to grow and in Sharjah and internationally. As retaining them is ultimately should happen after fulfilling the main mission of the city. One of our key successes in the past year was receiving companies from 17 countries from around the world. For these companies, we are not only a location to open an office in but also a hub from where they will branch out. From Sharjah, it is easier for them to reach markets around the world due to our central location. One of the options we provide is for a trade license, and we have several options available.</p><h4>What is your strategy to utilize and attract FDI?</h4><p>This is something we have been doing for a long time not only for SPCFZ but also for Sharjah Book Authority and the Sharjah International Book Fair. When we travel and interact with international companies, we acquire their knowledge and experience in the publishing industry, because some companies have been in the industry for 100 years. We have been able to attract many companies that did not plan to come to this region, and they are amazed with what we are able to provide. I tell them they will come as a businessman but definitely will leave as a friend, and this has spread throughout the publishing market. We want to get several companies to serve the community here, as we plan to have a printing company based here to make it easier for publishers, rather than them having to print in China or India. We want to compete in this market and ship publications in 15 days or less rather than 30 days from India and the same with other countries.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>The Sharjah World Book Capital celebrations started in April, and there is a committee to manage the activities for the following year. We are 100% a part of that and support it through the publishers in terms of excellent rates and services. We have five- and 10-year plans where we want to fill the place here with publishers and companies and develop them in a way that we give them all the opportunities in other markets such as Africa, India, Europe, and the Arab world. We are in talks with other countries to understand how to get businesses for our clients. We do not do anything other than serving the vision of Sharjah being a hub of culture and publishers. Since starting here a year ago, one of our clients has published over 300 books, with most of these in Arabic, as Arabic-language publications are growing in popularity. We want to provide a supportive environment and ecosystem for publishers to succeed, and we benefit from all that surrounds us in the area. We hope people understand the vision of the place. We are a place for business and the community. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is being developed in Sheraa right now, and what are you most proud of?</h4><p>We continuously seek to improve our programs and ensure we provide the support entrepreneurs need to build their start-ups. With their feedback in mind, we have revised our offering to focus on filling the critical gap between having a product and launching it into the market. Additionally, Sheraa continues to partner with esteemed organizations such as Expo Live, the Sharjah Youth Council, and Liv Bank—to name a few—to provide inspiration and mentorship to those still at the early stages of developing their business ideas. This “Founder First" philosophy is what I am most proud of about Sheraa. We are dedicated to creating an exceptional experience for everyone who joins our programs, free of charge. Moreover, the relationship extends far beyond their graduation. Our entrepreneurs know Sheraa will always be here to support them. I am also proud of the nature of the start-ups we attract, which is not only focused on financial gain, but also on creating positive impact.</p><h4>Which sector currently exhibits the most potential for growth in Sharjah?</h4><p>Sharjah is on an upward trajectory and is filled with opportunities across numerous sectors. The Emirate's natural strengths continue to lie in heritage, creativity, culture, and education, so tech start-ups in those areas will likely be able to make the most out of the market. Sheraa has partnered with leading entities—Air Arabia, Bee'ah, Crescent Enterprises, and Sharjah Media City (Shams)—to help develop start-ups in other growing industries, namely aviation and tourism, sustainability, social enterprise, and creative economies. We also look forward to working closely with the Sharjah Research, Technology and Innovation Park (SRTIP) to help encourage and support creativity, R&amp;D, research commercialization, and knowledge-intensive businesses in sectors such as mobility, environmental technology, and smart cities. Our partnership with Sandooq Al Watan will play a key role in this, particularly for emerging Emirati innovators.</p><h4>How would you assess the status of Sharjah in terms of AI, and which industry can benefit the most?</h4><p>Sharjah is excited to be developing an innovation ecosystem that leads the way forward on new technologies such as AI. Within universities, degree programs that look at new areas of technology are being introduced, a sign of the opportunities that lie in those fields. SRTIP is a testament to the Emirate's keen focus on developing an innovation ecosystem. These fields are also an emerging area of focus within Sheraa. Our portfolio includes start-ups such as BluePhin Technologies, which has built a smart robot that leverages robotics and AI to collect waste from commercial water bodies. Sweepteq, another recent graduate, is currently developing AI applications to support cameras that track debris on airport runways. Sheraa looks forward to supporting more start-ups in similar fields, especially because every industry will be impacted by AI. We want to be the catalyst that brings these innovations to market.</p><h4>What are your goals and objectives for 2019?</h4><p>Our overall goal for 2019 is to continue to enhance our offerings and find ways to scale our impact. We aim to refine our programs, with more of a focus on innovative tech ventures, provide increased access to the Sharjah market for our start-ups, as well as boost our community engagement. We are also proud to partner with Sharjah World Book Capital to nurture and support entrepreneurial talent across book, publishing, and content-related industries through various competitions and programs. Additionally, our second round of applications for our seed program will open in September, with the six-week program beginning the following month. Organizing for the third Sharjah Entrepreneurship Festival is also well underway. Also, in the pipeline is a program for established (post-Series A) tech start-ups, both local and global, that want access to the Sharjah market, particularly the ones that play to Sharjah's priority sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We are working on arranging and serving that interest even further, but what we have achieved in 2018 is satisfying. We have exceeded expectations.</p><h4>Why does Shams actively support entrepreneurs and SMEs in Sharjah?</h4><p>We thought about entrepreneurs from different aspects. They are not just looking for funding, but also easy setup and a community to work within. They want to increase their knowledge through specific courses, with good instructors. We thought about establishing the community, trying to have them participate in events that we worked on through the team, training courses, start-up meetings, and moving some of their products to show them the best way to market those. We are also working on preparing financial support. We are not only concentrating on their soft skills through courses; we are also trying to give them the chance to meet their peers and interact with them by creating a community around Shams. We are also looking at establishing a program to support these companies and start-ups to continue and further their successes.</p><h4>How would you describe the strength of regulations and how they help start-ups to establish something new and exciting in Sharjah?</h4><p>We have excellent knowledge about how it is done within other free zones and inside the Emirate itself. We thought that we could support start-ups and entrepreneurs to make it easy to start their companies and get them licensed, have them meet their clients, and anticipate their markets. We have not reached the stage where we can certainly say this is the way forward, though we are partnering with other initiatives within the Emirate of Sharjah, such as Sheraa. We are looking at what is missing for entrepreneurs and start-ups and trying to fill those gaps. It thus took longer than just one year, 2018, to get into that business. It needs to be mastered really well. One-third of our building will be dedicated to start-ups and entrepreneurs. We will be trying to start a program specifically for that sector.</p><h4>What kind of licenses do you offer in Shams?</h4><p>We have many different licenses but are concentrating on media and creativity. We have excellent response from the market for companies and individuals who want to embark on working in media or creative businesses. Anything related to that sector we license. We have a list of activities where we can license companies on our website, shams.ae.</p><h4>What kind of machine learning and AI implementations do you see in Sharjah?</h4><p>At Shams, we want to be at the forefront of digitalization. Many of our projects made use of technology and advancements in this field. A great deal of our interaction with the clients already licensed by Shams happens online.</p><h4>What are your main goals and objectives for 2019?</h4><p>Starting work from the new headquarters will allow us to show the business community and media and creativity sector that there is a new place for them. This first building is never going to be the only one, because we are already planning for other buildings and the plan is to even further showcase Shams as a master development project for interested companies, specifically for the media sector to establish their presence in the Emirate. We will build this plan on partnerships and getting the right partners in place at different levels. There are companies more into infrastructure development and construction and companies offering technology, serving a smart development or smart city. 2019 will be an active year for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since Sharjah Media Council's predecessor was established, how has the direction of the council and its main purpose altered?</h4><p>Our constant endeavor and aim of the Sharjah Media Council and its subsidiaries, including Sharjah TV, SGMB, and Shams, is to remain aware and keep pace with all changes taking place in all spheres of the media industry. We have been working to evolve a unified information policy for the media sector in line with the UNESCO's vision, defining its goals and functions as well as norms to strengthen the industry's role in the progress of a cohesive society. Our aim is to help evolve a positive media discourse and constructive narrative in line with the UAE's moderate vision and policy guidelines. These primary visions and aims have not changed and will not change.</p><h4>How do you see the media and broadcasting sector growing and improving here?</h4><p>Although both SMC and SGMB are relatively new, Sharjah has a long and illustrious history of hosting vibrant media in the region. Indeed, the UAE's first Arabic newspaper was published from Sharjah, in addition to several other firsts in various fields. It is no wonder Sharjah was the first Emirate in the country to set up a media council entirely dedicated to serving this rapidly growing and changing sector. Today, the Emirate is home to several newspapers, radio and television channels, and news portals in various languages. Sharjah radio and TV are known for their world-class programming in several languages, and this is only set to grow in the future. Today, the nature and engagement of these media has changed thanks to the arrival of the internet, smartphones, and tablets. However, the media's primary job and responsibility to inform and educate will always remain the same.</p><h4>What is your current strategy for communicating with the public, and what makes SMC unique compared to similar entities in the UAE?</h4><p>SMC is guided by the vision of His Highness the Ruler of Sharjah, who believes effective communication between the government and the people is vital for the fruits of development and progress to reach the real stakeholders. Indeed, all our initiatives through SMC and SGMB are inspired and driven by the same goal and agenda: enhancing government communication and strengthening the bond between the government and the people for the progress of the nation. Our flagship event, the International Government Communication Forum (IGCF), each year brings together world leaders, government officials, and media experts from around the world to discuss how governments can enhance their engagement and communication with people for overall progress and stability.</p><h4>How are you addressing issues related to effective government communication in the region?</h4><p>It is a work in progress. Anyone interacting with various government institutions and officials would say there is a marked difference between the situation today and when we started this journey seven years ago. Today, in their engagement with the media, government agencies are more forthcoming, transparent, and effective. We have been stressing the importance of continuous communication and engagement between government entities and the media to deliver a uniform and accurate message to the media. As a result, whenever there is a crisis today, officials and government spokespersons no longer shy away from engaging the media and presenting their side of the story. This remarkable success is being recognized. It is inspiring others in the region and beyond to do the same.</p><h4>What are your main goals and objectives for 2019 and beyond?</h4><p>In 2019, we have our hands full. Our thrust and focus are on making the most of our success so far and further expanding and strengthen our presence in building media infrastructure and creating economic and employment opportunities for our youth. All our institutions, including the Sharjah Broadcasting Authority, SGMB, Shams and Al Majaz Amphitheater, managed by SGMB, are looking at exciting expansion possibilities, new opportunities, and initiatives. The sky is the limit.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How had your company's performance evolved over the years?</h4><p>Undertaking large projects has upped the ante, and we have responded through a multi-pronged strategy of improving state-of-the-art technology, quality workforce, production standards, and the necessary certifications. Our qualified engineers with the help of proper and modern management systems have resulted in exemplary work standards and made Metallic Equipment one of the main players in the architectural metal work industry.</p><h4>Metallic Equipment has become an international group. To what do you attribute your success in several locations?</h4><p>Our strategy has always been to constantly look for opportunities to expand through better performance, which will always lead to better benefits. Every project we have executed demonstrates our exclusivity and perfection, be it airports in Mumbai and Saudi Arabia, presidential palaces in Africa, or large hotels in Uganda. The ease of working with us has spread via word of mouth. It is no wonder we have grown from a modest team of 14 to a robust workforce of 700 in such a short time.</p><h4>What trends do you identify in the construction industry, and how do you differentiate yourselves from your competitors?</h4><p>In Sharjah, we are improving in different sectors. We rely on proper management systems and utilize new technology. We are coordinating with contractors and clients that are looking specifically for our services because what we offer is different from the rest of the market. We do a wide range of architectural metal work, decorative metal casting, joinery, and special metal finishing such as electroplating, PVD coating, antique finishes, and more. We can offer all these services under one roof to our clients. We continually invest in R&amp;D to acquire new technology, machinery, and well-trained staff to improve our business every day.</p><h4>The manufacturing division of the group in Sharjah was awarded the integrated management systems certificate. What does this mean for the company?</h4><p>The integrated management system contains all the required ISOs, for security, quality standards, and safety of the environment. We have held these certificates for the last seven years and renew them every year. These are the quality benchmarks for the business, and it assures clients that everything in our company is organized and meets international standards.</p><h4>What measures does the factory take to build a more environmentally friendly future?</h4><p>I have headed this Sharjah branch for the past 22 years. When I started, the regulatory authority was not yet ready to deal with environment issues. The system has since evolved, and it provides us with the guidelines on how to comply with international standards for the environment. We must take care of our environment by way of recycling and efficient waste management.</p><h4>What technological improvements have you enacted?</h4><p>In carpentry, there has been only a slight industrial improvement lately, but in metallurgy we are trying to introduce cutting-edge technology. We are now using laser-guided machines to cut metal instead of plasma and water jets, which consumed too much electricity. The new machines were expensive but will be cheaper and better in the long run. We also have new PVD technology for plating to obtain different finishes that can last longer. The PVD machine pollutes less and significantly reduces waste. We have implemented the latest technology in quality control, engineering, and human resource. Most of our plasma, water jets, LED machine, and sanding machine are operated now by AI or computer numerical control (CNC) systems.</p><h4>What are your vision, goals, and priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>We are always planning to expand and improve upon our human resources, our engineers, and our staff. We also must maintain quality but be mindful of costs. Maintaining good relationships with the customers is also important. Our ultimate focus is always on delivering our services to the utmost satisfaction of all our esteemed customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your evaluation of Sharjah's effort to become an eco-friendlier and sustainable Emirate?</h4><p>Bee'ah has been operating for just over 10 years. When we were established, we were a PPP, looking at tackling environmental challenges, and we established goals to benchmark these efforts. One of our goals was zero waste for Sharjah. Today, Sharjah has the highest diversion rate away from landfills in the Middle East, approximately 76%. We have built the infrastructure, and now we have the facilities to treat, segregate, and recycle waste. We have a business unit that does collection and street cleaning, and we also manage landfills. We have become the leaders in waste management across the region. We operate across the UAE, and we have a staff of around 7,000. By 2021, Sharjah will reach zero waste heading to landfills, and we will be the first city in the Middle East to hit this target. To go from our current rate of 76% to our goal of 100%, we entered into a JV with Masdar, and in Sharjah we are building the first waste-to-energy plant in the Middle East. This plant will generate over 30MW of power from waste sources. This JV represents a large investment in some of the most advanced technology in the Middle East. This will help us in our efforts to reach zero waste. We have also created a digital venture called Evoteq, which facilitates digital transformation projects, as well as build digital platforms. As part of our vision of promoting a sustainable quality of life, we are also looking at other forms of renewable energy like solar. Our new HQ will be powered 100% by solar. It will be the office of the future and will be one of the smartest buildings in the world when it goes into operation.</p><h4>Do you have any other accomplishments to share with us?</h4><p>We have been successful in waste management. We are operating across the UAE and manage most of the iconic projects in the country, including Burj Khalifa, Masdar City, and several national landmarks. In the waste management and recycling sector, we are by far the leaders in the UAE. A lot of this success is due to the vision of His Highness, the Ruler of Sharjah, and the PPP structure of the company. In this sector in the Middle East, the PPP model is a successful model. We are a case example of this success. In order to do sustainable initiatives, we must recognize that not all of our efforts will be commercially viable. We are also investing a great deal in research, and we fund sustainability research and studies. We also fund the country's preeminent leadership program, the Sharjah Leadership Program, where future leaders are developed from within Sharjah entities.</p><h4>Could you tell us what you learned from your meetings with delegates from Harvard University?</h4><p>We met with the Emirates Leadership Initiative, a program that the UAE government funds. It allows international students studying public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government to learn more about the issues facing the UAE. A group of students visited the UAE, stopping in Sharjah, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi to understand what the different Emirates are doing. We introduced them to Sharjah's efforts in education, culture, sustainability, and business. As these students become future leaders in different areas, they can understand what the UAE is doing and can help promote its efforts.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for 2019?</h4><p>2019 is a big year for us. We are starting construction on the first waste-to-energy plant in the UAE and the region. This will help Sharjah reach zero waste. Our new headquarters will also be nearing completion. We also have ambitions to go outside of the UAE in 2019. Additionally, this is the year when Bee'ah will become fully digitally enabled.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The UAE is a global leader in implementing environmentally conscious policies, spurring technological innovations in its green energy sector while encouraging the development of sustainable solutions to combat climate change. Yet, among the Emirates, Sharjah, a district just north of Dubai, has proven to be a frontrunner by implementing an eco-friendly agenda through a multitude of ambitious green economy projects, forging a path to sustainability for other nations to follow.</p><p>In March 2019, Sharjah and its government officials established the Emirate's pioneering role in the green technology future by finalizing plans for a AED2-billion (USD544 million) sustainable city powered entirely by solar energy. Managed through a public-private partnership between the Sharjah Investment and Development Authority (Shurooq) and Diamond Developers, the state-of-the-art 668,902sqm city will be built over the next three to five years. </p><p>The sustainable city includes 1,120 residential buildings furnished with rooftop photovoltaic solar panels laid out on a smart grid equipped with the latest energy-efficient technology. The goal is to create a net-zero energy community designed to encourage walkability and the use of clean public transportation. This innovative project integrates green building regulations to create a model urban environment fully outfitted with traditional amenities such as schools, shopping centers, mosques, sports facilities. and even urban farms where residents will be able to cultivate their own vegetables and fruit.</p><p>“In recent years, the standards and criteria of social development have seen remarkable change. Sustainability, natural resources and environment preservation, public health protection, and greenhouse gas reduction are development priorities. These new standards are instrumental to sustainable development. They are an urgent global requirement that cannot be ignored," said Marwan Al Sarkal, the executive chairman of Shurooq, when speaking of the sustainable city development.<br>Another noteworthy project breaking ground in Sharjah is a USD220-million waste-to-energy plant, which is being managed by the Emirates Waste to Energy Company, a joint venture formed by Masdar and Bee'ah. Expected to be open in 2020, the plant will help reduce waste levels in the Emirates by incinerating trash, which would have otherwise ended up in landfills, and turning it into energy to serve the regional electrical grid. The plant will process more than 37.5 tons of municipal solid waste an hour and is expected to help the UAE move closer to its target of diverting 75% of waste from landfills.</p><p>The task is no small undertaking, as the average person in the UAE generates roughly 2.7kg of waste per day, more than double the average European, who produces 1.2kg of waste per day. The Sharjah waste-to-energy plant will treat more than 300,000 tons of municipal waste each year with the capacity to generate 30MW of electricity.</p><p>Speaking on the strong financial support for the green energy project, Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, chief executive officer of Masdar, said, “the region's first commercial waste-to-energy project, and one of the largest of its type, not only illustrates the bankability of advanced renewable energy technology and the renewables sector's growing appeal to both the local and international investment community, but it is also a testament to the attractiveness of Sharjah as an investment destination."<br>In addition to laying out the plans for a 21st century green urban community and pioneering waste-to-energy solutions, officials in Sharjah have also been implementing the green technologies to help citizens practice environmental consciousness in everyday life. In 2016, the Sharjah municipality introduced Wi-Fi-enabled smart trash bins that are programmed not just to compact trash, but also to notify waste operators when individual receptacles have reached capacity. After a successful trial run, Bee'ah, which is overseeing the project, is installing hundreds of smart bins on street corners in Sharjah, as well as throughout the UAE. </p><p>A similar innovation, forged at the intersection of convenience and environmental sustainability, includes the reverse vending machines being installed in Sharjah. Also operated by Bee'ah, these vending machines serve as collection points for pedestrians to deposit plastic bottles and aluminum cans in exchange for lottery tickets. Participants are given lottery codes that can help them win prizes, such as Apple TVs and Nespresso machines. </p><p>By making recycling fun, trash collection efficient, and designing the cities of the future, Sharjah is staking its claim as model green economy with its all-encompassing approach to sustainable development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the operations and main achievements of Unique Group?</h4><p>Founded in Sharjah in 1993, Unique Group is a leading integrated solutions provider for the oil and gas, renewables, subsea, and defense industries. The group operates through its seven main divisions: survey equipment, marine and subsea, diving and life support, buoyancy and ballast, on-site engineering, specialised boats, and medical technology. As a group, we have been able to continually make global investment amid the downturn, whilst diversifying our products. Our investment in equipment and new technologies has resulted in the widening of the services we provide to our customers.</p><h4>Which of Unique Group's divisions are the most profitable?</h4><p>We take a smart approach to our divisional work, ensuring we provide bespoke, turnkey solutions for our clients by combining the services our various divisions supply. In offering a complete, in-house service, we provide significant time and cost savings across the board, as well as simplified client communication channels. We strive to keep our current assets running and operationally excellent, regardless of the complexity of ongoing projects.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges in Sharjah?</h4><p>Over the past five years, the Sharjah government has invested tremendous amounts and has developed a truly unique value proposition. As a result, attracting talent to Sharjah is no longer difficult. However, the challenges we now face are similar to those experienced in other regions, such as high administrative costs and cashflow. Payment collection under the current market situation is strenuous and one of our major hurdles to overcome as we continue to grow.</p><h4>In which region are you looking to expand?</h4><p>Business development in Saudi Arabia is key for us in the coming years. The opportunities are vast, and it is a great time to help our customers through all our business units. We currently have several interesting projects ongoing in the region. Latin America is a market of interest, and we have entered into Mexico and Brazil as a part of our expansion strategy. Expansion in Europe, via our base in the Netherlands, as we look to expand our presence in the offshore wind sector. </p><h4>How would you evaluate the human talent in Sharjah?</h4><p>As per a report by FDI Intelligence, Sharjah has been ranked among the top 10 small and medium sized cities in the world. We have been operating out of the UAE for 25 years and employ more than 300 people in this region. Most of our employees are technical people, with a qualified industry background relevant to our business; we clearly continue to attract the right talent in the region. We have a diverse spread of employees and employ talent from across the globe. We have also been focused on in-country value and providing opportunities to young Emiratis as well.</p><h4>What are your digitalization efforts?</h4><p>We aim to digitize our operations, fundamentally providing helpful information for both ourselves and our clients. We are also working to improve the levels of automation in our product lines and recently launched our very own USV, Uni-Cat, a fully automated product designed for survey operations.</p><h4>What are your goals over the coming year?</h4><p>Our goal has not changed since year one. That goal is growth and adding value to our customers and stakeholders. We want to continue to add new technologies, especially in the clean energy space. We also want to grow internally as an organization, where our processes get better and leaner, and we increase diversity along with our knowledge base. We want to deliver to our customers an even better product or technology that is not only future-proof but also environmentally friendly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has SNOC evolved in the last two years?</h4><p>SNOC made significant progress in advancing all its strategic projects over the last two years. This includes new exploration activity in the Emirate, the Sharjah LNG Project, gas storage, and diversification into downstream markets. On exploration, SNOC completed a seismic survey of nearly 900sqkm onshore, which paved the way for the launch of a bid round for exploration. The bid round was successful, and three onshore areas were awarded to oil and gas major ENI early in 2019. Significant progress was made on all aspects of the Sharjah LNG import project toward achieving final investment decision (FID) on the project in 2019. A gas storage pilot project started in 2017, and plans are to start up the full project in 2021. SNOC also started diversification efforts into the downstream market by delivering all its LPG production to the local markets with plans to expand into other markets.</p><h4>How did you choose ENI, and what are you looking from this partnership?</h4><p>The bidding round was managed by SNOC on behalf of the Sharjah Petroleum Council. It was executed through a fully transparent and structured approach. ENI provided the most competitive bids, enabling it to win all three areas. We are pleased with the outcome, as ENI is one of the top-10 largest integrated oil and gas companies in the world. SNOC is also well established in Sharjah's gas sector, and by combining our local experience and ENI's international experience, this partnership will produce great results.</p><h4>What have been your recent initiatives regarding the gas storage pilot you are currently developing?</h4><p>We have already started a pilot project for gas storage, with the intention to commission Phase I of the storage project by end of 2020. We see this as a strategic energy security project for the country, and we are open to partnership with other national oil companies on it.</p><p>What environmentally sustainable options are on the horizon for the oil sector, and how do you seek to implement these?<br>Reducing our impact on global warming has been high on our agenda since 2000. We have managed to reduce our methane emissions and flaring levels by more than 90%. We track and report our greenhouse gas emissions. I personally support a phased approach to eventually replace all fossil fuels usage with renewables; however, until we get there, gas remains as the cleanest fossil fuel with the least impact on the environment.</p><h4>Are you planning any new bids in the near future?</h4><p>Our plan is to continue to launch bid rounds for other open areas in Sharjah. Our experience from the last round has taught us that one has to do their homework to achieve success. If we just open up areas without the proper planning, then we will either get poor bids or no bids. For example, for the latest bid, we conducted a full seismic study costing millions of dollars; we used the latest technology and put in place strict quality control measures to make sure we produce high-resolution seismic data. We made the data available to all the bidders and declared we would operate Block B to demonstrate how confident we are about Sharjah's potential. Similarly, we have to invest time and money in other open areas to ensure that future bid rounds are equally successful.</p><h4>What are your major plans, vision, and priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>Alongside the Sharjah LNG project, we are working on our other major plans. The exploration just started, and since it is a 30-year concession, the management of these three concessions constitutes a major part of our mid-term and long-term plans. Another important goal is gas storage. In 2018, we set ourselves a target to have gas storage facilities by 2021; that remains our target, and its establishment is planned to take place by end-2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What recent economic and market trends have you noticed in Sharjah?</h4><p>The UAE's rise as one of the world's most productive oil producers, coupled with its success in its non-oil sectors, have turned it into the Middle East's second-largest economy and one of the most open in the world. Improving oil prices, narrowing deficits, and continued public spending are expected to support economic growth averaging 2.5% across the GCC in 2020, according to Moody's Investors Services. Sharjah's diversified economy, with no single sector comprising more than 20% of GDP, has helped cushion the local economy from oil price volatility. We anticipate GDP growth to accelerate and provide support for the residential market, as regional economies adapt to the new norm in oil prices, Dubai diversifies in line with its economic diversification strategy, and infrastructure spending continues ahead of Expo 2020.</p><h4>What are some of the biggest challenges investors in Sharjah are currently facing?</h4><p>The UAE has proactively exerted efforts to be at the forefront by developing key mechanisms that ensure its economy remains stable in uncertain times. Sharjah continues to make steadfast progress in its economic activity with significant stability, which gives investors greater confidence. The Emirate has government-backed initiatives to encourage global firms, SMEs, and local start-ups to locate here. The creation of these new free zones forms are part of a wider strategy to help prepare Sharjah's economy for Industry 4.0 by attracting innovative, knowledge-led ventures to Sharjah. MANAFA has not faced any challenges in Sharjah; in fact, the Sharjah Real Estate Registration Department registered a 46% increase in the number of real estate transactions during the first six months of the year. It also announced a 37.2% increase in the value of real estate transactions made in 3Q2017, according to global property consultancy Cluttons.</p><h4>How is increasing digitalization and AI transforming business operations in Sharjah?</h4><p>The region conducts annual technology week, through GITEX, announcing numerous new products and services. The technology event sees over 100,000 visitors gathered through the five-day tech week, which happens twice a year. The main factor that has highlighted the focus on digital transformation has been the aggressive push from regional governments to adapt new technologies such as AI. According to a report released by PwC earlier this year, the economic impact of AI adoption on GCC economies is estimated to reach roughly USD227 billion by 2030. AI is expected to contribute USD135.2 billion or 12.4% of GDP in Saudi Arabia by 2030, USD96 billion (13.6% of GDP) in the UAE, and USD45.9 billion (8.2% of GDP) for other GCC countries. The average annual growth rate of AI's contribution to the GCC is expected to range between 29 and 34%, with the UAE seeing the highest growth rate at 33.5%.</p><h4>As 2019 has been declared the year of tolerance, how would you assess the ways businesses in Sharjah are reacting to initiatives to improve diversity and inclusion?</h4><p>The move will highlight the UAE as a global capital for tolerance, via its various legislative and policy-oriented goals to enhance the role of the country in instilling the values of coexistence and peace in local, regional, and international communities. Over the years, the country stands united and recognizes its initiatives to advance tolerance and peace while countering intolerance and violence around the world. Sharjah has been supporting the initiative as it strongly believes in promoting diversity across business, strengthening government roles to encourage and promote tolerance among young people, and prevent them from fanaticism and extremism. They are the future of the country and the next generation of leaders.</p><h4>What are your main goals and objectives for 2019?</h4><p>2019 is expected to be challenging, yet the government's support through various legislation that, for example, ease entry visas and foreign ownership by the UAE cabinet will most likely lead to additional demand in the UAE property market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What services do you provide?</h4><p>Hazel Middle East is the trading arm of Groupe Veritas and caters to the markets in the Middle East, North Africa, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. We are the trading wing, bringing in chemicals from all over the world, storing them here, and distributing them all over. We differentiate ourselves from other traders by virtue of having assets on the ground. We offer back-to-back trading, and we have a full-fledged warehouse. We started this business in the UAE in 2007. We are in the petrochemicals sector, and our chemicals go into paints, perfumes, construction materials, detergents, and more. The paint industry is our biggest customer. We also store and distribute the basic raw materials for many other applications. We deal with no less than 300 different types of chemicals. The terminal that we purchased in 2010 was too small, and we purchased the current plot we are on, a 30,000-sqm plot, and built 31 tanks. We can also be seen as a third-party storage facility, where others can store their materials. Our tanks were built to store chemicals and are sort of universal in nature. This flexibility allows us to switch products easily and makes us a force to be reckoned with. We started with a terminal of seven tanks, a warehouse, and then this terminal that is universal for petrochemicals and petroleum products. We also have the added advantage of having a process block for distillation. Here, we have an added advantage because we have four pipelines from the sea to our terminal. The vessels berth on our jetty and transfer chemicals directly to our tanks, and from there we distill or store them in our tanks and distribute them again. We also have a blending facility and a drumming facility capable of drumming both solvents and bitumen. This again makes us miles ahead of our competitors.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the current energy industry sector in Sharjah?</h4><p>Sharjah always used to have a shortage of power, but now the situation has improved. The economic crisis has been ongoing for three years, and it is difficult for businesses everywhere. The situation is improving as far as energy supply is concerned. There is a thrust on non-conventional energy as well. Hazel is doing a great deal in this field in India and plans to venture into the UAE in near future.</p><h4>How is your sector adapting to AI and digitalization?</h4><p>We have not been using AI, though digitalization is certainly a way of life. Everything we do is digitalized and stored on the cloud. Backups are available, and if anything is wrong here, we can make the change digitally. We also have an intercom with a direct digital line to our head office in India. Our control room is a massive facility, and from there we can run the facility and control a pump, temperature, and pressure of any tank. Our entire terminal is controlled by CCTV. This coverage is also available online. It is not about reducing labor but is a matter of convenience. Digitalization does generate downstream jobs.</p><h4>What are your main priorities and goals? </h4><p>We want to be seen as the single one-stop shop for all our customers. They can bring in anything, store them here, and export them out to any country. We are capable of distilling their products, and they can sell it in their markets. We also want to be seen as championing corporate social responsibility. We care for our environment and the health and safety of our employees. We have a robust risk assessment and environmental impact assessment system, and we are a responsible company. The Director of HFZA and other senior officials are supportive, and with their continuous support, we see ourselves growing stronger in the future and contributing to the country's economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of Sharjah's financial sector?</h4><p>Sharjah is well diversified and has its own safeguards. There is exposure to regional and international investors, but there is a lot of local flavor, with a concentration on regional names that understand Sharjah and its culture. Importantly, the free zones have been extremely well designed. A number of industries in the UAE are based in Sharjah. Personally, I am a strong advocate of doing business in Sharjah. There is a tight-knit and knowledgeable business community here. We are still producing real estate that is affordable to all segments. General consolidation in the banking industry in the UAE is a healthy trend. It produces economies of scale. I do not subscribe to the notion that larger banks are better, but they can create efficiencies in terms of staffing, funding, and usage of resources. For us as a medium enterprise, we are under no pressure to consolidate at this stage. There are many opportunities, and we are capitalizing on that.</p><h4>How can UAB utilize AI and digitalization?</h4><p>It's essential for banks to move toward digital channels because customers are opting to use these channels. We need to take a proactive approach to delivering best-in-class digital services. With retail clients, the majority of people would prefer to finish all tasks online. We are reacting to it in terms of the products we will launch. Corporate clients demand efficient online capabilities that allow them to apply for letters of credit guarantees, transfers, and manage their payrolls. There is a huge benefit to going digital in terms of time, energy, money, and effort. There is great competition in terms of who provides the best digital services, but this is a competition that has no finish line. As long as it keeps evolving, we need to deal with an open mind. With that mindset, we have revamped our website and are working on providing the market with a top-notch offering. We are enhancing our retail and corporate products. We want our end product to be competitive and recognized as best in class. We are heading in this direction, and we will get there.</p><h4>How are contactless payments, e-commerce, and peer-to-peer banking changing the world of finance?</h4><p>They are coming in and, in some ways, are being viewed as competition to us. As long as they serve their purpose and the customer, and there is proper governance and controls, these new developments are good for the sector. Most central banks have launched a Treat your Customer Fairly regime. This is a top priority for us. At the end of the day, we are serving customers, and the whole mission is to provide the most cost effective, fair, and efficient offering. We see the human angle as an important anchor in banking. A customer may or may not trust an app or a machine but with a basic human touch, it is a much better feeling all together. These services and demographics are changing, but core banking will always be required, no matter what happens. The young generation has a completely different set of demands that we are obliged to meet efficiently. In a country like the UAE, we have an effective regulator that applies the best international practices and having such a regulator adds financial stability to the country and its well-diversified economy.</p><h4>What new projects is UAB currently developing?</h4><p>In general, we are enhancing our corporate banking products. Additionally, we are enhancing our treasury and cash management products and improving our turnaround time. On the retail side, we are looking at further segregation of the product offering and enhancement. Notably, we have improved our turnaround time greatly in recent months, reducing it to one-fifth in some cases.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have Invest in Sharjah's major accomplishments been?</h4><p>Since its establishment in 2016, Invest in Sharjah has focused all its efforts in strengthening the Emirate's economic and investment positioning on both local and international fronts. Our aim is to create a long-term network with global businesses, trade authorities, and investment agencies around the world. We work closely with the UAE Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a testament to our continued alignment to the wise leadership of the UAE and that of the Emirate of Sharjah. Today, the key sectors that continue to thrive in Sharjah's diversified economy are tourism and leisure, healthcare, environment, transport and logistics, education, and light manufacturing. These developments reflect the growing opportunities businesses can explore in investing in the future. Locally, Invest in Sharjah organizes a number business roundtables every year targeting a specific country, welcoming its high-level delegation, ambassador, and a number of businesses, and establishments based in Sharjah but are originally from these targeted countries. During these roundtables, we continue to reinforce the government's role in supporting investors. Such events provide a more personal touch between investors and the opportunities in Sharjah. Also gearing up for its fifth edition in 2019 is the Sharjah FDI Forum, the first-of-its-kind forum specializing in FDI in the region and an international platform for businesses, scholars, and political leaders to explore and discuss investment opportunities in Sharjah and the region.</p><h4>What are Sharjah's future plans for renewables or environmentally friendly projects?</h4><p>Sharjah is home to some of the most natural, environmental, and historic sites in the region, and these features reflect the rich heritage the Emirate enjoys in maintaining its eco-friendly status. As a result, there are a number of entities and businesses in Sharjah tasked with leading, developing, and growing Sharjah's environmental sector, with prominent names such as the Sharjah Environmental Company (Bee'ah), the Sharjah Investment and Development Authority (Shurooq), the Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority (SEWA), the Sharjah Municipality, and more. This new project is expected to lead and provide a new standard of living in Sharjah, incorporating the most advanced eco-friendly technologies, renewable energy features, and sustainable agricultural solutions. There are also other projects from Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority (SEWA), which signed agreements with GE and Siemens to build advanced power plants here. The Emirate will then buy the energy from these companies and distribute it to customers.</p><h4>What recent regulatory changes contributed to the outstanding FDI inflow of USD11 billion in 2018?</h4><p>The new decree by his Highness Sheikh Khalifa will boost this figure. The new law of FDI allows investors in some sectors to retain 100% ownership. There are also new, easier visa laws for investors that will help them do business. The visa for innovators, scientists, and extraordinary students living in the UAE will boost FDI inflows to the UAE. In the real estate sector, Sharjah recently changed some of the laws on owning real estate, especially in new developments. In addition, in the manufacturing field, we have the Sharjah Industrial Oasis, which is part of Sharjah's management, to encourage more companies to invest in manufacturing.</p><h4>What are Invest in Sharjah's main goals and objectives for 2019?</h4><p>We plan to visit new cities and markets as part of our strategy of positioning Invest in Sharjah as a leading investment promotion agency, including re-visiting cities and markets to further reinforce our presence and network. We will also continue to collaborate with our local partners, both public and private, to facilitate and promote all the latest legislations and regulations that continue to boost the practical and efficient business setup opportunities in Sharjah, as well as licensing onshore and offshore investments. Overall, we are working to make Sharjah one of the top five investment destinations in the Middle East.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main achievements been since the company's establishment, and how has it evolved?</h4><p>The original companies now forming the Faisal Holding group were founded by Sheikh Faisal bin Sultan Al Qassimi in the 1970s. Sheikh Faisal is the pioneer of numerous significant enterprises in the UAE. Approximately five years ago, Sheikh Faisal and his key board members conducted exhaustive strategic studies into this group together with top global business advisors producing recommendations on the sectors of business we should focus on and how we should structure our organization to take it to the next level. This has been the basis of our clear long-term strategy, which continues to be successfully implemented in guiding our business strategy and planning, along with the company operating as a corporate entity with all the corporate governance according to international standards.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the economic trends emerging in Sharjah?</h4><p>As far as trends are concerned, it is all about efficiency and productivity, making the maximum use of one's assets, and ensuring they have the right positioning in the marketplace, no matter what business they are in. To remain competitive, one needs that edge. There are trends of specialization; businesses now have more focus because they cannot be everything to everyone. It is thus crucial to remain competitive and cost effective. </p><h4>Which sector currently exhibits the most growth?</h4><p>Our group's strategy, decided five years ago and which I have been implementing, is to remain focused on some of the sectors we were already successful in, one of which is hospitality. We own hotels in the UAE and the region, seeing continuing growth in tourism and thus hospitality. Tourism is huge globally and is the fastest-growing industry in the world. We have great confidence in the tourism potential in the region. The UAE has led the tourism situation here, and we will remain, and even expand our exposure, in hospitality. When we entered the healthcare sector, we also wanted to be extremely focused. We did not just want to build hospitals. Our research found there were enough hospitals in the marketplace and even an oversupply; however, that is not to say that there are no highly focused opportunities in this sector. One of these is the first national dental network in the UAE, which we are already rolling out with our multinational healthcare partners.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>The main goals are our expansion into the two new sectors of healthcare and education, where we actively have initiatives rolling out. On the hospitality side of our business, we continue to invest and develop. Our new ECOS-brand hotel, which we will open in Dubai South in 2020, will be the first of this unique special brand focusing on guest experience coupled with excellent value. We are opening it just before Expo 2020 right by Expo and Dubai World Central, which will give the hotel an initial boost to its operations and excellent brand exposure. Opportunities in resort hotels are also good, and we will be developing a significant resort hotel in Ras Al Khaimah, though we are positioning it in a unique way, as a low-rise environmentally friendly hotel at a beautiful natural beach with natural attractions that we will make all about the environment and experience. Our wholesale distribution business will also continue expanding in Oman, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. We have also repositioned our marketing agency business, which services all the sectors we are invested in. Real estate forms a large part of our portfolio and we continue to invest, develop, and manage our extensive holdings across the UAE, plus optimize our land bank assets. We also continue to be invested and active with our associated companies in the construction and manufacturing sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SRTI Park is the first major milestone of the American University of Sharjah Enterprises (AUSE). Can you give us a short introduction of the development?</h4><p><span></span>SRTI Park, an initiative of AUSE, was established in 2016 by royal decree of Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council of the UAE, and Ruler of Sharjah. SRTI Park aims to develop and manage an innovation ecosystem within a free zone that promotes R&amp;D and supports enterprise activities and the triple-helix collaboration of industry, government, and academia. The park focuses on six verticals: water technology, digitalization, transport and logistics, environmental technology, renewable technology, and production, design, and architecture.</p><h4>Phase I is expected to initially accommodate 200 companies. What are the highlights of this achievement?</h4><p>Phase I of the park comprises three inter-linked buildings over some 60,000sqft and will house the park's headquarters, laboratories, innovation centers, and a host of start-ups, SMEs, and anchor companies that focus on contributing to the R&amp;D and innovation culture in the region. Future phases include a center of excellence, a technology museum, a hotel, a convention center, and housing units.</p><h4>How do you see the innovative R&amp;D sector growing and improving here?</h4><p>It is not surprising that Sharjah has achieved a leading position on the international map. The Emirate has made education and science the foundation for progress and development in line with the vision of Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi. </p><h4>How is increasing digitalization becoming an increasingly hot topic affecting development in Sharjah?</h4><p>The park is unique as a nucleus designed to emulate the path of economic diversification, making the partnership between the public and private sectors an important strategic priority in order to increase spending on R&amp;D projects at all technical, social, and economic levels. The main features of the park are its solid pillars of technological progress in the service of community development.</p><h4>What sustainability projects are you launching at the park?</h4><p>We make use of natural resources, from solar energy and salt water to humidity to provide a source of irrigation for agriculture and to ensure the success of pilot projects by focusing on the importance of innovative farming methods and their many benefits compared to conventional methods of irrigation. The research site specializes in the development of sustainability and natural resource conservation technologies, offering innovative technological solutions for agriculture through the use of infrastructure in urban areas such as balconies, houses, and terraces. This includes the tower farm, a vertical agricultural system. The project introduces a new concept of sustainable agriculture through the practice of using the principles of ecology, which is the study of the relationships between living organisms and their environment. One of the most important research areas at Merlin Digital's Sustainable Technologies Research Site is for a sustainable water project, more specifically a solar desalination still that produces 10 times the amount of pure, distilled water per square meter per day from any source of contaminated water—seawater, groundwater, and others—compared to classic solar stills. The idea is to re-engineer solar distillation, a basic technology that humans have known for thousands of years.</p><h4>What are your main goals and objectives for 2019 and beyond?</h4><p>The park is a milestone in the pursuit of scientific research to the benefit of society, economy, and humanity. It is based on an ambitious vision to enhance the UAE's and Sharjah's presence as a key player in shaping the digital revolution, technological transformation, and economic openness, offering a competitive edge to attract leading companies and the best minds and creative talents to undertake research and innovation activities that support overall development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess 2018, and what recent market trends and changes have affected Sharjah's exports?</h4><p>2018 was a significant year of numerous challenges based on global fluctuations in the market. When the world suffers from downturns, it can make the business climate unpredictable and difficult to manage. Nevertheless, we achieved the same export level in terms of value to both established and new markets, especially in East Africa. We also have important clients in Central Africa. The food and beverage sectors in these locations are showing considerable export potential, and we are determined to make our mark. In certain areas, there was some export decline, but these were often counterbalanced by increased demand elsewhere. We are happy with what we have achieved in 2018 and optimistic for 2019.</p><h4>Could you tell us about recent projects or developments that the SEDC is involved in?</h4><p>One major goal is enhancing exporter capability, in terms of manufacturing and technology. We need to ensure that products meet EU standards and regulations in order to export to that market. Recently, we have been working on joint products for export to several European countries, mainly plastics and lubricants. We are optimistic about the center's performance, once it is finalized and working. We hope it will help manufacturers both in Sharjah and across the UAE, and will, therefore, become a regional presence.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2019?</h4><p>East Africa is the main market we are currently targeting, and we have been focused on it since 2015. After our market assessment of 2014, we discovered that several products could be exported, such as electromechanical items. Since then, we have sent various delegations into the region, the last featuring over 30 companies, confirming the scale of our operations there. Furthermore, we are hosting a buyer program whereby many buyers from East Africa visit the Sharjah market first-hand and buy from us. A key challenge we have to overcome is the shipping costs and dealing with custom regulations that differ depending on the country we are exporting to. There is no other retail businesses like our company in Sharjah. We had seen growth of 3% by the end of 2018, and this hopefully will foreshadow further positive results. While we are focused on East Africa, we are evaluating other countries and markets, especially in Central Africa, where we would engage with the same industries as before. We are considering doing business in Nigeria in 2019. We want to put in place a five-year plan for this and other markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does UBT regard technological advancements in its work?</h4><p>Technology in education is essential; it has basically created efficiency on a large scale. We introduce technology at all level, from curriculum to operations, and the next international advisory board we are having in November 2019 is discussing the so-called “technolution," or technology evolution. The technolution of education is about how technology will take the level of education from where we are today into tomorrow. We have around 20 chairmen, chancellors, directors, and global experts coming to discuss the role of technology and how we can move from beyond standard, classic, instructional-type education to a new way and how that will look in 2030; what do we need to start now to be able to lead tomorrow. The international  advisory board is dedicated to UBT, though at every session we have a different topic that UBT seeks answers to. The question on technology is an answer that will be dealt with in November in the framework of technolution. Technology is no longer a tool; it is the infrastructure of new buildings of the future. If we do not base everything on technology, we will be out of the prevailing context.</p><h4>UBT designed an activity-based costing module called Quswa to measure its performance. How has that product influenced your work?</h4><p>The word Quswa means “maximization," and we maximize the output of the five pillars: the book, the classroom, the students, teachers, and the curriculum. This process of internal standards is significantly more difficult than accreditation. Every program at UBT is reviewed on a semesrterly basis, and we track those five factors. We track the evaluations of students against the faculty and faculty against senior faculty. We also track the relevance of the curriculum against local needs. Projects that are related to 2030, for example, are being introduced. That is to provide greater relevance, to come even closer, and to bridge the gap between theory and what actual job requirements require one to understand in the market. Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman has said he wants to focus on local content and increase it, and we take that to mean local military manufacturing, local plastic manufacturing, and also not to exclude local case studies for the academic sector to use. In many universities, data like those we have from Quswa are only compiled for accreditation purposes, not actually taken into consideration. They do not drive a strategy or create a vision. We are keen to develop, and because one cannot develop something without measuring it, we had to come up with Quswa academics, Quswa operations and Quswa manpower. Everything must be challenged, and qualification is only data; it drives everything. We have followed our market practice and intuition more than data in the past, though that is no longer the case for UBT since 2015.</p><h4>What model would attract you as a private player to invest in future privatization programs?</h4><p>Today, the government has only offered investors, for the K12 education sector,  a role effectively as real estate developers. The investor would effectively have a maintenance contract and would have little control over the actual educational process and no ability to hire and fire teachers and no control over the core business. In the case of the Higher Education sector for instance,  If a faculty member is hired to teach five courses but only teaches three and still gets full pay, is it only because of job security? If job security is the goal, there is no need for Vision 2030; that also applies in the case for researchers. If productivity, efficiency and effectiveness are the goals, we should restructure the way job security works and link it directly with performance and productivity, that would definitely create a more competitive market place and drive job creation at satisfactory levels. Opening the doors for the private sector to manage public universities against agreed-upon KPIs in areas such as academia, operations, development, and strategy. This is the model I see as optimal for the privatization initiatives for this sector.</p><h4>How does Vision 2030 inform your viewpoint and approach in the sector?</h4><p>I see Vision 2030 as shifting the weight from the public to the private sector, enabling the private sector to become a giant by 2030, introducing many new industries including sports and entertainment for both men and women to boost the economy, and creating holdings that fund other projects that the private sector can contribute to. Personally, I have never been more optimistic in my life. The solutions may not be there yet, and it could take a long time, though the decisions will be made quickly. The higher education sector needs drastic change, and we truly need the Crown Prince's intervention, especially when it comes to educational loans. We don't need open ended scholarship programs for majority of high school graduates; they help the business model but have a long term negative impact on student quality. I am calling for students loans; those who are serious will come to UBT and create a more serious UBT after they graduate. Our reputation will improve more as the students pay back the loans. We could have more industry-driven universities with a love for knowledge and research. I am sure the Crown Prince could take this decision immediately. Universities, UBT specifically, is willing to subsidize and pay the interest on behalf of the student for the duration of their studies. We are very flexible for as long as we can continue to develop. Other universities would be willing to accept this model, especially non-profit universities that have more to gain than to lose from this model.</p><h4>Looking to the future, are there any challenges you want to highlight?</h4><p>Despite the appreciated efforts and attempts made by concerned ministries and government bodies to enhance the quality of private education and training institutions; private education still faces challenges and is burdened by bureaucratic procedures, overlapping regulations and duplications in authority from and between different regulation bodies related to private education and training. One challenge is that of leasing land to private colleges and universities. Our main campus is based on government-owned land, which has been the case for 20 years. The contract will end in four years, and we have been calling for a renewal. There has been a decree to lease land to universities at a subsidized or supportive rate so that we can create more universities and enable private investments. Now that we are ending our contract, that decree is no longer applicable, although its not been officially reversed. We have invested over SAR500 million on buildings and infrastructure on a piece of land owned by the government, and now for renewal we fear it will reclaim those buildings and land without taking into consideration that we initiated the building of this whole town. There were no roads, electricity, or water. We built kilometers of roads at our own expense and we powered the whole campus on power generators for over nine years. We need to have clearer legislation allowing for a subsidized lending scheme for universities, local or international; while preserving more benifit for local content (Local Universities). We have a contingency plan already been approved and granted a license from the municipality. For the new project on Medina Road, we have purchased the land in a prime location. If the Ministry of Municipality does renew the contract, we will build these extended campuses because we have reached the maximum on this leased land. We can no longer build new colleges, so the new project is happening no matter what. The female college is also happening on a new privately owned land, and it will change the way people see girls' education. We have a 550-seat auditorium, state of the art sports facilities, views of the Red Sea, and the best technology available. Challenges on the private education and training sector call for an Independent commission on Higher Education &amp; Training. With a focus on enabling private education and private training centers. That commission should have the flexiability needed to support and enable the already operational entities today, to safely and promptly land regional and international investments waiting to be part of the K12, Higher Education, and Training Institutions of tomorrow and help grow the private sector's contribution from the total education sectorto anticipated levels and beyond at the year 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>NIDLP was established with a wide-ranging mandate to attract USD453 billion in FDI by 2030. Can you further detail your mandate and main strategies? </h4><p>NIDLP seeks to transform Saudi Arabia into a leading industrial powerhouse and a global logistics hub in promising growth sectors with a focus on Industry 4.0. There are 34 governmental entities working together with NIDLP to implement more than 300 initiatives. We also seek to improve the competitive environment by providing the necessary enablers such as better policies and regulations, financial enablement, infrastructure and industrial land development, special economic zones, R&amp;D support, and export development. NIDLP also aims to leverage the country's unexploited natural resources, which are estimated at around USD1.33 trillion, take advantage of demand in the region to stimulate new industries, and transform the economy into a model based on PPPs. When we designed our initiatives and strategies, we took into consideration the geographic diversity and human and natural resources distribution of the country to make our program an effective tool in field planning and ensuring balanced development between the different regions. </p><h4>NIDLP has four priority sectors: industry, mining, energy, and logistics. Can you elaborate on the rationale behind the selection of these industries? </h4><p>NIDLP aims to achieve inclusive development of the industrial sector, including developing promising and competitive industries and increasing their share of GDP and the job market. In terms of mining, NIDLP aims to develop the sector and increase its contribution to the national economy. The program covers all stages of the value chain, from exploration to mining and intermediate industries. Saudi Arabia has well over USD1.3 trillion of untapped potential that can be activated with USD120 billion of investment in the mining value chain. In the energy sector, NIDLP aims to enhance power supplies and prices, with the ultimate objective being achieving fiscal balance while maintaining the Saudi economy's competitiveness and improving the competitiveness of the electricity sector through restructuring and exploring power exportation opportunities. In addition, we aim to increase the share of renewable energy. For logistics, NIDLP seeks to position the Kingdom as a global logistics hub, focusing on three key components: creating an export platform, developing a regional distribution platform, and establishing an efficient internal distribution network to enable industry and service supply chains. All those components aim to improve infrastructure, transport networks, and logistics standards in order to develop freight and passenger services, turning KSA into an international logistics hub capable of leveraging its geographical location. Our plan to improve our transportation and logistics infrastructure is backed by USD35 billion in investments. Overall, by 2030, NIDLP targets to add some USD453 billion in private-sector investment, contribute USD320 billion to GDP, add 1.6 million new jobs, and generate USD266 billion growth in exports and re-exports. </p><h4>How do you envision moving toward Industry 4.0? </h4><p>To accelerate the adoption of Industry 4.0 in the manufacturing sector, a comprehensive program has been launched with a total capital of around USD1.4 billion. The program covers different initiatives, including building the enabling network and connectivity, establishing capability centers for Industry 4.0, funding and developing factories to become model factories for Industry 4.0, and supporting R&amp;D and entrepreneurship in Industry 4.0 technologies. Our strategy is based on six pillars: providing financial incentives to support and encourage investors to adopt Industry 4.0; allocating a funding program of approximately USD800 million to accelerate the adoption of Industry 4.0; establishing Industry 4.0 capacity centers that will hold training and capacity development and collaborating with universities and colleges to standardize expertise and the transfer of knowledge; promoting education and training the local workforce with advanced skills; conducting awareness campaigns for all sectors of NIDLP; and providing a new legal framework, appropriate infrastructure, and adequate standards for cybersecurity and other axes to ensure the stability and continuity of the transformation toward Industry 4.0.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ecuador aims to make its economy more competitive and the new commercial and investment policy is the proof of this. What major reforms is the government planning to achieve greater economic revitalization?</h4><p>The government of President Lení­n Moreno has established the Prosperity Plan. It has two components, namely employment and industrial reactivation. In this sense, we have adopted several actions to open Ecuador to the world and attract private-sector investment, the true engine of growth. We have left behind an economic model that hurt Ecuador by generating distrust between the public and private sectors. We received a sick economy, but we are healing it with orderly management of public finances, through which we have reduced the fiscal deficit from 8% of GDP to 3% of GDP as of end-2018, the lowest in the last six years. We have formed new international relations and strengthened old ones. Equally important, we have strengthened our democratic institutions, which is a fundamental factor when it comes to providing legal security to companies. We have introduced powerful, region-specific tax incentives, such as income tax exemptions for periods ranging from eight to 20 years. In this way, our private sector has begun its dynamic journey. 2018 closed with a historic increase of USD4 billion in private investment. Moreover, non-oil exports grew by 5% and total private sales rose 4%. We have made considerable progress and are aware that we must continue working to strengthen Ecuador's status as an investment destination. In this sense, we are proposing a package of structural reforms to further promote entrepreneurship, innovation, and job creation. Specifically, we intend to reduce the informality that exists at work, particularly of women and young people. Similarly, we are proposing another legal reform to facilitate PPPs for infrastructure projects. One of our focuses is to establish a robust stock market that allows the inclusion of SMEs. In regard to public companies, we are proposing a legal reform that gives them the management tools they need to be more efficient and transparent. The reform package also seeks to strengthen our monetary system and provide an order to manage the public budget. </p><h4>What is Ecuador's position regarding cooperation with international financial institutions such as the IMF?</h4><p>Ecuador could not live isolated from the international community. Therefore, we have established a policy of openness and rapprochement toward multilateral organizations and global economies. This has generated more confidence in Ecuador, opening the possibility of accessing cheaper financing, attracting more foreign investment, and exporting to more markets. In 2018, we attracted a record USD1.4 billion in FDI, a 127% increase YoY. Due to the current administration's efforts, the international community has committed USD10.2 billion to support the Prosperity Plan over the 2019-2021 period. The support of the international community shows that the government's program is on the right track. Our comprehensive economic program with international organizations also establishes an increase of around USD400 million in social spending in 2019, helping us maintain a social assistance expenditure floor of 1% of GDP.</p><h4>What did the annual Meeting of the Boards of Governors of the IDB in Guayaquil in 2019 meant for the country?</h4><p>The fact that Ecuador organized the 60th Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the IDB is a demonstration of international community's renewed interest and confidence in the country. After 47 years we returned to host the most important regional event of the IDB. The event focused on important economic and social issues of the region and the institutional development of the organization. Ideas and opinions were also exchanged between the governors of the IDB and the IDB Invest. In total, more than 5,400 participants attended the event. The IDB also ratified its support for Ecuador, approving USD927 in loans for projects related to Quito's energy, drinking water, and sewerage systems, the Casa para Todos program, and the improvement of fiscal management and production development. Moreover, the IDB approved USD50 million for a university and a financial institution.</p><h4>What is Ecuador's vision regarding Latin American integration, not only with the Pacific Alliance, but also with other blocks such as Mercosur?</h4><p>Ecuador's philosophy is to open up to the world, diversify its markets, and consolidate its commercial relations with all those countries or partners that share democratic values. In Latin America, our goal is to strengthen regional integration and base it on the true interests of the region and not on political ideologies, which was the case with Unasur and ALBA. Ecuador is in favor of generating an integration process that responds to the economic and social development of countries, the fight against corruption, security, environment, human rights, and cultural aspects, for example. We want to be part of the Pacific Alliance as it will significantly boost our foreign trade; the Alianza is the eighth-largest economy in the world, representing 35% of Latin America's population.</p><h4>Ecuador is working hard to reduce its public deficit. To what extent can the greater involvement of the private sector accelerate this process and which sectors are best positioned to experience rapid development?</h4><p>The participation of the private sector is always essential for the development of a country. Therefore, we are creating all the conditions to strengthen private investment and make Ecuadorian companies more competitive. This benefits us all because this is how the economy is energized and employment is created. Our interest is to develop the entire business sector, which is why we have generated benefits for large, medium, small, and micro enterprises. Moreover, we are going to promote a legal reform in the tax field for greater simplification and establish a solid and efficient tax scheme that further facilitates investments in the country.</p><h4>What is your growth and deficit forecasts for 2020?</h4><p>We are working to improve Ecuador's macroeconomic indicators. We are executing actions whose results will be seen in the medium and long terms. The goal is for 2020 to register positive growth and further reduce the deficit. The goal is to reduce our non-oil primary deficit (including fuel subsidies) to 5% of GDP in three years and reach a global surplus of this sector of 2.9% in 2021. Another objective is also to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 40% of GDP by 2022.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Western Union enhanced its digital services in the UAE? </h4><p>Western Union's global digital money-moving capabilities were recently enhanced in the UAE as part of the company's deep commitment to keeping the country at the forefront of the digital revolution. In the UAE, the company launched the Western Union® app and relaunched the Westernunion.com website in association with local agent Al Fardan Exchange, one of the UAE's leading financial services providers. Customers in the UAE can now connect to their families and loved ones around the world digitally with the choice to pay for transactions online or within the app via direct transfers from their local bank accounts.</p><h4>What are the next advancements needed in terms of regulatory frameworks for Western Union to further expand its digital services in the UAE and the region, particularly when it comes to using debit cards for digital transfers? </h4><p>In the UAE, customers can send money online via direct transfers from their bank accounts. Customers also have the choice to commence transactions digitally and pay in-person at agent locations. We continue to explore possibilities of online transfers via credit and debit cards. Another hot topic in this space is image monitoring and facial recognition. Governments have historically favored a more conservative stance even in areas of potentially more effective solutions such as electronic know your customer (eKYC) solutions. Digital trends and innovation cycles are moving ahead in advance of regulations, which always take time to catch up. Western Union is currently exploring facial recognition as a step in the eKYC process in some markets, which could potentially enhance efficiencies in data collection, verification, and due diligence. Additionally, it offers customers a better experience and more efficient controls, allowing them to provide verification details without the need for any manual intervention. Providing both senders and receivers their choice of channel is a key element of our money transfer strategy. We want to increase access points for Western Union services so consumers have the choice of interacting and transacting with the company based on their individual preferences. These options include sending money using cash at an agent location, digitally via mobile phone, online at WU.com through bank accounts or cards, and ATMs.</p><h4>What are your key partnerships in the UAE to advance digital products and services? </h4><p>At present, we are focused on the success of our digital collaboration with Al Fardan Exchange. We may consider other similar types of relationships in the future. This launch is a prime example of how we are starting to leverage our platform in new ways, bringing value to customers, and making it easier than ever for them to move money in a way that fits their lives. Western Union's strategy is to continue rolling out its omnichannel offerings and provide a wide range of services for both pay-in and pay-out, mixing physical-only, digital-only, or physical and digital solutions.</p><h4>What role does Dubai and the UAE play in the regional portfolio, and which regional markets is Western Union focusing on in the short to medium term? </h4><p>The Middle East is a vital and rising economic hub bringing people together from across Europe, Africa, and Asia and lifting them toward prosperity. International migrants working and living across the region represent a large part of the population and collectively send billions of remittances back home. In the UAE, 88% of the population is made up of international migrants, followed by Qatar at 75%, Kuwait 72%, Bahrain 51%, Oman 41%, Jordan 40%, and Lebanon 34%, according to the World Bank. Also, from World Bank figures, the UAE remits a sizeable volume of remittances, making it one of the top-10, person-to-person remittance markets in the world. The large expatriate workforce in the region means there is a strong need for them to send money to their families back home. Western Union provides regulated, convenient channels for money transfers to over 200 countries and territories around the world. Our focus is expanding in terms of access points, and as consumer needs change, we are expanding our digital services and giving customers the convenience of sending money any time from the convenience of their desktop or mobile phone.</p><h4>Do the various nationalization plans in many GCC countries impact the remittances and money transfer market?</h4><p>Nationalization plans in some markets are resulting in changing migration patterns. The trend toward impacts any company that operates globally, and Western Union, like all global companies, is aware of these rising trends. The fact is that, despite current protectionist trends, globalization is a force that cannot be reversed. Two indisputable facts of our modern life make this inevitably so. First and most obviously, technology is making the world ever-more connected. The other big piece of globalization is a factor as old as time: migration. People have always moved in search of a better life, and as they move they bring cultural linkages and commerce with them.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and vision for 2020?</h4><p>As a company with both a vast retail network and a growing digital operation, Western Union has a unique vantage point on the future of payments. The keys to competing and succeeding in cross border money movement are customer trust, global compliance capabilities, and data. We are leveraging our deep financial services expertise and technology to solve the complexities of cross-border money movement. When it comes to the last mile, our global presence, brand trust, and ability to meet customers wherever they are in the financial ecosystem give us a powerful advantage. This matters in a world where digital and cash transactions are likely to co-exist far into the future. Expanding digital channels is a major part of our strategy. We continue to add more touch points to our network such as ATMs and kiosks, as well as more payout options.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give us a brief history of your operations here on Swissí´tel The Bosphorus?</h4><p>Swissí´tel was one of Turkey's first five-star luxury hotels. Our location, formerly the garden of the Dolmabahce Palace, made us even more unique. The initial ownership of the hotel was Japanese, and since then we have undergone many changes, including both good times and bad. The Swissí´tel name, however, has remained the same throughout, and this consistency has made us a Turkish institution. Everywhere I go, 70-80% of people currently working at the leading institutions within the hospitality industry have built their careers, in part, at Swissí´tel. We have been essential in training the very best talent in Turkey's hospitality industry, and we are still a market leader across every segment we operate in.</p><h4>What percentage of your customers are Turkish?</h4><p>When we consider the full year, we have a preponderance of Turkish guests; however, if we only consider seasonal occupancy, we see more Middle Eastern guests during peak times. There are other times of year when we see more visitors from CIS countries, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran, and so on. Most of the time, the leisure seasons are dominated by Middle Eastern guests.</p><h4>Are there any regions or countries that you have focused on for growth?</h4><p>At the moment, Swissí´tel is concentrating a great deal on Asia. Russia is a key focal point, as is South America. All hotels in Istanbul want to expand the diversity of their client base. Relying on one demographic bears too much risk. We see many hotels over-relying on a single segment or demographic, and we are intent on avoiding this mistake. I am personally focused on Asia, and specifically, I am keen to bring China to Istanbul. Additionally, AccorHotels — our management company — has a great presence in America, which gives that market a certain appeal. Russian business travel is also an interesting area for us. My present goal with respect to the Russian market is to maintain the momentum that we have already built. Our broader strategy is to diversify as much as possible. In Antalya, in the south of Turkey, the industry has seen what can happen when too much attention is invested in a single market, Russia, and then that source of visitors dries up. The advantage of Istanbul is that the city appeals to numerous people from around the world. Saudis are still the number one visitor group from the Middle East, but we are seeing growth from Qatar and Kuwait, and Iran is increasingly entering the picture.</p><h4>What percentages of your business are leisure travel and business travel?</h4><p>Leisure comprises nearly 80% of our business. Business travel, on the other hand, is presently trending downward, but we are looking forward to promoting growth in that area again, particularly among US and European visitors. The luxury cruise sector has also been avoiding Istanbul as a destination over the past two years, but there have been strong signals that travelers will return. This is a process that we are interested in assisting.</p><h4>What is your strategy for capturing the business segment during its return to Istanbul? </h4><p>We pride ourselves on being able to offer the very best experience that business travelers can receive. The value they get from us is unparalleled. As a destination, Istanbul itself is amazing, enriched by thousands of years of history. Our main challenge lies more at the political level, which is, of course, beyond our control. I recently attended a panel with German travel agencies, and they are interested in bringing customers back to Istanbul. They have already returned to Antalya, which last summer had one of its best seasons on record. In recent seasons, German travelers have sampled alternative destinations like Spain, Portugal and Greece, and have consistently found that the value they received in Turkey was far superior to other offerings. This is encouraging for us, and we welcome their return to the Turkish market.</p><h4>What efforts or investments has Swissí´tel made to expand on the guest experience side of hospitality?</h4><p>Swissí´tel Istanbul has an entire, multinational team focused on expanding guest experience. The company utilizes a strong set of tools that allows it to track and fulfill a guest's personal preferences. The goal is to create an excellent experience for visitors of all national backgrounds and build an emotional connection with them. One example is the butler services that we provide our guests, quite unusual for our brand. We want our guests to have a personalized experience that starts at the very beginning of their stay and lasts right through to their departure. This is why Swissí´tel Istanbul has the highest guest satisfaction rating in our company. Swissí´tel Istanbul also has the highest employee satisfaction level out of all of our global locations. Our colleagues really love what they do, and this in turn affects the guest experience in a positive way, serving to create an experience that guests will not forget.</p><h4>How are you applying technology to your operations?</h4><p>Without technology, it would be hard for us to operate. Everything exists in a digital format, and this is something in which we are deeply immersed. Guests can check in and out by phone. Using advanced technology, we are also able to track guest preferences at a level that would otherwise be impossible. Our colleagues have the ability to see the preferences of the guest directly from their own apps as well, creating even greater efficiencies. Technology is essential now for leading hotels. It makes connecting with guests and maintaining that connection much, much easier.</p><h4>How do you expect the new Istanbul airport to impact tourist numbers in Turkey? </h4><p>The new airport in Istanbul will have a positive impact on the country's tourism sector. Last year, I was part of a delegation that travelled from Istanbul to Beijing to speak to the government there about increasing the number of flights between China and Turkey. It was a successful effort. Now, Southern China Airlines flies to Turkey three times a week, with plans to increase that number to seven. We are planning to return to China in April to speak to other airlines and can anticipate an even larger increase in the number of Istanbul-bound flights. If we want to bring more travelers to Istanbul, this new airport is essential.</p><h4>How have recent investments in infrastructure impacted regional and in-country tourist traffic to Istanbul?</h4><p>Infrastructure investments have considerably helped to revive tourism in Istanbul. Middle Eastern investors have come with their colleagues to invest in projects, and these have improved the traffic conditions both in and out of the city. By attracting more investors, we are able to create extensive economic benefits for the entire city. This kind of growth helps stabilize the local economy, and the country as a whole.</p><h4>What are your biggest goals and plans for 2019?</h4><p>Our number-one goal is to focus on guest experience. If we can maximize that we will then be able to increase our ADR. Guests reflect on their experience and pay accordingly. Our guests have no problem with paying, but they are very selective about what it is that they are paying for. Additionally, we want to expand the reputation of the hotel in Asia and South America. We are working very hard on this and believe that we are on the right track. We want to be able to offer experiences that justify raising rates, rather than, as some of our competitors do, raise rates just for the sake of it.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<title><![CDATA[15 Months of Reform]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[isabel-celaa-minister-education-spain]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2018 has been a politically complicated year. How would you evaluate these last few months, and what would you highlight as the main achievements of this ministry?</h4><p>Indeed, it has taken 15 months of intense work to rebuild democratic institutions after the previous government's serious cases of corruption and to place equity at the center of public policies after a crisis and cuts that deepened social differences. The recovery of economic activity cannot only remain in the macroeconomic figures; it must reach the lives of families, with decent employment, social services, and quality education that allow them to have true equality of opportunities. The current government does things differently. We have prioritized dialog as a way to resolve conflicts and encourage respect for democratic institutions. Furthermore, we have been present in international forums and have engaged with the countries that we have important ties to. In terms of education, we came from a hard position of cuts, ineffective and unfair educational models, and significant neglect. Public spending on education fell from 4.4% of GDP in 2011 to 3.89% in 2018, while the number of students increased. For this reason, as soon as we arrived in government, we passed a law that repealed the main cuts of the conservative government, which had increased the ratio of students per classroom by 20% and raised the minimum number of teaching hours for teachers. The second major step was the government's approval of the draft Educational Law to repeal the law imposed by the PP and contained harmful measures and was questioned by the international educational consensus, such as segregating itineraries. The new law modernizes the system with the development of five strategic axes: children's rights, personalization of education, gender equity, education for sustainability, and education in the digital era. The early call for elections did not allow us to process the bill in Parliament, something we hope to do in the near future. We aim to make vocational training the crown jewel of the Spanish education system. The first step we took to this end was to develop a strategic plan for vocational training, which I presented, alongside the President, to business and union organizations. The production sector is experiencing a true digital revolution, and we cannot have an obsolete system of approval of titles with which to meet the new demands of the labor market. We are approving new titles and specialization courses and incorporating modules to apply in each of the productive sectors. The agreements with various business sectors ensure the relevance of the new degrees and allow us to promote innovation and knowledge transfer in VET centers. Finally, we initiated processes of study and participation in two fundamental themes: the reinforcement and improvement of the teaching career and to ensure the full educational integration of those who have special educational needs or family and social conditions that pose additional barriers to learning.</p><h4>The vast majority of companies highlight the retention of human talent, especially with technological training, as their main challenge. What strategy is the ministry following to address this situation and include technological training in the school curriculum?</h4><p>The current digital revolution is drastically changing the educational and formative context. This transformation implies a new way of understanding talent, because it is changing the way we build knowledge. The necessary transformations in the educational system will be both organizational and pedagogical and impact all stages and teachings, from early childhood education to high school, vocational training or lifelong learning. To address the talent challenge, we will launch actions aimed at developing the digital competence of teachers, students, and educational centers, defining the training we want for young students and those at other stages of learning. In addition, in a meaningful and universal way, we have to launch actions to boost training in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology, crucial areas in this new context that have not always received due attention or attracted as many students as they should. It is especially important to make a commitment to incorporate girls and women to these teachings (STEM), thus combating the gender gap. We will promote a state framework, aligned with the European Digital Competition Framework, capable of ensuring that young people and their teachers acquire the digital competence they need.</p><h4>What are the objectives and priorities of the ministry for next year?</h4><p>First, we will promote the passage of the new educational law that allows us to tackle the set of changes demanded by the Spanish education system. We will develop a strategy of digitalization in ambitious education and professional training that will be one of the levers of effective economic and social transformation of the education system and its components. We will create a school of AI in the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training, which will feature teacher training, the provision of resources and technological solutions, and research in these areas. In a period of one year, we will incorporate a professional module on digitalization applied to the corresponding productive sector to all VET titles. In addition, we will immediately begin to design 80 new FP offers, associated, among others, with smart manufacturing, maintenance digitalization, cybersecurity, AI, and big data, virtual and augmented reality, collaborative robotics, autonomous vehicles, and cloud computing, amongst others. We will increase the number of scholarships in the budget and carry out a reform of the study aid system, through the participation of the interested sectors, in order to make them fairer, more predictable, and appropriate, with greater endowment and simpler procedures to ensure no one is left behind. A fundamental challenge will be to reinforce the teaching profession and the working conditions of staff. Firstly, this will be achieved through initial training, then with the establishment of a system of introduction to the teaching profession through mentoring, and, finally, by promoting the evaluation of teaching performance. One of the key challenges of our country is to continue to reduce the rate of early abandonment in education. In order to achieve this, we will promote the universalization and free education for children under the age of three, which not only contributes to reducing inequality and improving the reconciliation of work and family life, but also constitutes a powerful factor to combat school failure, boosting personal development from the early stages of life. We will address an urgent modernization of the basic school curriculum, so as to ensure comprehensive training and the development of key student competencies. For this purpose, we will create an institute for curriculum development and educational innovation that will be in charge of the permanent updating and modernization of the curriculum. The new curriculum will encourage educational centers from early childhood education to enhance creativity, emotional education, the ability to solve problems, the development of skills for collaborative work, and effective communication skills.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps has FEDEXPOR taken to become the main voice of exporters in Ecuador?</h4><p>FEDEXPOR is considered a third-level entity, which means we can group chambers of commerce as well as companies together under our umbrella. Fedexpor represents 85% of Ecuador's non-oil exports. Our partners include a wide range of exporters from traditional sectors such as banana, flowers, mango, and cocoa as well as growing ones such as chemicals and cosmetics. Furthermore, we represent companies of all sizes, which means we are a transversal entity that represents all sorts of exporting companies. FEDEXPOR focuses on two areas: interests of the sector within Ecuador and services to help companies reach international markets. For example, we work to include several proposals to change the legislation and make Ecuador more competitive in terms of logistics or employment. We also offer training courses for companies and employees, as well as organize events. Over the last 10  years, FEDEXPOR has gained a great deal of strength due to the country's need to boost its exports. Ecuador's economy has experienced significant development over the years; however, it is still a small market, so exports are vital for the healthy development of its economy and people.</p><h4>What is the weight of non-oil exports in the Ecuadorian economy?</h4><p>Non-oil exports represent around 11% of Ecuador's GDP. In other words, USD11 of every USD100 in the Ecuadorian economy is related to exports. If we consider the spillover effect, the indirect impact of non-oil exports is as high as 20%. In 2018, Ecuador generated USD12.8 billion in non-oil exports, and 2019 is expected to surpass the USD13-billion mark.</p><h4>How have Ecuadorian exports to the EU developed after the signing of an FTA in 2017?</h4><p>If implemented properly, FTAs are extremely helpful in boosting exports. Trade between Ecuador and the EU has increased over the last two years. Exports to the EU have increased by 7% since the signing of an FTA in 2017, and the number of regular exporters has also increased. Ecuador currently counts on 1,400 companies that export to the EU, out of a total of 3,600 exporting companies. Most importantly, the EU is one of the largest markets for SMEs in Ecuador. Thanks to this agreement, more than 20,000 new jobs have been created. It is crucial for Ecuador to open its doors and realize its role in global value chains. That should be the main strategy not just for the exporting sector, but for the development of the country as a whole. The country is going in the right direction with measures to reduce bureaucratic red tape and increase the role of the private sector. At the same time, the government is signing new agreements and engaging in negotiations with other countries and regions.</p><h4>What opportunities could be unleashed for Ecuadorian exporters after the country's entry into the Pacific Alliance?</h4><p>Ecuador's entry into the Pacific Alliance is a key part of our current strategy, and the relevant stakeholders in the country understand the alliance's importance. The Pacific Alliance has demonstrated that it can keep up with a rapid growth rate if we compare it with other regional blocs. In addition, joining the bloc can also be key to boosting FDI into Ecuador, as it will mean a market-friendly economy is being consolidated. The main opportunities would come from access to Mexico, specifically for products such as cocoa, shrimp, processed food, wood, and construction materials. Access to neighboring countries such as Peru and Colombia would also improve. Chile is also part of the alliance, and we are currently negotiating an agreement with Chile that would be bigger in scope than the alliance itself. Additionally, we see opportunities in Eastern Europe, specifically Russia. Negotiations are taking place with Japan and South Korea, as well as with Costa Rica and Guatemala. Furthermore, after years of being on hold, talks on a trade agreement with the US have resumed.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the year in terms of business prosperity and economic output? What have been some of your recent achievements at the international level?</h4><p>Sharjah's economy continued its growth in 2018, according to international credit rating agencies, as Standard &amp; Poor's has maintained a long- and short-term sovereign credit rating in the local and foreign currencies for the Emirate at BBB+ and A-2, respectively. The rating agency has granted it an outlook of future stability thanks to its strong financial status and low exposure to risks, describing Sharjah's economy as diverse. Moody's has forecasted that the Emirate's GDP will increase by 2.9% in 2019, supported by the increase in capital expenditure, high oil prices, and gradual acceleration of the UAE's economy, pointing out that the economic power enjoyed by the Emirate of Sharjah reflects the significant growth of its financial dynamism, high per-capita GDP, strong competitive rates, and the financial balance of its economy. The Emirate's economic growth over the past year has been the result of cooperation between the various governmental bodies and Sharjah's private sector, with the unlimited support of Dr. Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qassimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, and the oversight of Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed bin Sultan Al Qassimi, Crown Prince and Deputy Ruler of Sharjah.</p><h4>What are some of the major events the Sharjah Chamber of Commerce will organize in 2019? </h4><p>A busy agenda awaits us in 2019, most notably taking part in the 11th World Chambers Congress, organized by the International Chamber of Commerce of the World Chambers Federation in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where we have partnered with the World Chambers Federation as sponsors of this key event, which attracts more than 12 chambers of commerce from around the world.</p><h4>What are some of the biggest challenges investors in Sharjah are currently facing?</h4><p>Most global business communities face various economic challenges as a result of global conditions that may affect international trade, supply and demand, or even consumers' ability to spend. We are an active component of the regional and global economic system, and we are susceptible to what is happening around us. However, we do take measures and steps that mitigate the negative effects of the global economic slowdown in order to enhance investor confidence in the Emirate's business environment and its efforts to spur business growth. A major challenge facing investors in Sharjah is their ability to utilize the latest technologies in their activities, as the Emirate is moving ahead with its future plans to harness technology to serve business and develop mechanisms, processes, and strategies that keep pace with Industry 4.0. Therefore, investors need to be flexible in dealing with modern technology and innovation in order to meet their customers' demands and changing tastes, while providing high-quality services to maintain their competitive edge. At this chamber, we are always investing in “smart transformation" and helping our members facilitate their work, saving them time and effort. We work to overcome any challenges and obstacles that may affect our members' and investors' competitiveness in Sharjah, in cooperation with the relevant bodies, by providing a platform for specialist business groups to discuss challenges and opportunities.</p><h4>What are your main goals and objectives for 2019 and beyond?</h4><p>Our strategic objectives for the near future include continuing to promote Sharjah as a regional and global business destination by strengthening our external involvement and utilizing our international network. We look forward to strengthening our role as a representative of the private sector and improving services provided to our members by supporting the smart transformation of everything we do. In the near future, we look forward to strengthening public-private partnerships by passing along the private sector's recommendations to the competent bodies. We also plan to continue this dialogue as a pillar of success and development and introduce our own contributions by proposing solutions and legislation appropriate to the private sector's needs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has shifting demand over the past years affected the Sharjah economy?</h4><p>Sharjah has always redeveloped its economic strategy every time there has been a challenge. We have moved from being an oil-based economy to focusing on non-oil sectors such as education and tourism, among others. The bottom line is adaptability. We have seen many changes over the past decade. Today, the oil sector comprises only 30% of our economy. Sharjah is now a more diversified economy. It does not solely focus on any one sector. It has played a major role in the UAE developing into a light industrial hub, an educational hub, a heritage hub, and a cultural hub. Sharjah has hosted several international events and activities. The secret of our success is to strike a balance between demand and supply, and make sure we have the right price matrix for everything that we do. Opening the real estate market created a big shift in focus for Sharjah's economy. Along with the revolution in FDI brought about by the creation of specialized free zones such as the Sharjah Media City and Sharjah Publishing City, among others, we have opened new vistas for Sharjah.</p><h4>Why did Shurooq choose the redesign project of the Khorfakkan beach project as its next flagship development?<br></h4><p>Within our portfolio, we seek to create developments in every city around Sharjah. Khorfakkan is a city that sits between two mountains on the Arabian Sea. It is an exciting location because it has an important container terminal. It is a weekend destination for residents as well as tourists. It is an important port of call for cruise ships and has a fascinating heritage village. Our plan is to develop the beachfront and create activities by adding more restaurants, coffee shops, and a play area for kids. In the future, we will add hotels, a water park, and a resort. The goal is to position each city differently. We would like a footprint on the east coast with this project, which will significantly develop the economy of Khorfakkan. We want to create a project in every district of Sharjah. These  projects will boost its economy while communicating their unique and historic heritage.</p><h4>What is the current relationship between the public and private sectors?</h4><p>Sharjah has always been clear when it comes to PPPs. The government has always been focused on doing what is best for the Emirate and having the private sector drive the economy. At the end of the day, PPPs are the key to success as it is important that the government does not compete with the private sector. We have one of the oldest PPPs in our seaport, with Gulftainer, and a PPP with Bee'ah. These partnerships demonstrate the importance of government and business working together seamlessly for mutual benefit. </p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for the next 12 months?<br></h4><p>Shurooq is excited to have the Sharjah Collection destinations, which we started with Kingfisher Lodge in Kalba and the Al Faya Lodge close to the city of Mleiha, which is being managed by the world-class hospitality management company “Mysk by Shaza." We will also be opening the Al Badayer Oasis, which is also under the Sharjah Collection brand. It will be a part of the desert experience. This is a natural oasis with the largest sand dunes in the UAE. Guests can stay in a village in the middle of the desert. The property has 10 tents, 21 rooms, an amphitheater, a mosque, and a fitness center. Later in 2019, we will officially inaugurate the Khorfakkan Beach project and the east coast in general, which will open up a treasure trove of natural landscapes, mountains, and beaches, with opportunities for numerous activities to tourists as well as residents. Future ventures with Shurooq are expected to enrich this portfolio as we proceed to diversify and attract new businesses and opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[we-can-do-it]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about your latest efforts to activate the roles of girls and women in addressing global sustainability challenges?</h4><p>This January, we announced a strategic partnership with the Masdar-led “Women in Sustainability, Environment and Renewable Energy," or WiSER, platform, during Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week. Through this year-long partnership, we will collaborate with WiSER on several programs designed to position women and girls of all nationalities as drivers of change and innovation. This is a tactical step in furthering our joint ambition to empower present and future generations of female leaders and help them play more active roles in the attainment of the UN SDGs Agenda 2030. The collaboration aims to promote women's engagement in key sectors such as energy, environment, and technology through evidence-based and targeted programs, and seeks to ultimately boost their participation in sectors in which they are underrepresented. Both NAMA and WiSER's mandates are built on making international initiatives for women locally relevant. Together, we are making concerted efforts through 2019 to accelerate women's access to education, professional training, and networking opportunities. </p><h4>How is Sharjah's government contributing to female empowerment?</h4><p>The two individuals at the forefront of Sharjah's women's empowerment efforts and advocacy need no introduction. HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, and his wife, Her Highness Sheikha Jawaher bint Mohammed Al Qasimi, have passionately created an environment in Sharjah where girls and women are never left behind. As an example, there are 32 women-centric entities in Sharjah, including NAMA, which function under HH Sheikha Jawaher's leadership. There are around 3,000 women employed in different departments working under the aegis of HH Jawaher Al Qasimi. Her Highness' way of leadership emphasizes the importance of being thorough and learning from experiences. It is due to this focus that we have developed tremendous research skills.</p><h4>As 2019 has been deemed the Year of Tolerance, how should schools teach the next generation about equality, tolerance, and inclusion?</h4><p>The lesson of gender equity, tolerance, and inclusion should begin at home. Mothers and fathers should be role models. Gender divides creep in unnoticed when we tell our girls to spend more time in the kitchen and keep repeating to our boys that they must get excellent grades as they will be providing for their families when they grow up. Our children must be treated the same, at home and in school, and must be offered the space to discover their interests without telling them what is “right" for them or “expected" of them. It is when our children see us not differentiating based on gender, nationality, or social standing that they will be able to see gender equity, equality, tolerance, and inclusion as a norm rather than an exception. I believe tolerance cannot be forced. We should all establish a world in which tolerance is spontaneous and is the norm.</p><h4>What are your future plans, goals, and objectives?</h4><p>The second edition of the Women Economic Empowerment Global Summit (WEEGS) is coming up in December. This is a massive project we are working on with UN Women. We want to deliver this two-day summit in a way that doubles the success of the inaugural edition, opening news doors of opportunities for women in all sectors—including but not limited to procurement, finance, city planning, and STEM. Through WEEGS and other initiatives, NAMA will continue its efforts to improve economic and workplace equity for women, especially in key sectors, such as technology, which are dominated by a male-driven culture. Finally, we are furthering our commitment to drive evidence-based research and data collection on the challenges women face when entering the workforce and the economy, as business-owners or entrepreneurs across various sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[60% E-commerce Shipments Within 5 Years]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[miguel-borras-managing-director-dhl-express-spain-portugal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an introduction to DHL in Spain?</h4><p>In 2019, we celebrate the 50th Anniversary of DHL since it was born in San Francisco in 1969. 10 years later, the company began its business activity in Spain with nine people in a small flat in Madrid, so we are also celebrating the 40 Anniversary in Spain. Few years later, it expanded the business and was established in a flat in Barcelona center. Since then we have not stopped growing and nowadays we are approx. 1,100 employees and have a fleet of 900 vans and 13 aircrafts. Today, we offer our portfolio of logistics services in international express to our customers whether they are large or small businesses. In 2013, concerning the B2C business, we started moving from traditional document shipping to the e-commerce shipping.</p><h4>How do you intend to maintain this growth?</h4><p>In 2018 growth came mainly from e-commerce shipping since the classic business is more or less steady and tends to grow at a rate of 1-2%. The plan for 2020 is to continue growing by 8-9%, the majority of which will come from e-commerce, as there is a huge potential in this market. The challenge is that although 50% of our deliveries are B2C e-commerce shipments, only 25% of our revenue comes from it. We expect to increase this percentage by at least two or three points every year for five years when it is expected that at least 60% of our deliveries will come from e-commerce.</p><h4>Can you go into more detail about the new conveyor belts DHL introduced to increase its capacity?</h4><p>We are investing in this because we need to move more packages in less time by automating our premises. We have invested around EUR93 million in our Madrid hub. Two years ago, we also invested in a new conveyor system in our hub in Vitoria to expand our network to other areas such as Santiago de Compostela, Lisbon, Porto, Seville, Valencia, and Alicante. This is not only about processing packages faster but also about a need to be more efficient and deliver according to the customers' needs. We are developing our drop-off points and our online applications such as On-Demand Delivery (ODD) in order to offer our customers the opportunity to choose how they want their shipments to be delivered. We are also investing in ITC systems to improve the lives of our customers. On top of this, is the DHL Parcelcopter, a drone able to deliver in hard-to-reach areas  with mountains, rivers, and such terrain.</p><h4>The DHL group aims to become zero net emissions by 2050. How will this be achieved in a sector that contributes extensively to emissions?</h4><p>In this sense, DHL has set an ambitious plan to achieve it, which includes different types of actions that are included in our GoGreen Program. We have fleet renewal plans from today until 2025, where our goal is to reach 70% of clean collection and delivery solutions on our last mile. We offer solutions that allow companies to use a green transport service, through our Go-Green program, neutralizing the CO2 emissions derived from the transport of its shipments. We also have quarterly and annual reports so that companies can account for their emissions.</p><h4>Is it the objective of the new hub in Madrid to be a connection center between Europe and Latin America?</h4><p>Madrid has excellent transport and communications infrastructures such as the Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas airport as well as an innovative and growing business fabric. All these features make the city of Madrid, a key privileged spot within the company's strategy. Our aim is to maintain our leadership and to grow through quality. Thus we are investing in infrastructures to increase efficiency and to improve our delivery capability. This will allow us to provide an even better service to our customers. This new hub is a critical nexus between Europe and the Latam countries. Thanks to this, we could connect businesses from all industries and private consumers alike, and enable them to leverage from the increasingly growing e-commerce worldwide.</p><h4>What makes Spain such a magnet for transport and logistics centers?</h4><p>The privileged geographical location of Madrid makes connections be easier; by road it is possible to cover an extremely large area in eight hours and by air, Madrid airport also offers an extraordinary advantage since it is the fifth in the list of best airports in Europe, with many connections worldwide. Barcelona area is also convenient for logistics centers because it has a great deal of industry and is home to one of the main ports in the Mediterranean. That is the reason why top international companies have located their logistics hubs in Catalonia. Furthermore, Barcelona is close to the French border, and we can deliver the shipments to the south of France in the same day that they arrive at Barcelona airport. Definitively, in terms of cost, Spain is still a strategic location to build warehouses in comparison to other places in Europe.</p><h4>What are the main objectives for 2019 and 2020?</h4><p>Our main objective for the coming years is continuing investing in state of the art facilities such as the new installation in Castellbisbal, Barcelona. We want also to continue investing in sustainable means in last mile deliveries, p.e. with electrical vehicles at Barcelona city center. Our budget assignment is to continue growing in B2C business and e-commerce in B2B, with the aim of growing around 8% next year for both B2C and B2B.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[equality-economics]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The theme for the first Women's Economic Empowerment Global Summit is women excelling in the economy, here and around the world, wherever they are. For women to excel in the economy, we know that they need access to productive assets, resources, and technology. We also know that decent work and the income that women receive is important, but in particular that women also deserve equal pay. The capacity to start and grow their own business as entrepreneurs is an important indication of how women are excelling in economies as mentors, sponsors, role models, and mentees.</p><p>Support for changing the discriminatory social norms and stereotypes that segregate women into jobs with lower pay and limited opportunity for advancement also needs to be given attention, as these norms can hinder the effective participation of women and fuel violence. Women also need to live free from violence—free from fear—at home or at work, so that they can prosper without the stress that comes with living with abuse.</p><p>We know that if women played an identical role in labor markets to men, as much as USD28 trillion could be added to the global annual GDP by 2025. By gathering today, we are trying to make this a reality. Yet, we know that there are constraints on women's ability to participate equally and fully in the labor market.</p><p>One of the constraints that we do not recognize fully—and yet is important to address, especially now, because we are marking the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence—is the challenge of violence against women. The 16 Days campaign is about ensuring that we bring forth a world where women and girls live free from violence, and the UNiTE campaign's official color, orange, is about this brighter future that we aspire to.</p><p>Our campaign's theme in 2019 is “Leaving No One Behind." We are talking about not forgetting about women and girls who are trafficked; who live with domestic violence; who are disabled, and therefore are hidden when they experience violence; who are bullied in cyberspace; about older women who experience violence; and about domestic workers who experience violence. All of these women have a contribution to make in the economy, and together, here today, we want to look at different ways through which we can empower these women.</p><p>Not only is violence against women a horrible human rights violation with enduring consequences for women, it also constrains economies from growing. In some countries, the average impact of this violence is 3% of GDP, and in many parts of the world this is not always acknowledged or even understood.</p><p>Let me turn back to the High-Level Panel of the Secretary-General of the UN, which gave us the report on women's economic empowerment. In this report, we highlighted seven key drivers that can propel women's economic empowerment. These drivers, which create positive change, include changing norms in support of women's economic empowerment; ensuring legal protection and reform of discriminatory laws and regulations—so that we do not have laws that discriminate against women; recognizing, reducing, and redistributing unpaid care work; building assets including through women's digital and financial inclusion and ownership of property and skills development; and changing business cultures, including encouraging business to sign up to the Women's Empowerment Principles, which include the principle of encouraging corporate procurement from businesses that are owned and run by women.</p><p>`Another way in which we are supporting women's economic empowerment is through a movement called “HeForShe." This is about making sure that when women at the grassroots level are unable to rise higher in their business activities because of low wages, the men who participate in making decisions about the economy pay attention and support the improvement of women's wages. It encourages men to stand for gender equality so that when we have a glass ceiling, the man removes it so that the women do not have to shatter all the glass themselves.</p><p>*From a speech made at the Women's Economic Empowerment Global Summit (WEEGS) In Sharjah on December 5, 2017</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>A window onto our inner lives, books are also the doorway to mutual respect and understanding between people, across all boundaries and differences. In these turbulent times, books embody the diversity of human ingenuity, giving shape to the wealth of human experience and expressing the search for meaning and expression we all share, that drive all societies forward.</p><p>Books help weave humanity together as a single family, holding a past in common, a history and heritage, to craft a destiny that is shared, where all voices are heard in the great chorus of human aspiration. Books are our allies in spreading education, science, culture, and information worldwide.</p><p>Books are also a form of cultural expression that lives through and as part of a chosen language. Each publication is created in a distinct language and is intended for a language-specific reading audience. A book is thus written, produced, exchanged, used, and appreciated in a given linguistic and cultural setting. This year we highlight this important dimension because 2019 marks the International Year of Indigenous Languages, led by UNESCO, to reaffirm the commitment of the international community to supporting indigenous peoples to preserve their cultures, knowledge, and rights.</p><p>This day provides an opportunity to reflect together on ways to better disseminate the culture of the written word and to allow all individuals, men, women, and children to access it. This is the same spirit of inclusion and dialogue that is guiding Sharjah (UAE), designated World Book Capital 2019. This designation takes effect on World Book and Copyright Day 2019. Sharjah was selected in recognition of its program “Read—you are in Sharjah" that proposes to reach out to its marginalized populations and its creative proposals to involve migrant populations in order to act as a motor for social inclusion, creativity, and respect.<br>With Sharjah, our partners, the International Publishers Association, the International Booksellers Federation, the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, and the entire international community, let us join together to celebrate books as the embodiment of creativity, the desire to share ideas and knowledge, to inspire understanding, dialogue, and tolerance. This is UNESCO's message on World Book and Copyright Day. </p><p>*From a speech made on World Book and Copyright Day, April 23, 2019</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>As-salamu alaykum! Peace be with you. With a heart grateful to the Lord, in this eighth centenary of the meeting between Saint Francis of Assisi and Sultan al-Malik al Kamil, I have welcomed the opportunity to come here as a believer thirsting for peace, as a brother seeking peace with the brethren. We are here to desire peace, to promote peace, to be instruments of peace.</p><p>We cannot honor the creator without cherishing the sacredness of every person and of every human life. Each person is equally precious in the eyes of God, who does not look upon the human family with a preferential gaze that excludes, but with a benevolent gaze that includes. Thus, to recognize the same rights for every human being is to glorify the name of God on earth. In the name of God, the creator, therefore, every form of violence must be condemned without hesitation, because we gravely profane God's name when we use it to justify hatred and violence against a brother or sister. No violence can be justified in the name of religion.</p><p>Various questions, however, confront us. How do we look after each other in the one human family? How do we nourish a fraternity that is not theoretical but translates into authentic fraternity? How can the inclusion of the other prevail over exclusion in the name of belonging to one's own group? How, in short, can religions be channels of fraternity rather than barriers of separation?</p><p>Investing in culture encourages a decrease of hatred and a growth of civility and prosperity. Education and violence are inversely proportional. Catholic schools—well appreciated in this country and in the region—promote such education on behalf of peace and reciprocal knowledge in order to prevent violence.</p><p>A fraternal living together, founded on education and justice; a human development built upon a welcoming inclusion and on the rights of all: these are the seeds of peace which the world's religions are called to help flourish. For them, perhaps as never before, in this delicate historical situation, it is a task that can no longer be postponed: to contribute actively to demilitarizing the human heart. The arms race, the extension of its zones of influence, and the aggressive policies to the detriment of others will never bring stability. War cannot create anything but misery, weapons bring nothing but death!</p><p>Human fraternity requires of us, as representatives of the world's religions, the duty to reject every nuance of approval from the word “war." Let us return it to its miserable crudeness. Its fateful consequences are before our eyes. I am thinking in particular of Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Libya. Together, as brothers and sisters in the one human family willed by God, let us commit ourselves against the logic of armed power, against the monetization of relations, the arming of borders, the raising of walls, the gagging of the poor; let us oppose all this with the sweet power of prayer and daily commitment to dialogue. Our being together today is a message of trust, an encouragement to all people of good will, so that they may not surrender to the floods of violence and the desertification of altruism. God is with those who seek peace. From heaven he blesses every step that, on this path, is accomplished on earth. From your country, my thoughts turn to all the countries of this peninsula. To them I address my most cordial greetings, with friendship and esteem.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[400 Companies Investing in KIZAD]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[samir-chaturvedi-ceo-kizad]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is KIZAD's role in the diversification of Abu Dhabi's economy?</h4><p>KIZAD is playing an integral role in the realization of Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030. As a master developer, we have created an integrated trade, logistics and industrial hub for the Emirate, helping it to move away from hydrocarbon dependence and ensure a strong, sustainable economy. By investing in infrastructure, technologies and innovations, local and international talent, KIZAD is helping drive diversification. Currently, KIZAD and Abu Dhabi Ports together contribute 3.6% (AED19.6 billion) to Abu Dhabi's non-oil GDP and by 2030 we estimate that our contribution will reach 15%. Already, more than 400 companies have committed investment to KIZAD, which is a remarkable achievement in such a short space of time. Equally impressive is the diverse range of industry we have attracted, from automotive and metals to polymers, food and beverage, and oil and gas. There are many reasons for this, for example our strategic location between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, having Khalifa Port on our doorstep and innovative and flexible infrastructure that has been built for expansion. However, I believe that one of the biggest factors of our success has been understanding the needs of each individual customer then going above and beyond to ensure we deliver what matters to their business the most.</p><h4>What industrial sectors does KIZAD focus on, and how does it develop this focus?</h4><p>As per Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030, KIZAD targets nine areas of industry, of which seven form our immediate focus. The first five are polymers, ferrous and non-ferrous metals; food; oil and gas; and automotive. The other two support these industries; logistics and utilities. One of the elements that is attractive to these industries at KIZAD is how the zone is made up of multiple industrial clusters. Through these we allocate land by grouping certain industries and service providers together based on how best they can benefit one another. As a result, firms can create value by leveraging our anchor tenants and facilitating synergies and operational efficiencies.</p><h4>How does KIZAD interact with the wider UAE economy, and how does it complement economic activities in Dubai?</h4><p>Our strategy is forward thinking and long term, driven by an even longer vision of building trade, logistics and industry across the UAE as a whole. This is a vision shared by everyone in our industry across the country. This is still very much a growth region in the early stages of industrialization. This industrialization is driving the demand for ports and logistics services in the region and is one of the reasons why its GDP impact here is significantly higher than other parts of the world. We want the UAE to be the location of choice for those seeking to benefit from this growth, and we also want to support our homegrown businesses to capitalize on this potential. After all, the more successful industry is as a whole, the more everyone will benefit. Of course, there will be an element of competition, but that's a good thing.  Healthy competition provides customers with broader options and developers with greater incentives to improve their services and offerings. Fortunately, we have a strong value proposition; the combination of Khalifa Ports' assets, Abu Dhabi's growing industrial sector, plus KIZAD's innovation is a value proposition that is not typical for the region and puts us in an excellent position to thrive and grow.</p><h4>As most industrial zones tend to fail, how has KIZAD become financially sustainable?</h4><p>I have seen many zones around the world that are announced with a big fanfare. However, the majority fail, largely because they are subsidized to a level where they never learn to stand on their own feet. At KIZAD and Abu Dhabi Ports we are not only operationally independent from the government, but financially independent as well. Where the government has funded our infrastructure, we are repaying this in the form of a dividend. Four years on from attaining financial independence, we have become a very profitable business. However, we aren't complacent and will continue to exercise prudence in how we expand. One of the reasons for our success is that we target customers who are sustainable and able to serve the market. We want those who can stand on their own feet and deliver value to the economy. Equally, KIZAD, with its road, sea, air and future rail connectivity to the UAE and GCC region, provides an excellent base for manufacturing, trading and logistics industries in so many sectors. And, unlike other industrial, logistics and manufacturing zones, KIZAD is not hindered by urban congestion or ageing infrastructure—its offers superior multimodal connectivity via its road networks and highways, Khalifa Port and four nearby international airports. So, as you can see, we have both a very strong offer and a sustainable strategy.</p><h4>How does KIZAD encourage innovation in Abu Dhabi's industrial sector?</h4><p>Innovation is at the core of everything we do, and we are constantly assessing ways to harness emerging technologies and trends to improve our processes and operations so we our clients can improve their efficiency in turn. As a zone development and management organization we have always focused on how small innovative ideas in infrastructure and services can positively impact our customers. Just look at some of the innovations that are already up and running, such as the Hot Metal Road, a specially constructed route that enables the cost effective and energy efficient transport and delivery of molten aluminium. Then there is the Modular Path, an eight-lane highway designed to enable large plant and equipment to be transported directly between Khalifa Port and KIZAD customers. We have also specifically designed and built a Sea Water Cooling and Desalination System to ensure water returning to the sea is cooled down and causes no harm to marine life. Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi Ports, our parent company, was the first entity in the Middle East to build a semi-automated port, and Maqta Gateway, our sister organization, is today using the latest blockchain technology to find new ways to make trade faster, easier and more secure. Ultimately, KIZAD is much larger than just the organization developing and managing the zone and our vision on innovation is much larger too. The zone is a sum of all our industries, businesses and residents. We are confident that in next 10 to 15 years, KIZAD will be the most vibrant industrial hub in the region. Our investors come from different backgrounds, bring with them unique technologies and are initiating some very complex and interesting business and industrial ventures. Our objective is to work with them and create an environment of collaboration and innovation that will make us one of the most pioneering industrial hubs in the world. And by enabling trade and industrial investments through such innovation, we will set new standards for industrial zone infrastructure, environment and operation. One of our industrial companies such as TELEX developing a special alloy for producing automotive components for Porsche, or a logistics company creating an innovative process to get the products to market faster, is as much a matter of pride for us as our sister company Maqta Gateway creating a new blockchain-based solution for shipping and trade, or indeed we at KIZAD developing a new solution to serve the industry. The objective is to be innovative to constantly improve the life of businesses and the people we touch.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[recipes-for-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess 2018 as a year in terms of business prosperity and economic output?</h4><p>It takes a long time to evaluate economic data. Also, when discussing such issues, we should be paying attention to areas such as economic sustainability, economic flexibility, and governance of the economy in general. However, Sharjah's economy achieved good growth in 2018 with a rate of 3% with an average cumulative growth rate of 3.9% in the years preceding 2018 (3.4%, 3.8%, 7.7%) at current prices despite the volatility of world trade markets and the pressure of government spending. Based on historical data, Sharjah's GDP growth has one of the highest rates of sustainability locally, regionally, and internationally. It also refers to the average cumulative economic growth in Sharjah over the last 10 years. This means there is sustainability in the economy of the Emirate, which has excellent control over any structural imbalances. Thus, the overall situation is optimistic in an economy where GDP rose to AED93 billion (USD25 billion) in 2018. In addition, one of the most important pillars of optimism and sustainability is that the industrial sector remains the largest, with a relative weight of 16.9%. Sharjah's economy depends on three main sectors, namely the retail trade sector, which hit a relative weight of 12%; financial and insurance activities, with a relative weight of 10.3%; and real estate activities at 13%.</p><h4>In your view, which sectors are currently exhibiting the most potential for investment in Sharjah?</h4><p>Sharjah has long been a major attraction for individual and family investments. It was the first Emirate to have an airport as well as the first educational centers, schools, and libraries. In addition, Sharjah has one of the largest and oldest commercial ports, the port of Khor Fakkan. On top of this, Sharjah is characterized by its high absorptive capacity, thanks to the presence of the most important industrial zones established in the country at the end of the 1970s. Today, it has a major base in attracting foreign investment, especially in the field of industry. That base provides a range of important industries that offer foreign investors a great opportunity to run their projects well and thus encourage even more investment.</p><h4>How is increasing digitalization and AI affecting the economy in Sharjah? </h4><p>The Emirate of Sharjah has industrial zones that boast not only labor-intensive operations but also technologically advanced activities. These companies export to a wide number of countries around the world and the Gulf region and are becoming more aware of the need to innovate thanks to the work of institutions such as the University of Sharjah and the American University, as well as the increase in innovation incentives in the Emirate. The ICT sector represents 2% of GDP, while scientific and technical activities represent 6%. These two areas grew by 1.8% and 3.1% in 2017, respectively, encouraging growth across the Emirate through the development of new technologies. Also, His Highness, the Ruler of Sharjah, called for the establishment of two centers for technology. The first one is in place at the American University of Sharjah and the second is in a free zone but under the management of the University of Sharjah. They work to adapt any new ideas and improvements in the technological field.</p><h4>What are your main goals and objectives for 2019? </h4><p>Growth in Sharjah continued in 2018 in various sectors based on the growth achieved over the past 10 years. The Emirate has not been affected by external volatility, but the growth rates achieved have made the department keen to lead development in all areas through clear objectives. These objectives include controlling markets, increasing investment, and facilitating procedures. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess 2018 in terms of business prosperity and economic output of Sharjah?</h4><p>Increasing investor trust and confidence was the main highlight of Sharjah's economic performance in 2018. This key metric has continued to drive the Emirate's economic diversification efforts by boosting the inflow of  FDI across sectors. Sharjah's stature as the region's education hub and the availability of skilled human capital in the Emirate have also contributed to attracting more global companies looking to set up their Middle East operations. One of the Emirate's most ambitious projects in 2018 was linking the Sharjah Research, Technology and Innovation Park (SRTI) to American University of Sharjah (AUS). This was seamlessly executed under the leadership of Hussain Al Mahmoudi, CEO of SRTI. It serves as a significant step forward in the Emirate's efforts to establish itself as a knowledge economy. </p><h4>What specific strategies is the Sharjah government employing in the UAE in heading toward a more sustainable future?</h4><p>The challenge with the term sustainability is its abstractness. To really be able to measure success in the area, we need to break down the concept into quantifiable elements. Sharjah's regulatory environment has been ensuring that economic sustainability is driven by infrastructural and other investments, which are beneficial to our nation and our investors in the long run. Meanwhile, the Emirate is driving social sustainability by constantly upgrading standard of living and the overall quality of life here. Last, but not least, environmental sustainability is high on Sharjah's agenda. </p><h4>How do you implement digitalization and machine learning?</h4><p>The government of Sharjah, in line with the UAE's strategy, continues its digitalization efforts. E-government today is a thing of the past. What we are looking at now is digital Sharjah. The unique needs of cities in the Middle East will require a different approach to developing digital cities, be it innovation in building materials or how we collect data on our environment. Also, industry leaders such as Google, IBM, and Microsoft have been busy seeking to understand the impact of technology on culture. It is extremely exciting that this is something that will find a home in Sharjah in 2019. It has only happened here because of His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, a member of the Supreme Council, alongside the Ruler of Sharjah's continued investment in culture over the past 50 years.</p><h4>What are your main goals and objectives for 2019?</h4><p>In 2019, Sharjah's international cultural exchange portfolio took priority at the Department of Government Relations. One of the many leading cultural efforts made by the Ruler of Sharjah in 2018 was to reinvigorate the African Hall in Sharjah. The purpose was to reactivate its role as a center for cultural exchange and a place where Africa's cultural diversity can be celebrated, right here in the UAE. In addition, our department will be pushing ahead to further some of the objectives Sharjah has set as UNESCO World Book Capital 2019. Some of our key literary, business, and educational events include the International Government Communication Forum, Sharjah International Book Fair, Sharjah Entrepreneurship Festival, Sharjah FDI Forum, Africa Hall's cultural program, and several more. With these events, our objective is to offer our visitors the latest and most relevant knowledge and expertise across these sectors. We are in a landmark year for Sharjah. All the work we have done over the years is meant to offer the knowledge of Emirati and Arab cultures to cities worldwide, as a gesture of friendship. Any opportunity for human exchange brings with it a need for cultural understanding. Our view in Sharjah is that every fruitful relationship—be it between two individuals, communities, cities, or nations—begins with cultural exchange. This is the reason for our strong focus on books and reading. Sharjah's understanding and practice of “humanism first" continues to deepen its unique presence on the world map. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey's tourism industry has always benefited from its location between the European and Asian markets, but only recently has come to benefit from the opening of the new Istanbul Airport. What impact will this have on the tourism industry?</h4><p>Almost 98% of visitors who come to Turkey come here by plane from foreign countries. The first phase of the new Istanbul Airport has opened, and when it is fully completed in 2023 it will have an annual capacity of 200 million people. This is important especially for the passengers arriving in transit from abroad. Besides that, our national airline, Turkish Airlines, and the other airlines will develop new routes. With this, Turkish guests will have the opportunity for flights to the destinations all around the world. Turkish Airlines started to go to Cuba this year and a route to Mexico is going to start. Similarly, new routes to Vietnam and Thailand are opening. This is important because of the tourism potential of Turkey, and also the potential for business travel. The timing of the airport's opening is excellent. In 2016 and 2017, there were negative effects because of political and terrorism-related reasons, especially in tourism mobility. However, in 2018 and 2019, the numbers have been good. In 2019, we had a goal of 40 million tourists and USD40 billion worth of tourism. By 2023, this could have been 50 million tourists and USD50 billion, but now we are expecting 75 million tourists and USD75 billion. If we can reach this goal, we will be the fifth or sixth top tourism destination in the world. In this sense, the airport is important. It helps Turkey to reach its potential.</p><h4>How has Jolly kept pace with tourism growth in Turkey?</h4><p>Jolly is a company with 33 years of experience in Turkey tourism industry. We have operations in leisure, business travel and MICE. We have been working with both local and global suppliers to enable Turkish tourist to travel around the world. All business units have recorded strong healthy growth in last 10 years. This ongoing trend has bloomed with Goldman Sachs' investment in our company. Goldman Sachs first invested in Jolly in 2015, and it chose to buy a second stake with us in November 2018. Now, we have a foreign investor within our company. They have minor shares, and the management is still done by the Vardar family.</p><h4>How has Goldman Sach's investment allowed Jolly to expand outside of Turkey?</h4><p>This was an important step for us, turning the Jolly brand into an international tourism company. We want to contribute to Turkey's tourism sector. The first step for us was to change the whole technological infrastructure of our company. After 3 years of hard work, we have developed our own ERP system which also has been funded by Goldman Sachs. We have made an important start in our short-, medium-, and long-term plans. After a full deployment in Turkey, we are planning to export this technology around the globe as well. On the other hand, we will work on expanding our outbound operations in key markets. With our previous partners with Germany's Öger Tour and Russia's Moss Tour, we have brought 2,6 million tourists to Turkey in 90s. Now we will start our incoming business again.</p><h4>How will this strategy change impact your customer profile?</h4><p>As Jolly, we annually serve around 1 million Turkish tourists. 80% of this is inbound and 20% of it is outgoing tourism. As I mentioned before, we have reached a very important point in our future strategy. In this new period following Goldman Sachs's second investment, we have made our goal to work our brand in foreign countries too, starting now in 2019. We will sell our local contracted hotels to the providers in foreign countries within our system. We are the biggest operator in Anatolian tours. We have Black Sea Tours, Gap Tours, Aegean Tours, and Mediterranean Tours for our domestic guests. Now our goal is to take our international guests, especially European guests, on the Anatolian Tours with our 33 years of experience. Last but not least, another focus area for us will be MICE. We are currently serving more than 300 companies in organizing meetings, business trips or congress. We will also start providing this service to foreign companies.</p><h4>Across Jolly's products, where do you see the most revenue growth and profitability right now?</h4><p>In our package tours, individual hotels, airplane tickets, and all the other tourism products, price is the most important variable. No matter how strong your brand is, you have to offer a better price as well. Our most important two products in volume are flight tickets and hotel accommodation, and we have identified the hotel segment as an area of focus for us. Airlines already offer their guests better prices on their web sites and often charge no service fees; hence, profitability for us is much lower compared to the hotels. We are trying to increase our profitability in hotels. In 2019, our goal is to get 7,000 hotels in Turkey on our website. We created an extra net for this. Hotels on our own site define their own prices, their capacity, and their programs. We used to make contracts and then entered them into our system, but now we give hotels their own platform for this.</p><h4>What untapped potential do you see in the domestic market, and how is Jolly working to capture the domestic market's growth?</h4><p>The main goal here is finding people who are just beginning to travel. There are 82 million citizens living in Turkey, but right now only 8 million of these travel through travel agencies. That 10% is a low number. As Jolly, we are now creating a marketing campaign to bring our services to the people in the rest of Turkey, not only in large cities. We have positioned this campaign to show people that they are not just purchasing a holiday. Each dollar spent on tourism has an important impact on the country. In fact, 30 years ago, Jolly took its first guests to the Black Sea. The owner of the vehicle we used has now become the owner of the biggest bus rental company there. We took our guests to Antakya. A person working in a shop that sold pişmaniye on the road has become the owner of the largest local food shop in Antakya. We are also creating a very passionate network that works for Turkish tourism. For instance, the son of a local Vendor in Diyarbakır is now working as a guide in Anatolia tours and his family is operating a guest house where they exhibit their local traditions and lifestyle. We created those memories and turned them into a major marketing campaign that reached to 25 million guests with 32 videos on TV channels, cinemas, newspaper ads, YouTube, and the internet.</p><h4>How has Jolly changed its operations and strategy to adapt to changes in technology and how people book vacations?</h4><p>If you cannot fulfill the requirements of the customer, you cannot be competitive. Thus, technology is important. We established a technology company named Gordion technologies in 2012. Goldman Sachs became a partner to this company too. They saw a vision there, and after their second investment November 2018 we changed the whole technological infrastructure. So, in terms of what we call end-to-end tourism mobility, we can carry out operations with a technology program from the first purchase of the guest to the last point. In this new period, thanks to our technological infrastructure, our guests will buy their concert tickets in their destination over our system, they will be able to purchase train tickets, make reservations in any restaurant they like, they will be able to buy match tickets in the coming year. We have a lot of ideas and plans. We will realize all of them in the new era.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Companies from all sectors are also focused on improving customer service to give consumers the best experience. This industry is about service. If you want to play in other countries, you can do it on tablet, PC, or cellphone, wherever you want, though nothing compares to being in the casino, because it is all about experience. We have to give them not only a place to go, but an experience to enjoy. </p><h4>How will APOJUEGOS help bring more tourism to Panama?</h4><p>In Panama, tourism is essential. We are a country mainly of services, and tourism is a key part of our economy. Bringing more tourism to Panama will help all sectors, and Panama's well-founded casino industry offers tourists the best casinos in the region with a wide offering of gambling.</p><h4>What positive impact does the industry have on the country?</h4><p>We can name a number of benefits starting with thousands of employees who work directly in the industry, hiring Panamanian musicians and artists to perform in the casinos, and sponsoring sporting and cultural events. In addition are all the business partners who benefit from our activity, not to mention the millions that go into the state's coffers in the form of taxes. </p><h4>What are your main goals for 2019? </h4><p>We need to strengthen the position of the sector and its relationship with the government. That will require accompanying all the initiatives as a team to identify the right opportunities to develop the sector even more. In line with the country's priorities, we also need to foster relations with the hospitality and tourism sector, as we are the ones promoting entertainment in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have had a presence in the Panamanian market for 100 years. What does this mean to you and your company?</h4><p>It makes us proud and reveals our ability to adapt over time. We are not afraid to change with the times and constantly innovate. Escoffery was founded by my great grandfather in 1916. It began as a small distribution company, focused more on veterinary products. In 1982, we started focusing more on food products, especially for supermarkets. When I joined in 2005, we acquired a grains and bean packing plant, and in 2014 we opened our own water bottling plant.  We are also constantly going into different channels of distribution. I plan to grow strategically, improve, and lead Escoffery into the future.</p><h4>What are you working on in terms of products? </h4><p>Quality mass consumption products are our specialty. Our goal as we expand our product inventory is to find great priced quality foods to offer our customers. We try to bring the best value products to the consumer, avoiding both high-end overpriced items and poor quality products. With this in mind, every time we choose a brand to represent, we go for companies with similar values as us—great quality and value. We are a family-owned business and love to work with other family-owned businesses that share our values and drive for innovation.</p><h4>How do you plan to expand throughout Panama?  </h4><p>Our distribution channels cover the entire country. We have our own warehouses located in Panama, another near AguaDulce, in central Panama, and one in David, in the western part of Panama. We need to reach our consumers wherever they are. We want to be there ourselves. Escoffery uses wholesalers for some hard to reach areas that are far from urban centers. As far as expansion goes, we will represent more brands and increase our reach to customers.</p><h4>What's ahead in terms of operations and new brands?</h4><p>We believe in constant transformation. Hence, we want to gain more market share, better relationships, and increase the happiness of our consumers and employees. We are waiting to see the country's plans for the coming years. We will then adjust or adapt our business strategies accordingly. In the meantime, we are working on efficiency and trying to be prepared for whatever may come. We are always on the lookout for new brands, but right now we are focused on the ones that align with our strategies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main highlights for 2018? </h4><p>We have increased our traffic by around 16%, which is positive for a new shopping center in its third year. Additionally, sales in our stores are increasing, as our goal in 2018 was to have a sustainable increase in sales per square meter. We had a consolidation of our mix of tenants and occupancy and maintained a 91% occupancy rate. For 2019, our main objective for the combination of tenants is to increase our offerings of services in the shopping center with more banks and services, combined with clothing, restaurants, and entertainment.</p><h4>Is there a specific strategy you are implementing to achieve your goals? </h4><p>We align our increase in traffic with the increase in sales, a broader strategy aimed more at local customers than tourists. We must get the local families that visit us to consume in our stores, eat in our restaurants, and have fun in our entertainment areas. Therefore, our strategies are designed primarily for local families with children, although we note that people are saving more than in previous years, but they will continue to enjoy the experience we offer them and visit us more. In addition, the increase in services at the mall is a direct response to the demands of our consumers, and we must provide them with additional services when requested at the mall.</p><h4>How did the World Youth Day impact your operations?</h4><p>During the event, we had 14,000 people traveling by bus from the interior of the country. It was a wonderful experience to have young people from so many countries. Everyone's performance at the mall has been excellent.</p><h4>How do you plan to attract more tourists to the mall?</h4><p>The first step is to offer our best service to the standards that tourists expect in terms of cleanliness, spoken languages, and opening hours, among others. The cruise segment attracts people interested in seeing what is offered locally. Therefore, we include ourselves in their local tours, which include tours of the city, the Panama Canal, and shopping, since not all tourists come to Panama exclusively to go shopping. In addition, we seek to secure international brands that other shopping centers do not carry. </p><h4>What is coming up in terms of events? </h4><p>Our strategy is to organize events throughout the year for all ages and demographics. We have developed a calendar where we have included the days that are celebrated locally, but also times when we know locals are looking for alternatives to enjoy as a family. We focus on several pillars to generate alliances and offer innovative and quality events that make us a reference in the industry, always highlighting our stores, gastronomy, and entertainment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the idea of setting up In Fit come about, and why Panama?</h4><p>In Fit is a dynamic brand that comes with the need to offer a personalized training for people who want to make a change in their lives, but do not have enough time to do it—an electro stimulation suit that facilitates muscle movement straight to the eight deepest muscle groups fibers—chest, abs, arms, upper middle and lower back, buttocks, and legs—the equivalent of exercising for 20 minutes with a professional trainer. After market research in different Latin American cities, we decided to open our first club in Panama due to the country's economic growth. The first to offer this kind of training, we have three strategically located clubs in Panama City. </p><h4>Fitness products and centers are already quite popular. How do you stand out?</h4><p>Innovation and excellent service are our mainstays, which is why we have fitness assistants who schedule daily appointments and provide continuous monitoring to our partners and customers to help them achieve their goals. We also have a club suitable for the attention of a single person by taking measurements every eight sessions and offering protein post-workout, showers, and amenities. </p><h4>What are some of the benefits of using In Fit system instead of a traditional gym?</h4><p>We always describe the training in In Fit as a unique experience, and this is due to, among other things, the electro stimulation whose popularity has been increasing worldwide, since it mixes traditional functional exercises with the impulses that go directly to the deeper fibers of the muscle, which helps control weight loss, activate metabolism, increase muscle mass, and rehabilitate musculoskeletal injuries. In Fit works with a unique special suit, and our 20 minutes are equivalent to two to three hours of conventional exercise. We also offer unique privacy since in other centers one has to wait to use the machines, while our staff are always ready to conduct the proper follow-up, making people's objectives easier to achieve.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With more than 66 years in the region, how have you managed to stand out as a leader?</h4><p>We have a mission statement: We do now what patients need next. It has been our mission statement for more than 10 years. Innovation is at the core of everything we do, thanks to our employees. That is why, being based in Switzerland, Roche is the biggest biotechnology company in the world. We invest close to 20% of our revenues in R&amp;D, with a focus on personalized care. </p><h4>What role does Panama play in your portfolio?</h4><p>We provide services to more than 25 countries and operate directly in 11. This is an important challenge because of the diverse geography. Managing these 25 countries out of Panama increases the complexity of the business and means we need to stay abreast of every regulation, government, and policy because they differ from country to country. Each conforms to a different structure to which we need to adapt. </p><h4>How is your regional presence aligned with your expansion strategy in Latin America?</h4><p>We have sustainable growth across all Latin American countries. On average, we have been duplicating the growth of the market in almost all Latin American countries, Central America, and the Caribbean. The market grew 4.5%, and we grew 8%. This is great because the innovation pipeline we receive from global headquarters is definitely the right products and solutions to fill the gaps in our countries and affiliates. We operate directly for Central America and the Caribbean out of Panama. There are currently approximately 100 jobs in Panama City and a total of 250 in the entire affiliate.</p><h4>How have you increased the value of your products to attract more clients and partners?</h4><p>Less than 60% of the Central American and Caribbean population has access to healthcare. Our biggest mission is to make sure we increase the reach of the remaining population, so the objective is to continue being the leader in healthcare, specifically in our diagnostics business, as well as pharmaceuticals. To achieve this, we have three pillars. First, with digital transformation, we are launching a portfolio of IT software solutions. We use all the generated data to produce insights as epidemic, operations, production, or diagnostic testing data. Second, we offer the most integrated solutions in the market. Third, we provide education to our doctors and have our own doctors in-house. </p><h4>How would you describe your social commitment when it comes to the Accu-check for Aventis?</h4><p>We have a few products for professionals, but also have huge portfolio of solutions that are more directly related to patients. Accu-check is one of them. We are fully committed to supporting diabetes patients in Panama. Since the end of 2017, we have established 11 centers within Roche pharmacies to provide support to patients with diabetes. In those centers, patients receive counseling in nutrition from qualified nutritionists and education on managing their disease. They can also receive technical services to advise them on how to better manage their blood glucose levels. This program has been successful, as we have reached over 6,000 patients, and the service continues to grow in Panama. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-wealth-of-regions]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of CAMCHI's recent achievements?</h4><p>CAMCHI has established itself as a solid and strong-willed organization that promotes the advantages and opportunities of trade and investments in the province of Chiriquí­ with national and international projection for the benefit of integral and sustainable development of the region. Furthermore, we have achieved respect and recognition of the work we do from the general public and the authorities themselves, with whom we have been promoting various projects in PPPs, such as the Business Roundtable, the launch of the Discover Destination Brand Chiriquí­ to promote tourism, and the Competitiveness Center of the Western Region of the CECOMRO Country, which helps integrate the provinces of Chiriquí­, Bocas del Toro, and La Comarca Ngäbe Buglé to support agricultural production, among others. All of the different chambers of commerce installed in the Republic of Panama are mutual entities. </p><h4>In regard to new business lines, where do you see the most potential?</h4><p>We have discovered some valuable points with the help of the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), including the quality of coffee. In fact, we found seven products that were the best for export. One was coffee and the second was cocoa, discovered in the northern region of Bocas de Toro. In addition, we have milk, tomatoes, bananas, as well as green vegetables. Our bananas and pineapples are the best when it comes to sweetness, even higher than Colombia or Ecuador. We do not produce large quantities, but we produce a premium quality. </p><h4>Would you say you are doing a lot of promotion or knocking on doors to get your message out?</h4><p>We are certainly knocking on doors. Even more, we have approached the canal administrator about all the different programs we have, both business-related and social. It was delighted to hear what we are doing, so we are expecting more support from it in order to help our project. It was the first visit by our chamber to the canal administration. We were founded in 1951, so you can calculate how many years have gone by. We received its administrators here, but we had never gone there. </p><h4>What is the main focus of the CAMCHI when it comes to attracting international investors?</h4><p>The main focus of our chamber is to convince major investment players to come to our area. We are trying to bring, and have been successful in bringing, a fish farm into the Puerto Armuelles area, a USD50-million investment. Furthermore, it will build a hatchery plant and grow into small fish before being hatched in big cages in Chiriquí­ Bay. In about two years' time, we will get amberjack fish exported from that area to the US. This is the fourth investment from this company, which has already invested in Hawaii, Africa, and Brazil. The fourth is here, and they say this is the best area they have found, apart from Hawaii. Our job is to eagerly look for new investors such as this to create more value for the employment we need in our area. We are not looking for merely low-quality employment. We are also looking for better paid, high-level employment that creates wealth. Low-quality employment doesn't solve any problems.</p><h4>What is in the pipeline for the CAMCHI?</h4><p>In our area, we are planning to continue all of our efforts in agribusiness and logistics. In Panama, we will build an international food hub in the canal zone. That is why we wanted to speak to the canal administrator. It is making investments with the backing of the Dutch government. One of the ideas we have is to back a project for building another port near Chiriquí­. We need to bring in all the fertilizers and everything we will need, but we also need to export. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Secret to Success]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-secret-to-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of your achievements in the last 30 years?</h4><p>We have been learning about new opportunities to do business and keep growing in sales. The region is focused on strengthening the agricultural sector. The company has formed key partnerships over the years. Exploiting that win-win social relationship is important and it causes other companies to want to do the same, creating more competition and opportunities. We feel satisfied as a national company because our company was able to access the private tender of Del Monte for the economic reactivation of Barú. This means that technical training has become a necessity. It is necessary that individuals are in line with the latest technology because that allows us to compete globally.</p><h4>How has your business portfolio impacted your operations?</h4><p>When the company was founded, we worked extensively with companies and suppliers of sprinkling equipment, drip equipment, and valves in Israel. Subsequently, with globalization, we started to work with companies in Italy. At present, our main suppliers are in Spain, the US, and Israel. One of our successes is that we have learned to manage and optimize our supply chain. We have been able to optimize freight rates and orders, and this has made it easier for us to compete better with affordable prices. We have to thank international suppliers because some have worked with us for more than 25 years.</p><h4>How has the company's experience translated into growth?</h4><p>Of the companies that sell and supply the same services, we are the only one with a branch outside the province for 15 years. The branch is located in the city of Chitré, where there is more need for irrigation. We have remained there, and there have been sacrifices, but it has been worth it. In addition, this inspires the loyalty of clients and investors because we are there every day for many years. They see seriousness and commitment, which generates loyalty. </p><h4>Are you planning to expand internationally?</h4><p>In Central America, we have plans to expand into Costa Rica and Guatemala. Nicaragua has potential, but its political conditions force us to be careful. The same is true for Cuba. We will always consider these countries because we see potential in them. In fact, since we are partners with the main irrigation manufacturers in the world, we can establish a presence in every market. </p><h4>How do you diversify and innovate?</h4><p>The main niche of the company is agriculture and livestock, but we have also been a key part of every megaproject in Panama. This includes supplying materials for the expansion of the Canal and Puente Centenario. This makes the difference. For example, when the mining industry was peaking, we sold a significant quantity of the geomembrane used to make water reservoirs. Geomembrane is also used in mining to make the reservoirs where the treated products go. Our success is in undertaking and innovating products that have multiple uses. This keeps the company alive and maintains the loyalty of the people. It is an integration of entrepreneurship and innovation, though the human part plays an equally important role.</p><h4>What are some of your CSR initiatives?</h4><p>We always support students, especially those from the Zamorano University of Honduras, University of Chile, and University of Panama. Our focus is on hiring young graduates and helping them learn. This is something we have been doing for over 25 years. In addition, we receive engineering students from Universidad Tecnologica, Universidad Latina, and other universities.</p><h4>What are the goals of the company for 2020?</h4><p>We want to grow our sales and expand. The development of the Barú area is a reality, and that puts us in a favorable economic situation. With the new government, many works related to rural infrastructure such as galleys, irrigation systems, irrigation districts, and communication routes will be tendered. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[climbing-the-learning-curve]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your relocation of regional headquarters to Colombia changed Coca-Cola's regional operations?</h4><p>We had several objectives, the first being to be based in our biggest market with the greatest opportunities. Colombia's time has come, and locating the sector hub in Colombia was in the best interest of our company and its associates. We still have a hub in San José, Costa Rica, and spread the Board of Directors across those two hubs. There is a great talent pool available in Colombia. Meanwhile, Latin America accounts for a third of the company's global business. Within the totality, it ranks among the top 25 countries in the world, and we intend to make it bigger still. These factors all played a role in our decision to relocate. We saw a steady increase in the volume of sales last year, though we are still on a learning curve as we progress towards becoming a total beverage company. In 2018, the trademark brand grew at a healthy rate, in particular our Sin Azucar, sugar-free variant. We have launched close to 40 products, and also reformulated about 70% of our products. Some worked really well, and others less so. This is the learning aspect, where we listen to the consumer, make quick tests and reformulations, and repackage accordingly. The great World Cup activation last year was fantastic. As a company with over 30 years in the market, we need to be a little anxious, to better learn from the market without holding back. We need to learn and experiment just as start-ups do. With that in mind, my number-one goal for 2019 is to see more empowered associates that feel free to experiment and adapt. With empowered associates comes greater innovation and more differentiation in processes for each aspect of the business.</p><h4>How is Coca-Cola using new technology to revolutionize its processes?</h4><p>Our bottler in Panama, Coca-Cola FEMSA, is the first company in the country to have a 100% clean energy supply, an historic milestone for local industry. This action responds to the sustainability and environmental care initiatives proposed by the company in order to promote the growth of the business in a socially responsible way. In 2018, we made a global commitment called World without Waste. We aim to collect and recycle plastic containers equivalent to the amount we produce, which we are well on our way to achieving. We continue to try experimenting with technologies in the recuperation of plastic. We are specifically further ahead in the recyclability of our packages. Our team associated with that is engaged and coming up with new ways to deliver and sell Coca-Cola products, including AdeS, our soy-based beverage, and Frutal, a nectar we launched in 2019. There is considerable work being done leveraging technology. </p><h4>How is Coca-Cola responding to the changing market demand for new, healthier, products?</h4><p>What we do best is listen to consumers. They want beverages that taste good and want to have the variety depending on their preference at any given point. And that is what we are doing. We have reformulated our portfolio to lower sugar or sugar-free variants. Many Coca-Cola trademark consumers like the red and may want the original taste Coca-Cola. Even our nectars have a low sugar content. From the get go, new products reflect consumers' wishes. We want our nectars to mostly have sugars from the juice base, and not added sugars, as well as taste good. The importance of the whole innovation process is that consumers change and look for new variety while maintaining their desire to have something that tastes good. We underwent a new process that prioritized effectiveness. And we have found that when we focus on fewer, bigger, bolder bets, we do better than when we are spread across different efforts that may dilute our energy and investments. A perfect example is the Red Coke No Sugar instead of a Coke Zero. Instead of spending money branding many different brands, we have built one brand, called Coca-Cola with Variants. It is part of being more effective, while at the same time being more efficient because we are marketing one brand instead of three. </p><h4>What will be the next big, bold bet for Coca-Cola in Panama?</h4><p>There will be more of a focus on the importance of being there, and on availability and affordability. Sometimes we focus on the more glamorous side of business. However, we have a returnable campaign that we launched this year telling our consumers that buying returnable packages helps their personal economy and the environment. We want to continue doing that. While it may not wow people that much now, it will extend our access to families with an affordable, family-sized product in a returnable, environmentally-friendly package, which is a big deal. We will not stop until that package is seen everywhere. Not only is it good for the environment, but also for Panamanian families that could otherwise ill afford a Coca-Cola. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Argos has 85 years in the market and a widespread experience in Latin America. So, how does this trajectory relate to the success of the company in Panama?</h4><p>Our history in Panama started in 2000 through a joint venture, though upon seeing the great potential here, in 2009 we sought to acquire the total participation of Cementos Panamá. After a successful consolidation process based on the understanding of local culture and knowledge transfer, in 2013 we made the brand change and offered all our experience and innovative processes to the local market.</p><h4>What does Panama mean in the Argos portfolio?</h4><p>Panama is definitely one of the two most relevant markets in the Caribbean and Central America Region. It is an important logistics center and has the dynamism of a developed market, despite being relatively small. This market offers us important knowledge and allows us to contribute to the construction of dreams that boost development and transform lives. Thanks to our value proposition, we have accompanied the strategic development of the country through the delivery of our products for projects as relevant as the expansion of the Panama Canal, Terminal 2 of Tocumen Airport, and the Metro.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the reputation of Argos?</h4><p>Thanks to the trust that our customers have placed in Argos, together we have built, a recognized brand that, today, has operations in 15 countries and reaches more than 34 destinations. Our company has deep understanding of the different market dynamics, the geographical diversification that helps mitigate risks through the balance of economic cycles, the service vocation of its employees and the innovative solutions we that have allowed us to position ourselves as a benchmark in the industry. Despite the challenges of the industry, we have created sustainable value that accompanies the progress of the territories and contributes to the building of dreams for housing, community development, and a better infrastructure in the Americas. Our commitment to innovation and sustainability also made it possible for the company to enter the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the sixth consecutive year. We are proud to be recognized as one of the most sustainable companies in the world, which generates confidence in our shareholders and investors. Similarly, this increases the capability to receive more investment to grow more and to provide more significant benefits.</p><h4>What does the opening of Terminal 2 of Tocumen airport represent for Argos' operations in Panama? </h4><p>We are very proud to have been part of this iconic project. For this work, we dispatched about 126,000cbm of ready-mix in total, which is equivalent to 21,000 trips by mixer trucks. The airport will generate more opportunities for trade, travel, and business in the country. </p><h4>What are your target sectors in Panama?</h4><p>Our higher purpose is to build dreams that boost development and transform lives in Panama. For this, we want to be allies of our customers and carry out infrastructure, housing, and community development projects, allowing us to continue to accompany the country's growth.</p><h4>How can the new government contribute to the business environment?</h4><p>The recovery of the country has already begun, although it is not yet reflected in the indicators. In the medium term, we remain cautiously positive in light of the solid portfolio of infrastructure projects and the initiatives announced by the new government to boost the construction sector in both the residential and infrastructure segments. Developments such as the law of public-private partnerships, the extension of subsidies to interest rates for social housing up to the price range of USD180,000, and the adoption of standards and technical regulations in cement are all extremely encouraging.</p><h4>How is Argos' commitment to the development of the country defined?</h4><p>We do not conceive the success of our company if there is no development of all the stakeholders with whom we interact. So, when we enter a country or generate a business, we look for development for all. We are committed to generating decent, stable, and quality employment, strengthening capacities in communities, and contributing to the improvement of educational and social infrastructure to create value and shared growth opportunities. We are also convinced that cement and concrete are strategic materials for sustainable development, since they contribute to the construction of cities that respond to environmental challenges, infrastructure that contributes to the revitalization of the economy and projects that strengthen the industrialization and interconnection of the regions.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>Our goal is to see the major infrastructure works of the country materialize, such as the fourth bridge over the canal, line three of the metro and the extensions of the other two lines, the beach corridor, and the consolidation of logistics sector. We are excited to contribute to Panama's economic dynamism in 2019 and beyond. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some success stories of water-related projects in Panama?</h4><p>Isla Colón in Bocas del Toro has seen success in tourism. A decade ago, the first water project took place there, and from there the area grew. We brought the technology, all built in Colombia, and in less than 60 days the plant was ready to operate. We have done direct filtering projects that are not known in Panama. Raw drinking water comes from the mountains, and it passes through a conditioning system to strain away all the pollutants. It is a filtration system that uses a storage tank. We have not only managed to significantly reduce processing time, but also the space required. It takes less space and fewer man hours, which makes water treatment technology more practical. </p><h4>Who are your clients and strategic allies in the Panamanian market?</h4><p>We have found support from the National Council for Sustainable Development (CONADES). It invests in drinking water and sanitation in rural areas. IDAAN has asked us for support, technology, and services in sanitation and drinking water. As for the private sector, there are companies in the construction sector with their own engineering projects. We have supported them, along with multinational companies, as well. </p><h4>Would you like to explore more markets in the region?</h4><p>One of the objectives for 2020-2021 is to expand our operations to Central America and the Caribbean, specifically in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. There are fantastic possibilities and opportunities. </p><h4>What sectors would you like to cover in Panama?</h4><p>We are interested in providing water for the food and beverage sector. Seven liters of water are needed to produce one liter of beer. The residue must be used and treated to comply with the regulations. Panama is avoiding imports and is giving support to the local agricultural sector. That support means opportunities for us. There is a great deal of talk about the exploitation and importation of copper. There is a lot of export of fruit in the north of the country, in Chiriquí­ and Bocas. The agricultural sector is growing in the north of the country. </p><h4>What is your contribution to the development of Panama?</h4><p>We sell all kinds of technology for the welfare of the population. In addition, we target development objectives. We aim to improve the quality of drinking water and sanitation. Furthermore, we have found rewarding projects in communities that have never had easy access to clean water. They appreciate our work, and that motivates us to continue. Our commitment has always been to see the development of the communities. If you have clean water, the development of a community happens naturally. Piña is a small town in Darién that never had much clean water, but today it has quality water and the opportunity to expand its tourism sector. It can reduce the levels of water contamination that leads to gastrointestinal illness. This commitment has led us to operate in different sectors of Panama that need water treatment and sanitation.</p><h4>What other projects do you have in the process? </h4><p>Panama has a plan to develop more drinking water and wastewater projects. Both have materialized in the sanitation facility along Panama Bay, and the plant is now operational after three years. Also, Arraiján already has a sanitation program. All these projects outside the city have a massive impact. Nowadays, Coronado has impressive population growth. That is the goal. In Colón, another of our flagship projects, there is progress. Additionally, Alto de Los Lagos is a housing project where the outgoing president developed 5,500 homes, and we built the wastewater treatment plant. The government has invested in improving the quality of life, and that means water and sanitation projects. There are interesting things coming up. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With more than 1,300 employees in Central America, Colombia, and Ecuador, how have you managed your resources in a sustainable way?</h4><p>SUEZ has set an ambitious target to respond to the environmental, economic, and social challenges of the 21st century. In fact, worldwide, and more than elsewhere in Latin America, water scarcity has become a major challenge and we estimate the gap between demand and supply will reach 40% in 2030. Our aim is to implement solutions that could reduce this and help every citizen get access to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation. One of the best examples that I can mention is the complete water management we implemented in Cartagena de Indias in Colombia. Our subsidiary, Aguas de Cartagena, celebrated 24 years of successes this year. We built water networks to reach 99.9% of coverage of aqueducts and offer a continuity of service to our 260,000 customers. With sustainable technologies implemented, we also acquired several certifications, such as the ISO 14000.</p><h4>What have been SUEZ's major accomplishments over its 50 years in the Colombian market?</h4><p>SUEZ is one of the five-oldest French companies in Colombia, believing in the sustainable development of the country despite the difficulties we've tackled up. Implementing the notion of sustainability in Latin America 50 years ago was not easy, but we are proud of having this historical presence in Colombia where we worked with both the industrial sector (Ecopetrol in 1997) and municipalities (Palmira, Cali, Cartagena, and Bogotá). Moreover, we are present in both the water and waste sectors. Over the last few decades, Colombia has significantly expanded the management of its water and waste resources, preserving the environment and improving the quality of life and health of almost 49 million inhabitants. Although challenges remain, SUEZ is proud to have participated in Colombia's environmental development.</p><h4>What do your operations in Panama represent for your business portfolio?</h4><p>We have an important presence in Panama considering that since 2008 it became our base for the Central American and Caribbean region. Panama has invested in a large program to reinforce sanitation in the capital called “Sanitation Program of Panama," which is unique in its magnitude and efficiency. Hence, SUEZ took part in this adventure building and operating the wastewater treatment plant in Juan Dí­az and operating the sewage networks in Panama City. Therefore, the Panama plant is one of the most advanced in Latin America and the biggest in Central America.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your commitment to the circular economy and your activities here in the short term?</h4><p>The circular economy has started to become a commonplace. It has been years since SUEZ changed its approach to the business by promoting sustainable solutions to industrial and governmental clients. The circular economy is the result of innovation and collaboration between players and collective intelligence. In the short term, we would like to build self-sufficient projects in order to reduce energy consumption. In Panama, we built the first module of Juan Dí­az, reaching 18% energy self-sufficiency. In 2020, the second module will allow the plant to reach 25% self-sufficiency. Thus, we will move forward with the implementation of a sustainable business model. </p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2019?</h4><p>On a global Scale, SUEZ implemented a project called “Shaping 2030" that gave us the general roadmap of the company. On the back of our valuable assets, such as our values, reputation, experience, and human resources, we plan to target the industrial market in Panama and Central America by using our innovations as a key competitive advantage. On a local scale, we are working on the implementation of advanced solutions to help cities in the optimization of water management. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your experience inform the targets you have reached in the last year of operations?</h4><p><span></span><strong>GABRIEL SANABRIA </strong>CPM was founded in Puerto Rico in 1991, and the company started operations in Panama in 2008. CPM's relationships with its clients are guided by its core values, including knowledge, ethics, drive, and transparency. We help our clients excel by transforming ideas and plans into tangible results. Thus, we have more than two decades of experience in technical advice, project management, and construction management. We actively advise our clients as they strive to reach their goals. Our commitment is to develop long-lasting and trust-based relationships as the cornerstone of our business; transparency with our clients is also essential. Additionally, we focus on the strategic drivers of our projects, as well as time, budget, quality, and compliance with regulations. </p><p><span></span><strong>HECTOR RIVERA</strong> Our most valuable asset is our human resources. This is a key part of our success, and we take the hiring process seriously. We want people to develop their careers within our company.</p><h4>Why did the company choose Panama, and how would you describe the Panama operations?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HR</strong> Panama has been a key destination for us, because it is a regional hub. Several of our clients are in other parts of Central and South America, and having a presence in Panama allows us to manage these projects. Over time, we have taken the developments we have made in Panama and expanded across the region. The position of Panama as a main hub has allowed us to expand across new markets. Panama is a key office for our operations. </p><p><span></span><strong>GS </strong>Our operation in Puerto Rico is comprised of a diverse client portfolio, working mainly with pharmaceutical companies, infrastructure firms, the government, and so on. In Panama, we are focused only on the private sector, reaching the high-end and high-quality project niche. The added value of project managers is typically for those who are focused on quality. On top of this, we are planning to expand our presence in Latin America, such as Guatemala, El Salvador, and Colombia, to share our knowledge and expertise. We consider that these markets will allow us to continue to make developments as technical advisors in construction and project management and PPPs.</p><h4>How have you managed to be successful with your PPPs? </h4><p><strong>GS</strong> We have a strong team that brought strong knowledge on PPPs as we started working on several procurement processes. We also participate in workshops to help governments understand how PPPs can be a tool to deliver a certain preferred outcome. Hence, we are currently advising the government of Puerto Rico, and we have participated in numerous projects.</p><h4>What allows you to be one step ahead in the market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>GS</strong> We are focused on technology, including the way we handle and use it. As inspectors in the field, we used to require a great deal of technology, but now we rely totally on our mobile technology, such as cellular phones. We also utilize advanced software that allows us to track and maintain our projects in the most effective way. As well, we use 3D modeling for our projects, and these technologies are vital for our building and construction operations. Technologies help us to identify and address potential problems, especially those that arise across disciplines. We are also certified drone operators. </p><p><span></span><strong>HR</strong> Technology is part of our culture. We manage our projects with myriad software and technological tools that make our operations much more efficient and effective. We keep moving forward and looking for the next cutting-edge technology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved and grown its operations?</h4><p>We started in 2000, a year when economic growth was falling, by establishing our first plant in Colón. At that time, there were four concrete enterprises active in the industry. We started with a small operation in Colón. One of the big projects we were involved in was Multiplaza. Also, we were part of the Paitilla airport project. From 2003 to 2007, we saw sustained growth in the consumption of cement and concrete. Even in 2008, a fateful year for everyone, Panama continued to grow. Nowadays, we are still growing at an impressive annual rate of 5%. Our company has always been cautious, and we have the strength to endure times of adversity.</p><h4>How are you expanding within Panama?</h4><p>We have always had an interest in Colón, but started to grow toward La Chorrera and Chiriquí­, meaning that we have the advantage of numerous plants. This allows us to compete over a wider geography.</p><h4>What impact has that had on your fleet of trucks?<br></h4><p>Concrete trucks are one of the most expensive assets and one that depreciates quickly. Therefore, you need trucks as close as possible to the point of use. That is why we have plants close to potential large volume construction projects. The growth of Panama has allowed us to grow. </p><h4>Which sectors are you most active in? </h4><p>One is the Free Zone, where the number of galleys built from 2003 to 2014 was enormous. Then, given the disarray of Venezuela and problems of Colombia, the number dropped notably but should recover over time. The infrastructural investment of the past five years assures us that Panama will remain the logistical hub of the Americas. The idea is for the railroad running from Chiriquí­ to continue to Costa Rica efficiently. Because of the number of ships that pass through here, the market for Central American and Colombian products grows tremendously, as no port in Colombia or Central America can match the volume of shipping seen in Panama.</p><h4>How do you see your company in the future?</h4><p>The future of concrete is linked to confidence levels in investment. We are not selling rice, beans, or meat, but a product that lasts. The world seems to be saying, “Panama is on the right track." And while 2019 will be a challenging year, I foresee a kinder 2020 given the new administration. </p>]]></richbody0content>

In addition, we maintain permanent and harmonious relations with the different governments, since in addition to being regulators of the activity, they represent close to 50% of the annual investment in construction. Additionally, we offer an extensive program of services to our members such as training programs, technical guidance, statistical information, legal studies, economic evaluations, and free labor advice, among others. In fact, one of the most important services is the organization of two annual housing and construction fairs in support of the commercial stage of the industry.</p><h4>What is the profile of the members of CAPAC?</h4><p>Our members are classified according to the activity they develop, general contractors, project promoters, suppliers of goods and supplies, including manufacturers of the main inputs such as cement and concrete, banking entities with portfolios to finance industry activities, surety and insurance, real estate brokers and professionals linked to the sector.<br>How do you renew memberships and recruit new members?<br>In its early years CAPAC was made up of traditional contractors and a limited number of suppliers of goods and services to the industry. With the passage of time, we have tried to incorporate representatives of different activities related to construction and mainly add to the membership, young entrepreneurs with a new vision for industry, the economy, and business. </p><h4>What is the position of CAPAC regarding the increase of foreign companies in the local market?</h4><p>Panama has historically been a country of open doors and without restrictions to the participation of foreign companies in our country. However, in the last 10 years, due to the development of large construction projects in the country, the presence of foreign companies has displaced the participation of traditionally Panamanian companies in the execution of works, mainly of large public investments. CAPAC has reacted to this situation by claiming the spaces that correspond to traditional Panamanian companies, under equal conditions and without exclusive terms and specifications in the bidding documents for the contracting of public works. The correction of this distortion is one of the main requests that CAPAC has made to the new government.</p><h4>How would you describe the role that CAPAC will take on the outcome of the new elections?</h4><p>As CAPAC is a business union without political preferences, we are committed to working jointly with the elected government, and we will maintain our policy of proposing favorable actions to the industry and supporting the government of all Panamanians in everything that is beneficial to the country and our population. In conclusion, we will support the management of government as it favors the national welfare and we will be constructive critics of actions that are not in the best interests of the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most outstanding aspects of the company in operational terms?</h4><p>At the operational level, the most significant achievement during 2019 has been controlling a 40% market share and the entry of Argos, with Banistmo as our financial arm and Autostar as our vehicle supplier. This contract has been an important challenge for us. It gives the company a significant boost in the private sector. We have left a bit of our traditional logistics line since our customers, and our know-how is focused on medicines and cold, dry, frozen, and multi-temperature food products. Also, we maintain two important certifications: ISO 9001 and ISO 22000 for food safety. This has been the heart of the business during all these years. </p><h4>How do you make sure to increase the distribution productivity of your clients by 40%?</h4><p>The heart of the business is to optimize logistics, which translates into savings. We have achieved this as a model that has an intellectual property, where the most important element is the driver of our vehicles, the Microempresario, is an entrepreneur in logistics. The technology joins the equipment and our in-house dedication with an expert team, prepared with us. Our staff members deal with our in-house clients in a dedicated and personalized manner and on a full-time basis. Our Micreoempresario, on the other hand, are important because they do not work motivated by a salary, but by productivity based on their efficiency. </p><h4>Are you interested in expanding even more? </h4><p>The Dominican Republic has a significant tourism and inter-annual growth. Today, we have a strong presence in that country; we are currently the second transport company and hope to become the first in one or two more years. In fact, some are replicated clients from Panama such as Nestlé, PepsiCo, Levapan, and InBev, which has become the largest beer group on the planet. We also have Grupo Ramos, the most important supermarket chain in Dominicana. In 2019, we decided that the model could fit well in Guatemala, because its size is similar to the Dominican Republic. The mass consumption companies, our main clients, such as Nestlé, PepsiCo, and Levapan, have their regional offices in Guatemala.</p><h4>What social responsibility and business activities do you develop?</h4><p>Two years ago, we created the first transport operation degree together with Georgia Tech and the INADEH. So far, 150 graduates have the degree, and we will continue supporting this initiative because we owed it to the country. It was not possible for a logistics country not to have a degree for a transport and cargo logistics operation. Additionally, we gave the degree for microentrepreneurs, and we have a simulator for practice management. This program professionalizes cargo transport, which increases productivity and efficiency. Truckslogic was able to integrate Georgia Tech and the governmental organs. </p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>We created an application that took three years of development and a lot of investment. Its name is Smartrans, and it will operate in 2019. This platform will provide support for a real logistics solution for the markets. The platform has a technology where the customer can request a truck in real time. The application has been a great challenge in 2019, but we have already exceeded 24,000 trips, with an average rating of 4.8 out of 5. It is a high-quality application that offers high-quality service, with fair and competitive prices. 100% of the carriers accept the trips, because we have analyzed the market well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the Civil Aviation Authority for Panama?</h4><p>The Panama Canal is one of the most famous canals in the world. However, Panama has other “canals," such as the “fire canal," which refers to the telecommunications highway for the Americas. All the major fiber-optic cables that connect the continents with the world pass through Panama. In addition, the train that connects the Caribbean with the Pacific is an “earth canal." I am responsible for the “air canal," which refers to the airspace for all the aircraft that land in Panama and go on to other countries. I am also responsible for those planes that fly over our territory. The Oxford Institute indicated that 14.8% of Panama's GDP is generated through aviation, which is equivalent to USD7.3 billion. The sector generates over 200,000 direct jobs. In comparison to the rest of the region, the aviation sector in Panama has the highest relative size to GDP. Aviation comprises 2% of GDP in Colombia and 1.4% in Brazil. It is always said that one of Panama's most valuable resources is its location. </p><h4>What influence does the authority have to help more companies enter Panama?</h4><p>We are the authorizing authority for any airline carrier that arrives in Panama. We establish agreements with countries to provide air services, and Panama has an open sky policy. We are not restrictive. Recently, we signed our first agreement with an African country, Morocco. Our idea is to open an “air road" between Panama and Morocco for direct flights. Air transport companies will then request to use this road. All the companies that fly into Panama have been authorized by the authority. We recently authorized the arrival of several companies into Panama, including Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines, and Air China. These companies permit Panama to be an important point of connection. Today, from Panama one can fly to 86 different destinations in the Americas and other continents. </p><h4>How will the new terminal at Tocumen boost this sector? </h4><p>Our airspace is finite; it does not grow. Therefore, we are first redesigning the airspace to turn it into a more efficient one. Right now, we have 40 operations per hour in Tocumen, and that number will soon increase. Therefore, we need a third runaway before 2025. In addition, Terminal 2 adds nearly 20 gates; however, that might not be enough in the short run. We are starting to look at the possibility of a third terminal at Tocumen. The distances between the runways does not allow them to operate at the same time. The third runway, when constructed, not only will allow parallel arrivals but will also allow the airport to rebuild the actual runways, which are 80 and 40 years old.</p><h4>What are you doing to reduce CO2 emissions?</h4><p>We have a department dedicated to reducing CO2 emissions. Also, with the redesigning of our airspace, there will be continuous descents and continuous ascents for flights, which is the ideal scenario for CO2 reduction. In fact, we have a USD7-million bidding process ongoing to redesign our airspace. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Cemre recently delivered its 50th vessel to Havyard Group, a Norwegian shipping company. Why did Cemre begin working with northern European companies, and what future plans do you have with them?</h4><p>We started to work with Havyard in 2005 when northern European countries showed their interest in Turkey for shipbuilding. We rented a place at Istanbul Shipyard from the Ministry of Defense and started looking for clients. When we came into contact with Havyard, a Norwegian company, all the Turkish shipyards were working at full capacity. We won our initial contract with Havyard because we had capacity, but we won followup work because of our performance. Later, we continued to work with them because we provided them with high-quality ships, delivered on time due to our entire team's hard work. We have delivered Havyard 50 ships so far and are working on 10 more ships, hopefully with more to come. This partnership has a win-win model and is based on mutual trust. We think it will strengthen and grow in the future.</p><h4></h4><h4>Other than Norway, which European countries are you most interested in?</h4><p>We consider Europe as one block, so it is not wise to look at a single country from a business development standpoint. We prefer to construct project or niche ships, such as the ships we construct for the energy sector that service offshore windmills. These ships are often used by more than one country and are extremely versatile. We have constructed ships for Norway, Denmark, Iceland, United Kingdom, and France. The most popular ships of late are fishing vessels, ferries, and energy-support ships.</p><h4>Why did the company choose to focus on niche sectors of the shipbuilding industry?</h4><p>Turkey's construction of classical ships has decreased substantially because of competition from the Far East. We have focused on project ships based on our client's needs, or on a tailor-made basis. One of our goals is to construct cruise ships and to grow our presence in that area. We see great growth potential for ships that use advanced technologies, such as hybrid power. There is growing demand for hybrid and battery-powered ships because the environmental factor is gaining prominence, especially in northern European countries. Hydrogen-powered ships are also being designed and people are beginning to realize the future of autonomous ships. We have to follow the technology. We have to target the ships that involve technology and demand more engineering contribution.</p><h4>What benefits do hybrid vessels offer, and do those benefits justify the higher cost?</h4><p>We have different technologies for our hybrid solutions. The key benefits are fuel efficiency, silent working ability, and environmental impact. So far, we have built hybrid ships primarily for ferry companies. Eventually, I believe all ferries will use electrical hybrid solutions, especially in Norway. Regarding cost, hybrid technologies will become cheaper in the future. For example, the batteries were expensive last year but now their prices are dropping. With time, all of the associated costs will be more balanced. When it comes to the market for the first time, the prices are higher because of the R&amp;D costs.</p><h4>How has the Turkish Lira's depreciation impacted your input costs and export demand?</h4><p>For us, the Turkish Lira's sudden depreciation or appreciation is a disadvantage. Although we export and an increase in the value of foreign currency may seem to benefit us, it's not the case. Around 60-70% of our costs depends on foreign currency. When our suppliers accept the foreign currency exchange rate and calculates costs accordingly, pulling the prices back is extremely hard. On the contrary, stable and small increases are better for us as that helps us plan ahead.</p><h4>With Cemre's pipeline full for the next two years, what investments are you planning to expand your capacity?</h4><p>We have always invested to expand our shipyard capacity; each year we grow by 10,000sqm. We started ship construction in 2005 with a really small area and in 2007 we had our own 20,000-sqm shipyard. The first shipyard we had has grown to 70,000sqm. After expanding it yearly for a few years, we decided to to purchase a larger plot of land. At present, we have two 70,000-sqm shipyards and a 10,000-sqm piece of land; however, according to our production plans, we need more space. There are 37 other shipyards in Yalova and we plan to outsource some of our jobs to then. We want to invest more on the technology, because the ships we construct are special ships and we want to construct these ships as quickly as possible with the best technology available.</p><h4>In the future, how do you envision Cemre further diversifying its shipbuilding capabilities?</h4><p>We recently got a Facility Security Document, so we plan to work on military projects for foreign countries. Another alternative is that we want to construct small-sized passenger ships, especially because passenger ships are also sensitive to the environment and use hybrid technologies. With the advancement of technology, new routes are formed, which boosts demand for new ships.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can you tell us about the 14th edition of Maritime Week in Panama?</h4><p>I received positive feedback at the conference from more than 40 high-level exhibitors from around the world. Moreover, there was a large audience in attendance. The main topic was how technology impacts the industry, and that has been addressed in all the conferences, covering subjects like how artificial intelligence will affect the logistics space. Hence, the main goal was to learn how Latin American ports are doing integrating technology into their daily operations. Additionally, shipping companies explained the challenges they have with new fuels, and in that regard, there was a company that was speaking of the new additives they are including in new fuels. Events such as this can help companies and their employees boost their knowledge and skills and we are achieving that, based on how the event connected shipping, ports, and logistic companies. We have to ensure that these areas work together if we want to create a successful industry.</p><h4>What steps does Panama have to continue taking to turn the country into an international hub?</h4><p>We had some experts who gave a presentation about the steps that need to be taken. Panama's maritime strategy for 2040 is the roadmap to transform the country into an international hub; it is vital for all stakeholders to understand how important the maritime sector is and what it can help Panama achieve. In addition, we need to identify if we are missing opportunities in the southwest coast of the US. Nearly 40% of the ships that arrive in Houston pass through the Panama Canal, and that demonstrates the ever-growing US-Panama relationship. We have to develop a strategy to strengthen our position constantly, and in that sense an important driver to consider is the agroindustry sector. The recently announced railway project will also play an important role in strengthening infrastructure and help Panama become an international logistics hub.</p><h4>Which countries can help Panama to become an important logistic hub?</h4><p>Right now, the best offer is from China, as a host of Chinese companies are willing to invest. With the investments that we have carried out and are planning to carry out, we know where we must head. An option would be creating a logistics corridor in Colón, for example. </p><h4>What role do universities play in developing the logistics sector?</h4><p>Six years ago, I did a study for the Inter-American Development Bank, which addressed the question on how to increase the amount of young people working in Panama. Then, we realized that all the logistics sectors around the world had one problem in common— a lack of human resources. We compiled data based on the requirements, and we realized that the maritime industry was seeking technicians and professionals who could manage the logistics. There was a point when there were 30 Panamanians with master's degrees in logistics and ports administration, even though we only had six ports. At present, we urgently need technicians and graduate students in order to be able to implement all the technology. Therefore, the role of universities is important, not just to produce graduates with master's degrees and PhDs but also graduates of short-term programs that focus on technology. </p><h4>What are your expectations for these conferences in the short-run?</h4><p>We have to train more young people. An important goal would be to train more people in areas like technology. The EU, for example, recently presented an LNG program to train more people, and we will follow the same path and dedicate all our efforts in that area. On top of this, we are in talk with universities to develop partnerships and synergies between education institutions and the private sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your results compared to your expectations? </h4><p>After 22 years of service, we can confirm that we have been committed to the future of Panama in terms of maritime leadership and innovation, and we have grown thanks to a series of values and principles that constitute the basis that help us be the leaders in port development operations in the country. Our growth process has been evident in the overall results of each port. In 1994, prior to the investment of Panama Ports Company, Balboa had the capacity to handle about 44,000 TEUs. By 2007, this capacity had increased to 2.5 million. That same year, the company made an additional investment to improve the project, today considered a mega-port. We have invested over USD1.5 billion in the past 22 years of concession to equip both terminals to our customers' needs, adjusting capacity to 5 million TEUs in Balboa and 2 million in Cristobal. Such investments have been key to port growth and are necessary to meet the demands of world maritime trade. In addition, we have invested in environmentally friendly patio eRTG cranes designed according to the latest standards. These RTG “eco" cranes have significantly lower emission levels and consume up to 40% less fuel than standard machines. In addition, our reefer connections are systematized by our exclusive terminal operating system, nGen, responsible of aligning the operating and financial systems providing a first-class customer service.</p><h4>How are you maximizing the awareness of the services you provide?</h4><p>We work primarily with our customers and business partners to adapt to the constant changes and challenges that customers require from us. Our clients are reinventing and adapting to today's economy conditions and trends. This translates into added requirements that we, as service providers, must always be on top of in order to develop methods that offer profitable initiatives on how to manage, transport, and deliver cargo. We have a strong commercial network in our group covering global, regional, and local offices.</p><h4>What prospects do you see for the company in Panama in comparison to the wider region?</h4><p>Panamanian ports are strategically located at both ends of the Panama Canal and offer benefits that no other port can. However, other countries may have bigger population i.e. local consumers, which may drive greater demand for imports—resulting in an opportunity for ports in those countries to offer transshipment services. Thus, we need to work on the options that help us to be ahead of the changes and challenges that customers call for. Sitting as a gateway to one of the largest consumer markets, Panama is ideally positioned to provide logistics services to the US and other continental American markets through crossdocking, semi-manufacturing, production assembly, pick and pack, and cold storage, with—sea to air—solutions and inventory warehousing and distribution.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your current strategy to connect five continents, 26 countries, and 51 ports?</h4><p>Hutchison Ports is strategically located at key ports along the most important trade lanes in the world today. The group operates 51 ports spanning 26 countries throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, the Americas, and Australasia. We invest heavily in IT and operational efficiency, innovating in every aspect of our ports' operations. We develop and manage all aspects of port operation and trade-related logistics, sharing proven operational practices throughout our network for the good of global commerce. </p><h4>What changes have you noticed in the approach of the international business environment toward Panama?</h4><p>Panama, as a nation, needs to go beyond its port capacity and try to add more value to the supply chain. That is why the priority and attention of Panama must focus on the logistics for the future and develop a global center in logistics.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the main highlights of the company?</h4><p>Ocean Network Express (ONE) combined the best practices of three Japanese companies: Kline, MOL, and NYK. Together, they have more than 300 years of experience. They are full of capable and talented people. Our people are goal-oriented, which has been a key element of our success. In normal conditions, having three partners is not easy, but our partners have only one goal in mind: to create the best shipping company in the world. This includes the profitability as well as customer side. We want to exceed the expectations of our customers and be big enough to survive while being small enough to care. We also want our customers to have a person on the other end of the line who understands and cares about their business. </p><h4>What have been ONE's main achievements?</h4><p>Just in the Panama Canal, we have experienced substantial growth in many areas. There is a ranking system in place that identifies how important a given carrier is to the canal. This is measured by the amount of money paid in canal tolls and the number of ships that transit. A year ago, we were in 569th position. At present, we are ranked sixth. This gives a sense of how transformative the merger has been for the company. </p><h4>How has the triumvirate's global experience translated into experience, market share, and customer experience in Panama?</h4><p>Everything that we have done so far is rooted in our experience in our headquarters. Our global headquarters are in Singapore and our holding company is in Tokyo. From there, everything has fallen into place. The vision and mission of the organization were set out by the headquarters in Singapore. Each country was expected to implement this. In other words, we all knew how to operate in our specific sandboxes, but the overall strategy was consolidated and enumerated by our principals. Individuals from all three organizations are up to date with customers' needs. </p><h4>Can you tell us a bit about the social activities of the organization?</h4><p>In Panama, we know our customer base quite well. That is why we were able to create a close-knit community. The company participates in many social projects around the world. We have several CSR projects and are engaged in awareness-building efforts, such as free shipping to support the Second Harvest food program in North America every year. We are carrying clothes from Japan to victims of floods in Africa for free. We also provide containers for Olympic athletes in Japan to store their kayaks. </p><h4>What are your main goals for 2019?</h4><p>We want to further enhance focus on operational safety and minimize operational accidents both on land and at sea. The company has accomplished so much in one year, and I am sure that we will accomplish much more over the coming years. We have seen growth in Panama and around the world, which is mainly due to our talented workforce. Hard work and talent have carried us a long way. These two factors will continue to push us forward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is Panama important to your portfolio? </h4><p>Panama has seen sustained economic growth year after year, and this growth is reflected in the portfolio that Servientrega has developed. We create diversification strategies and can offer the Panamanian market more than 12 logistics products that have made our brand well known. We service 98% of the country every day with our deliveries. These are quality products that satisfy our customers. In addition, the country is relevant globally because of its strategic location and the development of the canal. Servientrega has benefited from being a bridge that connects producers in the south with consumers in the north. </p><h4>How is Servientrega taking advantage of the free trade zones in the country?</h4><p>Having access to the free zones gives us the opportunity to offer services to the vessels that arrive in the country. Many renowned global brands are located here, and they have chosen us to distribute their products throughout the country because of the logistics facilities we provide. We have developed strategies to stay at the forefront of services tailored to our consumers, including door-to-door delivery of products. </p><h4>What is the strategic importance of having 12 branches and nine processing logistic centers countrywide? </h4><p>We achieved this by creating a route architecture based on our distribution centers. These hubs are in the population centers of the country. We also benefit from the experience and professionalism of our collaborators. Our strategically designed infrastructure allows us to cover the entire value chain. That includes storage, inventory control, distribution, and door-to-door delivery. We are the logistics operator with the greatest diversity of specialized products, and this is how we add value for our customers.</p><h4>Who are your key clients in Panama?</h4><p>Our portfolio is diverse. We serve the banking sector with door-to-door delivery of credit cards, compensation checks, messaging, and document handling. Also, we serve the industrial sector with premier products, from spare parts to finished products. We also work in the securities sector with general electronics, microchips, and cellphones. Additionally, we serve insurance companies with collections of checks and discount letters, managing their customer address databases. We are also active in the pharmaceutical sector, delivering medication to hospitals, clinics, and integrated health centers. Furthermore, we serve agricultural companies. We work in coffee production, for example. Our services there include the shipment and marketing of their samples worldwide. We are strategic partners of other global delivery companies that use us to cover the domestic demand. We not only serve large companies but are also the link between smaller companies and their potential consumers. We have developed applications that bring customers to our website. </p><h4>What are your goals for 2020?</h4><p>Our objectives for end 2019 and early 2020 are all about continuing to diversify our services. We predict great opportunities in the government sector. Currently, we are experiencing a boom in companies dedicated to e-commerce, especially small companies that need to market their products quickly and cheaply. We also see a potential expansion of Panama's ports thanks to more trade with China. The domestic market will have an important place as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief overview of the main highlights over the last year?</h4><p>In 2018, CrimsonLogic continued to deepen and widen its presence in Latin America and the Caribbean, using Panama as our regional headquarters. In Panama, we expanded our customer base beyond the Customs Authority, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and Colón Free Zone to include the COTEL. We strengthened our relationship with the Colón Free Zone by securing a project to upgrade its current system and give it the latest technology to digitalize its platform and position the free zone and Panama as a major e-commerce hub for Latin America. This required developing a new e-commerce flow, and then enhancing the integration with Panama Customs System (SIGA), to ensure a faster system processing of the operations. Also, in order to support this new business model, we are implementing a new risk management module and more advanced dashboard to minimize possible trade threats and maximize business intelligence through data mining. A key aspect was to include global best standards (e.g. Global Trade Identification Number [GTIN] from GS1). In addition, we are going to implement some new and disruptive types of technology like blockchain to help maximize transparency and optimize the traceability of cargo, increasing the positive impacts on Panama's Ease of Doing Business rankings. In the Pacific Alliance (Chile, Peru, Mexico and Colombia), we also continued to build and support the interoperability platform that we built to integrate and connect their electronic single windows for trade facilitation and exchange certificates of origin and phytosanitary and customs declarations. In the Caribbean, we have further expanded our position. From Trinidad and Tobago, where we built and maintain their single electronic window for trade facilitation (TTBizLink), we moved into new markets such as the Bahamas, St. Lucia, and Suriname. In Trinidad, we deepened our position by securing a digital platform project for construction permit filing and approvals. Also, we were awarded the project to build an e-Judiciary platform for the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court based in St. Lucia.</p><h4>What challenges did the company face when expanding into Panama? </h4><p>Having our corporate headquarters in Singapore, one major challenge was adapting to the culture, language, and time zone differences between Asia and Latin America. To address these challenges, we have been working hard over the years to localize operations. We now have a substantial presence in the City of Knowledge in Panama with the full range operations, handled by local employees in management and administration, business development, project management, programming, consultancy and maintenance, and support. The second major challenge was to secure the required skill sets in this region. For this, we have worked hard to develop relationships and agreements with universities and colleges in the region to provide internships, bursaries, and work opportunities for students.</p><h4>How are you working on strengthening the importance of the products you provide in Panama and throughout the region? </h4><p>CrimsonLogic is a global company with hundreds of implementations worldwide in the space of digital government over the last 30 years. With such extensive experience, we have been able to commercialize our solutions, especially in areas such as trade facilitation, judicial management, and public services. Our approach is to have products that adopt global standards, but at the same time have the flexibility and scalability to adapt to unique customer needs in countries like Panama and the region.<br>What is your strategy for disruption, and which partners have you targeted to partner with in this area? <br>Being a leader in the digitalization of public sector services, we are not a company that aims to disrupt the status quo, but, instead, to facilitate and make public services more efficient and transparent. Hence, it is more appropriate to call our strategy one of “fostering and enabling change" in government and public services to improve the overall ease of doing business within countries. </p><h4>How have your plans to expand into Latin America progressed?</h4><p>We have done extremely well as a company in expanding our footprint in the Latin American and Caribbean regions in the last 15 years. When we initially set up in Panama in 2004, we only had one customer and one contract. Today, besides Panama we have offices and projects in Peru, Chile, Trinidad, the Bahamas, Suriname, St. Lucia, and the Pacific Alliance countries. In total, we have secured over USD120 million in contracts in this region in the last 15 years.</p><h4>What are your main targets and goals for 2019?</h4><p>We plan to continue our expansion as our position. We will be strengthening our presence in the Caribbean by also investing in Trinidad, which is also becoming an important hub for the Caribbean region. We will also continue to strengthen our presence in Panama for the Latin American region and work as partners with our customers, be they in government or the private sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights of the sector thus far?</h4><p>The maritime industry is an extremely important sector for the country. It has an impact of more than 30% on GDP. It also generates more than 289 employers, both directly and indirectly. The sector has a great impact on the country, and it is the cornerstone to develop the logistic hub of the Americas. We are currently working on promoting the sector at all levels, national and international, and being more visible to authorities related to the provision of maritime services to spread awareness of the importance of the sector for the country.</p><h4>How has the profile of membership evolved over the years?<br></h4><p>Currently, our membership is composed of shipping lines, shipping agents, container port operators, oil terminal operators, bunkering, class societies, ship chandlers, bunker barge operators, cargo surveyors, freight forwarders, ship repairs, marinas, commercial divers, and many more. All the major companies involved in the sector are in this association. As a maritime chamber, we have agreements with other international associations, and we seek to exchange knowledge between associations. Our association has evolved over time, and we seek to adapt accordingly.</p><h4>What can be done to bring more investment to Panama, and how does your Vision 2019-2020 help accomplish that?<br></h4><p>We believe that by working together, private companies and government, we can attract much more investment in Panama's maritime sector. We prepared our Maritime Vision 2019-2024, which was handed to every presidential candidate for 2019-2024 and which we hope will be embraced and implemented by the new president. This is the result of more than 20 intensive meetings with all clusters of the chamber, which resulted in five pillars to further develop our industry, amongst them the need for strong institutions to lead the development of the sector including logistics, the development of more infrastructure to strengthen the transshipment business, the modernization of the regulatory system according to market needs to expedite the transit of cargo via Panama logistic infrastructure, and the importance of human capital and education. The knowledge in the industry regarding processes needs to be brought in line with the digital revolution.</p><h4>Who are your main partners to achieve your goals?</h4><p>We represent the private sector but work along with the public sector represented by the Panama Maritime Authority. We have to continue maintaining a dialogue between the public and private sectors to positively impact the maritime sector. We also need to continue promoting activities so the chamber can increase its reach in terms of education. This is what we have called project hands-on education, where we give students the opportunity to experience what it is like working with our member companies and gain real-world experience. Additionally, we also have the Annual Maritime Conference, organized by CMP, which helps educate the general public on matters relating to the maritime sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the company become so successful in the region?</h4><p>Risk management is our priority. There are many potential opportunities, but most of them are not well defined. When an opportunity is not well defined, it can lead to unsuccessful projects. The company self-finances almost all of its projects. For now, we are only focusing on Latin America, because we believe this region has many opportunities. Countries in Latin America need world-class solutions. And we are always working to provide them. In Panama, we have a huge public transportation project. Around 300 people are working on it. SONDA provides and operates the whole financial administration of the Public Transportation System for Panama City. SONDA sells and recharges the contactless cards used for the Metrobus and Metro. In addition, we have kiosks in some places around the city, which provide customer services. </p><h4>What sectors are you targeting in Panama?</h4><p>We have identified four verticals: transportation, government, retail, and finance. We have defined focus accounts for each vertical, prepared for each an account planning strategy, and built the commercial team to find the opportunities. We offer a variety of solutions across Latin America. We have to use that experience to show our customers how we can help them. We target our customers with quality services. For example, in all the countries, we are ISO certified. We want to offer the same level of service to all our clients. We want to ensure our clients are getting everything the market has to offer.</p><h4>Would you like to reach any new market?</h4><p>At this time, we are focused on Latin America. We are working on some business opportunities in the rest of Central America and some Caribbean islands. But they are just specific regional projects. We are also working on system transportation solutions for some countries in Central America.</p><h4>What other sectors would you like to target?</h4><p>We have a digital transformation unit, which is focused on cyber security, virtualization, and big data analysis. When we talk about digital transformation, cybersecurity is one the main challenges. Most of the financial institutions are not prepared for that. Providing that service is our goal. SONDA has specialization centers in certain countries. We have specialization centers for smart cities, utilities, cybersecurity, virtualization, and transportation. </p><h4>What are your main targets and goals for 2019 and 2020?</h4><p>SONDA is a big player in the Latin American region. We want to bring all our experience to Panama, including our information technology know how. We want to offer customers a single, easy way to get the best solutions for their business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main highlights of Microsoft's Panama and Latam operations?</h4><p>2019 is Microsoft's 24th year in Panama and its commitment to the country is stronger than ever. Over the years, we have supported local entrepreneurs, developers, students, and technology companies that have become part of our ecosystem of business partners. Now, in the midst of a period where digital transformation and AI are promising to transform every sector of the economy, our mission is to work closely with different stakeholders to harness the potential on offer and create intelligent business solutions to leverage the country's development. </p><h4>How is Microsoft aligning its operations with new trends such as cybersecurity, cloud, and cyber resilience?</h4><p>Over the last decade, our operations have centered around generating growth and advancing our client's migration toward the cloud and AI, and unleashing enormous potential across all industries, like finance, manufacturing, agriculture, retail, and healthcare. This has been possible because our clients trust us; they know security is not something we take lightly. We invest over USD1 billion every year on developing cybersecurity infrastructure and have deployed a global security and cybersecurity infrastructure that analyzes over 6.5 trillion information signals daily to calculate risks and threats. Our major asset is our client's trust. Our technology, infrastructure, and services guarantee our customers and their customers the most rigorous protection, data privacy, and security, on top of total compliance with regulations on local, regional, and global levels.</p><h4>What is your strategy to keep strengthening your business portfolio in Panama?</h4><p>We are confident that our platform will continue to empower both the private and public sectors to be more efficient, productive, and able to generate opportunities that boost economic development. In addition, we are committed to continuing being the public sector's partner of choice, and we will continue to place the highest priority on investing in education; we are committed to contributing to the development of appropriate skills among students. That and teaching new skills to the workforce will be key to taking advantage of the fourth industrial revolution. The transformations we are witnessing in the workforce will be greater in the years to come. The changes in the labor market and the evolving needs of the digital-native generations that are entering the workforce call for a re-imagining of the workplace. Adapting to this transformation will be key to attracting and retaining the best talent. That is why our productivity solutions have evolved to become connected work platforms that provide constant flexibility and intelligent collaboration. We firmly believe that technology should serve the greater purpose of generating well-being, help each person and organization achieve more, leaving no one behind. Furthermore, to make sure technology drives equal opportunities to all, we have developed local programs to ensure inclusion, from promoting women in STEM careers to driving technology adoption to rural agriculture. </p><h4>What are the goals for 2019?</h4><p>Our strategy for the upcoming years is to continue reinforcing our commitment to Panama's development; foster a close relationship with our customers in alliance with our partner ecosystem; be the partner of choice in empowering every pillar of the economy to achieve more; and to strive to always promote our vision of diversity and inclusion in everything we do.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Huawei evolved in Panama so far, and what are some of the highlights of being one of the most successful smartphone brands in the world?</h4><p>Huawei was founded almost 30 years ago, and the company has been in Panama for around 10 years. In 2016, we had an important year as we launched the dual-camera P9 series. This high-tech product became quite popular in Panama. Later in 2017, we launched another phone with one of the most advanced processors in the world, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. Huawei's devices have been popular in Panama, and we are growing at a stable rate. Our success comes from the fact that we keep investing heavily in R&amp;D across hardware and software. Our goal is to provide the best technology, which is why Huawei is becoming more and more popular globally. </p><h4>How will the new store in Multiplaza Mall maximize your offerings?</h4><p>We opened this store in early 2019 and it has become increasingly popular over time; we want it to become a reference point for all other brands in the space. We have the best technology in our devices, which is why Huawei products are mostly considered computers rather than smart phones. Even more, we have strong product offerings, including fitness watches and other accessories. </p><h4>How would you characterize Huawei's B2B activity in Panama?</h4><p>In Panama, there is a diverse set of corporate entities that represent numerous industries. It is an open country with a great deal of passion. Furthermore, we have a lot of corporate clients and a large number of partners to whom we offer complete solutions. Huawei is known for smart devices, but the company also offers strong ICT solutions. We provide these solutions to a wide variety of areas in Panama, and this is one of the reasons why this the country is so important for us.<br>What new products are you set to launch in Panama?<br>We recently launched the new P30 phone series. This offers some unique features, chief among them is the camera, which is by far the best among its competitors. The new series is our key in this market, and it has been performing exceptionally. In particular, clients are excited about the zoom function of the P30 Pro camera, which can offer up to 50x digital zoom. The main camera is 40 megapixels and it has numerous stabilization improvements. Such is the picture quality of the P30 Pro that the camera can even be used to take pictures of the moon. The product's battery performance is also quite good, and our wireless charging technology has also improved greatly. We are also setting new standards in the area of safety through enhanced fingerprint security. </p><h4>What are your main CSR activities in Panama?</h4><p>CSR is important to us. At Huawei, we are focused on working toward the improvement of the communities in which we operate. Treating people well is a primary concern for us. One of the main issues we focus on is improving education. We believe that this is one of the most important areas we can work on. We have supported numerous online facilities for education, including assisting schools that have difficulty accessing resources due to their distance from the cities. Also, we have donated equipment that allows children to take online English classes. Our biggest contribution to Panama has been the Seeds for the Future program. We started this in 2015, and through this program we take the top performers and best students from every engineering program related to our industries in public universities. These students are given the opportunity to visit China. They learn about culture and receive Chinese language lessons. They are also provided with professional internship experience, which is guided by some of our best professionals. We are passionate about such education-based programs and will further increase our efforts in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With a strong presence in the market since 2001, what have been Digicel's achievements?</h4><p>We have a strong presence in the Caribbean. We originally launched in 2001 and were in a roll-out mode for 10-12 years, launching in 31 markets. The telecoms industry today is in a phase of transformation and reinvention. We continue to perform well in the Caribbean, although telecoms companies around the rest of the world are losing 3-6% of their revenue. What is interesting is that business solutions have been our main area of growth over the past two years. Everything related to the IoT, business solutions, and ICT solutions is growing by double-digits in the Caribbean. Mobile revenues are flat, or growing moderately, but we are compensating for this with growth in the ICT sector. </p><h4>How does Panama fit into the company's operations?</h4><p>We have been operating in Panama for the past 10 years, but we did a relaunch in 2018 and transformed the business nearly into a greenfield operation in Panama. It took us one year to do the whole relaunch because we looked at every single business area and element. It always starts with technology and the network. In order to be the market leader, we have to become the operator of the future, staying three or four steps ahead of our competitors. To date, we are the only provider that offers LTE Pro (4.5G) in Panama. We are able to deliver higher speeds and optimize our spectrum so that customers can have a better experience. </p><h4>How would you describe the milestones behind winning the Speed Test Award 2018?</h4><p>It was exciting because it was the first time the award was given in Panama. We knew because of the way we built the network and its spectrum that we had a considerable advantage over our competitors. Ultimately, we were three to four times faster than the competition.</p><h4>How has Digicel worked to improve national coverage and penetration in the country?</h4><p>When we launched in 2018, we did so with 30% more LTE penetration than anyone else in the market. We had to choose between starting with LTE only in main cities, a traditional approach, and then growing it progressively, or going all in. Our approach made LTE available to people who had never had access to it before.</p><h4>What main goals would you like to achieve?</h4><p>We are focused 100% on LTE and only sell LTE handsets. The fiber-optics network capacity we have built is ready for 5G and other ICT and business solutions. While we were focused on consumers, we were building our capabilities in terms of ICT and business solutions in parallel. In the innovation labs, we are setting up products specific for Panama. The government aims at wholesale digitalization, and the market is ready for it because LTE penetration is there, though the tools are still lacking for full conversion. Thus, we have invested heavily in products designed to automate processes for the government; we also build data centers for the banking system.</p><h4>How can Digicel promote social benefit while generating economic growth?</h4><p>It all comes back to the roots of Digicel. Denis O'Brien, our chairman, obtained a license for a telecom operator in Ireland, but instead of that, he decided that Europe was already too complicated and that there were other underserved areas in the world with low penetration. He saw the opportunity of meeting the needs of emerging markets. Transportation and logistics in the Caribbean are challenged by the sheer range of islands and extreme weather conditions. Yet, such conditions also offer opportunities to serve an underserved market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important are the operations of Millicom internationally, now that it has acquired Cable Onda?</h4><p>Millicom is a telecommunications company that operates in Africa and Latin America, but the vast majority, over 90%, of its business is in Latin America. Latin America is a strategic priority for us. We operate in nine countries in Latin America: Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Paraguay, and Bolivia. With our recent acquisition of Movistar's operations in Costa Rica, Panama, and Nicaragua, we are now a fully convergent operator for fixed, mobile, and business communications. In all those markets, we typically hold a strong leadership position where we are either number one or number two in the market. We believe that through our work and efforts we are making a difference in the region, as we build digital highways that connect citizens, communities, cities, and the countries themselves with the rest of the world. We are proud that this year Cable Onda was recognized as the fastest Internet provider in Panama by Ookla. Our commitment is to have the best digital highway and provide the best service for our consumers.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the operations of Cable Onda in Panama?</h4><p>Panama fits quite nicely into our operations across Central America. We also have operations in Colombia, so there was this gap between Central America and South America that we now closed with the acquisition of Cable Onda. Panama helps us continue diversifying our portfolio. Panama is a dollarized economy and it is a country that has great macroeconomic indicators and a long history of democracy, political stability, and respect for institutions. These are all factors that are important for investors like us who have a long-term view.</p><h4>Would you say this headquarters will become the main hub for Millicom?</h4><p>Our Millicom office is based in Miami, where our executive team sits and where all global strategic decisions are made. Given the geographical position of Panama, Cable Onda's strong presence, its solid team, and its operations in other Latam markets, we could eventually benefit from conducting centralized back office functions from here. So, this is something we are looking into, and we just created an SEM for that purpose.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2019 and the next year?</h4><p>In 2019, our main goal is to complete the integration of Cable Onda and Telefonica into the Millicom family. Successfully completing the integrations of Cable Onda and Movistar into Millicom will improve the experience for our customers. </p><h4>What are your CSR initiatives?</h4><p>There are a lot of initiatives we undertake in terms of social responsibility. All employees of Cable Onda, including myself, spend two days per year doing social work. We go to schools and villages and to whoever can benefit from our support. In total, this translates into 30,000 hours per year. This makes a difference in our communities and we do it with tremendous passion.</p><h4>What are your most important priorities for the future?</h4><p>Cable Onda has a fantastic team with an amazing track record of success. Probably the most important element of Cable Onda is its team. It is a top priority to protect that and invest further in developing our people. In addition, we are working hard and investing a lot of resources into upgrading the digital services we offer. With the acquisition of Telefonica in Panama, we are now waiting for regulatory approval. The enterprise value of the Cable Onda acquisition was USD1.46 billion. The acquisition of Movistar cost USD650 million. Put together, we have made investments of around USD2 billion in Panama. This shows that we are here for the long run. We want to be the key actor in bringing the Fourth Industrial Revolution to Panama. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>City of Knowledge has taken a number of important initiatives. What are the most noteworthy?</h4><p>We are proud that the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Panama began at the City of Knowledge, as it created Panama's first business incubator, which later evolved into a business accelerator and eventually into an innovation center. Along that path, we accompanied the launch of private funds as well as dedicated funds to support start-ups. Thereafter SENACYT and the Chamber of Commerce joined us, as did some universities and banks, while the government created the Autoridad de la Micro, Pequeña y Mediana Empresa (AMPYME) to support the entire ecosystem. In January 2019, we inaugurated a new co-working space that is already mostly occupied by start-ups. The fact that we have been able to attract universities from the US, Europe, and Latin America is another source of pride. We have opened windows of opportunities for our universities and business communities to work with both a Latin American and global vision. After years of working here we have grown to become a community of over 11,000 people featuring researchers, students, teachers, entrepeneurs, and businesspeople. </p><h4>You are hosting the Cybertech conference again in 2019. Aside from the event, what does City of Knowledge do to maximize awareness of its services?</h4><p>This is the third year in a row where Cybertech Latin America has taken place at the City of Knowledge. It was the initiative of the former Israeli ambassador, and the current ambassador has supported this important technology gathering. There is no better place since we have people from all over the world, including North America, Latin America, and the Caribbean, working for start-ups and innovative companies. Events such as Cybertech help us reach out to local and global communities.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019, bearing in mind your long-term targets?</h4><p>We are constantly reviewing our regional vision and have advanced sufficiently to redefine our mission and identify ourselves as an innovation community that fosters social change from humanistic, scientific, and business perspectives. Now, during strategic planning, we are introducing new factors to revise our vision. We have invited not only our tenants, such as universities, high-tech companies, start-ups, international institutions, and NGOs, but also the surrounding community. In due time we will work alongside the new authorities, since some of them may not be sufficiently familiar with what we do, and we will reassure them we can always provide a space where people can openly discuss and confront different views.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main objectives for the IPO in 2018, and how would you evaluate the company's journey and the current positioning in the market?</h4><p>Over the past 12 years, our company has evolved from Leejam 1.0 and Leejam 2.0 to Leejam 3.0. Back in 2006, when the company was formed, the owners began with opening fitness centers. This caught on rapidly, and Saudis began to include fitness as part of their lifestyle, bringing excellent returns for the company. That was Leejam 1.0. However, as the business grew, the founders decided to take the company public. In 2013, they were advised to have a private equity partner on board to lead the company through its next phase of growth - Leejam 2.0. At that time, we had three missions: corporate transformation, investment in senior management for business continuity, and a successful IPO. Around 75%+ of the current management was hired during this phase. Leejam went through its IPO in September 2018. It was in fact the most successful IPO in the GCC in the past couple of years, with a stock price that has increased 78% since IPO. Today, Leejam is worth well over USD1 billion and has around 4,000 employees.</p><h4>What are some of the trends in the market following the increased attention for sports under Vision 2030's Quality of Life program?</h4><p>Two things happened in Saudi Arabia, and we could not have been in a better place at a better time for our fitness business. The first major development was more opportunities for women. With that, the market grew overnight by 50% in 2017. Since then, we have opened 29 female fitness centers in Saudi Arabia. By the end of 2019, we will have 40 female centers, making us the largest player in this category today. Also, in 2018, we took over the Princess Noura University Fitness Center, the largest female fitness center in the world. The second major development was the Quality of Life program under Vision 2030, with great attention paid to encouraging healthy lifestyles. We work in close coordination with the government on how gyms should be designed, with male and female sections.</p><h4>What is your vision for creating meaningful jobs for Saudis?</h4><p>At the moment, most of our staff in our fitness centers are Saudis, though our trainers are mainly non Saudis. Right now, Saudi-born fitness trainers as a concept, especially in the male category, almost do not exist; however, we are working with Quality of Life and the MISK Foundation to create programs within universities and other diploma certificates that will allow Saudis to become fitness trainers.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on future expansion, both within the Kingdom and in the GCC region?</h4><p>We already have a presence in the UAE with locations in four of the Emirates. There is also strong interest from Kuwait and Oman. However, when the female opportunity in the Kingdom opened up, we did not want to miss it. We have not opened up other locations in the GCC yet. In the next four to five years, we will continue to add 15 or more centers each year across all categories, focusing on our existing geographic footprint, which is Saudi Arabia and UAE, as well as expanding in the GCC.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In July 2019, new President Laurentino Cortizo took office vowing to re-energize the economy, curb corruption, and reduce poverty in a nation that has witnessed some of the highest development rates and unequal income distribution in Central America.</p><p>Leading the Democratic Revolution Party, Cortizo said he would focus his five-year term on balancing foreign relations with both China and the US. The two nations are the largest users of the Panama Canal, a vital revenue source for the nation since it claimed full sovereignty over the pan-oceanic transit hub in 1999.</p><p>Spearheading economic reforms is Finance Minister Héctor Alexander, a former student of Nobel Laureate economist Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago. Alexander has long held bearish views of Panama's markets, projecting the economy will grow slightly less than 4% in 2019, below International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates. </p><p>In assuming his new role, Alexander said he would implement a slew of new measures to improve the economic forecast for one of the region's fastest-growing nations. “We are falling short of where we could be in growth and development, and this is our big challenge," he told Bloomberg News. “We think we can turn it around."</p><p>Panama's growth has long been lauded for China-like growth rates that have given rise to countless new skyscrapers in the capital city over the last decade. While Alexander believes the nation could be more prosperous, many analysts have pointed to healthy growth in the nation's industrial sector, as well as sustained development of small to medium business enterprises as signs the stubborn unemployment rate will shrink in the foreseeable future.</p><p>Apart from a booming finance sector, which is expected to grow 10% in 2019, Panama maintains one of the highest levels of FDI in the world. Such figures have led the IMF to project the economy will reach a growth rate of 6.3% in 2019, well above its 4.6% rate in 2018.</p><p>The Centre for Economics and Business Research of the United Kingdom projects even higher growth rates, estimating 6.8% for the year, citing strong construction activity stemming from large infrastructure projects, including a fourth Panama Canal bridge, extensions of the Panama City metro line, and upgrades to metropolitan sewage and transportation systems.<br>“We are going to be better off with Cortizo," Ana Lorena Carrizo, a risk analyst at ratings firm Equilibrium, said. “He has a plan to boost the agricultural, healthcare, and tourism industries, as well as exports."</p><p>One of the main drivers for Panama's industrial revival will come from its first copper mine, which opened in spring of 2019. Operated by First Quantum, a Canadian mining company, the mine is expected to generate USD2 billion per year in export revenue once it is fully operational in 2021. Known as the Cobre Panama mine, it is the largest copper mine coming online in the next few years and represents the single-biggest private sector investment in Panama's history. The USD6.4-billion operation produced its first copper at the end of March 2019 and is expected to produce between 140,000 and 175,000 tons of copper by December. By 2020, production is projected to rise to 270,000-300,000 tons. </p><p>First Quantum invested USD1.83 billion in the last two years to bring the mine to market, and developments are ongoing as transportation and industrial facilities are expanded to support the project. Such large-scale projects, along with the transparent, pro-business policies set forth by the new administration, are likely to spark new energy in the Panamanian economy that might just surprise its own finance minister.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights for the company in Panama?</h4><p>PowerGen began operations around 1999, selling generators in a small office in downtown Panama. We have been in the market for almost 20 years and have developed into one of the biggest rental houses in Central America. At present, we have over 1,800 units in the rental fleet with an original investment in excess of USD50 million. Also, we cover most of the different aspects of the construction industry, including aerial equipment, construction earthmoving equipment, compressors, generators, material handlers, and so forth. Additionally, we employ close to 180 collaborators and have six branches; the main office is in Panama City, and we have secondary offices in Colón, Chame, David, Chiriquí­, Santiago de Veraguas, and Costa Rica. Some of our customers in the logistics end of the business are Agencias Feduro, Productos Alimenticios Pascual, Empresa Panameña de Alimentos (EPA), Nestlé, and Farmacias Arrocha. In addition, we serve clients like Panama Canal and First Quantum Minerals. We have actively participated in a variety of construction projects like the metro, Panama Canal expansion, airports, Pier 16 Colón, the cruise terminal, and more.</p><h4>Is the growth of the company related to the fact you had some bonds operated by one of your partners?</h4><p>The bonds in reality are purchased by several financial institutions. The fact that we have been able to issue bonds creates special regulations in the business. This business has to operate and is regulated by the stock market. Thus, we have to follow the same standards as a public company. We have to submit the results of the business every three months to the stock market, which then regulates it. There are certain parameters we have to meet, and this makes us different from the majority of other similar companies in Panama. </p><h4>Would you like to target a specific sector in the medium and short terms?</h4><p>That depends largely on the kind of projects breaking ground. For example, there are talks about building a bridge over the canal, and that project will require equipment like the ones we have. Other similar projects include the third line of the metro and the expansion of the canal. We follow the projects closely, so when a project is assigned to certain contractors, we contact them and offer our services. </p><h4>How have you managed to be competitive with your current business model?</h4><p>In the construction side of our rental business the important factor is utilization, in particular every machine's percentage of utilization. A utilization rate of close to 70% or above is good for both us and the contractor. The market we operate in is unique. A well-managed contractor will maintain a 70% utilization rate of his own equipment and satisfy his peaks with rented equipment. However, the rented equipment must be as effective in order to maintain the project schedule. We supply equipment in good condition and tailored to the contractor's needs. Renting equipment is the most economical way of operating a business. This allows an investor to keep investment at 90% or 100% utilization. If a contractor owns all the equipment, the utilization rate goes below 70% or 60%. That will mean the business model is not economical. This is where we come in. That is how we serve the market. The contractor needs a company with good rental equipment.</p><h4>What are your targets and goals for 2019?</h4><p>Our goal is to maintain our clients and operations and post a growth rate between 10% and 15%, which is a conservative growth rate in our sector. Even though we have been established for many years, the type of rental business we are in is a relatively new business in Panama. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Bosch's presence in the region?</h4><p>Establishing operations in strong locations is an important part of Bosch's global strategy. In 2011, Bosch opened its regional office in Panama to enhance business opportunities in Central America and the Caribbean. Since then, Bosch has been growing steadily in the region; we are in almost 14 countries and have consistently registered double-digit growth. Our growth comes mainly from three business sectors: automotive, where we are consolidating our distribution; power tools, where we have also increased our presence through traditional and home center distribution; and building technologies, which offers camera surveillance and audio solutions and where the growth has been exponential due to our participation in an increasing number of significant projects across the region, such as Line 2 of the Metro Panama, Amador Convention Center, Centro Cí­vico in Tegucigalpa, and APM terminal in Moí­n, Costa Rica. </p><h4>What are the company's carbon neutral and mobility solutions aspirations?</h4><p>As a German industrial company, we are conscious of our carbon footprint and we believe that acting now to compensate for it can play a significant role in achieving and promoting global climate neutrality. For this reason, Bosch aims to be fully climate neutral as early as next year. Regarding mobility, Bosch provides B2B solutions with the user in mind. Our products are meant to be “Invented for Life." As we have been more conscious of the user experience, we are transforming the way we do business. We started thinking about not just products, but also about our 3S strategy: sensors, software, and services. A product with an embedded sensor becomes interconnected. Adding software, we can enhance the IoT. We invested heavily in an IoT suite and recently launched our own Bosch cloud, which allows us to upload and download information from our connected products. All this encourages our developments in three areas of mobility: connected mobility, automated mobility, and power train systems and electrified mobility. </p><h4>Where would you like to strengthen your market position?</h4><p>The first is automated mobility and autonomous driving in particular. We are also working on electrified power train systems and IoT-based solutions for connected mobility. Together with Daimler, we launched a pilot robotaxi program in San Jose, California, becoming the only Tier-1 automotive supplier to enter the driverless ridesharing market. In electrification, we expect sales in electric powertrain solutions to increase dramatically. All automakers are working on this. Bosch implements technology across the board, from bicycles to trucks. Regarding the IoT field, demand for connected products is also growing. This market will be worth around USD250 billion in the upcoming years and, in order to grab a significant piece of that, Bosch is developing connected solutions in fields such as smart cities, Industry 4.0, mobility, and agriculture.</p><h4>Which IoT technologies can best be implemented in Panama?</h4><p>I would say that Panama has great potential in the field of Logistics 4.0. We are working with drivers to understand the real needs in Central America and the Caribbean so that we can shape our solutions accordingly. This is a change from the past, when we would just bring a product developed for the German market and almost impose it on other markets without taking into consideration relevant information of the user experience. One good example comes from Industry 4.0, where we promote retrofit solutions instead of brand-new machinery with full connection ability. We aim to make old machinery connectable by retrofitting them with sensors. The result is a significant reduction in investment and still a considerable improvement in the production process.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2019?</h4><p>First of all, we are working on implementing our #LikeABosch lifestyle. We want to be recognized as an innovation driver that supports new initiatives related to disruptive fields. Hence, we still see many opportunities in our traditional business lines such as auto parts, power tools, and thermotechnology. Our target is to consolidate our presence in these markets, and our ambition is to consistently achieve double-digit growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ENSA has been in the market for 20 years; what are some of its recent achievements? </h4><p>The past two decades presented numerous challenges, but the company came out on top and grew stronger. First, we had to stabilize and modernize the company because it originated in the public sector. We have made an investment of around USD350 million in infrastructure over the past four years and modernized the distribution grid considerably with new and expanded substations. We are continuing our commitment to working with and for the people, both at work and in the wider community. </p><h4>What is the importance of receiving a BBB investment grade certification from Fitch?</h4><p>We have grown significantly over the past three years, which confirms our dedication to effective management. The utilities have also been growing, and the company has been posting good results. Due to the overall national rating we did not receive a higher rating, which we merited. Nonetheless, the rating identifies ENSA as a long-term proposition; this qualification helps us considerably in terms of future investments. In fact, we have maintained this qualification for 12 years in a row. </p><h4>How does this growth translate into investments and national coverage?</h4><p>The world is changing for energy distribution companies and the sector in general. Our company requires rapid modernization, which we are currently working on. We have been making vital investments in IT to have the tools for a much more automated operation. Additionally, we are in the process of changing our entire operations center and are adapting software accordingly to enhance nationwide service. </p><h4>What is the significance of the recent opening of substations in Colón? </h4><p>Colón represents a primary market for us, as we have always believed in its future as an epicenter in the Americas. In the first place, it has beaches, ports, and a logistic heritage. Meanwhile, another beautiful region, San Blas, lies within our concession area, and also has the opportunity to provide electricity to the ports. The project has already begun, and we are building a 140-km distribution grid at a cost of USD5.6 million. We continue to bring quality of life to people, and expect these ports to better receive tourists in what is a vital economic sector.</p><h4>ENSA recently signed an agreement to implement alternative energies in Panama's public transport system. What are your objectives regarding this project?</h4><p>We are the leaders in the country in terms of electric mobility, having just signed an agreement with Traservi, the nation's largest transportation corporation. This has led to the launch of seven electric taxis in Colón. As a matter of fact, we have already assembled the service station, and hope to reach 30 facilities by August. This would amount to the largest fleet of taxis and electric public service provision in Central America. Recently, we signed an MoU with MiBus, the main local transportation company in the city, and are working with them to pilot a real-life route for regular passengers. MiBus has 1,400 buses in its fleet, and we hope in the medium term to replace them with electric vehicles.</p><h4>Do you aspire to enter other markets?</h4><p>A year ago, we set up a company called ENSA Servicios for the development of electric mobility, solar panels, energy efficiency, technological platforms, and other services. In that context, we serve El Salvador, Mexico, Panama, and Colombia, among others.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>We are in an important process of transformation. Thus, we have an important commitment to national regulation in delivering the service our people deserve. Wise allocation of resources fosters wealth generation and social development. For this reason, as a leading company our responsibility and contribution are even more <br>important. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about the performance of your power generation plants in Panama?</h4><p>We have seven power plants in Panama. In 2018, we had 777MW installed in Panama, with 705MW based on hydroelectricity. Five of the hydro plants are in Bayano, La Estrella, Los Valles, Esti, and Changuinola; we also have a bunker-based barge. In 2015, we won a tender to deliver, starting in September 2018, the first natural gas-based power plant in Panama and Central America. At that time, we had recently completed a 381-MW plant, which has gone on to generate maximum power over the summer. This is great because hydroelectric plants do not produce much energy in the summer. This plant allowed Panama to fill the capacity gaps in the national grid. With more diverse energy sources, it is possible to have a more flexible energy market for Panamanians.</p><h4>What role can LNG play in Panama? </h4><p>The plant we made generates 381MW, and this is in turn treated in our LNG-based plant. It is located in a terminal that has the capacity to receive up to 160,000-cbm large ships and a 180,000-cmb storage tank. The plant uses only 25% of the storage tank; the rest is used for other important purposes. Moving forward, LNG can play a vital role in solving Panama's problems. Industries that depend on boilers and diesel fuels can all be switched to natural gas to make the industry more efficient.</p><h4>How are you planning to achieve your medium- and long-term vision?</h4><p>We are developing an LNG project with Bahia Investment Group. For this project, we put around 37% equity of both companies. The goal is to have the financial muscle for the other 67%. To do this, we have different multilaterals such as the IFC and the BCIE as well as local banks such as Bancolombia and Banco General. All the various state institutions must also be aligned so that the project is finished on time. The main stakeholders of this project are the banks, the partners, the state, and the surrounding communities. The community is an important factor for us, which is why we started about 10 different social projects. Our goal is to help the community grow on the back of education and training; we also provide funds to help micro enterprises work and grow.</p><h4>Could you talk about the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 2030? </h4><p>By 2030, there is a clear goal of reducing carbon emissions by up to 70%. That is not easy, especially when you have a company like AES that has been operating coal plants in other countries. Nonetheless, the decision to replace coal with renewables was made, and we chose gas because that is how we can create a more mature energy matrix. However, that does not mean we will not work with other renewable energies. We have several projects for 2019 and 2020, including 50-MW and 70-MW solar plants.</p><h4>What are the latest initiatives affecting the social development of the country?</h4><p>We have several CSR programs for the communities that surround our projects. For example, over 12 years in Changuinola, we have spent more than USD89 million on our social activities in the form of aqueducts, schools, medical dispensaries, and training. We also have a hydro-biological center where we reproduce fish that can be placed in the reservoirs behind dams. We are always aware of the communities in which we operate. </p><h4>What are the latest initiatives that are affecting the social development of the country?</h4><p>We have several CSR programs for the communities that surround our projects.

Also, we have a hydro-biological center where we reproduce fish that can be placed in the reservoirs behind dams. We are always aware of the communities we operate in.</p><h4>AES surpassed its 200th shipment at the AES Andrés LNG terminal in Dominican Republic in 2019. What is the company's long-term strategy regarding LNG and its goals in Panama and the region?</h4><p>AES is the main power generating company in Panama and the largest investor in the energy sector. The new natural gas-fired power plant meets strict social and environmental standards. It is a great step for Panama to become an energy and distribution hub for LNG. Additionally, AES Colón will be able to offer competitive prices by taking advantage of the existing logistic facilities offered by the country due to its strategic geographical position. According to an IDB study about Central America demand projection, 48% demand might be covered with LNG through AES Colón, positioning Panama as a benchmark in the local and regional markets. </p><h4>How is AES Panama developing its non-conventional renewable energy portfolio?</h4><p>As a leading sustainable energy company, our diverse combination of generation sources provides us with the strength and flexibility to adapt to local and regional market needs, maximize plant efficiency, and provide reliable and affordable electricity. Furthermore, we believe that our businesses do much more than just provide energy. Improving lives and making a lasting difference in the communities in which our businesses operate has always been part of our values and mission. We believe that it is our responsibility to provide infrastructure solutions that support a sustainable social, economic, and environmental future.</p><h4>How will ETESA's bid for the electric line from Colón to Panama impact the operations of AES Colón? What's your perspective on the entry of the new Shanghai Gorgeous and NG Power plants?</h4><p>AES Colón is an actor whose success is due to AES' competitiveness, complemented by the strengthening of the company's investments in Panama, which add up to USD2.6 billion in total. We have invested heavily in Panama because the country offers a level playing field and legal security. We are the main private investor in Panama's energy sector. AES Panama promotes free competition; we have participated in bidding processes which we have won and lost. Our competitiveness in the market is clear, and it is precisely due to the efficiency that AES has demonstrated over the years through the development of various projects in the country. AES' standing in the market will further strengthen with the start-up of the USD1.15-billion AES Colón Project. Equally significant, we are one of the main contributors to the National Treasury, having paid with more than USD700 million in taxes and royalties over our 20 years of presence in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you decide to come to Panama?</h4><p>Grupo Humano is the leader and largest insurance company in the Dominican Republic market.  It started operations back in 2001, providing exclusive health and life insurance coverage. In 2018, general risk insurance was included in the portfolio. In order to diversify its operations, in 2011 the group decided to expand into Central America, starting with El Salvador under the brand Aseguradora Vivir. Two years later, the group established its insurance and reinsurance operations in Panama, the country base for Vivir. Making Panama our headquarters was a strategic decision, considering market attractiveness, and growth and stability of the country.  Furthermore, Panama shares a number of similarities with the Dominican Republic, allowing us to benefit from our primary experience and knowledge. Panama's economic growth and the nature of its open market make it an extremely important and lucrative market. Panama checked all our requirements, providing us a potential opportunity to develop our business model and offer our variety of insurance plans. </p><h4>What is the relation between your international expansion project and Panama?</h4><p>For us and in general, Panama is a highly important market given the sort of economic growth it has been experiencing. We entered Panama because we saw a potential opportunity to develop our business model and offer our variety of insurance plans. Additionally, we also see Panama as a global commercial and financial center located only a couple of hours away from the Dominican Republic and other countries in the region like El Salvador, where we started our expansion project. </p><h4>What steps are you taking to differentiate your products from those in the market? </h4><p>Since the beginning, we focused our value proposition on providing quality service as well as offering a complete health and life portfolio for businesses and individuals. Panama is a competitive market, with 23 insurance companies offering all kinds of plans, and these keep us more committed to evolve and achieve our goals. We believe that the key factors to success are customer service and our relationship with the insurance brokers and innovation. </p><h4>What premium products do you offer to broaden your client portfolio?</h4><p>We have a portfolio of products focused on different segments: a specific mix has been designed to cater both high-income and low-income individuals and business. We have premium packages for managers and executives that cover all services across the world, without the need for reimbursement. Notably, we recently launched our mobile application to offer a better and agile service to our customers.</p><h4>What is the company's long-term outlook?</h4><p>We are focused on the corporate segment because we have experienced good growth in that segment over the last few years. Moving forward, we want to grow in life and corporate segments and seek other opportunities to assure future growth.</p><h4>What are your main targets in Panama?</h4><p>We are working to improve our service platform, upgrading our portfolio with new benefits and coverage, strengthening our commercial structure, and focusing on corporate accounts.</p><h4>With an annual turnover of more than USD8.4 million, Seguros Vivir Panama closed 2018 as the 11th ranked insurance company out of the 23 insurance companies operating in Panama. What are your expectations for 2020?</h4><p>In 2019, we are projecting a 20% growth to register a turnover of about USD10 million, and we hope to continue achieving higher growth in 2020. We are expecting to close 2020 with at least 13 million direct subscribed premiums.</p><h4>What priorities and initiatives would you like to see from the new government regarding the insurance sector in Panama? </h4><p>Panama is an extraordinary country and we have always bet on its continuous development. We are expecting positive steps from the new government and we are confident that it will be a good period for Panama. The key factors for the development of the industry are strong institutions, modernization, and support for the sector.</p><h4>Lately, Seguros Vivir has been strengthening its social media game. How has social media impacted insurance penetration in Panama, and what are your strategies in this area going forward? </h4><p>Panama is one of the countries with the highest internet penetration rate; it also leads the smartphones usage ranking in the region. We believe that social networks such as Facebook and Instagram are already an important channel of communication with our customers and we are sure that they will have a greater relevance over time, so we will definitely continue to grow through them, sharing information about our company, products, tips for a healthy life, and our added values. In line with this, we are planning to increase the promotion of our product. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the operation progressed over the company's 25 years of history? </h4><p>Seguros FEDPA is a 100% Panamanian company, and it is cooperatively owned. This is something that distinguishes us from other companies in the market. We have our origin in the cooperative movement, and 100% of our shareholders are Panamanian cooperatives, which is a unique feat in Panama. </p><h4>Why is the cooperative movement important? </h4><p>We have produced great results for the last 15 years. At present, we are ranked among the top insurance companies; we have a 2.5% market share. We have a leadership position together with the five-largest companies that sell car insurance in Panama. In addition, we have managed to develop collective life insurance, accident insurance, and automobile insurance. </p><h4>How is your expansion model impacting your operations?</h4><p>Our expansion model is one of our most important achievements. Undoubtedly, we have a strong nationwide presence. Seguros FEDPA either has a direct presence through branches or an indirect presence through agencies. As a matter of fact, we do not only focus on population centers. This allows us to reach many people who previously did not have access to insurance. At present, thanks to our management, we can sell insurance to the most remote places in the country. In terms of the number of insured people and the number of insured risks, we are one of the leading companies. </p><h4>How does Seguros FEDPA innovate and strengthen its strategies to attract more clients?</h4><p>Service matters a lot, since our product is intangible. In this sense, service quality has to spearhead the entire industry, and at Seguros FEDPA, we provide the best service. We sell a promise and we deliver accordingly.</p><h4>What kind of international affiliations do you have?</h4><p>As a company in the cooperative sector, we are affiliated with the International Federation of Cooperatives and Mutual Insurance Companies (ICMIF), which brings together the main insurance companies in the global cooperative sector. Furthermore, we have a wonderful relationship with other insurance companies in the American and European cooperative sectors. Our industry seeks to train people to achieve greater development in every country. We have a high level of cooperation with all the sister companies in Central America, the Caribbean, and South America.</p><h4>How is FEDPA contributing through corporate social responsibility activities?</h4><p>The cooperative movement is a socially responsible movement. One of the differences between cooperatives and the free market is that the cooperative movement has a social purpose. We focus on having a positive impact on Panama's provinces, societies, and communities by participating in all kinds of activities. We participate in charitable and cultural activities. In the last few years, we have focused on doing work that will leave a mark on the community and, moving forward, we will focus more on that.</p><h4>What are the goals and ambitions of Seguros FEDPA for 2019 and 2020?</h4><p>If we consider the developments that have taken place in 2019, such as the election, 2019 has been a bit tight compared to what we expected. However, we are still optimistic about the rest of the year. We feel that the economy will bounce back. By the end of the year the company's growth rate will be similar to 2018, which was close to 10%. Also, we expect growth will take off in 2020. Nonetheless, we hope to participate in the growth of the insurance sector, and we remain focused on our target markets in the middle and lower classes. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe 2019?</h4><p>Historically, the economy is slow during electoral years and in line with that, Panama's growth rate in 1Q2019 was 3.1%, lower compared to the same period of last year, mostly due to the construction and services sectors. The construction sector's performance dipped in 2018 because of strikes. Nevertheless, it is projected that the mining sector will help offset this slowdown with the start of copper production. The situation has been the opposite for the local capital market; 1Q2019 closed with USD4.3 billion, a 50% increase YoY. Despite 2019 being an election year, we posted an increase in trading volume as a result of the strategic initiatives we have been working on for the past few years.</p><h4>What does it mean to become the first exchange in Latin America to be a part of the Climate Bonds Partners program?</h4><p>We are working on different initiatives to become the hub for the regional capital market and follow high international standards; this partnership is indeed a step toward achieving this goal. It is our commitment to develop a local capital market under the best environmental, social, and governance principles to offer investors responsible investments, based on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. This partnership will contribute to the development of initiatives that will allow us to achieve our objectives, contribute to our society, and educate and promote these principles to all stakeholders. We are working with the CBI on a guide for green, social, and sustainable bonds and plan to launch it by 3Q2019.  </p><h4>What opportunities does high liquidity of the USD bring to the business environment?</h4><p>Since Panama has a USD-based economy, high liquidity of the USD presents important business opportunities. However, we need to cautiously follow the US-China trade war and other commercial tensions due to the impact they have on our economy, particularly to the Panama Canal, a major contributor to the country's GDP.</p><h4>What is your perspective on fintech and what is the stock exchange doing in this regard?</h4><p>Fintech is highly important for the financial sector of any country, and Panama is no exception. We need to establish a regulatory framework that not only regulates these types of innovative business models, but also promotes and enables their inclusion in a friendly environment so that they can help transform our financial sector. Fintech must be addressed as a matter of urgency because its mandatory for the benefit of our financial sector. At Panama Stock Exchange, we are working on a number of initiatives, but they are mostly in the early stages of development.</p><h4>What has been the role of the stock exchange when it comes to integrating markets and expanding and bringing more companies?</h4><p>Our role has been key to the integration of the Salvadorian and Panamanian markets. As of May 2017, we had completed over USD100 million worth of negotiations and had cleared and settled over 500 trades. We continue to work on enhancements to our integration model to provide more liquidity to our markets and are also working with Association of Capital Markets of the Americas (AMERCA) on a project to integrate its remaining exchange members.  </p><h4>What are your targets and goals for 2020?</h4><p>Our goal is to become the hub for the regional capital markets by 2020. Hence, we have been working on different strategic initiatives, including an important financial educational project. Moreover, we have been working with the regulator to enhance our regulatory framework and with governmental agencies to develop our local capital market. Sustainability has become an important part of our strategic plan, and we will continue to work on having our bond guide in place, recommend the ESG principles guide to our stakeholders, and bring awareness of responsible investments. Equally important, we will continue to promote our market and its benefits. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights of the company in Latin America?</h4><p>The biggest highlight for us has been the launch of our first large renewable investment in Brazil, adding 89MW of solar power. That was an important step for the company's decision to undertake larger renewable projects in Latin America. We have invested in agribusiness projects in various countries, and we are investing in an infrastructure fund for Peru, Chile, and Colombia to construct railroads, water filtration plants, and highways. All that is quite positive because such projects extend our presence in the region. We also have a large investment in the port of Callao in Lima and have done other infrastructure-related investments as well. Looking into the future, some of the interesting projects that we have in the pipeline include an expansion of the solar PV project in Brazil and a major microfinancing investment in Bolivia. These are financially attractive investments with a positive social and environmental impact, which is the overall target for our investments. Going forward, on a broader scale, we are advancing into microfinancing, financial institutions, agroindustry, and renewables, as well as construction and infrastructure. </p><h4>Why did you come to Panama?</h4><p>Pedregal Power Plant is a 20-year-old project. We established this company with our partners several years ago when the energy infrastructure in Panama was still in its early days. At present, there is a lot of competition and foreign investment, but 20 years ago the country was considered to be high risk for many funds. Back then, IFU and other investors saw the potential and risks of the Panamanian market. Today, we are completely changing our portfolio of investments to bring renewable energy to the forefront. Two decades ago, Pedregal Power Plant was quite important for Panama City's energy baseload. Moving toward the future, the best opportunities and most sensible investments are in renewable energies like solar or wind power. </p><h4>What is the current state of the energy sector in Panama?</h4><p>The structure of the energy market meant the government had to offer power purchasing agreements (PPA) to the new large LNG projects, as well as a coal-based plant. These plants will more than just cover the consumption in the coming years. So, in order to make space for wind and solar energy in Panama, consumption has to grow considerably, which we do not foresee in the near future. </p><h4>What's the strategy to create and develop these projects?</h4><p>The fortunate thing about renewable energy becoming economically viable is that it makes it possible to think of off-the-grid initiatives such as solar.  Hydropower has a lot of importance in Panama and Colombia, but it has some problems, too. Water is becoming increasingly scarce in recent years due to climate change. This can make space for more wind and solar projects, including small 10-20MW projects. Such small-scale projects might not be what larger funds and companies are looking for, but we are happy to undertake them. </p><h4>What's your strategy to bring more investment into your portfolio? What are your goals in Latam for 2019?</h4><p>We are aiming to invest USD65 million in three to four commercially viable projects with a positive social, economic, and environmental impact. These investments could be in any Latin American country, from Mexico to Peru. We are going to knock on doors and explain to peers and entrepreneurs who we are and what we do through local and international investment bankers, trade fairs, conferences, and personal meetings. Also, we will further initiate talks with European funds and companies who have been active in Latin America for years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does it feel like to be recognized as one of the Great Places to Work in Panama for 2019?</h4><p>It was a surprise because being a small company we cannot invest much in things that are not part of our core business. The Great Place to Work Institute does a cultural audit and another one about how people feel about working for the company. We were interested in getting this independent opinion. For me, company culture is the essence of success. It was a surprise to find out Suma Financiera was ranked number six among the best places to work in Panama. The five companies ranked above us were all huge multinationals. We were also ranked ninth out of 100 for Central America and eighth in all categories for Central America.</p><h4>How do you ensure Suma Financiera continues to increase its market share?</h4><p>Right now, we have eight offices and great infrastructure. However, we need to increase productivity per credit agent. When I check the balance sheet, there is no fat that needs trimming. We are a small company that is getting bigger; we have almost 100 people and 2,500 clients. In addition, we have to increase our quality and make people more aware of our services. Our message is that Suma Financiera is a great place to grow. We strive to be a fearless company where people can raise their hands and speak freely.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does your award for “Best Private Banking Services Overall 2019" in Euromoney's Private Banking Survey represent?</h4><p>It is just a testament of the hard work and effort of all our colleagues around the world. It is recognition of how we have conducted our business, putting clients and their interests first. Although the award is given out yearly, this not the result of a good year but rather the culmination of initiatives and practices that we continuously strive to achieve.</p><h4>How is this being translated into your Panamanian operations for almost 45 years?</h4><p>Panama might not be the first location that comes to mind when you talk about UBS. Nevertheless, we have a one-bank approach where we are committed to uphold the standards and level of service our clients have come to expect. This approach, and the performance and level of service of UBS in places such as Panama, is one of the main reasons why we are continuously recognized as the best private bank globally. Our goal is to provide the same high level of service whether a client comes to our office in New York, Zurich, or Panama.</p><h4>During UBS' time in Panama, how have your main sectors of operation changed, if at all?</h4><p>We do business a different way. We do not focus on selling specific products or services, but rather on providing the best wealth management services to our clients. This allows us to remain flexible and continuously improve our offering in order to make sure that we achieve our goal. Our main stakeholders have always been and will always be our clients.</p><h4>Which are the preferred global partners for the Panamanian market?</h4><p>We focus on our clients. That is why we strive to be booking center neutral. We do not try to push clients to book in Europe or the US but rather provide them with viable alternatives in most major markets and allow them to make the decision that best fits their needs. Our preferred global partners are the clients' preferred global partners.</p><h4>How do you plan to increase your market share in the country?</h4><p>We depend on our people and their commitment to the principles and pillars of the bank. Simply put, we have the most talented and hardworking group of colleagues in the region. We provide them with all the support and assistance of the UBS global platform and allow them to get to work. This is the reason that UBS has stayed in business locally for over 50 years while our major competitors have come and gone.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your expected results in terms of sustainable investing?</h4><p>It is definitely a major factor in many clients' decisions and investment strategy. We do not push clients in one direction or another but rather provide them with the best alternative in whatever direction they decide to go. Sustainable investing is no different. Our clients have shown an increased interest and appetite for this sector over the last five years, and we have been pioneers in introducing products, services, and investments that deal with sustainable investments to clients. We are one of the only banks, if not the only, to offer an investment fund 100% dedicated to investing in companies that deal with sustainability.</p><h4>What are the main goals for 2019?</h4><p>In real estate it is location, location, location. For us, it is clients, clients, clients. We are the best at what we do, and if we remain focused on our clients and their well-being the rest will come together easily. Our focus is to provide the best possible wealth management service to all of our clients. We do not want our clients to see us as another big bank; we want to be a partner to help them reach and meet their financial goals in a structured and responsible way. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does it mean to be the first Latin American bank to be listed on NYSE and obtain an investment grade?</h4><p>It was a great privilege to be the first Latin American bank listed on the NYSE. Our listing provided international investors access to high quality diversified Latin American risk when investing in Bladex's shares. However, for Bladex, the listing was only the first step. Bladex's debt rating based on diversification, credit underwriting standards, and a strong business model achieved an investment-grade credit rating. With our shares listed on the NYSE and debt rated investment grade, Bladex is able to tap the international capital markets for both debt and equity in the most efficient possible manner. Furthermore, we achieve diversification through a portfolio construction that entails 19 different jurisdictions in Latin America, each one its own complexities and opportunities. We have the benefit of 40 years of experience in building these portfolios. In fact, part of the attractiveness of our business model and operations is that we have successfully lent to a region that has gone through significant ups and downs. An important element of our success is the degree to which Bladex has evolved with the economies of Latin America.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of a stronger relationship between Panama and China?</h4><p>Panama has an interesting challenge in continuing to develop excellent relations with China and the rest of Asia. Panama has a historic relationship with the US. Given current trade friction between the US and China, Panama finds itself in a delicate position. The US continues to represent the lion's share of foreign trade with Latin America. At the same time, trade with Asia, specifically China, continues to grow and cannot be ignored. Bladex has an interesting balance in terms of how we develop our lines of businesses. Much of the trade we finance today is between Latin and North America, and we need to further develop our trade channels to the East and West. Growth rates of Latin American trade with Asia are more than twice the growth rates of trade with North at this rate, by the end of the next decade, trade with Asia may surpass trade with the US.</p><h4>What is Bladex's corporate community involvement?</h4><p>We are dedicated to the concept that a country is only as good as its education. As members of the Panamanian community, it is our responsibility to promote not only better standards of education, but also to support institutions that are doing a good job, particularly for the underprivileged. This is why we are heavily involved with the Centro Educativo Marie Poussepin. Bladex is focused on examining how we can build on our efforts to continue to improve education in Panama. We view these efforts as a key core of our corporate responsibility and the legacy we would like to build upon.</p><h4>What are your goals for the next five years, and how do you see the bank's future in the region?</h4><p>The business model of the bank continues to be relevant to Latin America. That said, we cannot ignore the fact that more technologically efficient players, such as fintechs and other non-regulated entities, will compete with more established and regulated financial institutions such as ours. Our intention is to deepen Bladex's commitment to the region through the financing of trade transactions. That means a broader offering of trade finance products, better diversification of trade channels, and pursuing new markets, such as Asia and Europe, more aggressively. The holy grail of being able to finance trade is to be able to approach the exporters of Latin America with a value proposition that involves discounting entire portfolios of invoices of trade transactions, valuing them, and positioning or packaging them through securitization transactions as capital market instruments, and in off-balance sheet structures. We still have some work to set ourselves up operationally and technologically to approach our client base with such a value proposition. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is your commitment to continuing attracting and promoting business in Panama?</h4><p>We have been part of the Bancolombia Group for five years. Actually, we have managed throughout our experience to consolidate the operation as a relevant bank in Panama, not only because of our participation in the market, but also because of our commitment to the projects in the sectors that lead the country's economic growth. Furthermore, we are a bank committed to the sustainable economic and social development of Panama. In fact, we are headed in the right direction to consolidate our operation as a universal bank proposal, even more when Panama currently has many investment opportunities at the infrastructure level and other major projects.</p><h4>What does the news of the biggest bond issuance in Panama mean?</h4><p>The government of Panama is a great client for our operation in the country, and we have managed this dual issuance for USD1 billion that was placed both on the international and local markets. This participation demonstrates that we have laid the foundations as a financial group that allow us to support the government of our country in its projects, issuances, and capital needs. This is the result of several years of work. We are proud of being chosen due to the reputation and the trajectory of Grupo Bancolombia in the region.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the Panamanian economy?</h4><p>Latin America is still deficient in infrastructure investment, and Panama has a great track record, so we have traditionally been an ally for these projects, either via the government or the private company that bids on these projects. There are large investments to be made, and we are poised to support the commercial sector and even participate in the free trade zones. Free zones have historically been a competitive advantage of Panama, and this sector still has business opportunities. In fact, we and our clients still find opportunities to serve them. Finally, we are committed to working on value proposals that allow us to be a relevant player in the financial sector for every Panamanian or resident.</p><h4>How are you providing digital and innovative tools?</h4><p>We were the first bank in Panama with fintech. Consumers dictate how they want to relate to the financial industry. In fact, Nequi was the first value proposition in the Panamanian market that associated a fintech with a bank. For two years, we have educated consumers. We are pleased because we closed the month of April with 60,000 clients on the platform. This has been a learning process along with the operation of our digital sales portals. Hence, we are committed to transforming ourselves constantly to encourage users to think of the bank as a new way of doing business, with players and alliances. This is the result of investing heavily in the bank's innovation culture.</p><h4>How is the bank fostering gender equality?</h4><p>We are a bank that works hard for gender equality. I am proud to say that we are part of the advisory board on gender parity. This has translated into signing the seal of equality. Under our proposal of Impulsa, we are leading a program that is aimed at female entrepreneurs. We have reached more than 1,000 women in education programs. This means working with 25 female entrepreneurs to give them formal training so that they can realize their projects and ensure their undertakings are sustained over time. Also, we count among our facilities more than 900 employees who participate in volunteer activities. The goal for 2019 is for 55% of our workforce to actively participate in volunteer activities. Social responsibility and sustainability are the only way to do business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the latest accomplishments for the company?</h4><p>After 52 years in the energy sector, we are proud to have expanded to the green energy segment. We decided to do that to tackle a growing market and contribute to climate change. Coming from the oil and gas sector, we felt it was something important. After eight years, we have made substantial progress in distributed renewable generation, which means producing energy and managing it at the consumer level.</p><h4>How has your international experience translated into the operations in Panama?</h4><p>We gained experience from exporting our engineering and project management services across the world, in Latin America, North America, Europe, and the Middle East. We are now concentrated on being a regional player based out of Panama. That includes the northern part of Latin America, Central America, the Caribbean, and Southeast US. Our objective is not only to provide services to clients in the renewable energy sector, but also become an asset manager and investor of distributed energy resources.</p><h4>What strategies and initiatives do you have regarding corporate social responsibility?</h4><p>In our corporate history, we have always given priority to the education sector. We are, after all, a service company. However, recently we have been active in pro bono projects for off-grid communities needing electricity as a way to improve their lives.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your experience in Latin America translated into results in Panama?</h4><p>Cox Energy develops PV projects and invests in these projects while managing financial closing of long-term power purchase agreements (PPA). In Latam, we are present in Chile, Mexico, Panama, and Colombia. The company has a pipeline of 5,000MW in different renewable energy projects. Of this, more than 2,500MW are backed for the most part by long-term energy contracts, both public and private, while the other 2,500MW are in different stages of development and ready to go to tenders and sign future PPAs. We started in Chile because renewable energy was promoted there, and the government bet on auctions for renewable energy projects. So far, we have won two auctions: a 264-GW one in 2016 and a 140-GW one in 2017. At present, we can build almost 700MW of solar energy, the majority of which is produced under long-term contracts with almost all distributors. The auctions put the generators in contact with the marketers and distributors. In general, all countries provide enough support to face eventualities. Chile is one of the countries in Latin America where renewables have registered the greatest development. Its regulations are clear and specific, and it offers security to investors, generators, and distributors. Other countries should try to achieve a similar evolution.</p><h4>Has the company evolved in Latin American markets?</h4><p>We have consolidated our position in Spain, Mexico, and Chile. We are interested in all markets in Latin America, Central America, and the Caribbean. There are many opportunities, especially for solar energy because, in Latin America, the radiation from the sun is excellent and we must take advantage of it. Equally important, costs related to solar energy have been falling; just between 2014 and 2016 costs dropped by 70%. We have been in Panama since 2014 and have seen different ways to enter the market, which is a small energy market compared to other markets. In fact, in Central America, small projects are popular; for example, a 10-MW project is considered quite significant. In Panama, we have a pipeline of 150MW, and we are looking to close that with industrial clients. Other options are going to marketers or directly to spot, which is the market. Panama is heavily focused on hydroelectric energy, but there can be abrupt changes with the water supply, as has been the case in Colombia. It is important to have a reliable source of energy such as solar energy or wind energy. Panama enjoys abundant sunlight, which is why self-consumption is an interesting model here. However, people find it difficult to make the first investment, but we have different business models where we invest, and the customer pays over the years.</p><h4>What are your targets and goals for 2019?</h4><p>Our goal for 2019 is to build and put our plants into operation and develop new opportunities in Chile and Mexico. In Colombia, we want to do a PPA project and keep growing. At present, Panama is our entrance point to the Central American market, and we want to expand further. Our objective is to close a long-term contract and build a solar plant in a maximum period of one year. This is why we are focusing on industrial companies to start generating solar energy. Self-consumption is another interesting model and we want to grow that model in Panama and reach 150MW capacity. Panama will remain an attractive market as long as the government supports and maintains favorable policies. The regulations must support the development of projects, and the goals must be met. It would be interesting for the government to enact new tender processes for renewables and begin to forget about fossil fuels whose price fluctuates. We need an energy policy that will benefit the population and the country's competitiveness. I hope the new government will change this situation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the highlights of recent years?</h4><p>2018 was a great year for the company's Central American operations as we fulfilled all the target objectives. Our severity and frequency indicators were the best throughout the region. Regarding operational issues, we began our entry into Honduras through the execution of our first solar farm. With this project, we have taken the first step as a company in the B2B business in Honduras. In Costa Rica, we are continuing with the storage business. In fact, we are working in storage associated with solar distributed generation. In the case of Panama, in addition to the traditional generation of distribution, one of our new targets is the first massive residential project with solar panels using photovoltaic distribution technology already installed on the rooftops of houses. This project represents a milestone in Central America and Colombia. This project is done in partnership with Provivienda, which is one of the main actors in the construction and promotion of housing. To date, 104 houses have been delivered. However, this is a 20-year project that includes 10,000 units.</p><h4>What about your current projects in Panama?</h4><p>We are developing three large projects for distributed generation for food companies, shopping centers, and a liquor factory. The distributed generation reaches sectors like commercial, residential, industrial, and offices. At the end of 2018, we had 1-MW contracts in distributed generation and were immersed in the assembly process. We will deliver those projects in 2019 and expect them to generate benefits for our customers. Regarding electrical real estate, we assembled, installed, and inaugurated the country's first multi-brand (multiprotocol) electric vehicle charging station in association with the AltaPlaza mall. There are two charging points available for all protocols or types of electric or hybrid vehicles. Our aim is to install two more this year. Regarding non-conventional renewable energies with a centralized generation, we have acquired the Divisa 10-MW Solar Farm in Aguadulce.</p><h4>What are some of Celsia's corporate social responsibility initiatives?</h4><p>We are doing several things in Panama, mainly in communities near generation plants. In 2018 and 2019, we worked on school infrastructure in Chiriquí­. In Colón, we provide classrooms equipped for children with special abilities. Also, we have improved the electrical installation in schools. More than 100 children in Colón participate in our karate program every Saturday. Furthermore, the Celsia Cup of Karate featured 600 athletes from all over the world. In Chiriquí­, we offer workshops, improved parks, and implement water-related projects. In Costa Rica, we worked in old schools and constructed a skate park in 2018 in the community of Guayabo. In 2019, we changed the roof of the communal house. In Honduras, we have been working with the communities of Comayagua, a region where we are implementing a solar farm. Furthermore, we will do an electric rally in 2019 from San José to Panama. Electric mobility touches on economic and social issues across communities. We want to promote electric mobility in the countryside and the city and make mobility greener.</p><h4>What are the plans and objectives for 2019?</h4><p>We are considering expanding into other countries in the Central American and Caribbean region. Our goal is to close 2019 with the signing and installation of 20MW of distributed generation with solar panels in the region. We want to continue with the traditional assets of generation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

In that sense, one of the main drivers we have is to create and develop new office spaces for our people, making sure everyone, no matter their position, has access to windows and views. We try to bring everybody in on the process. We have competitors who separate their managing partners from the backstage staff, who also work to develop client products and solutions. Our secret is to involve all of our staff to be a part of our work.</p><h4>What expansion plans do you have? What about your portfolio?</h4><p>Our area of operations is Central America, Panama, and the Dominican Republic (EYCA) in which we operate as one firm, meaning we share one profit and loss statement in the seven countries. EYCA is part of our Latam North Practice, which is composed of Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, and Bolivia. Our portfolio of clients is diverse and growing. Furthermore, many of our clients search us out because of our reputation; we then retain our clients because we render services of a high quality, which is the way to be present in the market. It is important to add that we are targeting our investments in digital right now, and the EY network is making a great deal of investments in this sector. We have an innovation sector in Costa Rica and Panama, so we will share new technologies and issues with clients. We may not see the effects of this investment in the short term, but there will be benefits in the medium to long term. Hence, we are bringing our clients the same good service as always, and with our investments we will gain more market share.</p><h4>Who are your main partners, and where do you see growth in Panama?</h4><p>There is growth in digital. In 2018, we invested in a company of 60 people in Costa Rica that is now working with us. Worldwide 50% of our content relates to digital and Panama is the connection between north and south. Connectivity is important and the challenge lies in how to integrate that airspace and maritime connectivity to create better logistics solutions for our clients and companies seeking to invest in Panama.</p><h4>How do you engage people and communities to advance in gender equality?</h4><p>EY has made a massive investment in promoting women in leadership positions. We are trying to establish individuals rather than differentiating genders. Also, we are allowing the work from home commitment for families with children so they can combine their work schedule with their family commitments.</p><h4>What are your main goals and targets for 2019?</h4><p>The main goal for EY is to continue being an excellent service provider and increase its market share. We think the banking and service sectors will grow, therefore we will focus on banks, insurance companies, and finance companies to grow together. The financial sector's assets may increase, while the number of institutions will fall. A concentration in the market needs to happen and we will help banks with IT integration and post-merger integration. Additionally, telecommunications and the multinational market are another sectors where we expect a great deal of investment to take place. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In terms of FDI, how is the strategic position of Panama an advantage compared to the region?</h4><p>Panama is a fortunate country compared to the region, and the growth of the private sector contributes to strengthening the economy. When one examines the financial sector, Panama has a strong position because it is a dollar-based economy. Additionally, the country has a small population, which, in my opinion, facilitates inward and outward business interactions. In addition, another advantage that Panama has, when it comes to foreign investment, is that it has been a country for transit for 500 years, which has attracted both investments and human capital to be part of its development.</p><h4>How have you managed to stand out as a leader in the country?</h4><p>There are two key lessons I have learned. First, you must be willing to delegate responsibility. Second, you must be willing to take measured risk. Everyone knows about successes, but few people know about the failures. Believe me, both are a part of life.</p><h4>What have been the main strategies to increase the value of your investment portfolio?</h4><p>The secret is to find good people. I define that as people who are ethical, have a passion for what they do, and can communicate the purpose and strategy of the company.</p><h4>What is your opinion about the latest IT developments in the Panamanian economy?</h4><p>Panama has outstanding infrastructure for the development of the telecommunications sector. The development of the information storage sites and fiber optic infrastructure are strong. In fact, events like Cybertech Panama 2019 are facilitating the exchange of ideas and initiatives that invite entrepreneurs to increase direct investment. In addition, these projects are bringing new talent to Panama. They, in turn, then interact with Panamanian talent.</p><h4>What have been the recent milestones in terms of social responsibility activities?</h4><p>As president of Sumarse, I would say the most important companies in Panama now have corporate social responsibility agendas. As I get older, I am also spending more time on non-profit activities, and I have always told people that if I regret anything it is not having done more with non-profits earlier in life. In this way, I strongly suggest everyone to get involved in at least one social nonprofit activity. It will make you a better person, and therefore a better business executive.</p><h4>What are the goals for 2019?</h4><p>The goal is to keep growing responsibly. That has been the company's goal for many years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Dusit stand out in the increasingly competitive Dubai tourism market? </h4><p>The international brand DusitD2 reflects the needs and desires of the second generation traveler. We offer a refreshing take on destination chic, and we're a contemporary and trendy hotel, perfectly suited for the savvy-modern traveller. Currently, around 76% of travelers are millennials, and as we represent this market, we keep close tabs on millennials needs and expectations so we can always provide a valuable and relevant product to this market. This can be seen in all aspects of our business, from the hotel's strategic location in Barsha, close to offices and universities, to our minimalistic design, staff's friendly approach and casual designed uniforms, to the various second gen-catered philosophies of our F&amp;B outlets. Millennials are the next generation of tourists, the biggest demographic travelers. One of our strategies to stay relevant and one that sets us apart from other similar properties is that we hire young. Young staff members bring about fresh ideas, passions and motivation which only add more value to our brand offering.</p><h4>How do you seek to expand the dusitD2 brand and other Dusit brands in Dubai? </h4><p>The first dusitD2 facility established in 2002 was received extremely well and spiked interest about the brand all around the world. We plan on developing another in Dubai soon, and there are plans to open another dusitD2 in Bahrain by 2020. Our facilities will also expand to other GCC countries, including in Saudi Arabia in 1Q 2020. The other brand that is currently <br>expanding is Dusit Princess, a classy and functional hotel, best suited for the no-nonsense traveler, offered at affordable rates. This brand has been expanding significantly in Asia, and we have just introduced it in Dubai. Our first introduction of Dusit Princess in Dubai will be in the Marina; we are currently in the final stages and aim to open in October. We have refurbished the residences from top to bottom with a touch of luxury in all the details. Moreover, we have big plans for Dusit Princess Dubai Marina. The property at its core will be a health-frantics dream fitness hub; for starters, we are bringing the flagship KO8 fitness studio focusing on suspension &amp; resistance training to operate at our property and the head office of SwitchDXB, a popular application that has been in the market for the past two years, offering users to discover everything Dubai has to offer from leisure and fitness, to wellbeing. We will be hosting a launch and reception for all our fitness partners at Dusit Princess Dubai Marina. We also have a unique eatery, Bakers Kitchen, that is focused on wholesome, organic and healthy food. All of our innovative partners combined with the Dusit Princess brand will make this property one of the most unique healthy-focused destinations in Dubai.</p><h4>How do you anticipate Expo 2020 impacting both tourism and the overall economy? </h4><p>We are watching the developments for Expo 2020 closely. We seek to ensure that we position ourselves correctly in order to attract our share of the 25 million expected visitors. We are working to become one of the official hotel partners of the Expo, though this is not yet an official designation. The tourism and hospitality sector is looking forward to EXPO 2020 by announcing more projects to meet the rising demands of tourist inflow; but this means that with an increase of demand, comes an increase in the supply of hotels, keeping the industry competitive as ever. </p><h4>What else is in the Dusit pipeline?</h4><p>dusitD2's architectural design and interiors were carefully hand-picked and curated to build the D2 brand that exists in Dubai today. For a while, dusitD2 was considered to be an art-hub for many artists, and we're currently working towards reviving this status. We will be hosting an Art Week in October, dedicated to reactivating the art community in Dubai and going back to our roots of being an art-focused hotel. As part of this interactive Art Week, we are organizing multiple workshops, hosting some major artists who will be live painting at the property, as well as dedicating a day for kids to get in touch with their artsy-side and giving talented, young individuals the opportunity to display their skills and learn more.  More on our expansion, we plan to expand into the UK and are extremely excited about this! Dusit is strong in Asia, and it is growing rapidly in the Middle East and the GCC; We are hopeful that Europe will be our next big destination. </p><h4>Have you noticed a shift in the composition of tourists to Dubai?</h4><p>When I first arrived in Dubai in late 2002, 70% of tourists were from specific European countries. Today, Dubai's popularity as a must visit tourist destination is only set to grow in the upcoming years with all the year-round calendar of festivals, events, shopping experiences and the city's rapid expansion. Dubai is no longer just a beach or luxury mall destination, it's a talent magnet. Now, a visitor can engage in new and diverse activities with the innovative tools and skill building opportunities that Dubai has to offer, such as Dubai Creative Zone which provides the perfect entrepreneurial-spirited  environment for tech innovators and startups. A great deal of focus of Dubai's Tourism and Destination Management is now on the Asian markets, which represent a large portion of all global tourism. China would be the number one source, with Japan and  South Korea following; these nationalities travel frequently as well. The GCC also represents a great deal of travelers and we are the regional hub for short- to medium-term trips for travelers around the GCC. Our properties also focus on attracting <br>travelers from CIS countries, Eastern Europe, and Scandinavia. In addition to millennial business travelers, our target audience comes to Dubai to be culturally educated, inspired and enriched by discovering new regions and learning new things. Many major universities around the world have opened campuses in Dubai, and this attracts numerous millennials who end up staying with us on a long-term basis; they are the marginal percentage of our overall occupants. The average stay period ranges across different areas of the industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook of the economy now that a new government has been elected?</h4><p>In Panama, the annual capital investment is close to 42% of GDP, which places us among the top globally in this important indicator. USD27 billion was invested in Panama in 2018. However, more important is the fact that private investment in 2018 was six times higher than government investment. The private sector accounts for over 85% of the total investment in the country. This makes it imperative that the government perfects its role as a facilitator of private investment. This is one of the main initiatives of our Agenda Paí­s 2019-2024, which also presents action plans aimed at finding solutions to the most important and pressing problems facing the country. Hence, Panama needs to reach its potential of 5.5% GDP growth in order to generate the desired jobs and take firm steps toward our full development. For this, CCIAP will promote tourism as an activity that generates thousands of jobs and has multiplier effects in other areas of the national economy. Furthermore, we are working with the Administrator of the Tourism Authority of Panama as well as with important actors of the private sector, in order to carry out actions that will help attract the more than 15 million passengers that transit annually through the Tocumen International Airport and increase the number of visitors to Panama. Panama has all the fundamentals to become the perfect location for conventions and large-scale international meetings." CCIAP will organize together with the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, the Tourism Authority of Panama, the Inter-American Development Bank, and our counterparts the International Chamber of Commerce of China and the Chinese Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the 13th China-Latin America and the Caribbean Summit (CHINA-LAC), during which nearly 2,000 entrepreneurs from all over the world will meet.</p><h4>As a recently elected president of the chamber, what is  your main focus?</h4><p>During my term, we will focus on the economic reactivation of the country, concentrating on the tourism sector, which has great potential for the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs, as well as having a transversal effect on other areas of the Panamanian economy. In view of the challenges that lie ahead, CCIAP has formed a group to promote national economic development led by former President Gabriel Barletta. Since the election of the new president, we have met with the designated authorities to work together in order to achieve the desired economic dynamism. We are extremely optimistic in the teamwork that we can develop between the state and private companies. </p><h4>In terms of growth, which sectors will be the main drivers of the economy for the short term?</h4><p>The Center for Economic Studies of the Chamber of Commerce, Industries, and Agriculture of Panama (CEECAM) estimates growth for 2019 to be 4.5%. Among the sectors that have retained their dynamism are the Panama Canal, ports, the Hub of the Americas, telecommunications services, and the financial sector. This economic development is impacted by several factors, among which are optimism for the entry of a new government administration, the commercial situation between the US and China, and high expectations for the operations of Minera Panama and its impact on exports for 2020. Also, we can highlight the levels of FDI, which present a favorable performance, with an amount of USD5.5 billion in 2018, and a growth of 21.2% YoY. CCIAP has positive growth expectations that will be strengthened in 2020, expecting a growth of the economy close to 5.6%. To this end, it is important to keep working with our main economic partners, such as the US, China, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Spain. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What drove Raytheon's decision to become an onshore, landed company in the UAE, and what can other defense firms learn from that experience?</h4><p>Raytheon certainly feels privileged to establish a landed company in Abu Dhabi. We have had a presence in the UAE for over 30 years, providing different solutions and systems in support of the UAE Armed Forces. Our landed company   Raytheon Emirates reflects the dynamic business environment that is propelling the UAE and advancing its indigenous capability. This is an exciting opportunity for us to expand our business from beyond sales and marketing to a wholly owned, locally-based company responsible for business creation, market growth and financial results utilizing the Emirati industrial base. We see it as a complement to our existing business, and an entry point to new missions, markets, technologies, and capabilities many of these we cannot possibly imagine today.</p><h4>What distinguishes Raytheon's experience and approach in the UAE from other markets?</h4><p>One of the differentiating elements of the UAE market is the fundamental driver of relationships. Relationships here are different and have a deeper meaning versus some business relationships in the US, which can be more at arm's length. In the UAE, it starts with a personal relationship, and from there one enters into business relationships and, eventually, trusted partnerships. We are working closely with the Emirate's defense industry companies. We have close relationships with Mubadala, Tawazun, and other key stakeholders, balancing their perspectives with those of our customers and incorporating all these considerations into our business plan. This is a collaborative market where we work together to grow.</p><h4>How does Raytheon leverage its global resources to cultivate talent here, and what role do Emiratis play in the company's wider operations?</h4><p>Raytheon has always prided itself on having an inclusive and diverse workforce. Bringing that to Abu Dhabi and incorporating Emirati talent into our human resource pool has been exciting. Certainly, as an American company doing business here, having a greater Emirati presence helps us understand how to do business in the Emirates. Blending our technologies, experiences, and brand with their cultural expertise has been a powerful tool for us. We have been fortunate to hire several Emiratis in our extended leadership team and will continue to do so as our business expands. They are extremely educated and highly motivated and have been a refreshing addition to our multi-national workforce. The benefit of Raytheon being a global company with strong links to the US is that as we hire Emiratis, we are able to bring them to the US to learn our processes, technologies, and business philosophies. There has been a valuable cross-pollination, with Raytheon giving Emiratis experience in our businesses and our US operations gaining experience from them as well.</p><h4>What has Raytheon brought to the cybersecurity landscape of the UAE?</h4><p>When people think of Raytheon, they usually think of our traditional defense capabilities; however, we are a strong cyber-defense company as well. We actually protect .gov and many homeland security-related web domains in the US. Through Raytheon Emirates, we can offer that capability, which has applications beyond the defense sector, to the UAE market. Civil entities ranging from police forces and airport authorities to banking and financial firms are all exposed to frequent cyber attacks. With its layered cyber defense services, Raytheon is capable of serving a range of industries in the UAE. The cyber arena is also a great place for us to recruit, attract, and retain Emirati talent. When we have positions open in the UAE cyber business, the number of local applicants we get and the level of their qualifications is staggering.</p><h4>What role has Raytheon played in building coherence across the Gulf's regional defense landscape?</h4><p>It is important for Gulf regional allies to build and have operational coherence for many security and public safety matters. This includes having a degree of mission interoperability and compatibility across the region so systems and solutions can talk to each other. There is commonality in terms of support systems and logistics, and there is a clear benefit from economies of scale. In this regard, our mission systems can provide situational awareness and satisfy the variety of threats faced by allied forces.</p><h4>What are some of the most exciting areas of innovation and collaboration you are witnessing in the UAE defense sector cluster?</h4><p>The threat landscape is moving away from traditional domains toward areas like cyber attacks. These will not be seen in the air or on the ground, and they move at an accelerated pace. Similarly, cyber defense has to move at an accelerated pace in order to keep up. Raytheon Emirates is working on developing cyber academies as well as a cyber range, where we give the government the capability to engage threats and to defeat them as they emerge. Beyond cyber, there is a number of outstanding capabilities and technologies in the UAE that are sponsored by Mubadala or Tawazun. Some of the things that Nimr and Calidus are doing, for example, are natural fits that can be blended with Raytheon's offerings. We are exploring the possibility of combining some of our capabilities with other local companies to create indigenously developed solutions that meet demand in the UAE, and even other markets. This is in line with the country's goal to build domestic knowledge and assets.</p><h4>Is the defense sector here developing a culture of cooperation necessary for export orientation?</h4><p>It is; the economy is globalizing at such a pace that transactions will become increasingly seamless, regardless of where the products, services, manufacturers, or providers are from. The real value and barriers to entry will come from the quality of collaborations and partnerships. Raytheon has partners across the world. There are few projects we have undertaken solely as Raytheon. This way of doing business gives us access to markets, customer bases, and technologies that we would not have as a singular company. The opportunity for Raytheon to extend that cooperation here with the Emiratis will not only benefit us, but, more importantly, matches up with the goals the UAE has laid out in Vision 2030 — namely, to help develop industries outside of oil and gas and advancing the country's defense capabilities.</p><h4>How can potential investors in the UAE's defense sector expect to see the landscape evolve over the next few years?</h4><p>In so many industry sectors and on so many business fronts, the UAE is leaning into innovation as it diversifies its economy. Whether it is cyber or academic, health, water treatment or power, it is a relatively young economy. There are many opportunities to bring in new technologies and capabilities. It is an exciting time for a nation embracing the future. For countries and companies alike, change is a constant. The Raytheon that started 97 years ago is much different today, and the Raytheon Emirates of today will be much different from the one 30-50 years from now.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the issues to be discussed with the new government of Panama?</h4><p>The most urgent issue for Panama is water. Israel can help significantly. Panama, like other Latin American countries, has not had to worry about water throughout its history. However, Panama and other countries in the region must start planning their systems much better, along with controlling and directing these systems differently. In the past, Latin America had water without limits; however, today, this resource is no longer free for the countries of Latin America. Israel is a country without a great deal of water, and, due to this, we have managed to develop extensive technology for the management of water systems and water conservation. We can offer many components in Panama to make a historic change. Agriculture and water are existentially linked, and Israel has a great deal of experience in this field, producing all the food we need but also managing to export, too, even though most of the country is desert. We have already done this in Colombia and Ecuador, where some companies in Israel work in sectors such as flowers. Today, these companies sell almost USD1 billion in flowers in international markets.</p><h4>What is the contribution of Israeli companies to the Panamanian market?</h4><p>There are Israeli companies in many sectors of the Panamanian community, and we are about to close a free trade agreement (FTA). In Israel, we have already finished the whole process, and here it is only necessary to ratify it in the National Assembly. We have Israeli companies in the agricultural sector and, with our help, Panamanian trade can reach Dubai, Singapore, and other places that are centers of globalization. In fact, Panama and Israel can connect the world because Israel is a global technology center, and Panama is an important hub because of its canal and the airport. If we join these two centers, we will have an international network. There are examples such as Selina, which is a company that works a great deal on the Casco Viejo and is an important anchor for the tourist sector in Panama, especially for cruises where 25-30% of the Casco development corresponds to Israeli companies. Grupo Dekel also participates in this project. In five or six years, it will be one of the most impressive cities in the world.</p><h4>What is the approach of the Israeli embassy in Panama in terms of academic exchanges between educational institutions?</h4><p>We have visited all the major universities in Panama and have met with different deans and faculties. There are different topics on which we can focus to use the experience of Israel. There are already Panamanian students studying in Israel, and their teachers say they are amazing students. These people will return to Panama with the best knowledge in their fields. There are about 50 Panamanian students in Israel, but we can have many more. We have agreements of this type in other countries. Israeli universities started many international programs in English in the last decade, which helps Panamanian students reach Israel, Tel Aviv, Haifa, or Jerusalem. All have programs of thousands of students from all over the world. We want to send more Panamanian students and bring more Israeli teachers. In fact, we are invited to the National Congress of Science and Technology (APANAC) of 2020 in Panama. This is a great opportunity to activate the academic environment with Israelis at this conference. Also, we want to send deans and directors to Israel, so the students of Israel can see what they are doing. There is much to be done in the academic field. Modern diplomacy happens across many sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Panama integrate the Caribbean and Central America with the rest of the continent?</h4><p>Panama clearly knows how to do this. Panama became the hub or bridge of the Americas a long time ago as a result of its location and integration with Latin America. If someone asks a Panamanian if he considers himself South American or Central American his answer will be both, because he is in the middle and connects both. What helps the most in this role is connectivity with the Caribbean, South America, and Central America. Everything that goes through Panama can go to those regions, including connectivity and logistics.</p><h4>What role can Colombia have in the development of the Panamanian economy?</h4><p>It is an important role, since 17% of the investment in Panama is Colombian. Investment from the US comprise 22%. What directs our investment in the medium term is banking. In fact, 30% of Panamanian banks belong to Colombia, including Banitsmo, Bancolombia, Bac, Grupo Aval, and Davivienda. From there, we expanded to Central America. In addition, there are some large companies, such as the Nutresa Group and Grupo Argos, among other. Another important issue is the orange economy: platforms, software, the whole subject of creative innovation in music platforms, advertising, video, banking software. Another sector is tourism, as we are discussing the idea of bringing Panamanian tourists to Colombia. For connectivity, we have flights to all cities every day. We also want to continue growing in the flower market. The Netherlands is our strongest competition, but it is far away. Here the market is ours. These are the sectors we are targeting.</p><h4>Which sectors in Panama offer the greatest opportunities for investment and trade for Colombia?<br></h4><p>We are focused on construction materials. One sees the last 12 years of growth in the construction market. We have identified materials such as windows, gutters, and doors, all of which is brought to Colombia. We will compete with Chinese imports as well. On top of this, we are competing in energy distribution. We will enter strongly into the energy sector, especially through the tender for the fourth distribution line. We competed with Spain, Italy, South Korea, and France for the tender. The last two left were China and the Colombia.</p><h4>Besides electrical distribution, which other sectors could be competing with other Latin American countries thanks to that relationship with Panama?<br></h4><p>We want to be part of South Pacific cruise lines. There is a line that is extending from Valparaiso, it would go up to Guayaquil, and from Guayaquil we want it to pass through Colombia, through Buenaventura and Nuqui, and arrive here in Panama. We want to create South Pacific cruises that do not exist yet. We want to build a cruise terminal in Buena Aventura and capture a bit of the tourism that comes down from these cruises, so that they can get to Calima, Cali, and then go to the south. We will either compete or partner with Chile and Ecuador.</p><h4>With the new administration, what is your prediction for the future or potential collaborations in the relations of Colombia and Panama?</h4><p>We started to invest here more heavily after Venezuela collapsed. Venezuela was our second-largest commercial partner, so we had not been looking at other options or candidates for its replacement. After the crisis in Venezuela, we realized we could start investing in Panama. There are already established Colombian companies here, and it is the country that is growing the most. It is important to diversify and expand to new markets. For us, Panama is important. In less than a year, Colombian President Iván Duque has come to Panama three times. Not only is it important in commercial terms, but also in terms of geopolitics, security, migration, and stopping drug trafficking. We are allies. We always cooperate, and we work with the Americans. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do forums like Panama GBF2019 facilitate business partnerships?</h4><p>This is an opportunity for Haiti, which is the reason why I am here today to be part of this forum. In fact, we have the opportunity and the possibility to create a new way to relate between Dubai and Haiti, and Dubai with the Caribbean. The importance of participating here in the Global Business Forum is to be part of the networking and take advantage of a platform where the entrepreneurs can share, which is important for their businesses and of course to boost businesses in Latin America and the Caribbean. This is an opportunity for the Emirates to invest, and to invest in Haiti. In fact, I personally encourage such events and even more in the Caribbean. Haiti could be the next host country for the next Global Business Forum in 2020.</p><h4>What opportunities for growth do you see in LATAM and the Caribbean?</h4><p>Latin America and the Caribbean currently count on many opportunities when we talk about economic growth. Most of the countries are expanding within the regions. As a consequence, people from the Caribbean must continue to focus, for example, on areas such as technology, innovation, and industrial agriculture, and we must identify those other opportunities further down the road, which must become a state policy. As a matter of fact, I have mentioned this during my electoral campaign, along with the political stability that this can generate.</p><h4>What synergies between Haiti and Dubai can business leverage?</h4><p>Countries located in the Gulf, in fact, the UAE, have great experience when it comes to oil production and how to diversify constantly the economy, and that brings opportunities to countries such as Haiti. For example, we signed an agreement 19 years ago to export wool and 5,000 different products to the US without any taxes, which is a chance to invest for the UAE today and to have even more access to the North and South American markets. Hence, this is a chance for the investment located in the UAE to come to Haiti and subsequently to the US, especially in electro domestics, electronics, technology, agriculture, and cruise ships tourism. In fact, Haiti currently receives 800 cruise ships each year with the Royal Caribbean brand, because there are a great deal of attractions. We have five islands where we receive tourism. Thus, this is something that we would like to improve to attract greater investment from the UAE to work together and develop these islands with land reclamation, similar to Singapore to bring financial ventures and develop cities for the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main strategic priorities now that the government is starting?</h4><p>Panamanian foreign policy has a clear mandate: the defense of national interests. We have plans to restore and promote the image of Panama in order to attract investments, position Panamanian products in world markets, and generate opportunities that will contribute to the economic and social development of the country. Accepting this challenge, we are undertaking efforts to strengthen the country's institutions and lead our foreign service in a new direction. In addition, the embassies and consulates have a clear responsibility to attract investments, foster exports, and strengthen the Panamanian economy. Another priority of the new national administration is to deploy a strategy for the defense of Panamanian interests in all our relationships, forums, and initiatives, both on the bilateral as well as in the multilateral levels. To accomplish all of this, it is important to resume our historic role as a country promoting consensus, dialogue, and a constructive leadership in this new and changing regional and international scenario. </p><h4>How can Panama contribute to the development of the region?</h4><p>Panama enjoys exceptional advantages: We have the highest connectivity in the hemisphere and count on a canal that shortens global maritime distances and facilitates commercial exchanges in the region for the world. In fact, our maritime ports, facilities for air travel, logistics, and telecommunications confirm the role that our geography and history have assigned us: to be a bridge for the world, as well as a passageway enabling convergence. However, the best way we can contribute to the development of the region is by playing and renewing our mentioned natural and historical role, of being a country that promotes dialogue and consensus, where not only the oceans, but also ideas and creative thinking converge. In this way, Panama contributes to the stability of the region, which results in the free exchange of trade, economic progress, and development. Additionally, Panama has made significant marks on foreign relations, because it has been the venue and the site of numerous historical events, where the people of the American continent have gathered to support peace, understanding, security, and stability. That has been happening since the Amphictyonic Congress of 1826, the objective of which was to create a confederation of the Spanish-American people to solidify independence and non-intervention and uphold the equality of all nations before the law. That Congress was an early seed of multilateralism in our hemisphere. We must also remember the work done by the Contadora Group that contributed so much to achieving peace in Central America. </p><h4>What are the ministry's goals for 2020?</h4><p>Our foreign policy is a tool for economic and social development, whose mission is to advance Panama's interests and perspectives. We have committed ourselves to continue, reinforce, and relaunch political, economic and cultural relations, not only with our neighbors, but also with Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Our vision and commitment are to bring prestige to the name of Panama and encourage trust in it, and, for this purpose, one of the goals of the government led by the President of the Republic, Laurentino Cortizo Cohen, is to strengthen transparency, institutionalism, and effective compliance with the law and continue the fight against corruption, without making any concessions to it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>My fellow Panamanians, we have monumental challenges and great national tasks ahead. It is time to take the lead. Another stage begins, that of joining forces. It took us almost a hundred years to recover the Canal for Panama and reach our total sovereignty, a conquest that Omar Torrijos called the Fifth Frontier. Almost 20 years have passed since that historic reparation, which united our nation into one territory and under one single flag.</p><p>Now, the next conquest is the Sixth Frontier, the fight against poverty and inequality. The country of bounty and prosperity cannot hide from misery. Panama, a country whose figures show economic growth, in the last 10 years has tripled its debt, and the great national problems have worsened. Today, we are the sixth country in the world in inequality, which is unacceptable. Our challenge is to create a prosperous country of law and order, and above all, a fair country; a Panama that brings opportunities for all. This is our vision; this is our purpose.</p><p>Dear friends, this is a new beginning, to rescue Panama. Our country has been disrespected and abused to date. Today begins the victory of hope. With love, I want to express my gratitude. I want to thank God and my family. I also want to commit to all Panamanians. Day by day, I will earn your trust with my actions and decisions. We will leave a legacy with the foundations and the pillars of a different country, a better country.</p><p>The President of the Republic of Panama, with pride, tells you that work dignifies man. I am now the first worker in the country. I know how to work hard, with organization and discipline and with an aligned team. Panama summons us all. I am ready and the team is ready to grow like never before. To be proud of being Panamanians, to repair what needs to be repaired, to cut weeds from the fields, to start the new planting, and to reap our future: a Panama with opportunities for everyone. Let us make a cherished homeland. We have everything we need to do it. We have to do it; united we will.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, the interests of the country are always at the forefront. No individual interest, political or economic, will ever come above national interests. Our country has already suffered enough. Public funds are and will be sacred; we all have to be held accountable to the country. We will work without stealing. There will be no untouchables, even if they are ministers, legislators, prominent businesspeople, or even the president himself. Panama demands the restoration of an effective justice system.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, in the past are the lessons of good and bad, in the present is the determination to act, and in the future, the Panama of opportunities becomes a reality for all. The Five Panamas—the modern, the neighborhoods, the middle class, the rural, and the regions—expect us to act. I am optimistic. Women, men, all Panamanians, I summon you to unite and set aside your differences, to produce the consensus, to make serious commitments, and to build bridges, without interests that prevail or groups that want to impose, and without hate that solves nothing. We are all summoned; we must restore trust between us, with faith. Better days are coming for Panama.</p><p>Dear friend, a good government is a team. A team aligned in permanent contact with the communities that prioritizes and executes with transparency and efficiency and works without stealing. A team with energy, with character and without arrogance that consults with all. An accountable team, one that facilitates good investments, treats people like people, and serves and is useful to Panamanians. I instruct all government officials to act in a coordinated manner in the same direction, for the same purpose, with ethics, morality, and honesty.</p><p>Dear Panamanians, our Uniendo Fuerzas (Uniting Forces) Action Plan points in the direction of our government. It contains 125 commitments in four pillars and one star: good government; rule of law and law and order; a competitive economy that generates employment; combating poverty and inequality; and our centerpiece—education. There is no nobler task than transforming the country's education system. Complying with the National Commitment to Education, we will move forward with the transformation of our education system to teach our students to think to work as a team and to solve problems. The actions of all members of the government team must be aligned and framed within the action plan.</p><p>In addition, starting with the President of the Republic, I will require all members of the government team to adopt a code of conduct in the exercise of their public functions. My greatest satisfaction at the end of my presidential term will be to walk with my head high without feeling ashamed and continue to receive the affection that Panamanians give me today. It is not how I got to the Presidency; it is how I will leave it.</p><p>Dear friends, Panama needs everyone. The homeland summons us, without conditions or further delay. Let us move in the right direction. The moment of truth has come. I cannot do it alone; I need all of you, everyone. Panama in your name, united we will. And, after five years of overcoming the challenges of transformations and regaining national self-esteem with the pride of being Panamanians, we can all say, “United we did it." God bless Panama, thank you. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main strategic priorities of the new administration?</h4><p>President Cortizo's administration is entirely focused on achieving our Vision 2020 goals. In line with that, our first step is to strengthen the confidence in the government. We will create a true democratic society for the people and pursue, in every way, cultural growth, economic progress, and social welfare, through the execution of the initiatives detailed in our strategic plan. Our actions are based on four pillars: good governance, rule of law, competitive economy, and the eradication of poverty. The basis of all four pillars is education. Our mission is clear: to protect the national interests and promote sustainable economic, cultural, and social growth. Our administration is focused on reestablishing Panama's historic role in the international arena as the convergence center.</p><h4>How can Panama contribute to the development of the region?</h4><p>Ever since the establishment of the Panama Canal and its affiliates infrastructures, the Panamanian isthmus has been used as a strategic, globalized trade route for both mobilization of people and goods, either crossing from the Atlantic or the Pacific Ocean. Currently, Panama continues to forge the path as the leader in the region, not only by contributing as a maritime, logistics, and trade hub, but also by expanding all areas of business and opportunities throughout the country and region. In terms of sustainability and development, Panama has realigned its priorities to focus on its short- and long-term objectives regarding sustainable economic growth, one of the key strategic objectives of President Cortizo and his government.</p><h4>What are the ministry's goals for 2020?</h4><p>One of the main goals of the Ministry of Commerce and Industries for 2020 is to address the systemic obstacles and challenges the local producers and industries have been facing in terms of exporting goods and services. By first identifying such obstacles and studying the best course of action, we have been working on a thorough solution, thereby setting up centers and entities to overcome them through the implementation of our holistic approach. In addition, we believe it is time to assess the dominant role of the private sector in our economy. The public sector should move from being a passive facilitator to a proactive one by establishing the necessary guidelines to guarantee a permanent communication channel with the private sector. This particularly can be achieved by structuring a Commercial Intelligence Unit with specific objectives: developing a strong partnership with the business sector; identifying and foreseeing new business opportunities to help further expand our access to foreign markets by leveraging the FTAs negotiated in recent decades, as well as targeting the main reasons of our inability to take advantage of the opportunities identified back then. Locally, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Commerce have a common goal of working together to become a facilitator for all investments, thus introducing pathways to reduce transaction costs and internal bureaucratic logistics. We are envisioning strategies to become more competitive in constantly evolving global markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you developed the brand through time?</h4><p>We are extremely proud to celebrate our 20th anniversary in 2019. Most brands in the F&amp;B industry do not have long lifespans, due to the constantly changing market and consumption trends. We first started with a simple concept to serve Manousheh, the Lebanese staple street food, in a way that conformed to best-in-class service and hygiene standards. We aimed to deliver the same product one would find in Lebanese bakeries but focusing on quality and experience to cater to a more sophisticated, young, and international crowd. Given our initial success, we began opening new branches and achieving success while maintaining our quality and consistency. We became a leading regional chain, whereby customers know what they are getting when they choose Zaatar w Zeit. </p><h4>What is your geographical distribution, and how have you adapted your strategy to the different markets?</h4><p>Currently, we operate around 80 branches worldwide. We have 24 branches in Lebanon and are about to open the 25th this year. Outside of Lebanon, we are present in six countries: the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Canada. Given Lebanon's limited growth vis-í -vis our ambition, we are now concentrating more on strengthening our presence abroad. This requires the development of relevant marketing and business development strategies to target the different markets. What we serve and represent in Lebanon is somewhat different from what we do abroad. In Lebanon, we have gradually distanced ourselves from traditional Lebanese cuisine to become relatable to the new generation, developing new products and adapting traditional Lebanese food to international trends. We want to offer something new instead of competing with traditional Lebanese bakeries and restaurants. Innovation is one of the main factors of our success; however, our expansion outside of Lebanon is not reflective of the diaspora. We aim to target promising markets that have an interest in Lebanese food. Therefore, our strategy for these markets is to serve more traditional Lebanese food than what we do in Lebanon itself.</p><h4>What is the rationale behind opening the Canadian branch?</h4><p>The Canadian market is extremely different from the Middle East. We want to enter the market cautiously to understand the Canadian consumer. Canada will serve as a testing ground for a potential expansion in other Western markets. Based on internal market research, Canada will cover 70% of what western consumers will want. We decided to open first in Vancouver to test the ground for further expansion as it has the least Arabic population. While cities in the eastern half of Canada have a larger Lebanese diaspora, we want to ensure our franchise model also works in the absence of an Arab population. We need to guarantee the franchise will work everywhere and not only for a specific group. We have had extensive discussions with several European and North American partners, and they were extremely excited by our Vancouver plans. Following the growing demand for Lebanese and ethnic cuisines in North America, I am confident we have enough grounds to establish ourselves as a modern Lebanese brand. Another component of our strategy that we will need to adapt is the speed of service. We will be located in downtown Vancouver, where there are many corporate offices, university students, and tourists. It will be crucial to enhance the grab-and-go section for people who want to eat on the go; this is also likely to be the case in the center of most Western cities. Finally, a big part of our design for the Canadian model will be sourcing local zero-kilometers raw materials. While this is often not possible in the Gulf, in Lebanon we try where possible to support local production and limit our contribution to pollution generated by transportation. Low carbon footprint food will be even more of our focus in Canada, where the government openly supports local businesses to practice this trend. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights for the brand? How is the company going to celebrate its 20th anniversary? </h4><p>The fact that we are celebrating our 20th year in Lebanon is probably our most meaningful highlight. Restaurant life cycles are becoming shorter than ever, as consumers are more demanding and have more options to choose from. We believe that it is a strong recognition of quality of product and service for Chili's to have been serving guests for two decades now. The most rewarding highlight is to see passionate guests who used to come as kids 15 or 20 years ago visit Chili's regularly with their own kids. We feel that we have grown together with our guests and this builds an invaluable bond between them and the brand. We serve over 100,000 meals per year, and the majority of those are regular guests. As for our 20 years celebration, we are currently preparing several marketing activities that will be launched after the summer, and we intend to place the guest at the heart of this initiative. </p><h4>Can you guide through the brand's history and global expansion strategy?  </h4><p>The Chili's brand started in 1975 in Dallas, as a casual diner boasting a fun and laid-back atmosphere, serving mainly hamburgers and ribs. The success was immediate, and the philosophy that drives the brand remains the same today. Chili's counts more than 1,500 locations worldwide, with more than 100 in the Middle East. The expansion strategy starts by identifying the right partners in every market, in order to replicate the model while continuously adapting to the specifics of the local market. </p><h4>What are the strong points of your offering? </h4><p>Consistency has been our top priority from day one, as we believe it is the key to success in the hospitality sector. We have never compromised on the quality of our products and service and strive to provide the very best dining experience to our guests. We have also always focused on innovation, which is a game changer in building loyalty throughout the years. While we have never shifted our focus from our core categories (fajitas, burgers, ribs, and margaritas), it is important to understand the evolution in market needs and consumer expectations. Guests need to regularly experience culinary innovation, and we do this through our quarterly limited time offers (LTOs), that allow us to test new ideas, new recipes, and new ways of presenting some products. Finally, we believe that our team members are also a key part of our offering. It is worth noting that most of the team members have been with us for more than 10 years, with several team members being around since the opening. We firmly believe in employee training, retention, and evolution.   </p><h4>What impact has economic hardship had on the restaurant sector in Lebanon? How has Chili's adapted its strategy to face these challenges? </h4><p>There is no doubt that Lebanon has been facing a severe economic crisis for several years now, which has significantly impacted purchasing power. People tend to go out less than they did before, and disposable income has undeniably decreased. This means that consumers are looking for the best value for money in everything they purchase. The result is a constant pressure on prices, while costs are still on the rise, and I think this contradiction has forced some restaurants to compromise on the quality of their offering. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about Raouché Arjaan's presence in Beirut?</h4><p>Rotana is a fast-growing chain that operates 65 hotels in 23 cities across 12 countries with a pipeline of 10 hotels to open before the end of 2020; it is one of the leading hotel management companies in the region with hotels across the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Turkey. Raouché Arjaan by Rotana opened its doors in October 2009 and this year marks its special 10-year anniversary in Beirut. The hotel has 175 elegant and spacious rooms and suites, most of which look out onto to the Mediterranean Sea and Pigeon rocks, equipped with kitchenette facilities and a uniquely personalized service.</p><h4>What are the strengths and special features of Raouché Arjaan by Rotana?</h4><p>Apart from our stunning rooms and suites, our hotel's location is convenient and makes us the best choice for all types of travelers. The hotel's hidden gem, the Aquarius pool bar and terrace on the 17th floor, is the place to be during sunset and the number one choice for private functions. </p><h4>What is your outlook on the tourism sector?</h4><p>Many new hotels have opened during the past few years, with a new uprising trend of Lebanese guesthouses that have created a uniquely traditional and authentic journey. This has given the country a different edge, mostly for those wanting to experience the city and the villages during the same trip. We are confident that with such stability, the business and market will grow further, allowing other chains or stand-alone hotels to open. The first quarter was extremely good, the summer outlook and forecast is comparable and for the remainder of 2019 indicators show that the situation will remain good. Overall for the tourism sector and the Lebanese economy this will be promising. </p>]]></richbody0content>

In all this time, Le Gabriel has become one of the leading luxury hotels in Beirut, and we strive every day to keep exceeding guest expectations. There are several attributes that allow the Sofitel Beirut to stand out: The first is the property itself, exceptionally located in Achrafieh's Carré d'Or and featuring interiors of high standards that were recently fully renovated. The hotel is also well known for its personalized service, thanks to professional and dedicated team members across all departments. In fact, most of the hotel's personnel has been here for over 10 years, some more than 20. In hospitality, this makes a significant difference, as they have acquired through the years an invaluable knowledge of our loyal clientele, and they truly manage to make guests feel at home. Although part of the Accor Group—one of the world's largest hotel operators—we have managed to maintain a certain “boutique" feel to Le Gabriel, which is a key differentiator in our market. Last but not least, the hotel stands out for its robust food and beverage offering, whether La Verrií¨re restaurant or the banquets. The recent partnership with renowned Chef Nicolas Audi has very much contributed to raising the bar and making Le Gabriel a food and beverage destination in Achrafieh.</p><h4>What is the rationale behind the “Live the French Way" global campaign of Sofitel?</h4><p>“Live the French Way" is more than just a marketing campaign; it in fact lies at the heart of Sofitel's DNA. Sofitel has always been an ambassador of French style, know-how, and art-de-vivre across the world, and “Live the French Way" pays homage to the brand's origin and reinforces the brand's position as a global leader in luxury hospitality. This new campaign is particularly relevant for us in Beirut, as we Lebanese carry an important French heritage.</p><h4>In 2019, Sofitel Beirut announced its partnership with famous chef/caterer Nicolas Audi. How will the partnership enrich your offering? </h4><p>The partnership between Le Gabriel and Nicolas Audi Catering is an important milestone for both entities, and we share great ambitions for this joint endeavor. For luxury hotels, partnering with renowned chefs is a common practice, particularly for a luxury brand like Sofitel, which places food and beverage at the heart of its value proposition. For example, Sofitel has successfully collaborated with Christian Constant at Sofitel Paris Arc de Triomphe and Yannick Aleno at Sofitel Le Faubourg. Partnering with Nicolas Audi Catering was not simply about joining forces with an exceptional chef or revamping our menus. It is a strategic partnership that spans across the entire value chain of our F&amp;B department. Thus, we have chosen a long-term partner with whom we share extremely strong values of tradition, hard work, and the sole objective of continuously offering an exceptional guest experience. The idea behind the partnership is to take the hotel's F&amp;B offerings to the next level, covering restaurant, banquet, and private functions, as well as the pastry retail shop. La Verrií¨re restaurant and terrace is an exceptional venue in the heart of Achrafieh, and its new menu is aimed at being an everyday brasserie and not a classic fine dining restaurant. The bill comes out to about USD40 on average per person, which is in line with the new identity and target market. Nicolas Audi managed to create a delightful menu that will appeal to the hotel's clientele, travelers, and locals alike. The restaurant can seat up to 40 persons outdoors and 70 indoors. The restaurant will host several F&amp;B public events throughout the year such as wine tastings/pairings, themed buffets, gastronomic menus, and more. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is Mexico within the company's international business strategy?</h4><p>Halliburton has had a strong presence in Mexico for over 70 years. The company expanded its presence in Mexico through its business lines and technology offerings for onshore and offshore projects. Offshore projects currently account for 80 percent of the country's production which translates to a high demand for Halliburton's products and services. Moreover, exploration is another key activity in the country and we work closely with operators to locate new reserves and produce them economically.  Remarkably, Halliburton has participated in all the inland exploration and development programs with a major operator to help the company drive greater returns and maximize their asset value.</p><h4>How are you helping companies reduce their cost per barrel?</h4><p>From the drilling side, we deliver the latest technologies to the rig site which helped reduce the number of days by 30-40 percent. Our expertise allows Halliburton to reduce costs and drilling time in onshore and offshore projects. One example is providing new stimulation vessels to Mexico that will help operators produce wells earlier to save valuable time. Additionally, our services help new companies entering the country accelerate their investment and start-up projects, particularly for exploration wells.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the change of Director General at Pemex and how are you adapting?</h4><p>Halliburton has worked around the globe with different national oil companies, so we understand the responsibility and changes that those companies go through when there is a governmental transition. We will continue to work with the new administration as we have with previous administrations and maintain strong relationships from the top management to the workers in the field. Halliburton will continue to align our business with our customers' challenges and collaborate to deliver the right solutions.</p><h4>How was the company able to return to profitability in 2017 before all other service companies?</h4><p>The improving prices in combination with our higher levels of efficiency allowed us to grow positively. The industry suffered from the impact of low pricing and we worked hard to reduce costs to soften the blow. We developed several global continuous improvement initiatives to increase efficiency and drive cost savings in our daily business.  We also brought new ideas and technologies to customers that helped them optimize previously drilled wells and boost production in existing assets. The last four years have been challenging; however, they have given us the opportunity to review our execution and how we work with customers. These initiatives throughout the organization were responsible for limiting expenses, recalibrating our focus on efficiency and demonstrating our commitment to operators and their particular challenges.  </p><h4>What is your outlook for exploration demand in the coming years in the Mexican oil industry?</h4><p>Halliburton views the Mexican market favorably and sees a tremendous commitment from the international oil companies (IOCs) and other operators across the E&amp;P landscape.  Big players such as integrated majors are continuously investing in the country and starting their exploration projects. One of the significant challenges in the region is reservoir recovery which is driving greater investment into exploration to increase declining reserves. We are aware that these projects will play a key role in operations for the next four to five years. Moreover, these projects will demand high levels of technology and we are prepared to offer these services.</p><h4>How do you strive to keep expanding Halliburton's presence in Mexico in the coming years?</h4><p>We are well established in Mexico and plan to expand by further understanding the unique challenges of the country and opportunities they provide for service companies. The company plans to reactivate its presence in deep-water projects and onshore expansion in northern Mexico. We also see opportunities in helping the country expand its gas production as there are many important reserves to participate in. We have a large portfolio of service providers and national companies that collaborate with us to make sure that new projects continue to be developed. In terms of employment, we incorporate local talent in the company and almost 97 percent of our staff are Mexican. Halliburton will continue to support the local economy and have a large number of Mexican professionals working internationally. It is important for the talent to grow not only in Mexico, but outside the country as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Schlumberger's vision in the Mexican oil industry, and how does the company intend to contribute to the development of the sector?</h4><p>Schlumberger has been active in Mexico for 82 years; we are an integral part of the country's oil and gas history. The company has brought new technologies and processes while employing and training local talent. As a player in Mexico's oil industry since the beginning, we have a substantial understanding of the area, both on the surface and in the subsurface. In the context of the fourth industrial revolution, Schlumberger´s vision is to help the Mexican oil and gas industry to smoothly transition into a more efficient era, in which specialists spend more time making decisions concerning meaningful tasks, rather than performing repetitive activities that could easily be automated. This in turn translates to greater profitability, with better risk management over the E&amp;P value chain giving more certainty with decision making processes derived from big data and AI.</p><h4>How is the company further innovating and expanding its services in Mexico?</h4><p>We have executed the largest multiclient seismic project in the world using the latest technologies for both seismic acquisition and imaging tailored to address the geological and geophysical challenges in the Campeche basin. Our multiclient library is available for licensing to any company interested in investing in the country. This data coupled with specific studies has helped companies make informed decisions and has driven some of the largest investment of foreign companies in Mexico. We have expanded our infrastructure. Recently, we opened a state-of-the-art facility in Villahermosa, where we can maintain our entire technology portfolio and run most of our land, shallow-water, and deepwater operations. This is just one of our many facilities in Mexico. Our presence is also well established in Ciudad del Carmen, Veracruz, Poza Rica, and Reynosa, and we have satellite facilities in Dos Bocas and Tampico. With our network of facilities, we are able to support any upstream activity.</p><h4>What opportunities have you identified when it comes to deepwater projects in the country?</h4><p>We are the industry leader in deepwater projects around the world, with a significant presence in deepwater projects in Mexico. We have participated in the largest number of deepwater wells in the country, and such projects demand advanced technologies and expertise, which is where our strength lies. For instance, we have introduced technologies such as SonicScope multipole sonic-while-drilling service to mitigate risks in exploration environments, Quanta Geo photorealistic reservoir geology service which redefines imaging in oil-base mud (OBM) to profice highly detailed images, Litho Scanner high-definition spectroscopy service, and CLEANCUT cuttings collection and transportation system, to name a few. Deepwater projects also require extensive integration of technology, processes, workflow management, and training of personnel to run the highly complex operations.</p><h4>How is the fourth industrial revolution marking the beginning of a new digital era in the oil industry?</h4><p>In different forums and gatherings, one often hears buzzwords such as big data, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing (HPC).  In Schlumberger, we started defining our digital strategies at the beginning of the decade. We decided we would not merely make use of new emerging technologies such as big data and cloud computing; instead, we started developing new solutions combining our vast experience in software, E&amp;P workflows, and hardware, as enhanced by new cognitive and artificial intelligence capabilities. All of this is available in our new DELFI E&amp;P environment, which we launched in 2017 at our SIS Global Forum. The industry realizes that randomly adopting any technology that emerges, for instance, cloud computing or big data, ends up with an unbalanced workflow. You need to start from the beginning and think about what these technologies could enable you to do. Then you develop the digital solutions to suit your needs. The digital revolution will lead to a leap in efficiency in the oil and gas industry. The future is in the technology, and we are well positioned in terms of our software solutions, enabled with high-end technologies such as cloud and HPC. In our design philosophy, we have a system approach, which means we do not look at designing different elements in isolation; we look at the entire system. This approach enables us to have systems that are fully aligned with the digital revolution.</p><h4>What are the biggest opportunities to make the oil industry in Mexico more efficient?</h4><p>Advancements in the digitalization of the oil and gas industry in Mexico are important. Pemex has been a leader in this front, contributing to the efficiency of the industry and adding significant value to operations in the country. When talking about opportunities, we must go back to the basic drivers and strategies of the country's energy industry—i.e., increasing production, increasing the volume of research in the sector, and improving our knowledge of the subsurface. Our technologies have put us in a great position to achieve this. Our people have a vast knowledge of the oil and gas reservoirs in Mexico, which is a great opportunity for us and our customers moving forward.</p><h4>Which of your solutions are in highest demand in Mexico, and why are they more popular?</h4><p>Our portfolio consists of three main areas: drilling, production, and reservoir characterization. Drilling services currently have the highest demand due to the current business environment, and the production services come next, as there is currently a big drive in the country to increase production. However, reservoir characterization services are also important, and our multiclient seismic services program and digital transformation services fall into this category.</p><h4>What are the company's strategies to expand its presence in Mexico?</h4><p>We have been here for over 80 years. We are committed to the oil and gas industry in Mexico and to the country itself. Our plan is to continue on the path of growth and development. More importantly, we want to continue the localization of advanced technologies and development of our human resources in a sustainable way. We contribute to the local communities wherever we work and operate. For instance, we recently celebrated the 20-year anniversary of our Schlumberger Excellence in Education Development (SEED) program initiative. SEED is a hands-on program that relies on the scientific and technological expertise of our employee volunteers and focuses on STEM topics through camps, teacher professional development, workshops, and classroom visits. This past year we hosted workshops for students ranging from ages 8 to 18 years old in Tabasco, Campeche, and Veracruz. In addition, we sponsored student teams selected from the eight SEED schools in Mexico to participate in both the national and international robotics tournaments, as well as donating robotics materials to schools that excel in science and technology initiatives. We will continue to work in our community and maintain our commitment to environmental stewardship, because being socially responsible is essential to maintaining the growth of a company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about Le Gray's history and some of its biggest accomplishments?</h4><p>Le Gray opened in November 2009 and soon became the flagship of Campbell Gray Hotels in the Middle East. The hotel is a benchmark for modern, understated luxury. Its attention to detail and dedicated and passionate team have earned it several accolades in the past two years alone. Since our opening in 2009, we have followed a strategy of diversification of clientele, achieving the highest occupancy rate in the STR report. Le Gray Beirut was listed by TripAdvisor among the 25-best hotels in the Middle East in 2018 after having been number one in Lebanon since early 2016, in addition to also winning the Expert Choice Award 2018. We were also nominated among the top-five in the Middle East by the prestigious Prix Villégiature in 2018. Our latest achievement was being voted Lebanon's Leading Luxury Hotel by the World Travel Awards in April 2019.</p><h4>What makes your hotel stand out the most?</h4><p>Le Gray is a concept with its own definition of luxury that takes inspiration from an understated understanding of luxury. The guest who comes to Le Gray comes to live an experience; he does not just come to sleep or eat. Le Gray's guests are loyal and come for the small attentions that await them, from the individual service that recognizes every guest's preferences to the friendly and homey atmosphere that awaits them in the cozy interior surrounded by genuine art. Our success as a boutique hotel since opening also highlighted a shortfall in conference and banqueting capacity. As such, the decision was taken to expand the hotel in 2015. Today, Le Gray has a new entrance with two accesses, one for arrival by car and another for pedestrians arriving from Weygand Street. A lobby lounge now stands in the heart of the hotel, a must for a luxury hotel, and our room inventory has increased by 16 new rooms and suites to reach a total of 103 units. </p><h4>What is your target market?</h4><p>As tourism arrivals declined, we implemented a strategy targeting business visitors to maintain a good occupancy rate. The situation has improved and at present 60% of our guests are business visitors and 40% are leisure visitors. With the return of tourism, we aim to achieve an equal rate of 50% per segment. To get into the details of the profiles and nationalities, 46% of our guests come from outside the region, principally Europe and North America, while 45% come from the Middle East and North Africa. To boost both numbers, we are participating with the Lebanese Tourism Ministry in major tourism exhibitions held in our target markets, while our sales team makes individual sales trips.</p><h4>Have you observed any major changes in tourist arrivals in recent years?</h4><p>We are witnessing interest in Lebanon from new markets. For example, the new route of SAS airlines encouraged tourists from Scandinavian countries to come to Lebanon. What's more, direct flights to Madrid not only facilitated travel from Madrid itself, but also brought many more Latin American visitors. To be sure, these include tourists and the Lebanese diaspora. Our expectations for summer 2019 and the year in general are very high, both of which have been fully bolstered by our first quarter results and the general prevailing atmosphere. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2018 for Patchi in terms of performance?</h4><p>2018 was a successful year; we saw an uptick in the number of clients compared to previous years. The reason is because Patchi remains consistent in terms of taste and quality, and we were able to attract new customers. The difficult economic crisis impacted customers' purchasing power; however, Patchi, being an extremely powerful brand in the Middle East, with 82 outlets in Saudi Arabia and 34 boutiques in the UAE, was able to maintain its size and growth. There were many developments within the brand in 2018. First, we opened a new concept that would take the brand from being a destination for chocolate gifts to being the home of the finest chocolate. In 2018, Patchi expanded its business to F&amp;B, namely desserts. The new retail concept introduces an unwrapped chocolate line, chocolate blocks, and a list of macarons. In addition to all the desserts created at Patchi kitchens, with our secret recipes, the F&amp;B arm also offers a list of sorbets, hot chocolate drinks, fondues, granitas, and a list of teas and fresh mocktails. Our top selling item is the Cabosse dessert. The concept—just like any other creation—was launched in Beirut to be rolled out in the GCC by 2019, starting with Saudi Arabia and then the UAE. We also expanded within existing countries without the need to tackle new ones, such as Morocco, Oman, and others. There is development on the retail level in all the countries where we previously opened our outlets. 2018 was a successful year, and in addition to new clients and our new concept, we paved the way for a great 2019 with other projects in store for Patchi.</p><h4>Where do you stand on fair trade and the environmental issues caused by such production?</h4><p>Such trade is delicate and subject to extreme fluctuations. The prices of cocoa mass or butter have doubled. I always buy a year ahead and acquire my ingredients in a way that respects the source and provides Patchi with enough raw materials for the longest time possible. There are no environmental issues when it comes to our production, which is far away from residential areas, and we produce the best quality without causing any leakage or impact. We even have environmental officers who keep a watchful eye over our production to prevent any mishaps. Moreover, 2018 witnessed the kickoff of works on our largest production facility in the Middle East, in the UAE. It will be located within the industrial zone and will cover 111,000sqm. It will be in line with all of Dubai's rules and regulations, including on green energy, solar systems, and so on. We decided to relocate there because of such regulations and are due to open by 3Q2019.</p><h4>Do you plan on expanding into other items?</h4><p>Our expansion will be in all things related to and go well with chocolate. Trends are changing, and if at some point coffee becomes the perfect companion to chocolate, then we might branch out. Patchi is a proactive brand and keeps an eye on trends and changing market needs. Depending on demand, we may adapt as long as it is aligned with the business core, namely chocolate. We will go with the flow, which is a must in order to be future-proof.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>We are extremely content with our model, namely being a chocolate manufacturer and retailer that only sells its products at its own boutiques. Thanks to our business model, strategy, and the team behind the business, Patchi owns today a network of more than 200 boutiques spread across several countries around the globe. We have online stores for key markets such as the US, UK, Canada, and Lebanon. We have been one of the top-three chocolate brands at Harrods London for three years in a row and have opened a pop-up store at the Twelve Oaks Mall in Michigan. We are a family business that operates similarly to multinationals, with a centralized office that caters to the entire brand and business demands, be they owned or franchised. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Among your complete offering, which programs stand out?</h4><p>We have a wide range of programs covering all fields of business development and management, including the traditional bachelor's program in business administration and the MBA program, which attract students from all corners of the world. These programs give our students a good international positioning to move onto important international institutions of education. We have also developed innovative programs that respond to regional and global needs, such as a master's in human resource management, finance, and business analytics. These programs address important changes in society, such as AI and data analytics, ensuring that the business school remains up to date with global trends. On top of this, through the Darwazah Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, OSB is actively committed to supporting the entrepreneur and start-up ecosystem in Lebanon in addition to participating in numerous committees, initiatives, and efforts. We work directly with organizations and start-ups to help them develop entrepreneurial means, progress, and scale up. </p><h4>How international is OSB?</h4><p>We provide a global business education with sensitivity to local issues. Our focus is truly global. Although based in Lebanon, our goal is to train and prepare business leaders with a global perspective. We expose students to a variety of global, regional, and local knowledge. This includes the faculty personnel teaching the programs, with considerable international exposure and prime research skills. We have a high number of international teaching staff, at around 20-25%, from over a dozen countries. The teaching staff is complemented by top practitioners and industry executives in Lebanon, who share their knowledge and experience with the students. Thanks to the quality of our offering, we are ranked as the top business school in the region. This is also partly due to the reputation of the American University of Beirut, an institute of excellence with a globally-established reputation. We attract a large number of students from all corners of the region and beyond. About 20% of our students come from beyond Lebanon, the main region of origin being the Middle East and North Africa. Yet, we are seeing a larger number of students applying from Europe and the US, and we are increasingly focused on international recruitment</p><h4>How have you integrated technology into the curriculum?</h4><p>We have integrated it into all our courses. Professors are using the provided online or technological capacity to flip the classroom, facilitating access to information and allowing students to explore topics of interest more in-depth, beyond the traditional lecture model. Through blended or hybrid learning models we are witnessing an enriching combination between traditional and online learning. This enables the learner to spend more time developing by him or herself at a comfortable pace, freeing up the classroom time for people to debate, engage, and integrate different points of view rather than just absorbing knowledge.</p><h4>What does Beirut offer to prospective students?</h4><p>First, Beirut is the capital of leisure and fun in the Middle East, with a renowned intellectual, social life, rich history, hidden charm, and a very welcoming population. Moreover, Beirut is a true melting pot, offering a comprehensive perspective on the Middle East to any student coming from outside the region, while at the same time retaining a lifestyle in tune with Western standards. In Beirut, you can find parts of every nation in the Middle East, from the Levant to the Gulf, Iran, and the Maghreb, discussing different views in one democratic nation.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>While approaching our 25th anniversary in 2025, we are working on a new medium-term strategic plan, with the ambitious goal of placing ourselves among the top business schools in the world. Some of our programs, for example our Executive MBA program, are already present among some of the global rankings for business school programs, and we intend to strengthen our international positioning. The plan will be articulated along a series of goals based on the number 25 or multiples of 25, but it is still too early to disclose precise information. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is LAU innovating and approaching the era of digitalization?</h4><p>We live in a globalized world fueled by breathtaking technological advances. The fourth industrial revolution, robotics, and nano-technologies, are all part of the information age. The walls of separation between disciplines need to be brought down. The only constant in this world is change, which is growing exponentially. For LAU, this means that the previously followed academic model is now broken. The board came up with a series of strategic recommendations. We strengthened the intellectual and academic capital of the institution, adding 100 new members. We also intend to turn LAU into an excellent innovation institution, investing in academic and entrepreneurial discoveries. Academically, we are addressing curriculum content and teaching modes of delivery, integrating technology, the machine, and the human element. We need to use the instruments of education to promote students who specialize in a variety of disciplines. These include critical thinking, intellectual flexibility, and adaptability, the ability to communicate, live in a diverse environment, work as a team, and write. Students need to develop flexible minds to adapt in the future job market. We also want to make the university more accessible. There are different ways of bringing the campus to learners, either virtually or physically. This will include expanding beyond Lebanon. We will be targeting the Lebanese diaspora, as well as exploring a number of opportunities in the Gulf region. Moreover, we need to address the pedagogical approach to education. We are calling to bring down the walls of separation between specializations in order to have an interface between schools and academic programs. We are excited to already have in place plans in the academic and applied sciences fields. We have the School of Medicine working with the School of Engineering, for example. We are also adding our MBA program to this relationship, encouraging doctors to also have an MBA. Lebanon is famous for its openness and diversity,  welcoming elements from French, Lebanese, American, British, and even Canadian influences. This diversity has made Lebanon a shining example in higher education. Since the region has been facing some serious challenges, the university, with the mission to serve others, has raised funding to help students continue their education. In 2019, we are giving USD35 million in financial aid and scholarships. With a new cabinet in place, we have high hopes for more money to enter Lebanon. We need money on the street. </p><h4>How do you see Lebanon in the potential for innovation and entrepreneurship?</h4><p>In the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, you do not need to move somewhere to be successful. The public sector should be open for innovation, given the openness that we have, with Lebanon's diversity, liberal viewpoints, and its dynamic private sector. They should all be welcoming investment to the country. While our formidable governor of the Central Bank has been stabilizing the monetary policy of the country, still, he cannot continue to do this alone. Outside investment is essential. </p><h4>What is the breakdown of your student population?</h4><p>By design, we need around 20% of our student body to be international. We believe that is the true meaning of the term “university." Taking into account regional situations and economic crises, the fact that international students comprise 14% of our scholars is a remarkable number. We have positive expectations for the future. We welcome students from any and all backgrounds, as long as they come to learn. In partnership with USAID, we support the Universtity Scholarship program which selected about 540 students from public schools, so they can get an education here. We are proud of this approach because, in our judgment, it is the best way to serve our community, Lebanon, the region, and beyond. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major highlights for GlobeMed Lebanon?</h4><p>In 1991, GlobeMed started its operations in Lebanon as a third-party administrator (TPA). We were the first TPA in the country. Throughout the past 28 years, GlobeMed was all about improving healthcare services for the benefit of the insured across the region, revolutionizing the industry with the same visionary approach that has helped us become the best at what we do. Our business has evolved from a traditional claims processing model to a “managedcare" strategy helping individuals to lead healthy lifestyles and assisting patients with chronic disease to better monitor their condition. GlobeMed helped insurance companies to develop the Perpetual Plan in 1995, one of the first insurance products that people could acquire for a lifetime, a true milestone in the health insurance sector. In 1999, GlobeMed launched the first online portal for healthcare providers to process claims and create what is known today as the electronic claims system, a pioneering step that was followed with many other achievements that shaped our journey and redefined the standards of managing healthcare insurance in Lebanon. In acknowledgement of the group's excellence and professionalism, the sector's specialists had honored GlobeMed with the prestigious Medical Administrator award at the World Health Tourism Congress in 2014, the TPA of the Year by the Middle East Insurance in 2015, the best TBA at the MENA IR Insurance Awards in 2017, and Claims Management Services Provider at the MENA IR Insurance Awards in early 2018. These tributes challenge us to further excel and innovate.</p><h4>Which sectors do you cover, and how do you intend to expand?</h4><p>The company continues to expand and grow; at present, we proudly serve 35 clients, both in the private and public sectors through a diversified portfolio of insurance companies, and selffunded and social health insurance schemes. We have successfully expanded our insurance portfolio to more than 270,000 members in 2019. Among our new customers who benefit from our services and solutions is Cigna International Health Services Company. GlobeMed Lebanon was selected once again to manage the healthcare services of Electricité du Liban's (EDL) Beirut employees and their families as well as our cooperation with the Beirut Bar Association. Another great achievement is our partnership with the Children Cancer Center in Lebanon, which will help the center regulate the treatment costs for children, enabling them to better manage funds to treat as many ill children as possible. GlobeMed Lebanon has successful experiences serving different sectors whether private or public, local or multinational, such as serving UNHCR for Syrian refugees in 20142015 and serving the Ministry of Health across Lebanon as part of the audit and health and hospitalization claims in 2017-2018.</p><h4>What are the main trends and challenges in Lebanese healthcare, and how does GlobeMed tackle these issues?</h4><p>Healthcare and healthcare delivery are excellent sectors in Lebanon. We have excellent facilities and personnel, providing patients the best quality of care and making use of the latest technologies and medications. The problem we face is the cost of healthcare versus what people can afford. GlobeMed Lebanon has come a long way in managing healthcare benefits, both in Lebanon and the region, where we have succeeded in providing services and solutions that satisfy the needs of our clients. GlobeMed has continuously worked to find ways to address these challenges and push the healthcare sector. Additionally, to expand our coverage, we are moving toward wellness and prevention to reduce costs, and improve the quality of life and customer experience. This is a key element, given that the insurance market is getting increasingly saturated, and the private healthcare industry is heading into a fierce competition. We are witnessing a remarkable growth in mutual funds, which used to cover a small share of the insured population. As a result, investment in health prevention is key and is in line with our commitment to the global wellness trends shaping the health industry today, as consumers seek to ensure healthy lives for as long as possible. We are shifting toward preventive healthcare rather than disease management, which requires us to grow our health coverage benefits to encompass preventive health tests and programs.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>GlobeMed Lebanon has launched an innovative solution that not only helps clients adopt a healthier lifestyle but is also a valuable selfservice tool that allows clients to manage all matters and details related to their insurance coverage. Called GlobeMed Fit, the app can be used by existing GlobeMed clients and all Lebanese. The app combines four sections within one control panel: fitness, nutrition, health, and insurance. It is well suited to the Lebanese public, taking into account their dietary habits. It also includes a section on health that allows users to record tests and examinations, while reminding them of times and dates they will need to take their medication as well as managing their insurance benefits. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your expectations for the hospitality sector in 2019?</h4><p>I have positive expectations for the rest of the year; the first quarter was promising, and we are confident it will continue this way. We were fortunate to start 2019 by hosting the Arab Economic Summit; Lebanon is increasingly becoming a MICE destination and hosting regional congresses and conferences. Talking about the leisure segment, we are seeing a “back to the roots" type of tourism with greater demand from tourists from the Latin American market, particularly from Brazil, coming to discover their roots and heritage. We are also witnessing a high demand from the GCC, mainly from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait and expect to maintain this continuous growth, especially in summer and until the end of the year. Finally, with the support of new direct flights, we are seeing a rise in the number of tourists from the European market such as Spain and the Netherlands. Lebanon has so much to offer that it has something for everyone. One of the prime draws is always the rich heritage of the country, but it has been also seen as a lively culinary and wine destination, as well as a creative art hub with a vibrant nightlife.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about Phoenicia Hotel's long-standing history? </h4><p>Built in 1961, Phoenicia Beirut became the first InterContinental Hotel in the Middle East. Since then and following the re-opening in March 2000, Phoenicia has always welcomed guests with the epitome of hospitality gaining its position as the region's flagship hotel. In 2011, the hotel celebrated its 50th anniversary with interior enhancements by internationally renowned designers. In the last few years, the hotel has hosted high-ranking diplomatic delegations, particularly in the period following the presidential elections. And we are proud to have recently won Lebanon's Leading Business Hotel at the World Travel Awards as well as Best Business Hotel in Beirut at the Business Traveler Middle East Awards 2019. </p><h4>Can you give us an overview of the hotel's offerings and coming goals?</h4><p>Between the Phoenician, Roman, and Residence towers, guests have the choice of 480 rooms and suites that can suit every taste. For InterContinental Club members, the Phoenicia Club, located in the Phoenician tower, is designed to meet every business or leisure requirement that may arise, ensuring a personalized treatment all throughout. We also offer an array of dining options including a wealth of world cuisine at Mosaic Restaurant's decadent buffet, international bites at Cascade Lobby Lounge, or at Amethyste, our outdoor pool lounge, as well as fresh Italian cuisine at the recently opened Rossini Osteria e Caffí¨. We proudly consider ourselves a business hotel hosting various international conferences and exhibitions. Our 11 meeting rooms and grand ballroom are equipped with the latest technology and can fit 20 to 2,000 people depending on the group size. We also offer Eau De Vie as a private event space bespoke for meetings and gatherings, set against Beirut's most stunning sea views. And, finally, to enhance guests' experience, SPA Phoenicia offers tailored treatments, from holistic massages to healing therapies. And finally, for the coming year, we are still working on promoting Lebanon as a MICE destination and focusing on weddings. The hotel is traditionally known for its royal and lavish weddings so we continue to concentrate our efforts in this segment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you weather the crisis in the real estate sector? </h4><p>Our key project at the moment is District//S in downtown Beirut. We made an investment in acquiring the land before 2010. Due to the crisis, we had to adapt the project. We had the choice to either reduce prices or bet on something different. Agility and flexibility are the key lessons every Lebanese businessman has had to learn. In our case, this forced us to develop some distinguishing features that would set us apart from competitors. First, we believe in sustainability. We are trying to create awareness that investments in renewables will benefit not only the environment, but also they produce savings in the long run, as they cut consumers' bills for maintenance, electricity, water, and air conditioning. Betting on sustainability and technology offers something unique in the Lebanese real estate landscape. Besides sustainability, we also invested in technology, in terms of home automation and predictive maintenance. Thanks to AI, homes can now analyze and learn from inhabitants' routines and accommodate their preferences. We adapted our offer to the needs of the new working generations, who prefer access over ownership. Thus, we have provided our apartments with on-premise facilities such as meeting rooms, co-working spaces, and on-call services. This is what we call a “total solution," a one-stop destination. All in all, I see our efforts to incorporate sustainability and technology mirrored by larger segments of society, as awareness is spread through media and connectivity. Another key element of our project is to mix the local talent with international know-how. Regarding architecture, we chose a British architectural firm that had experience in building cities and included Lebanese architects to adapt it to our culture and perfect the design. In terms of AI, we similarly relied on a company based between France and San Francisco, the heartland of AI, while teaming up with Lebanese developers to enhance talents. As far as sales go, diversification is key. No developer can afford now to stick to one formula. Again, adaptability is key. During the last few years, sales have varied; at some points sales consisted only of few big apartments, while recently it has been more of small apartments. </p><h4>How would you define the construction style of the project? </h4><p>Lebanon is a great melting pot of styles and cultures, with a history that ties it to the French, Ottomans, Phoenicians, Romans, and others. After the civil war, Solidere did a great job rebuilding the city, trying to balance the mix of international experience with local traditions. This would also be the best way to define our own project, District //S. Our project has different building designs, as if you were looking at a family picture: there is a certain familiarity, but everyone is a bit different.</p><h4>Is the Lebanese diaspora an important target? </h4><p>Since the Lebanese market is small and the purchasing power of Lebanese is reduced at the moment, we are developing a special product for the diaspora, with access to international capital. Our target is young Lebanese living abroad. They need a place in Beirut that they can use for one to three months a year, which they do not want to be empty when they are away. We lease apartments like these for such clients. This includes a storage facility where clients can keep their things when they are not here. While they are away, they can use their apartment, fully serviced, for other people. This scheme is income-generating for the clients, and allows us to keep the space constantly occupied. We are also offering parking, shuttles, bicycles, and electric cars for people commuting to the city. We have an extra 700 parking spaces than what is needed by the project. </p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for the year to come?</h4><p>Our goals are reflected in our values. They are commitment to the environment, technology development, community-building, and enhancing local Lebanese talents. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Chí¢teau Musar wines special? </h4><p>We are not about profits, but quality. We have an almost philosophical approach to wine-making: we believe in the power of the number seven. That is how many years we leave our wines to age, to integrate all their tastes and tones. After fermentation, in the second year the Chí¢teau wine is put in wood, and then the third year in the glass bottle. It is then kept in the bottle for another four years before it is finished. </p><h4>What is the history of Chí¢teau Musar?</h4><p>Chí¢teau Musar is located in Ghazir, a coastal area where my family owned a castle that was previously home to the Prince Chehab family that later on ruled Lebanon. In 1930, we began to make wine from the grapes grown in our vineyards in the Bekaa Valley. In our first years, until the end of the French mandate (1945), we sold most of our wine to French officials. Major Ronald Barton, of Chí¢teau Langoa-Barton, stationed in Lebanon during World War II, became a great friend, strengthening the links between Chí¢teau Musar and Bordeaux. Those links remain to this day.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide an overview of the group's history?</h4><p>The group was established in 1936 by Gabriel Antaki. It was focused on photography at first, with some Japanese and German brands. During the 70s and mid-90s, one of the main pillars of the group was Maxell, a brand we carry an emotional attachment to. In the early 1990s, the company started diversifying into consumer electronics. In 2006, Farid Antaki took a different approach to the business and decided to focus on brands that invest heavily in R&amp;D, differentiation and have a unique connection with the customers such as Bose, Dyson, DJI Fujifilm, Razer, Yamaha, and others. </p><h4>What are the opportunities presented by the Lebanese market for tech companies?</h4><p>Currently, opportunities are almost nonexistent, and if made available the risk is too high. The market has been shrinking heavily for the past two years, and the consumer electronics sector took a hit. However, there are opportunities for start-up companies that are based in Lebanon and cater to the region or even Europe and the US. Some start-ups are being approached by regional VCs to invest and expand their reach.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has made Dubai so successful as a transportation and shipment hub?</h4><p>Dubai is known for its progressive infrastructure and logistics capabilities. Dubai recognizes trade as an enabler of growth for local and international businesses. They have made multiple resources available to make trade easy for all local and international organizations, such as the Jebel Ali Free Zone and many others. The free zones have enabled large multinationals to trade and operate out of their own warehouses with market leading transit times to anywhere in the world. One of the biggest markets in the region is Saudi Arabia, which is served easily through Dubai's advanced infrastructure such as the airports and ports. Fruitful partnerships across the public and private sectors are enhancing the confidence of regional and international investors and boosting competitiveness of the local maritime sector, which is promoted by the pillars of research and development, innovation, and smart transformation. Dubai has also been key for investors due to its geographical location along with its advancement in regulations and customs.</p><h4>Beyond Dubai's advantages, are there any gaps that need to be addressed?</h4><p>E-commerce has been a serious growth engine for the past couple of years worldwide, the region has just started catching up with the online trend. With that said, the e-commerce industry is booming and quickly catching up to Europe and the rest of the world. The e-commerce market in a mature market is around 15%, with Amazon buying Souq and Noon becoming an internationally known marketplace, the market in the region has grown in a short period of time to around 5%.</p><h4>How will Expo 2020 impact your operations?</h4><p>From a logistics point of view, Expo 2020 will have a significant and positive impact on the industry and its operations. This impact will be driven by the development activities and the deals that will take place during Expo 2020. The exhibition is expected to boost trade, logistics, and port operations across the UAE. The logistics industry will play a vital role to ensure that the business runs smoothly, which in return will increase the operations for the business. Expo will also showcase the country's geographic positioning and access to the world's fastest growing markets as well as DHL's capabilities and market leading transit times.</p><h4>What are DHL's latest advancements in technology and innovation?</h4><p>DHL is exploring how innovation in the logistics industry can support the future of transportation around the world and in the Middle East region. We have three innovation centers around the world in Germany, Singapore, and the US. We are looking at robotics, autonomous vehicles, and more. In robotics, DHL has tested Baxter and Sawyer, two smart and collaborative robots in its warehouses on co-packing and value-added tasks, such as assembly, kitting, packaging and pre-retail services. The advancement of technology in the logistics industry is driving the adoption of collaborative robots to improve efficiency in the supply chain. DHL is definitely ahead of technology. We have drones which we use in areas such as the rainforest or in areas difficult to access, sending medication. We are doing this in the Shetland Islands as well, where the sea is too rough. Technology certainly has a place, and in the Middle East, Dubai will be amongst the technological pioneers. Dubai is ahead of its time, and technology will drive positive change.</p><h4>How important is sustainability?</h4><p>Going green is one of our main priorities through working in a sustainable manner and ensuring our operations run in the most environmentally friendly way possible. Our contribution to greater sustainability around the world is green logistics. To realize a more sustainable future, we think it is important to think big. Our new climate protection target is to reduce all logistics-related emissions to zero by the year 2050. To help realize this target, we have established a number of ambitious interim goals across the main action areas of our sustainability strategy. The first is to increase our carbon efficiency by 50% compared to 2007 levels. Secondly, we are reducing local air pollution emissions by operating 70% of our own first and last mile services with clean pick-up and delivery solutions, such as bicycles and electric vehicles. Third, we are encouraging more than 50% of our customers to incorporate green solutions to amplify environmental sustainability across the supply chain. The fourth interim goal is to certify 80% of our employees as GoGreen specialists and get them involved in our environmental and climate protection activities. This includes joining partners to plant 1 million trees every year to protect our forests. Our mission is to connect people and improve their lives, which is why our environmental targets are broad in scope. Along with our climate protection measures, we work on reducing air pollution from local exhaust gases and particulate matter, as well traffic-related noise pollution. We also minimize our consumption of water and paper.</p><h4>How is DHL positioned within the transport and logistics landscape?</h4><p>DHL is the leading global brand in the logistics industry. Our DHL family of divisions offer an unrivaled portfolio of logistics services ranging from national and international parcel delivery and e-commerce shipping and fulfillment solutions to international express, road, air, and ocean transport and industrial supply chain management. DHL connects people and businesses securely and reliably, enabling global trade flows. With specialized solutions for growth markets and industries including technology, life sciences and healthcare, energy, automotive, and retail; a proven commitment to corporate responsibility; and an unrivaled presence in developing markets, DHL is decisively positioned as “the logistics company for the world.“ To meet the demands of over 1 million customers around the globe, DHL has over 4,000 offices in more than 220 countries and territories. They handle a total of 160 million shipments per year. DHL runs a fleet of more than 250 aircraft, operating 714 scheduled flights every day. Another 2,335 flights daily are operated for DHL by commercial aircraft. On the ground, almost 17,000 vehicles service a total of 120,000 destinations in all continents. We are conscious that we impact the environment and striving to have the greatest positive impact, environmentally, socially, and economically.</p><h4>What are your goals for the near future?</h4><p>The Middle East is the fastest growing region in the world, and this will be one of the most exciting and dynamic regions in the long term. We have invested heavily here and because, as a global company, want to keep the business growing. We are investing in Abu Dhabi at the moment, and building an airside service point, which will be equipped with new age technology. We want to be in everyone's community and make it easy for everyone to connect to their loved ones at all times. Our 2018 expansion of the 13,100-sqm facility located in the Cargo Terminal at DXB has a capacity to manage up to 5,000 shipments per hour making trade easier and allowing people to connect all around the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Diadora celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2018. How has the last decade been for the company?</h4><p>It has been challenging, but interesting as well. After I took over Diadora in 2009-2010, we were asked to participate in the relaunch of this historic brand. We took the challenge for three main reasons. First, the reason why the brand lost its popularity was not because of the brand itself but because of issues within the company. Second, we realized how much the brand meant for the region and for the history of sports and Italian craftsmanship, and I did not want all this know-how and authenticity to be lost. Third, on a more personal note, I wanted to have my own business experience with my own team without being viewed as the son of the owner. After 10 years of facing numerous challenges, the dream of bringing new life to the brand has been realized, and the results so far have been positive.</p><h4>In 2015, you embarked on a program to re-shore part of your production. What was the socio-economic impact of this strategy and what is the essence of the “Made in Italy“ brand for Diadora?</h4><p>The essence of “Made in Italy“ is what Diadora is as a brand. The brand and consumer environment have been changing rapidly and I firmly believe that a brand is not identified by a logo anymore, but rather by the brand value the stakeholders can identify with. People are not just looking for a product, they are looking for an experience. Diadora's values are authenticity, sports, and Italian craftsmanship. Focusing on the Italian aspect first, Diadora has for long been the preferred choice of sportspeople around the world. When we took the brand over, we identified this Italian style as a key differentiating factor. We have Italian design in all our products and we decided to invest in this brand value by re-shoring part of our production. Our re-shoring project's main success is that it is considered as coherent and quintessential as Diadora.</p><h4>Diadora exports its products to 68 countries. Part of your turnaround strategy was to focus on some key markets like the UK, US, Germany, and Japan. Where do you see the main opportunities to further increase your presence abroad?</h4><p>Going international was our choice; we were not forced into it. Since we took over, the Italian market has been growing at the same pace as foreign markets. The big surprise has been the response in the US market, which we entered in 2017. The results have been great because the brand's authentic Italian image and concept have been recognized by the US market. Surprisingly, our most successful product lines have been our super-technical running shoes. This segment is one of the toughest to break into in the US, but we were able to succeed due to Diadora's clear identity and brand differentiation.</p><h4>Diadora has been present in China since 2018 through Tmall's e-commerce platform. How are you working to improve Diadora's e-commerce offering?</h4><p>We are constantly working to improve our websites' experience through collaboration with buyers and companies. We launched our Tmall e-shop during an event hosted together with Roberto Baggio, a long-standing friend and supporter of Diadora and a sporting icon. He is also considered an icon in Veneto because he is from Vicenza, but also in other parts of the world, such as Asia. Thus, he was able to promote our brand value in China.</p><h4>Diadora is the perfect blend of tradition and innovation. How do you plan to apply this spirit of innovation moving forward?</h4><p>Sometimes we get the meaning of innovation wrong. We tend to identify innovation with products, rather than with processes or simply as a way to be. We have some innovative products, but Diadora is also very innovative in the way we are leading the company. The mean age in the company is 38 years and we run the company as millennials, from our working schedule to how we share our spare time and interact with each other.</p><h4>What are some of the latest technologies Diadora is implementing?</h4><p>The most important one is called Blueshield, which is present in running shoes. Our innovation team created it as the first technology to adapt to the foot rather than the other way around. Some people have pronation and others supination depending on whether they run with the internal or external part of the foot. Generally, in the market you find shoes that either correct your posture as a pronator or as a supinator. With our Blueshield technology, the innersole has an internal foam nucleus that adapts to and corrects your posture regardless of whether you are a pronator or supinator because the nucleus adapts to you.</p><h4>Diadora was awarded the EcoVadis Gold Medal in 2018. Can you elaborate on the company's sustainability efforts?</h4><p>We have an internal sustainability department and everyone has been working with them on various projects, starting from the energy efficiency of our headquarters. At present, half of our energy is supplied by renewables, specifically solar power. All of our supply-chain is evaluated by EcoVadis and we and other players are setting a good example by acquiring gold certification from them.</p><h4>How has Diadora's origins influenced the company's international profile and performance?</h4><p>It is a matter of being in a territory where there is a certain huge  know-how about our industry. At Diadora, we promote a sportswear environment that complements our international outlook on athletics.</p><h4>What is your view on the challenges and opportunities the sportswear sector offers?</h4><p>Competition is a challenge because we have to compete with other sportswear producers from other countries like the US and China. The other factor is that we have to compete or coexist with a consumer, business, and production environment that is rapidly changing. Under such circumstances, it's important for a company to stay true to its roots and leverage its strengths, especially in foreign markets, while maintaining a flexible mindset. We have to be able to resonate internationally, but we also have to remember that our background is our strength.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Diadora in the short term?</h4><p>We will go on investing in our brand values. We will continue to present our 71 years of history, while continuing to invest in new products and innovations with a fresh approach to the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Over USD94 Million Turnover]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[massimo-slaviero-ceo-unifarco]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Unifarco produces cosmetic, dermatological, “nutraceutical“ and make-up products, with branches in Germany and Spain, as well as a sales network in France, Austria, and Switzerland. What is Unifarco's added value?</h4><p>Unifarco distinguishes itself for consumers thanks to our partnerships with pharmacies. We began with the goal of giving pharmacies the opportunity to take the lead. We created Farmacisti Preparatori as an umbrella brand: the pharmacist does not just distribute the product, they also promote it. This has been a winning strategy, helping brands realize global ambitions.</p><h4>You closed 2018 with a turnover of EUR94 million. Your forecast for 2019 is a turnover of over EUR100 million. What factors contributed to this growth?</h4><p>Our consumer base is growing, but it has a “territorial exclusivity.“ In Italy, we will increase from around 2,600 pharmacies to 3,000. We have acquired clients in the countries where the system of pharmacies is similar to that of the Italian one. First we went to Austria, and then to Switzerland, Spain, Germany and France. They are family-run pharmacies. They appreciate our promotional model. We acquire about one client per day, but also our old clients keep on growing. That is why we have an increase in our average revenue. In addition to “Farmacisti Preparatori“ we also have other brands: Unifarco Biomedical, Dolomia, and we have recently acquired MyCli. We have a quite interesting portfolio cosmetics-wise. It starts from pure dermatology and gets to purely natural products. We sell these four brands through our “club“ of pharmacists, as I like to call it. In the past 15 years, we have opened to food supplements. The cosmetics sector grows by 1% every year. The market for supplements grows even more. It is still a product that is spread through pharmacies, but is also expanding outside of them as well. A company of our kind cannot avoid research, because you need to invest money, time, and energy to develop new products. We have started a company together with Padua University — UNIR&amp;D. This is another fundamental factor in our company's strategy. Research engages dermatologists, professors, and newly graduated students.</p><h4>Last year you invested 4.5%, around EUR 3.8 million in R&amp;D. What other investments in R&amp;D are you planning for the upcoming year and how do you use digital technology?</h4><p>We are using digital solutions, but not as much as we could. We are in contact with a few universities that are outside of Italy. We have built partnerships with doctors working in the anti-aging sector, because in Italy traditional science is not engaged in R&amp;D in our field. The same goes for the European-level. Research investments are still focused on healing illnesses, but our focus is taking care of the person so they can live a long and healthy life. Researchers in the anti-aging field are mostly in the US.</p><h4>You have implemented collaborations with over 30 labs worldwide, in addition to the universities you have mentioned. Why are these collaborations so important, and what are you planning in this regard for the near future?</h4><p>The most important thing is that we created an e-learning school, PHI. Lifestyle and food supplements, dermatology, and anti-aging cosmetics are now focused on the human microbiome.  The most advanced part of our research puts attention on this, but the traditional research at universities is not interested in this. These new areas of research are focused on the billions of bacteria leaving inside us. There are 1.5kg of bacteria living in the average human intestinal system. They are not enemies to be killed, as traditional medicine was saying. Instead, they have to be valued. Our skin is covered with bacteria and their health makes the difference when it comes to the look of our skin. We are focusing on the kinds of bacteria that deliver results for our clients' cosmetic goals.</p><h4>Another important topic for Unifarco is sustainability. You were the first company in the cosmetic sector to obtain the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) certification for your products. You also put a special attention to packaging when it comes to its environmental impact. Can you talk about the Life Cycle Thinking approach that you use?</h4><p>Our work in this field started a long time ago, when we got the ISO14000 certification. This imposes norms of good behavior regarding waste, water usage, risks for environment, but only within your country. The vision we embraced with EPD is a global one, because our home is the world. EPD is about how much energy it costs for the world to move materials and transport them. We produce our packaging locally. The costs for us are higher, but we pollute less. We have been carrying out research into biodegradable plastic, which is plant-based, although that may not be a viable solution. We have been trying here in Veneto to implement an initiative asking the consumer to bring back their plastic bottles to the pharmacy, so we can reuse them. This could be a good message we convey to consumers.</p><h4>Unifarco exports around 15% of its products, with the goal of getting to 35% in the medium-term and to reach 6,000 pharmacies. What are the strategies that need to be implemented in order to reach these goals?</h4><p>These strategies are our same as our oldest strategies, which center on taking care of our partners. Taking care of others is important throughout the whole value chain. The pharmacist has to take care of the customer, not only by handing them the product, but also by knowing them personally and knowing what they may need or want in their future. Our task is to take care of our pharmacists in the same way. We have  only a little bit of interaction with the final consumer. But we never want to substitute the pharmacists and their role. It is not easy to have 6,000 people that are able to take care of the consumers as we want them to. But this is the goal. When it comes to food supplements or cosmetics, a piece of good advice is worth much more than a EUR3 saving, or than having the product in 12 hours. If we manage to take good care of our clients, we will have full pharmacies and fewer people shopping online to save money. Our value chain and supply chain are weaved together.</p><h4>Do you plan further expansions abroad?</h4><p>We are currently testing out Eastern and Middle Eastern countries as markets. For sure, internationalization has high costs, both in terms of money and human capital. It is a big commitment because you need to have people there and keep track of your product. We are taking it one step at a time. We can maintain our current 8-10% rate of growth. We are in no big rush.</p><h4>What can we expect from Unifarco in the future?</h4><p>We expect to continue on our path to the EUR150 million revenue goal by 2023. This is a monetary goal, but we actually hope to get more customers thanks to taking care of people. That is our philosophy, and we hope that consumers understand it and appreciate it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[building-back]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the mission of Solidere?</h4><p>Solidere was established in 1994 by former President Hariri in the aftermath of the civil war, with the aim of reconstructing Beirut and, more specifically, the damaged areas in the Central District. According to the original master plan, the company would only operate for 25 years, though its lifespan was recently extended by 10 years to complete construction work. A public-private partnership (PPP) was set up to undertake the effort and secure the necessary financing for the project. Solidere was initially capitalized at USD1.82 billion. Following the retirement of some shares representing recuperated properties in 1997, its share capital, which is listed on the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE), now stands at USD1.65 billion. The main objective behind Solidere was to change war-related perceptions about the city. For many years, the central district had been the symbol of war, and reconstruction was to signify the end of the war. The complementary objective was to reposition Beirut as the regional player it was before the war, giving it a new fresh look while maintaining its roots and wealth of archaeological assets.</p><h4>What have been the country's biggest successes?</h4><p>Our biggest success has been the union between tradition and modernity and the way we balanced the need to preserve and celebrate the past with the requirements and amenities of modern times. Recognizing the city's heritage, Solidere preserved surviving buildings—many dating from the Ottoman or French eras—and re-established the urban fabric and neighborhood structures. In the master plan, 265 buildings and 27 public or religious buildings were retained for preservation. These were carefully restored based on historical research on original designs and materials. Much of the renewal within the Old City is in full development, calling for modest contextual architecture framing public space and recovering city quarters. High-rise buildings are introduced in the city center in select locations in a manner that complements existing buildings. Interiors are fitted with modern equipment for functionality, comfort, and efficiency. The final product has confirmed that heritage buildings can survive and even create great value, provided they are adapted to the needs of contemporary life and business. An example of this connubial is Beirut Souks, whose reconstruction is Solidere's most ambitious real estate development to date and one of its biggest successes. </p><h4>Given the low purchasing powers of Lebanese at the moment, does the diaspora represent your ideal target?</h4><p>The diaspora is indeed one of the most important investors in real estate and our main potential target. Lebanon's economy in general has always relied on inflows from expatriates in the GCC and Africa, though these have become more important in light of falling investments from the GCC, which 10 years ago represented the backbone of the real estate sector. The diaspora holds strong ties with the home country and will, therefore, have continued interest in buying or renting property. However, we can count on their contribution only if investment conditions are facilitated in terms of banking facilities, interest rates, laws, taxes, incentives, and loans. This requires a joint effort from the government, the banking sector, investors, and developers. From the perspective of developers, it is important that we adapt our offering to market changes. This means offering smaller units, lease-to-own options, and lower prices in order to meet market demand and stimulate the market. Despite the crisis, most developers insist on offering large apartments that few can afford, holding on to the Lebanese real estate model of 10 years ago. By end of 2018, Solidere embraced an exceptional and temporary change in direction to adapt to the challenging market conditions in order to improve the company's liquidity and substantially reduce debt. In contrast to 2018, 2019 holds interesting prospects for us following the decision to offer attractive prices in the market. We will close 1H2019 with USD200 million in sales. Moreover, we are positive about the 2019 summer tourist season and the return of GCC citizens, which might represent a further boost to the sector and the general environment in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Port Calling]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[port-calling]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What attracts a company to invest in Tripoli?</h4><p>There are many advantages of doing so. First, in terms of infrastructure, we have a large port, an airport, and an economic zone, with plans for expansion. This enables Tripoli to compete at the regional level. Additionally, Tripoli is destined to serve the nascent oil and gas industry in Lebanon. Additionally, Syria is less than 30km away; once reconstruction works begin, Tripoli will serve as a connecting platform for neighboring countries. Our current problem is that infrastructure in Tripoli is not utilized enough to its maximum potential; this discourages further expansion and investments. Hopefully, we will shortly witness a turnaround; Tripoli has all it takes to be one of the key regions of Lebanon. </p><h4>What triggered your investment in the expansion of the port of Tripoli? </h4><p>I started investing in the expansion of the port of Tripoli a few years ago, moving terminal containers from Beirut in 2016. This was because of the comparative advantage of the port. The Port of Beirut is right in the middle of the city and on valuable land—especially taking into consideration the limited availability of land in the country. The location limits the possibility of expansion and increased traffic congestion. Compared to the Port of Beirut, the Port of Tripoli has a clear advantage in terms of location and expansion possibilities. The port is well installed and connected to other regions, especially since it has the potential to become one of the main suppliers to Syria. We started in 2016 with 10,000TEUs, reaching 22,000 in 2017 and 30,000 in 2018. Our goal is to reach around 300,000TEUs by 2020, which would represent full capacity utilization for Phase I of the port master plan. In 2018, thanks to a deal with French shipping company CMA CGM—one of the largest shipping companies in the world—we posted a significant increase in throughput and expect to reach a target of 120,000TEUs for 2019. We are also looking forward to receiving other major shipping lines going forward. Most of the expansion of the port of Tripoli has been self organized. Since our activities benefit the broader economy of Lebanon, both by developing Tripoli into a major hub and decongesting Beirut, we look forward to seeing a major effort on the part of the government to establish a national logistics strategy. </p><h4>What is Gulftainer's global reach?</h4><p>Gulftainer is the largest privately owned port operator in the world, based in Sharjah, UAE, and operates ports across different countries and continents, including the US, Brazil, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, and is actively pursuing new projects to increase its portfolio of terminals. In Lebanon, Gulftainer is the operator of the port of Tripoli. Gulftainer Lebanon aims to become one of the top 10 port operators worldwide. This is set to occur following natural developments within the industry, where automation is becoming prevalent, requiring large investments from consolidated groups. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Today, we have almost 200 employees spread across six countries in the region, offering a complete spectrum of logistics services from domestic and international express courier and clinical trials logistics to freight forwarding for general cargo, energy, and military projects. 2019 is a year of strategic milestones, as the holding will see the consolidation of all its brands, including Net Express, Net Critical, Net Logistics, Net Projects, and Skynet, under one commercial brand, Net. The rationale behind this move is to embrace the disruption brought by the new digital age. It is essential that we cope with the new generation of digital customers and incorporate their needs and expectations into our business model by moving all our services online. Besides the current focus on B2B and B2C, the future of this industry will be anchored to C2C, connecting customers with each other. This aspect of the business is still underdeveloped in Lebanon, and through our rebranding, we have a great opportunity to serve this need and grow. As part of this move, we will launch a unified website in July 2019 that will be a one-stop shop for all types of services, including national and international express and freight forwarding with online payment. We will innovate the customer experience by managing all aspects of the operation online. </p><h4>How can you profit from Lebanon's strategic location?</h4><p>We are a Levant-based company; thus, we see Lebanon as the natural gateway for international online markets looking to access this region. Once stability returns to Syria, Lebanon could serve as a hub, as it did in the 1970s, and assist in the process of the reconstruction in Syria. AXAL is now building an Air Express Terminal of 3,600sqm at Beirut airport, and Net will have 1,800sqm bonded to operate it as a hub. All these could turn us into a leading company at the regional level, offering all types of services such as express, freight, critical, and project, competing with other multinationals.</p><h4>How can Lebanon develop into a regional logistics hub?</h4><p>Lebanon should shape its maritime strategy to differentiate the services offered by its two main ports. The ports of Beirut and Tripoli are a mere 80km away from one another, and rather than competing, both ports can serve different needs. We need to expand the transshipment activity in the Port of Beirut to serve the growing needs of the region, the main economic and demographic hub of Lebanon. </p><h4>What is your involvement in e-commerce?</h4><p>E-commerce has great potential to be part of the solution to Lebanon's trade deficit by connecting producers and creators with sellers and buyers across the world through an international market platform. Lebanon possesses great talent and productive capabilities but lacks access to a sufficiently large market of consumers. E-commerce will help Lebanese producers extend their market reach to broader international markets, connecting them to the Lebanese diaspora around the world. However, in order to have a vibrant e-commerce platform, we need to develop the necessary enablers, such as excellent internet service, digital customs clearance, online consumer data protection laws, and the necessary reforms and legislations for its success. As President of the Express Association (AXAL), my objective is to present a national strategy for e-commerce, while lobbying for the involvement of the government on this project, through the ministries of economy, telecommunications, transport, and finance. Today, there is a maturity in the country for such a project, largely due to the desperate need for reforms and growth. Parallel to the budget reforms, the government should seek to capitalize on the development of e-commerce, as it holds the potential to boost trade and transform the economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Radec Logistics? </h4><p>Radec Logistics is a member of a group of companies operating in Lebanon and Syria since 1959, whose core activities are in shipping, port agencies, forwarding, and logistics. Radec Logistics was established as a result of three different cycles encountered by the group. It first started in 1993 when our mother company, National Shipping Company, a leading shipping company in the Lebanese market, expanded activities to cover its customers' logistics demand. In 2004, the group's logistics activity became semi-independent, as we teamed up with different partners and bought a large industrial facility to convert it into a warehousing facility. This second cycle lasted until 2007, when we pulled out of the market as a result of a leasing agreement in favor of a major FMCG distributor. In 2009, Radec Logistics started gradually taking over group's logistics operations and strengthening its presence in the Lebanese market by opening a new warehouse in Port of Beirut Free Zone. Since then, we have positioned the company amongst the leaders in the field and grown from 8,000cbm of capacity in 2009 to 50,000 in 2019, offering integrated warehousing and distribution services and logistic solutions for some of the major companies in different sectors. We are presently operating three non-bounded warehouses in Beirut city in addition to one in Beirut Port Free Zone Logistics area and a fleet of trucks for distribution. As our history shows, we are a flexible company. Following market opportunities and trends, we consider any possibility that will benefit the business; we do not hesitate to restructure and open up to partnerships. Following our slogan “Your Cargo... Our Solutions," we easily adapt to our clients' needs to provide them with tailor-made solutions, which is one of our main strengths.</p><h4>Where do you see opportunities for the growth of the logistics sector? </h4><p>The logistics sector is heavily influenced by the adverse market conditions in Lebanon, which limit the volumes traded. The sector has not seen any significant growth in the last three years due to the country's economic instability. This does not mean that there has been no demand; however, from our perspective, before committing to significant investments, we need to ensure that clients can honor sustainable agreements. Given Lebanon's limited size, the growth of the logistic sector will come from its neighbors, where we see opportunities if regional stability is reinstated, and Syrian post-war reconstruction commences. The distance between Beirut and neighboring capital Damascus is shorter than between ports within Syria itself. Lebanon is ideally positioned as a natural gateway to different Syrian and Iraqi cities and a strong candidate to act as a logistic hub for the Levant. However, if Lebanon is to serve the region, it is essential that a sustainable national strategy be put in place, where the first step must be the development and improvement of the road network, the introduction of dry ports, and better rules and regulations. Poor infrastructure currently costs the logistics sector in terms of time and money.</p><h4>How are you investing in IT and software? </h4><p>Investing in IT can contribute to the strength of any logistics company. It is a substantial investment that you recover in deferent ways, yet can ensure higher quality and accuracy of the services the company is offering to its customers. IT was one of the largest investments we made upon startup, whereby we had our own in-house IT development team that helped with the success and rapid growth achieved. When Radec restarted logistics activities in 2009, our first decision was to develop a more international approach by implementing a modern warehouse management system. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has BCC performed recently? </h4><p>Lebanon faces many challenges that are affecting the transportation industry. The economic situation has definitely created greater competition and in such hard times, with our larger infrastructure we can afford to be more aggressive and acquire a bigger market share. Thus, over the years BCC Logistics has always performed above the industry average. We are one of the largest companies in Lebanon with more than 200 employees and over 14 departments. We are involved in air, sea, and land freight forwarding and clearance and also offer warehousing services. We have a 5,000-sqm, bonded warehouse inside Beirut Sea Port and another warehouse of the same size in the suburbs of Beirut. We have our own fleet of around 70 pick-up trucks that we use for distribution all over Lebanon. We have another department that specializes in fairs, exhibitions, and fine art. Diversification has been key to our good performance in times of hardship, allowing us to rely on other sectors when one is performing badly. Working in a small country like Lebanon, one cannot survive on one product or service alone. </p><h4>What is the importance of investing in IT for a company like BCC Logistics?</h4><p>IT is the backbone and future of our company. Our clients are becoming more and more demanding, and we differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our IT infrastructure. We use Microsoft's Dynamics ERP platform for our operations and have also developed several internal programs such as B-Force for our customer services and B-Link for track and trace.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2019? </h4><p>We see many positive opportunities ahead. Natural gas drilling and exploration will certainly boost the transportation sector, as will the rebuilding of Syria. Once these opportunities become concrete, and the right reforms are passed, I am confident that Beirut can become a regional logistics hub. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2018 for DHL?</h4><p>Overall, 2018 was not a bad year. It was difficult at a macroeconomic level but we did manage to grow our revenue. That was due, in large part, to our team, which did an outstanding job by going the extra mile. To maintain a high level of performance, DHL invests heavily in training and continuously motivating the team, whether it be through the annual MENA football tournament attended by over 1,000 employees or our Employee Recognition Program, which identifies and rewards high-performing individuals. The company's certified International Specialist training program is another key component of its motivational strategy and has been in place for over 10 years. It has seen tremendous financial investment and continues to go from strength to strength. The program is continuously evolving and provides the knowledge our people need to properly serve our customers. Notably, DHL Lebanon was voted best employer in the Middle East in a survey conducted by AON Hewitt as were a number of other DHL entities in MENA and around the world. A strong focus and commitment to quality has been another key to our success. Investments in security, facilities, technology, and equipment were made again in 2018 and resulted in the highest service performance the company has ever achieved.</p><h4>What are the company's CSR strategies?</h4><p>DHL has three main CSR programs at the global level: Go Help, Go Teach, and Go Green. The Go Help team, comprised of DHL employees, works with the UNDP and other agencies to support countries affected by natural disasters and trains them how to prepare for them. DHL contributes its logistics capabilities, man power, equipment, aircraft, and know-how to support relief efforts and the training program. Go Teach supports local initiatives mainly for children who do not have the opportunity to obtain an education. We support Teach for Lebanon, for example, at a global level, to help children in impoverished areas access higher levels and standards of education. This global support is supplemented by the involvement of the local team with the various programs and initiatives in Lebanon. Our third program is Go Green, which has several platforms globally. One of which is a service that provides customers the ability to offset the carbon footprint of their shipments. On another front, DHL recently became involved in the development of electric delivery vehicles. At a more local level, we are involved in reforestation, recycling, and other such programs. We also focus on recycling and do our best to ensure our waste, including electronic waste, does not end up in a landfill. Our delivery fleet is renewed every four or five years, which is a major investment that maintains efficiency and limits emissions.</p><h4>What are your business strategies for 2019?</h4><p>In past interviews we talked about our 2020 strategy, called Focus 2020, built on growth through quality. Our aim is to grow and do so by improving quality. That involves making sure we hire the most qualified people, train them, and keep them motivated. In line with that, we will continue to make sure our service improves. As I mentioned earlier, we will also continue to make investments in other than training and development. Our delivery fleet will be replaced in 2019 at a cost of USD 1 million. Two large delivery vehicles were just upgraded at a cost of EUR100,000, and our CCTV system is in the process of being upgraded. USD600,000 worth of security equipment that includes a state-of-the-art cargo X-ray screening machine was recently purchased, and there are plans to improve our efficiency by installing new material handling equipment at a cost of USD200,000. Finally, the Middle East fleet of Boeing 757s was recently upgraded to Boeing 767s, one of which lands in Beirut five times per week. This is a significant capacity upgrade and further testament to our commitment to investing in quality. Simply put, our strategy is growth through quality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for the ICT sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>We expect market conditions to improve and in fact they have already improved as compared to last year. The government is working on all sectors, highlighting electricity and telecommunications, in order to make improvements. We aim to inject more foreign capital in the IT sector and further develop the local ICT sector. Lebanese people are known for their creativity and being up-to-date with the latest trends in the IT sector. Moreover, the local IT sector offers high-quality services with competitive prices. In order to attract more FDI, the government must focus on providing good infrastructure. To that end, the government and the Ministry of Telecommunications began building fiber optic infrastructure in 2018. By the end of 2019, we expect to see an increase in the speed of the delivery of fiber optic infrastructure. Equally important, the government created a new ministry for information technology. One of its tasks is to implement an e-government platform to facilitate bureaucratic procedures, which will be made in cooperation with the private sector. In total, 13 IT associations and syndicates recently formed the Lebanese ICT Federation to lobby for new laws concerning e-government and the ICT sector. A first step that shows we are on the right track was the approval of law 81 for e-signature in 2018. </p><h4>How can youth's access to IT be improved? </h4><p>The Beirut Digital District (BDD) project, led by the private sector, was a brilliant idea to facilitate access to information technology and support young entrepreneurs and startups. Now, as part of the Professional Computer Association (PCA), we are campaigning for an expansion of the digital district to other areas and create “digital clusters" throughout the country. This will facilitate the creation of new companies and start-ups. Furthermore, it will reduce costs for companies in Beirut, and employees will not need to commute long distances or relocate. Concerning our company, we are aiming to launch a training program system that will focus on harnessing the creative youth, where one person will be selected each year to become a partner of our group. Lebanon has one of the best education curriculums and is a leader in the MENA region in dealing with education and technology. It is important to capitalize on this and support the human talent that our schools produce. </p><h4>What are the strengths of your company?</h4><p>We value our customers, which is why we provide solutions that benefits them. We create digital transformations, work in different sectors, and build our experience. One of our great recent achievements is working on the e-government project. We offer a complete list of services, including infrastructure, software systems, security, and digital marketing. We have done projects in Iraq with the Central Bank and the Ministry of Housing and Construction. We have a presence in Europe, especially in Cyprus and Germany, as well as in Sierra Leon and Gabon, where we work on large telecom projects. We are working on strengthening our presence in Europe to increase our business and target several sectors. Digital marketing was recently bunched because we believe it's the number-one way to market products, as it enables a higher level of penetration through phones and digital devices. We are currently working on two aspects, researchers and tools, to satisfy our customers' needs and generate a return on their investments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main developments in the outdoor advertising industry?</h4><p>Worldwide, the outdoor industry, which is commonly called Out Of Home (OOH), is in a large period of transformation. Digitalization of assets led to new, unprecedented planning and booking capabilities with campaigns that can be contextually relevant, which means booking either part of the day depending on the product consumption or service availability, on a special day, or based on the location, thus transforming advertising into a useful message that is welcomed by consumers. The convergence between mobile and OOH is also an important phenomenon, increasing investments in our medium; research shows that campaigns running for the same product are amplified when displayed OOH as they increase mobile search and drive sales. We are heading toward automation in booking and programmatic buying, such as what is done in online ads, which will be a game changer in the next five years. Another major development is the consolidation we see happening in many markets and the constant pace of acquisitions, which will favor setting new international standards for OOH thanks to the weight of the increased number of global, international, and regional leaders. Competition is no longer within the OOH industry but rather with online/social and mobile, which are obtaining almost USD1 out of USD2 being invested in communication in 2019 (USD287 billion will go to digital out of a total of USD 635 billion). In 2019, 61% of this total is concentrated in the hands of Google, Facebook, and Alibaba.</p><h4>What is your strategy to face these changes?</h4><p>Our strategy is to pursue the digitization of our assets, currently 270 screens. We also aim to complete the Pikasso Transformation, a new way of making use of Digital Out Of Home (DOOH) with the new planning and booking capabilities by making it familiar to all the agencies and advertisers through organizing conferences on how to best use DOOH based on appropriate, contextual, and customized content. Enhanced data-based decision making is also significant. Data has never been as available and as important in decision making. In 2018 and for the first time in Lebanon, we launched Out-of-Home Audience Measurement with Cuende and the Digital Out-of-Home Audience Measurement in Malls with Quividi camera facial detection. Lastly, we are working on automation and getting ready for programmatic methods.</p><h4>What are your countries of operation?</h4><p>We are focused on three regions: the Levant (Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq), North Africa (Algeria, Tunisia), and West Africa (Mali, Ivory Coast, Senegal). Recently, we launched our activity in the Caucasus (Armenia). This concentration allows us to create scale and bring cross-border standardized OOH solutions to multinational/regional advertisers.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the company's CSR involvement?</h4><p>Our contribution is in three directions: internally, toward the community, and related to our industry. Internally, we ensure that our employees are guaranteed fair, equal, and non-discriminatory treatment in addition to health and safety standards and continuous training programs and we are committed to ensuring environmental sustainability. With regards to the community, we are undertaking initiatives such as the Citizen Billposter, supporting NGOs and NPOs in promoting public interest and other good causes by providing free-of-charge advertising space. We manifest our commitment to the industry through observation of international standards set by the likes of the World Out Of Home Organization (WOO), previously known as FEPE International, and the Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA). </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[digitization-at-the-core]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Is Lebanon ready to embark upon a path of digital transformation?</h4><p>According to a report released by the Digital Arabia Network Mapping Project this year, proper digital transformation is concentrated within two sectors of the Lebanese economy, i.e. the innovation business (46.9%) and education and research (20.3%). This leaves out other sectors where digitization has still not been embraced. Digitization in the public sector has involved only a few departments and overall still largely represents virgin territory. Indeed, it is worrying that Lebanon's ranking in the e-Government Development Index for 2018 has slipped by 26 places in two years (from 73rd in 2016 to 99th in 2018). Although there are still several challenges to face, Lebanon is waiting to transition to a model of digitized business and e-government. What the country now needs is a unified plan coordinated by a central body at governmental level to kick-start this transformation. In regional terms, Lebanon is generally considered to fare well when it comes to digitization. The country has promoted itself as a tech and digital hub through a series of successful initiatives, and companies have been very receptive to incorporating elements of digital change into their structure.</p><h4>Will the reforms and development plans channeled through the CEDRE conference promote digital transformation?</h4><p>Digital transformation will be an important component of the set of reforms demanded by the international community—or, in some sense, a necessary by-product. The highly anticipated USD11 billion of investments and funds will only be opened up conditional to the implementation of a set of governance reforms aimed at fighting corruption and improving transparency and efficiency. Thus, e-government should be a central pillar of this strategy. The digitization of all governmental processes and transactions will increase transparency and limit fraudulent behavior, because all actions will be logged, available for scrutiny. E-government will increase the trust between citizens and governmental institutions, improve the service offered, and boost the efficiency of the whole chain. However, the actual implementation of a unified plan for e-government remains subject to the political will of the government. </p><h4>How have technological innovations been incorporated into the company's development strategy? </h4><p>Following the global rise in importance of new fields of technological innovation, Everteam has made this a core of its offering. This means every standard solution or technology that we offer has been developed and injected with new elements stemming from new tools for analytics, cloud storage, secure storage, robotics, AI, IoT, and much more. Everteam is currently venturing into new fields with strong potential for growth (such as big data and analytics). Integrating these fields with IoT software and services will strengthen our position in the market, responding to the increasing demand for higher efficiency and flexibility and improved customer satisfaction. Automated processes are now a core demand of customers from all sectors, who want to access and carry through operations as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p><h4>What is Everteam's strategy for 2019?</h4><p>Due to the ever-changing nature of this industry, constant expansion is a necessary strategy for us. Everteam's expansion strategy is multi-layered. This comprises first technological expansion, keeping up with innovation and incorporating this into our offering; this enables us to preemptively satisfy the needs and solve the challenges of any current or prospect client. Second, we are looking to expand geographically, extending our reach in the US and targeting new markets with accelerated growth and new customer pools, such as Central Asia and Africa. Third, we intend to pursue more acquisitions and expand our portfolio of companies, thus targeting an ever-larger range of sectors. We expect to see some positive changes in the coming year. The integration of digital transformation in the business fabric of the country is taking place more rapidly. Everteam is working on expanding its portfolio in order to encompass the needs of all governmental departments as well as all other sectors to become pioneers in digital transformation. In summary, 2018 was a good year, and we are proud of the many achievements we have accomplished in many countries in the Gulf such as paperless environment, government streamlining, and a centralized knowledge base. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[True Competitive Edge]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[true-competitive-edge]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Wonet offer?</h4><p>Wonet offers two main services: voice and data. Customers can download the app and subscribe to both or either one for a monthly fee. The novelty of Wonet is that customers can receive and make calls through their own number from anywhere in the world without roaming fees. Wonet customers can also call other Wonet users for free. Our advantage, compared to Skype, is that we offer this highly competitive service free of charge on the customer's primary number. This is an important step forward in terms of customers' comfort. Originally, we started in France by providing clients with a similar service on a secondary number, just like Skype and another 300 companies do. In this crowded market, we did not have a truly competitive edge. Then, we concluded that customers do not want to change their number. Thanks to a technological breakthrough that is under patent review by the European Patent Office, we managed to offer the same service on the same number; thus, raising the bar higher for the whole market. In simple terms, this technological breakthrough consisted of taking the voice out of the SIM and storing it on the app. This means that even after taking the SIM out, you can be reached anywhere on your own number. So far, the service has been commercialized in 40 countries (mostly in Europe and the US), where voiceover IP is legal and permitted. The second main service is data. This is driven by a physical data SIM, which we deliver to any destination in the world. The SIM costs EUR30 and has unlimited validity. We offer six data packs corresponding to the six continents: Europe, the US, Latin America, Africa, Middle East, and APAC. All packs have a validity of 30 days, and the prices vary from EUR20 and the bundles vary from 0.5-2GB, depending on the destination. The most aggressive pricing we have is in Europe, at 2GB for EUR20.</p><h4>In what ways do you intend to empower operators? </h4><p>At present, Wonet is shifting its strategy and focusing on partnering with mobile operators to empower them by offering free roaming services, such as our Roam Like at Home (RLAH) service. Roaming fees are negotiated between the operators of different countries. Unfortunately, this is nothing but a volume game; in regions with high volume, such as the EU, operators have the power and strength to negotiate competitive prices, while individual operators in the Middle East or other regions do not, thus the higher roaming prices. Mobile operators in the region have gradually lost importance because they have maintained high roaming prices despite the free-of-charge services offered by apps like WhatsApp, which was first used internationally to bypass roaming fees. Wonet's business model is to tackle this precise aspect, empowering mobile operators from all regions. We want to be perceived as roaming partners for the mobile operators, not as business disruptors. In countries where voiceover IP is not permitted (such as some countries the Middle East), Wonet has little competitive value. For this reason, partnerships with country operators will be the focus of our regional strategy. Our value proposition to mobile operators is that, by offering the people the right price and data on their regular mobile number, users will move away from WhatsApp, at least when they travel. This will change the declining trend of roaming revenues that operators have been experiencing recently. </p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>We are in advanced discussions with the two main Lebanese operators, Alfa and Touch. Our goal is to launch services in Lebanon by 3Q2019. We have plans for out-of-country services in Iraq, the UAE, Jordan, and other countries. We look forward to having minimum four operators in three to four countries and exploring partnerships with additional operators. We want to empower mobile operators to be able to set their own roaming rates without being dictated by the large groups. This will have a ripple effect on retail prices, benefiting the end user. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Ministry for Investment and Technology Affairs was recently created. Would you tell us about its importance and task?</h4><p>The ministry's establishment reflects the increasing importance of the knowledge economy and technology in the larger economy. Following the McKinsey &amp; Co. report on boosting Lebanon's productive sectors, we need to rethink our economy and its structure. The knowledge economy in particular is one of the key productive sectors that we want to focus on. Lebanon's competitive advantage lies in the human resources, in particular its intellectual talent. The creation of the ministry is a major step forward and strategic for the development of Lebanon. The sector can provide a solution to the problems of unemployment and brain drain. Circular 331, launched by the central bank, had the merit to jump-start the entire tech ecosystem and put it on the map. Lebanon is now number two in the region for number of startups and amount invested in startups. Our ambition is to complement the actions already taken by incentivizing non-bank investors in the knowledge economy, especially from the diaspora, and making business easier for SMEs and scale-ups through a number of new regulations and reforms. Another important focus is helping our companies to expand outside of the small Lebanese market. The third task for me is to attract job creators to the country, whether large multinationals or SMEs. Lebanon offers a number of competitive advantages to companies looking to base their regional operations here, such as a talented pool of young and entrepreneurial people with excellent levels of education; multilingual youth; a skilled, business-oriented workforce; and our strategic geographic location. We are working on promoting Lebanon as a tech hub, while also raising awareness of our story and brand. We have established a special economic zone (SEZ) in Tripoli, which will benefit from a special, business-friendly regime that will attract local and international companies. Balanced and regional development is an important part of our strategy, and this is the easiest way to be successful in the IT sector. Besides the SEZ in Tripoli, we want to create tech hubs and knowledge villages across Lebanon.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your digitalization efforts?</h4><p>Digital transformation in the public sector is a central pillar of the government's mandate. We are working on establishing an e-government platform in collaboration with the Office of the Minister of State for Administrative Reform (OMSAR), and the Ministry of Telecommunications (MOT), under the auspices of the Prime Minister. We have seen a lot of plans related to digital transformation over the last 15 years, and now it is time to execute them. This is a complex plan that will require different skill sets and resources; the transition will be gradual. It is important for the citizens to feel that their journey is becoming simpler and more digital, and this applies also to the government. This will create greater efficiency, transparency, and help fight corruption. Another achievement of digital transformation was the recently approved Law No. 81/2018, which will facilitate electronic transactions and e-commerce. We also have plans for cyber security. If we want to attract companies and do business with the outside world, then we need to have highest standards and best practice.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?<br></h4><p>Our upmost priority is to make the right reforms on the economic front to put Lebanon and its people back on track for growth and prosperity. We are finalizing the electricity plan, which is an important part of our economic strategy, and working on reducing the budget deficit. Structural and sectorial reforms are key and some of these reforms have already started. The next priority is launching large infrastructure projects to improve economic activity and create jobs. As for the ministry, it will focus on making the knowledge economy a key pillar of Lebanon's economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of the company and its expansion plans? </h4><p>We are a franchise of French cooperative Candia, one of the biggest in France. We are the first company in Lebanon that started producing long-life milk. We also produce fresh and pasteurized milk as well as all the derivatives of dairy such as labneh, laban, and goat cheeses. Moreover, we also produce juices. We are diversifying our offering by launching more cheeses and yogurts. Thanks to Candia, we invest heavily in technology and equipment, especially with regard to long-life milk, which is a sensitive product. We invested heavily to promote awareness about this as people are still not convinced our milk can stay in the carton for six months without being refrigerated. The company is in good financial shape despite the hard times; the volume went up from 500,000 liters in the 2000s to 15 million liters. We are also trying to expand our range and the number of franchises. At present, Libanlait's business is based on a farm of 3,000 cows, which is its current capacity for one milking parlor in Bekaa. That includes 1,500 milking and 1,500 breeding cows, which means we replace our own herd. If we wish to expand, we need to do another unit with 4,500 cows because of the capacity of the milking parlor.</p><h4>What is the main challenge for your line of business? </h4><p>Our main concern is imports of dairy products from Saudi Arabia. The size of farms in Saudi Arabia means producers there can afford to sell at a much lower price. Moreover, their products are not taxed by Lebanon due to trade agreements. This forces us to bring down prices to such an extent that our sales are hardly profitable. It also affects Lebanese farmers from whom we purchase high-quality milk. Libanlait is working with the government to implement protectionist measures to support the farmers and the industry. Such measures in the agri-food business are common in most developed and developing countries and Lebanon should not be an exception. The industry in Lebanon needs to be supported through subsidies so that local production can compete with imported products. By far, powdered milk represents the largest source of competition for milk products; however, I do not consider this as a challenge yet. Milk powder is still predominantly used in all industries across the country and imported in higher quantities. However, Lebanon is still not at the stage where it produces enough milk to replace milk powder; thus, I do not see any problem in the two industries co-existing together. </p><h4>What is the rationale behind the water recycling plant you are soon to launch? </h4><p>We decided to invest in a major recycling plant to clean up the Litani river, which runs next to our production facilities. The river itself has ceased to exist, as there are more than 160 production units on the river which pollute it with waste, chemicals, and poison. Until now, there was no clear plan to counter the problem. We have been studying the situation and assessing different solutions for over four years, together with the Ministry of Environment and the UNDP. Finally, we selected an avant-garde technology solution provided by the Canadian company LWR. We got the World Bank to support the project with a USD2-million loan with a highly convenient interest rate and payback period. The machinery and equipment for the recycling plant will be shipped by the end of May and be operational by mid-July. The plant will recycle all effluent and white water from the production facility and produce clean water and liquid nutrients, which are ideal for agriculture irrigation. Thereafter, we will develop a big irrigation project with pivots and all kinds of irrigation systems. We are interested in partnering with universities to get students to learn about the recycling plant and involve them in a large-scale agriculture project—something quite rare in Lebanon. </p>]]></richbody0content>

At the same time, it shows that the technology sector is gaining momentum in the national economic scene. We have the ability to develop our own technologies, instead of limiting ourselves to importing and adapting systems. This only became possible with the advancement in the capabilities of our national talents. We are also glad to see support from the government for the technology sector, by creating a Ministry for IT, deploying digital public services, nurturing startups ecosystems, and positioning the country as a player in the global technology market. At RGH, our priority is to continuously invest in Lebanese talents, whose work on our proprietary solutions has already contributed to the citizen experience in Lebanon. We are determined to pursue our investments in R&amp;D to create solutions based on the latest technologies, and contribute to the country's digital transformation alongside other Lebanese tech companies.</p><h4>You recently wrote that the knowledge economy can be a driver of Lebanon's growth. How can this be achieved?</h4><p>Most developed countries testify that knowledge is the key driver of economic growth, wealth creation, employment, and social welfare. The knowledge economy is rooted in quality education and access to information. It encourages freedom of expression, interactions with global cultures, pluralism, and R&amp;D and innovation. Such characteristics help improve the positioning of a country as a technology influencer on the global market. Our country has laid the foundations of the knowledge economy. We see initiatives such as Banque du Liban's Circular 331, Beirut Digital District, and UK Tech Hub, as well as the government´s recognition of the knowledge economy as one of the sectors that present the highest growth potential. All of these initiatives prove that Lebanon is on a steady path toward embracing the knowledge economy as a driver of national development. In this regard, the Lebanese quality educational system is an essential component. The evolution process to achieve such a goal is complex; however, with the right support from authorities and efforts from industry stakeholders, Lebanon can join other exemplary countries.</p><h4>What is the relation between the knowledge economy and ICT? </h4><p>ICT is key to establishing a knowledge economy. It supports knowledge transfer, and thus, it has a direct impact on economic growth, especially in developing countries. In the context of Lebanon, we see the example of the fiber optics project, which directly supports the country's strategy to move toward a knowledge economy. High-speed internet opens numerous new business opportunities for companies which focus their growth on the knowledge-based services and products. It facilitates the development of incubators and accelerators as focal points for the growth of new ideas and disruptive technologies.</p><h4>How can RGH further support the country's infrastructure to embrace a smarter city life?</h4><p>Embracing the benefits of digital transformation in all aspects of urban life is at the core of our business mindset. RGH focuses on innovation and invests aggressively in R&amp;D to find solutions for challenges faced by citizens. We welcome and encourage every initiative to create a smarter city life and have an active role in such initiatives. In this context, we are taking part in the development of the country's infrastructure with the fiber-optic project. We are also contributing to the city's digital transformation by assisting in the automation of public services. With its home-grown tech companies, start-ups, and highly educated local talents, Beirut has a great potential to emerge as a smart city. However, a significant effort is required from all involved stakeholders to deliver solutions that add value in today's complex landscape. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has AVE's global strategy evolved over the years?</h4><p>Founded in 1904 in Brescia, Italy, AVE is among one of Italy's oldest and most prestigious manufacturers of electrical equipment. We were recently included among the top-100 Italian companies, a milestone that recognizes our long history and dedication. Our core business includes home automation, hotel automation, and wiring devices for residential use. Outside of Italy, our main presence is in the MENA region, followed by Eastern Europe. We have branch offices in Dubai, Belgrade, Amman, and others, and local factories in Tunisia, Romania, and Lebanon. AVE's philosophy is to bring a local, valuable product to the markets it serves. The medium- to low-end market is mostly dominated by Chinese products, which are cheap but of questionable quality. We can deliver the best combination of quality and price to markets like Lebanon. The Tunisian market, where we have been present for 25 years, represents one of our great success stories. We started through a joint venture with local partners with a minority share of 20%. At present, we employ 400 people in Tunisia and represent 85% market share. We are also the second-largest player in Libya. Following our success in Tunisia, we decided to increase our presence in the Lebanese market. AVE is running an industrial plant in Lebanon and has a 51% market share. The project called Meta Lebanon is a joint venture with A&amp;G Holding, a Lebanese company. </p><h4>Why did you decide to invest in Lebanon? </h4><p>Investing in Lebanon might seem like a risky move to international companies. After careful assessment of the security risk, we determined it to be a safe investment. Instead of buying our own buildings, which is an expensive venture in Lebanon, we preferred to invest in machinery and projects. Nevertheless, Lebanon presents a set of interesting opportunities for us. It is a strategic location to serve the Levant region and post-war reconstruction in neighboring countries. Moreover, thanks to the FTA between Arab countries, everything produced here is easily exportable. We are already the number-one brand in Jordan for medium- to high-end market, but we are looking to grab a bigger share of the low- to medium-end market. Our partnership with A&amp;G Holding was one of the main reasons this project came to light. A&amp;G Holding is a group of retailers and wholesalers of electrical material in Lebanon. AVE's conditions for A&amp;G Holding to enter the joint venture were not easy at first, as A&amp;G Holding was asked to invest EUR1.5 million (USD1.6 million) as a know-how fee. However, thanks to AVE's good reputation, A&amp;G was able to raise capital and enter the JV. Our cooperation is mutually productive: AVE brings in international know-how and a large structure, while A&amp;G contributes with logistics expertise and local know-how. An important point in common for our businesses is the strength of family ties. The choice of Zahle for the factory location reflects different exigencies. Zahle has a constant supply of electricity, which is a great plus in Lebanon. Unlike Beirut, costs of properties and labor force are cheaper and Zahle offers all the amenities and the security of a proper city. The city is strategically located, not far from the Syrian border and just a short distance from Beirut.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2019?</h4><p>The factory opened in May 2019, and we have already pre-rescheduled orders with companies in Jordan and Syria. Our long-term goal is to become the market leader in Lebanon and Jordan. An important priority is to lobby the government to protect Lebanese products by imposing import duties on low-quality Chinese goods. A project of this sort will greatly benefit Lebanon on various levels, from job creation to offering a high-quality product. It is important that the government shows its support.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Protecting Millions of Workers]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[vicente-aparicio-managing-director-asepeyo]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the evolution of the company been?</h4><p>Asepeyo is the number-one mutual insurance company in Catalonia and the second nationally. Considering the country is emerging from a difficult period that began with the 2008 financial crisis, we are doing well. Furthermore, as mutuals, we never stop being business associations as we collaborate with companies that protect their workers with us. When companies encounter problems, as was the case in the financial crash, we too have problems. If companies have to reduce the number of workers, then the total volume of workers we insure or protect falls. We had 2.3 million workers, and that number fell to around 1.65 million. All the mutuals lost in proportion to their respective market share, which is noticeable. Since 2013, the economy in Spain has been recovering, and now we are back to pre-crisis income levels.</p><h4>The volume of workers Asepeyo represents is growing; in 2018, it increased by 3.3%. What is your strategy to continue this growth?</h4><p>The strategy is based on our service, as we have several limitations when it comes to increasing our activity. For example, we cannot legally carry out commercial activity by attracting companies.  Therefore, if we want to be attractive, it must has to be based on our reputation and services. We seek to meet companies' requirements so that they know they can rest assured with us. What is more, we are always looking to improve our facilities, healthcare, and human capital because we see the potential in the person-to-person recommendation. If, unfortunately, a worker has an accident at work and comes to our facilities, he must leave satisfied with how we received and treated him.</p><h4>This service differentiates Asepeyo from many others in the market, and a large part of this has to do with the professionalism of its employees. Companies in the health sector often complain it is difficult to retain talent in Spain. How does Asepeyo deal with this?</h4><p>Currently, Spain and the healthcare system are experiencing difficulty in the retention of healthcare personnel. Doctors and nurses are seeking permission from professional associations to go abroad because European countries value professionals trained in Spain, further complicating matters. We can retain these personnel by providing resources, means, and growth capacity. Perhaps it is not about earning more but offering a habitat where they can develop. Not long ago, for example, an extremely talented physiotherapist came to work for us, not to earn more, but because here he can innovate, create, and put into practice ideas that do not have resources in public health sector. We are also public health, though we have a capacity for adaptation and availability that has enabled our professionals to carry out these innovations. These are the things we try to encourage.</p><h4>What is your perspective on the importance of having strong spirit of innovation here and how fundamental is it for the future of all sectors?</h4><p>It is not just Asepeyo, our competition is also doing it. On the health issue, we have put an MRI of three Teslas in Coslada, which few hospitals in Spain have, much to the delight of our traumatologists. Thus far, we have renovated 12 centers in 12 years. The center in Girona went from being 800sqm to 2,400sqm, and we have equipped it with everything. There is a 2,000sqm center where we will dedicate 1,000sqm to physiotherapy. It will have a gym so that all patients of the city can come to a single center with all the physiotherapists and a specialist. We are trying to strengthen health because it is not just our goal, but an obligation. In doing so, we put professionals in close proximity where they can share experiences and knowledge among themselves. Furthermore, we have collaborated with companies working in virtual reality. Every year there are more than 80,000 accidents, about 13% of which are traffic accidents. We acquired four driving simulators where people drive while our technician places obstacles in the way, which is significantly more effective in raising awareness in prevention. The key is to raise awareness because we have a minimum capacity to act in prevention. We tackle the issue from a social security point of view. Companies are delighted with this proposal because we give them a product that they have never had. Now, we are also looking to use drones for risk prevention.</p><h4>What is Asepeyo's main objective for 2020?</h4><p>We have several objectives. If we want to do things, we need to grow. However, we can only grow within the standards in place. The objective is to continue in our line of transformation, continue evolving in the healthcare sphere, and continue improving our facilities. We have to complete the digital transformation in which we are now at 30%. We have developed applications of all kinds, such as one for companies for injured workers to communicate with one another. Our strategic plan ends in 2020, by which time we hope to have finalized these processes and build a new plan that will be partly conditional on the current plan. We have many challenges, but improving an injured person's home and lifestyle is a priority. We can help 6,000 people a year, and EUR13 million can be distributed among all these people to help them with their problems when they have an accident at work. This is extremely important, and the truth is that we are advanced. We have sports activities that mean the world to them. In winter we take them skiing, in summer swimming, riding bicycles and horses, and even flying. At the hospital in Madrid, we have launched and adapted the exoskeleton that was created as an experiment by the US and Israeli army. We rented the exoskeleton and have it in the hospital where we are working to evolve it. A patient who was in a wheelchair for 30 years was able to walk using the exoskeleton, which means another life for that patient when he leaves the hospital. Furthermore, we connect the people that were injured. In Madrid, we recently gathered around 90 invalids with their caregivers and spent a whole day explaining new techniques and problem solving, for example through sexual therapy. We have even received invalids from other mutuals because this program does not exist elsewhere. Recently a group did the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, and I went with them. In this way, these people can create bonds and long-lasting relationships. Everyone should understand that this helps improve their quality of life significantly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mohamed-chebil-general-manager-the-curve-hotel]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The hotel was established in 2016. How have the first years of operations panned out?</h4><p>The Curve Hotel opened its doors in 4Q2016. And within the short period of our operation, in 2017, we were among the top-10 ranked hotels in Doha. We not only capitalized on being a new property and a fresh brand, but also made sure that the vast experience of our staff was reflected in the service provided to our guests. From the start of our operations we have aimed to live by our tag motto, which is “the place to embrace the city.“ We do that by being customer oriented, and by making sure that they have significant memorable experiences, also feel that they have a home-away-from-home on a daily basis.</p><h4>What changes have you seen in your occupancy rates since the blockade, and what type of customer are you targeting currently?</h4><p>The primary challenge that the blockade brought to the hospitality industry was that the increased supply became more evident as more new hotels and hotel apartments commenced operations, while the market suddenly narrowed. Our primary target market consisted of corporate executive managers, which was also a minority in the market. In order to meet the challenge of maintaining our occupancy, we widened our reach to include sporting events, airlines, diplomats, and the state sector, as well as tourism mainly from Oman and Kuwait, and residents, which we consider part of local tourism. Through our consistent efforts in promoting our brand, we created a strong awareness and in parallel our solid reputation in the market generated positive feedback from our guests. In return, we are able to manage our high occupancy without affecting our rates, and to remain aligned with the international brands.</p><h4>What are your plans to maintain healthy visitor numbers at The Curve Hotel?</h4><p>The Curve Hotel sustains its principles of providing a consistent high level of service, this is the key to continued dynamism in terms of visitor numbers. It is more important to keep and maintain existing guests, as apart from representing stable business, their satisfaction also help bring in new business. This luxurious and modern hotel transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary with its amenities and special offers as it allows guests plenty of opportunities to indulge and relax. It is an ideal place to settle in as a resident, or alternatively simply enjoy for short stay, meeting a diversity of lifestyle needs. We are also taking the opportunity to promote individual facilities available at the property through separate promotions such as the rooftop pool, which gives a panoramic view of the Arabian Gulf, our well-equipped gym and the Skinsation Spa. The several restaurants and coffee shops to have recently opened on our ground level, have also promoted the property to a wider market, creating greater awareness.</p><h4>How would you assess the overall health of the Qatar's tourism sector?</h4><p>The overall health of Qatar's tourism sector is good, and it is making sure that it maintains that condition through diversification of its activities, and by defining new sources of tourism. The Qatar National Tourism Council has been working to attract visitors to the State of Qatar from previously untapped markets such as luxury cruises. It is also creating culture years with China, Russia and India, in parallel to opening the curtain on these markets. It has also made itself more present in other countries by opening tourism offices. The Council continues to work closely with tour operators and Qatar Airways, specifically for its stop over program. QNTC is slowly, but surely addressing the issue of tourism through exploring alternative opportunities, which consequently helps the hospitality industry of Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[4,200 Hotels Worldwide]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[hany-ghanem-general-manager-the-best-western-plus-doha]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Best Western brand developed in the Qatari market?</h4><p>Best Western is one of the leading franchise businesses worldwide with over 4,200 hotels in operation. We have around eleven hotels in the GCC, with one in Doha. We are well known for affordable prices, which is what makes Best Western unique. Our hotel is owned by His Excellency Sheikh Dr. Abdul Aziz Bin Mohamed Bin Jabr Al Thani. Owning a hotel is part of his contribution to investment in the hospitality industry, which he believes merits support as a highly promising sector. Having an international chain attracts loyalty because most customers nowadays are looking for a hotel where they can have a loyalty program, or get points and stay anywhere in the world.  Our hotel has helped us gain a good positioning in the market, as we are located very close to Souq Waqif at less than a 5 minute walking, as well as a 3 minute walk from the Corniche and under 15 minutes from the airport by car. This was an added value for the hotel, and we were able to cooperate with Qatar Airways and host layover customers at the premises. We are close to the business area, and so enjoy a good base of corporate customers.</p><h4>How would you assess the impact of the blockade on the tourism sector of Qatar, and the country's recent initiatives to attract more visitors?</h4><p>I would say that now we have recovered notably since the blockade of June 2017. It had a major impact at the time, being a sudden decision, and we had to rethink our means of retaining revenue to keep our hotel operating. We were struggling in 2017, but during 2018 after the recovery made through the efforts of the government and hotel management of the sector we are back on the right track. The focus today is not only on rooms, as people have started to think of the Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) business. The government started to find ways to attract different markets beyond the GCC and is seeking to compensate it in the long term. It opened the visa on arrival for 80 countries, and is keen to attract the Chinese, Indian and Russian markets. The rethink has also seen the transition of the Qatar Tourism Authority into the National Tourism Council. We support all initiative of the Council, and when talk moved to the Chinese market for example, we were among the first hotels to address that market, becoming certified to accommodate Chinese visitors. In the hiring process, we have ensured that we have employees trained in many languages including Chinese, Indian, and Russian.</p><h4>What plans do you have for the 2022 World Cup?</h4><p>We are in regular contact with the Supreme Council for Delivery and Legacy, and we have no doubt that we will be fully booked during the world cup time  however for sure . For sure we are expecting advance teams and events for preparation of the World Cup and are ready for this. Whatever is required of our side will be provided. Those in charge of the hospitality sector are doing very well with the preparations. Last year they opened the Qatar National Library and in 2019 the Qatar National Museum will be opened, as will new malls. They are trying to provide attractions that impact guests and travelers on their first to visit Qatar. It is all about sustainability of tourism and its substantial new facilities beyond just one month of World Cup 2022. What happens afterwards is the big question. I would say that the strategy for Qatar is encouraging as it has already encompassed many sporting events such as the gymnastics in 2018, cycling in 2016 (which I was honored to be one of the organized committee members) and handball championships in 2015. Meanwhile, the conference tourism sector is also being developed.</p><h4>For 2019 what are the priorities for the hotel?</h4><p>Best Western is keen to attract the expatriate business. In 2018, for example, We were the official hotel for Nepal Idol 2017 and The Voice Nepal 2018, where we hosted the entire crew, celebrities and contestants for those two mega events that happen for the first time outside Nepal, In addition we are keen to have a variety of service offered which is suitable for different nationalities, for example we have an Irish pub, a Chinese restaurant, and a newly opened Filipino Restaurant, we sponsored as well, the Pakistani main event for National Day,  additionally We are very close to the Philippine community and received an award from a well-known social media platform for Filipinos as the Best Filipino Preferred Hotel. This is a standard we must maintain in 2019.  We will continue our efforts to tap diverse markets, such as the Chinese and Russians, and are in contact with certain agencies in China. I hope that the Iranian market becomes open, too, as it is a huge market of well-traveled people. Locally we will focus on corporate accounts, and as we approach the World Cup there will be an increasing number of events and visitors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did PAL Aerospace first come to base its overseas operations in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>PAL Aerospace is a Canadian company whose core competency is special mission aircraft that engage in Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). In an increasingly important global market, PAL offers turnkey solutions for clients with the ability to do engineering and design, modification and integration, maintenance, integrated logistics support, training, and In-Service Support (ISS). What makes PAL unique, however, is that we can operate our own aircraft, deploying on short notice in various countries and environments around the world. PAL established its presence in Abu Dhabi over a decade ago at a time when GCC countries started to consider the acquisition of their own special mission aircraft. Given PAL's ability to provide aircraft, training and support services, we offered a unique value proposition to governments in the region. Ultimately our decision to partner with Emirati ownership, choose Abu Dhabi as our base of operation in the region, and form PAL Aerospace LLC was influenced by the UAE's tremendous foresight in understanding of the value of ISR services and appreciation for how our services could complement their objectives.</p><h4>What distinguishes the UAE from neighboring countries as a market for special mission aircraft and ISR?</h4><p>The UAE is the only country in the region with a mature ISR fleet, with neighboring countries only now seeking to acquire comparable assets and capabilities. So, as a fundamental differentiator, the UAE is much further advanced in this area. We believe, based on our experience in this market and the partnerships we've built here that we are uniquely capable of contributing to the training and planning required to support ISR services as other GCC countries seek to integrate that capacity into their nation and regional defense plans. We also believe, based on the UAE's head start in ISR, that it will remain a regional leader in that capacity for years to come.</p><h4>What factors drive PAL's decisions regarding aircraft used on ISR missions?</h4><p>Traditionally, PAL's focus of work has been in maritime surveillance. This specialty has served our partnership with the UAE well given the country's size and location proximate to the Strait of Hormuz and the Red Sea. In the maritime domain, the two key aircraft attributes are the ability to operate “low and slow." Twin turboprop aircraft are both well suited to this type of operation and have the capacity to carry the technology we need to successfully identify threats like terrorists, narcotics traffickers and human smugglers. With that in mind, PAL has developed significant capacity in operating and supporting Bombardier Dash 8s, ATRs, Beachcraft King Airs and Airbus C295s. These are all reliable airframes with a track record of exceeding client expectations for reliability and performance in ISR operations.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the skill levels of technicians operating in the UAE?</h4><p>At large, the skill level of technicians in the UAE is quite high, as it needs to be. People look at one of PAL's specially modified Dash 8s and assume that the maintenance is the same as an off-the-shelf aircraft; however, when you board the aircraft, you quickly realize just how substantial the differences are between a missionized aircraft and a commercial airliner. For instance, we do not operate the same fuel system as a regular Dash 8, we have significantly different wiring and electrical requirements — the differentiators are substantial. An ISR asset is not a plane with electronics on board; it is an electronics system that has a set of wings. To give you an idea of the level of technology on board, an ISR asset, including the aircraft and onboard systems, could cost anywhere between USD100-250 million. The airframe accounts for less than 10% of that cost. Operating this level of advanced technology effectively requires world-class talent and we have seen a significant development and maturation of the skill sets we need in the UAE over the last several years. This has come from government leadership, development of training techniques and programs required to properly nurture skills development and, when needed, recruiting specialized capacity from abroad.</p><h4>Do you see the UAE being able to build a completely localized ISR industry?</h4><p>The global ISR market is so deeply interconnected, and specialized that it is almost impossible to get the economies of scale needed to localize the industry in any one country. The UAE has developed a substantial fleet of military aircraft, and has successfully localized maintenance, repair and overhaul operations. PAL appreciates and supports this approach. We have chosen to operate as a local company in the UAE market, and we have an Emiratization strategy in place. Our staff is currently composed of around 10% Emirati nationals. We are very proud of this, and we are always looking to increase the numbers. That said, ISR assets are completely unique aircraft, built for a unique set of special mission criteria. So to properly support those operations and make sure we are keeping up with leading-edge technologies in the field, some degree of international participation will always likely be required.</p><h4>What is the current frontier of innovation in ISR?</h4><p>There is rapid innovation going on in the ISR market, not necessarily focused on the airframes so much as on the onboard ISR systems. The electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) camera market, for example, has changed dramatically in the last three years. EO/IR used to be comprised of a single camera and a lens. Now, cameras offer multiple lenses and make use of artificial intelligence. The ability of radar technology to detect ever smaller targets at increasing distances advances every year. Most of the R&amp;D that PAL has undertaken in the UAE been developing here is driven by our clients' needs. For instance, we have always been heavily invested in software development and as a result we have been doing more and more work locally on refining the mission systems software that essential serves as the central nervous system for the aircraft.</p><h4>Does PAL see any of its services in the Gulf region moving beyond the defense sector?</h4><p>There has been some interest in the UAE to see PAL apply our work outside the national defense domain, particularly in addressing environmental and security concerns around critical infrastructure, like offshore oil and gas installations. There is an evolving discussion as to whether the responsibility to act as the custodian of this critical infrastructure lies with the companies managing it or the government. In Canada, for example, this stewardship is accomplished through a partnership between government and private industry. PAL owns and operates aircraft under direct contract from the oil and gas industry, but we also have surveillance operations in the same areas under contract with the government. We believe that in time of responsibility for infrastructure monitoring will shift toward industry.</p><h4>What is the biggest growth segment of the ISR industry in the Gulf region?</h4><p>Training services are set to be the biggest growth sector in the ISR market in the Gulf region over the next few years. The demand for ISR assets in the GCC is only increasing. As PAL has worked closely with the Government of the UAE in to develop ISR capacity here and have established local operations with demonstrated ability to successfully train and support ISR operators, we are in a strong position to lead the training elements of this future growth. Additionally, Canada is globally renowned for its sensor operator training capabilities. This allows us a unique opportunity to tap into a substantial supply of high-quality, specialized trainers, bringing world-leading techniques and technology to the UAE.</p><h4>What recommendations do you have for the further development of Abu Dhabi's aerospace and defense sector?</h4><p>We believe Abu Dhabi would benefit from an increased recognition of the importance of a mature defense and aerospace cluster with a clear export focus. From PAL's perspective, for our company to grow, we need to be able to market our services effectively in the rest of the Eastern Hemisphere, secure in the knowledge that there is a supportive ecosystem to help us do the actual work and bring significant economic and technological benefit back to in Abu Dhabi.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[500% Revenue Growth Over 5 Years]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[brendon-lee-general-manager-connexion-conference-event-centre]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision behind the establishment of CCEC?</h4><p>The centre always been envisioned as a venue where people can connect through events. Set amidst the Bangsar South integrated city, CCEC was developed by UOA Group to meet the growing needs of the booming township by providing services and facilities for meetings and events in addition to all the other conveniences made available in the area. Since its launch in 2014, CCEC has come a long way. It has now doubled in size and has managed to increase its revenue by five folds. The centre currently manages over 200,000 square feet of space, featuring a total of 15 Function Rooms, five Ballrooms, an Auditorium, a Rooftop Gazebo and an upscale event space known as The Oak Room.</p><h4>What have been some of your chief highlights and achievements in the past year?</h4><p>Besides seeing an increase in the number of local and regional events at our venue, we are also delighted to be selected as the preferred venue for major corporate events of large and publicly listed companies such as Google, Alibaba, Microsoft, Pfizer and Amazon. Having event organizers who return to us repeatedly like the recent Google Onboard event in March which we have hosted three times is also very gratifying. Due to these high-profile events as well as positive feedback and recommendation from our return clients, CCEC welcomed a record-breaking quarter million guests last year. In addition to that, CCEC has also begun providing outside catering services recently. A new co-living space by UOA called Komune Living that has 648 rooms, nearing completion in just a few months will be one of the biggest external catering projects our team will undertake this year. From an intimate team of less than 50 associates since its inception, the team has now expanded to over 100 associates to accommodate the centre's rapid growth.</p><h4>What strengths and unique features set the center apart?</h4><p>Based on feedback from our clients. CCEC has been their preferred venue over the years because of our location between Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur. As part of the Bangsar South integrated city, it is conveniently surrounded by hotels, co-working spaces, various exciting retail and dining outlets, train stations and over a 1,000 parking bays, making it one of the few venues in Kuala Lumpur that provides exceptional connectivity and accessibility for our clients and their guests. Aside from that, the Centre also takes pride in its customisable solutions to suit each client's specific event requirements in order to deliver a seamless experience each time. This flexibility in offering, convenient location and the right pricing strategy is what sets us apart from the rest of our competitors.</p><h4>What is your strategy in further positioning CCEC?</h4><p>Last year, we obtained the Halal certification which took a year's worth of effort. After this achievement, we set our sights on the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) certification which is a pre-requisite for securing international events. Our goal for 2019 is to lift the share of international business in our total operations. Currently, corporate events represent a large scale of our revenue but we still see ample room for growth in the corporate segment especially in the international market. The additional certifications will enable us to secure bigger and also more international events in the future.</p><h4>What are the most important requirements for Malaysia to enhance its international competitiveness and attractiveness for business events?</h4><p>As of now, Malaysia is already an attractive location for a lot of international companies and event bodies due to its stable political environment, state-of-the-art meeting and conference facilities, good accessibility and a well- connected transportation system. These contribute towards Malaysia's competitive edge against other neighboring countries and make it one of the most business-friendly countries in the region. If Malaysia continues to keep this up, it will further strengthen Malaysia's brand and position for the international market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Botanic Advantage]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[sebastian-salazar-fuentes-ceo-founder-botaniktech]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In a dynamic industry that moves at a rapid pace, what first-mover advantage does Botaniktech expect to see in the industry?</h4><p>Our first advantage in the cannabis industry in Peru was our deep understanding of the plant and the regulations. The authorizations we have obtained as Botaniknow come as a result of this. Being ahead of our competitors and building relations with the government institutions involved in the industry have been our greatest advantages. As the industry develops, and regulation is implemented, we position ourselves as the cannabis knowledge reference in the industry in Peru.</p><h4>What role does scientific research play in Botaniktech's model?</h4><p>In the Peruvian cannabis industry, research can provide us with a better understanding of the potential benefits and uses of cannabinoids as well as help set higher standards of quality in production. Developing healthy synergies with all players is of great importance for a budding industry. In this sense, we have formed partnerships with an organization that is specially focused on R&amp;D. It brings to the table important knowledge and data on consumers/patients, doctors, and uses of cannabis in Peru. This is key for us to develop effective strategies to open the cannabis market nationwide.</p><h4>How is Botaniktech positioning itself to become the leading firm for Peruvian cannabis patients?</h4><p>With a population above 32 million and more than a third living in its capital city Lima, we have a great advantage for logistics and distribution. We started our cannabis efforts in March 2018, building a company specializing in import/export, commercialization, and the distribution of cannabis and derived products called Botaniknow SAC. We have done things well, and as a result, we are the first in Peru to hold the authorization to operate as a pharmaceutical company dedicated to cannabis. We also obtained the first certificate for good storage practices (BPA) in compliance with the regulation regarding cannabis and its derivatives. Today, we aim to be the first company to introduce cannabis products to the Peruvian market. Later, through our pharmaceutical laboratory Botaniktech, we will cultivate and produce the much-needed medicine for Peruvian patients.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the licensing and approval process for cannabis firms in Peru?</h4><p>It is a complex process, with several key regulation milestones to overcome. This involves many steps and significant investments to be in compliance with all requirements from the Peruvian General Directorate of Medicines, Supplies and Drugs (DIGEMID). Regulation in Peru involves three main licenses: research, import/export and commercialization, and production. Only the first two are fully implemented for companies to apply to them, while the third is still under study by government institutions. We expect this to be ready at the end of 2019. Peru is the fourth country in the region to pass cannabis legislation. We have learned from Uruguay, Chile, and Colombian laws. There are two main differences in our regulations. Peru defines psychoactive cannabis as cannabis with more than 1% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and deems it “cannabis for medical and therapeutic use." Psychoactive cannabis does not include cannabis with less than 1% THC called hemp. This gives us a different understanding of the reach cannabis can have in the industry in Peru. The other key difference that is also an advantage is that we have considered in the regulation the possibility of distributing cannabis across the social health system, resulting in a bigger and controlled market.</p><h4>What competitive advantage does Peru have in terms of becoming a cannabis leader?</h4><p>Peru is known for many things: warm people, amazing food, and wonderful places to visit. Soon, it will also be known for its excellent quality of cannabis. We are fortunate to have one of the best environmental conditions in the world for cannabis cultivation. This advantage, in addition to extensive agricultural knowledge and today's technology, could be a game changer in the global cannabis industry. We are a multidisciplinary team that comes from different industries, and we are committed to making Peru the region's leader supplier of cannabis.</p><h4>What will be the next step for Botaniktech, domestically and internationally?</h4><p>In 1H2019, we have built solid strategic partners in Colombia, Canada, Germany, as well as Ecuador, which we are waiting for legislation to be passed. Our next step is to pass the registration process for cannabis-derived products to be sold in the markets. We expect this for early 2020. The alliances we have made internationally give us a solid base to aggressively penetrate the markets in the region. These synergies represent huge production and distribution capacities. We aim big and intend to be the first supplier for the South American market. At the same time, we will start our own farming operation and production of cannabis-derived products to be sold regionally in 2021.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pino-musolino-president-north-adriatic-sea-port-authority]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the main advantages of the ports of Venice and Chioggia?</h4><p>We went through major legislative reform in 2016, and the Italian port system now comprises 15 port authorities. The ports of Venice and Chioggia are under my authority. This adds some layers of complications, though it has given us possibility of working on a systemic level and allows us to use the best of both ports to increase capacity and output in terms of industry and our industrial hinterland. We have been a port for the last 1,200 years, and geography matters. Thanks to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Mediterranean basin is returning to a center position on the global stage of international trade. In the last 100 years, the port of Venice has developed into a large industrial cluster, with 2,200ha of port area, more than 1,200 enterprises, and jobs for more than 19,000 workers. Moreover, the position and the advantages granted by the port of Venice have allowed the famous northeast Italian region, the most dynamic cluster of industry, innovation, and development, to advance further. Being the system of ports serving this industrial hinterland is definitely an asset. We have many advantages that are certainly a plus for companies that want to use Venice as a gateway for import and exports, particularly with a focus on East Asia-Europe connectivity.</p><h4>What strategic initiatives drove growth of the port in the last few years?</h4><p>I devised a strategic plan of development comprising several layers. Until recently, the central focus was on the physical infrastructure, though the immaterial digital infrastructure is just as important. We have devised a development plan that combines the building of new infrastructures or additional railway connectivity rather than merely road connectivity, as well as a full digitization of our systems. We have increased nautical accessibility by creating a virtual copy of our port and the main navigation canals that are now projected on the AIS screen of ships. This dramatically increases the capacity of port activities on a 24/7 basis. We have improved land connectivity and are building a new rail bridge that will go directly to the high-capacity, high-speed line. This will reduce the time in which the train can be sent out straight from terminals to 20 minutes. When we put all the tiles together, the main picture is better and more efficient than before.</p><h4>What is your vision of a model port?</h4><p>We are pouring some EUR440 million into this and are devising all the different layers of projects and investments. We are on the leading edge of technology in building the green port of the future. Together with a private equity investment, we have created the largest coastal deposit of LNG in the entire Adriatic Sea. This project will receive almost EUR30 million in grants from Europe. It will be a state-of-the-art coastal deposit of LNG serving the inland service and will connect with the dry ports of Padua and Verona. We will also provide the latest bunkering to the LNG operated vessels of the future. First, we need to plan and invest in that in order to be ready to host those vessels coming into the market and will do so in the next three to five years. We have devised a modern system of treatment for water and rainwater as well. It is possible to combine sustainability and development and provide a strong efficient economy with an eye on the environment we are based in. Being green should be a key part of our activities. We are pushing hard on R&amp;D to eventually devise technologies that will make our systems not just greener but also more efficient and ultimately economically viable and financially feasible.</p><h4>What technologies are you currently implementing?</h4><p>We are also devising systems to implement our logistics efficiency. We are developing our own fully-integrated port community system, and in the next two years we will have fully automated and digitized system of paperwork and exchange of data on a cloud where private and public bodies will all be integrated.</p><h4>What can be done to boost cooperation at the local, regional, and international levels?</h4><p>We need to work on stronger bonds with the other side of the Mediterranean. The continent with the highest rate of growth in the coming 100 years will be Africa, which is around the corner, though we are neglecting it. We could work strongly with the countries of the Black Sea Basin and the Caucasus. China is proposing a plan of connectivity going west; why are we not meeting it halfway, with plans of connectivity going eastbound, to ensure it will not decide everything? We should maintain strategic control over our supply and global value chains, particularly because as a continent we are a large manufacturing area, and we risk losing our competitive edge if we do not pay enough attention to them. At the moment, there is a strong gateway represented by the northern range; however, if the Mediterranean is to return to the center stage, then the southern range of ports in Italy, Spain, and the south of France needs to be equally considered and equal in infrastructure. In the last two revisions of the TEN-T, we connected the continent. However, how do we connect the continent to other continents? We need to create motorways of the seas. The Caucasus will be a great area of development thanks to the BRI, and we need to make the best out of it while we are still preserving and strengthening our economies and connectivity.</p><h4>What should we expect from the port authority and the transportation sector for 2020?</h4><p>We have to complete our current investment and infrastructure plans and are working to participate in all those meetings at a European level to support and bring a revised vision of TEN-T and a distribution of funds. We are cooperating in the Mediterranean and are fostering new agreements with additional Chinese authorities and ports. We are bringing more vessels and feeder services. We also want to expand our clout to all the countries, as everyone is talking about BRI as though it is only China; however, there are 100 countries in between. We are dealing with Indonesia, we have a sister agreement with the port of Vung Tau in Vietnam, and we are developing relationships with Port Klang in Malaysia and the ports in the Middle East and the Gulf in order to develop commercial agreements and MoUs. We also have strong ties with the port of Qatar. We are developing a strong plan of exchange of data and implementation of new lines with the ports of Damietta and Alexandria. The whole idea is to push our boundaries and ideas and think outside the box. We want the ports of Venice and Chioggia to be the best they can be.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Main Event]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-zohair-al-sarraj-ceo-specialist-exicon-international-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you position yourself within the business event landscape, and what are your main strengths?</h4><p>We are a full-service events management company that can handle all event-related aspects from the pre-event preparation and marketing phases to onsite event logistics and post-event phases. We are a company that can operate as both the organizer were we have several event concepts that we initiate and also as the executor for events related to governmental bodies and corporate entities across the Middle East. I would say that our main goal through our events is to contribute to the development and reinforcement of the industries' performances and establish new grounds to work from. Being an organizer of events we initiate, the research, project management and scientific committee support we offer our clients and highly effective event marketing techniques are some of our strengths. Our main strength though is our team of professionals which I am truly proud of have.</p><h4>There are various recurring events in your portfolio, happening on annual or bi-annual basis for example. Could you give some examples of these long-term partnerships and what benefits it offers for all parties involved?</h4><p>Indeed, we always aim to have sustainable event concepts which can be done several times in different locations and maintain strategic partnerships. We started with the International Operations &amp; Maintenance Conference (OMAINTEC) which was held 16 times before in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan. The 17th edition will be held on November 19th to 21st 2019 in Dubai under the patronage of H.E. Dr. Abdallah Belhaif Al Nuaimi, the Minister of Infrastructure Development. The OMAINTEC conference is actually an example of how initiatives made in a conference can transform into institutions where the Arab Council for Operations and Maintenance was established during the 3rd OMAINTEC in June 2004 at Beirut. We organized as well the Arab Desalination Conference (ARWADEX) 12 times, held previously in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Egypt and always attained official patronage from officials where the event was held in. Also we are the proud executing party of the Saudi Law Conference organized by Burhan Almarifa &amp; LexisNexis. The first edition was held in 2018 under the patronage of H.E. the Minister of Justice Dr. Walid Bin Muhammad Al Samaani. The 2nd edition was just announced as well to be held on November 3rd to 5th 2019 at the King Faisal Conventions Center under the patronage of H.E. the Minister of Commerce and Investment Dr. Majid bin Abdullah Al Qasabi.</p><h4>A global trend in the event industry is technology, increasingly important to attract visitors and engage with the attendees and those that are following on distant. What is your approach on bringing technology in? </h4><p>Technology is evolving greatly within the events industry and we are on constant look-out to keep up with the latest advancements. The use of digital marketing techniques and social media has become our main marketing channels for our events. As for engaging with attendees and as part of our all in one events management software, the use of electronic newsletters and the mobile app has proved to be very effective.</p><h4>What do you estimate to be the impact of Vision 2030 on the events industry?</h4><p>Saudi's 2030 Vision incorporates more than 500 initiatives within 18 ministries and public authorities, and the Specialist - ExiCon International Group has formed an alliance in respect of these initiatives. The events industry can help by producing on average at least two events per initiative. Within this time frame we can do 1,500 events to help reach the objectives of each initiative within the ministries. For example, there are healthcare initiatives relating to topics such as medical insurance, digitization, medication, and communication with patients at home. The Ministry of Health will take all the steps it can to reach these targets. To achieve this you need international exhibits, consultants, and user involvement, so you need a forum such as a big seminar or conference targeting, for example, the issue of medical insurance. This forum allows the sector here to listen to what other people and countries have done and exchange experiences with international medical insurance providers. There are many experiences from around the world—some are good for Saudi and we might customize some of those, and others are not so good or relevant. The Specialist - ExiCon International Group can create events to cover all these different areas. Digital transformation is another important topic. Today Saudi Arabia is ranked in the top five globally in terms of e-government transactions. There are a lot of digital transformation events we can do in Saudi Arabia. Smart cities are another objective and these relate to Industry 4.0—the new industrial revolution. There are many topics that can be discussed within Industry 4.0. Saudi Arabia is also moving to have its military manufacturing locally within the Kingdom. We also have big plans to do more exploration and extraction of minerals in Saudi Arabia, and we can collaborate with Ma'aden in this sphere.  </p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the years ahead?</h4><p>The Kingdom is developing greatly in all aspects as part of Vision 2030 and contributing to these developments through our events is our main goal. Vision 2030 is focusing on new technology and how to bring it to Saudi Arabia, which is another great sphere of interest. In all these projects there is a big push for the international contractors and consultants to involve Saudi engineers and employees and to make them part of the technology being used in these projects. We are now planning to launch a big project about digital transformation internationally and the technology debate to talk about how technology will help the people and to address their fears. Education and training should focus on redirecting people towards these new jobs. We also have a project with the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation (TVTC), where we aim to improve their model of training by organizing some conferences about this new model. Also on a regional scale and adding to our offices in Riyadh, Beirut, Dubai, and London, we just opened our new office in Cairo where we are very keen to organize more events in Egypt and contribute to the economic development efforts undertaken by the Egyptian government.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[In a Flash]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[john-lickrish-ceo-flash]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent does Flash contribute to the development of Abu Dhabi as a major entertainment hub? </h4><p>Flash is the events arm of the Government of Abu Dhabi, but we operate under a private-sector mandate, so commerciality is our number one priority. We are involved in conceptualizing events from production, ticket sales, marketing, communications, and backend support. Flash is incredibly diverse within its delivery scope, meaning we can oversee a Disney show, a Papal visit, a Coldplay concert or the 2019 Asian Cup football tournament. We produced several major events back-to-back throughout 2018. The Pope's visit in early 2019 was attended by over 150,000 people and was the 2nd biggest single gathering in the UAE's history only unification day in 1972 was larger. Flash also executed the Asian Cup, the biggest sporting event to hit the Middle East. Notably, we even beat Australia, the previous host, in terms of attendance with over 750,000 spectators.</p><h4>How do events raise the profile of Abu Dhabi, and what effect does this have on the overall economy?</h4><p>When presented an event opportunity, we look at how this will impact the profile of Abu Dhabi and the perception of the Middle East throughout the world. Events and activities bring a lot of attention to the UAE, and when outsiders see a Coldplay or a George Michael show it shatters misconceptions about the Middle East. Moreover, these events provide considerable economic benefits on the back of direct revenues, services, and support systems, as well as the infrastructure that needs to be in place to deliver them. Visitors are encouraged to come to the UAE, and residents have more opportunities to enjoy these events at home. These are all the critical factors for our operation, and they help to pave the way for us to grow in a broader, more sophisticated way.</p><h4>How have local consumer expectations evolved since the inception of Flash, and how do you differentiate Flash from competitors? </h4><p>There is healthy competition in the market, and Flash's aim is to serve as a baseline in the sector. Mainly, we want the competition to emulate what we are doing, and we want to ensure that we protect the image of the city and the country by delivering events at an international standard. In short, there should be no difference between events held in Abu Dhabi, New York, or London. We are working hard on transportation infrastructure and customer experience more than other event companies. This differentiates us in the market. We aim to build Flash as a premium brand. We are not here to control the sector— only to compete with other private sector companies. Flash bids for contracts just like every other company.</p><h4>Do you believe the UAE can act as a template for other countries in the region looking to expand their entertainment offerings and loosen restrictions?</h4><p>One of the biggest obstacles for promoters in the Middle East is bringing content from abroad to the region, which can be quite isolated from other parts of the world at times. More artists passing through places like the UAE will benefit promoters and consumers across the region as a whole. Hopefully, we will see the rise of more regional corporate partners and brand sponsors that can help with the commercial viability of the sector and build a stronger regional market.   Within the UAE, there are still growth opportunities, for example in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi, a market that has yet to be fully serviced.</p><h4>In your experience, what are some of the ways private sector players can collaborate with the Department of Culture and Tourism (DCT)? </h4><p>Flash has worked closely with the DCT on several projects; our objectives align with theirs in many strategic areas as, ultimately, we wish to bring positive attention to Abu Dhabi and drive visitors. We are exploring new opportunities and looking at combined programs to increase the length of stay for visitors that come to Abu Dhabi for specific events. At present, a visitor can plan for activities that span several days, including concerts, mosques, museums, Formula One, tennis, and cultural events. Moreover, we can produce many ancillary events around major international properties while also highlighting Abu Dhabi's unique historical, cultural, and natural attractions.</p><h4>What is your outlook for growth opportunities in the sector? </h4><p>We are pleased with Flash's growth and are looking for ways to expand. We want to make sure we can sustain a positive relationship with our home city and the residents of the UAE. We are also more thoughtful and deliberate in our planning when looking at our long-term goals in the Saudi market. At the same time, we are looking at horizontal integration for some of our supply chains and how we can increase those to provide more value to our customers through our corporate partners and sponsors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Doing It Right]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[doing-it-right]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2018 for Diageo?</h4><p>The on-trade has always been a building block and foundation of Lebanon's hospitality and tourism industries, positioning the country as the Middle East's reference for nightlife and entertainment. Lebanon's vibrant nightlife scenes are mirrored in different countries in the MENA region, particularly in Dubai, and that keeps our industry busy. Equally important, Lebanon remains a hub for innovation, mixology capabilities, and expertise, and an open platform for premiumization and eventually for growth. We have seen positive shifts in the on-trade space recently with new ventures and venues emerging, but that doesn't particularly indicate solid growth. 2018 was not the best year, and that's due to the political and economic instability. The tourism industry didn't grow as expected because of the decision of many Gulf states nationals not to come to Beirut and a decline in the number of Lebanese expat visitors. The biggest challenge in 2018 was a significant drop in consumer spending on entertainment and particularly on alcohol, which is why the on-trade channel suffered. On the positive side, the president's determination to implement serious corrective measures and carry out a short-term impact strategy with new faces in the government makes me optimistic for 2019.</p><h4>How would you compare the arak and champagne segments?</h4><p>Champagne is one of the most expensive drinks and falls into the fine drinking category. This category is where consumers pamper themselves and take it to the next level. Due to economic uncertainty in 2018, many weddings and big events were canceled or postponed, and that caused a drop. The second reason is the change in consumer behavior and preference for lower-priced drinks. The plunge in champagne YoY in 2018 was in double digits; however, in the off-trade space, we saw slight growth but that didn't really support our total sales because the majority of champagne consumption lies in the on-trade. Another key reason is the rise of sparkling wine, which is 50-60% cheaper than champagne but similar in some ways. Lebanon is known to produce the best arak and in the recent years we have seen a rise in home distilled or craft arak, as opposed to commercial brands. This remains the drink of choice during Sunday lunches or Lebanese gatherings. The arak category is declining by 16% in value and by 9% in volume, which means people prefer cheaper or home-distilled arak. Another reason for the decline is that arak is no longer trendy among the youth. Furthermore, arak was never promoted or served as an aperitif or mixed with other ingredients or served at the bar; it was always associated with food and that of course narrows down growth avenues.</p><h4>What are Diageo's objectives for 2019?</h4><p>We are extremely proud of our people and purpose of serving our community. We seek to educate our drinkers, drive positive change, help and educate the community, and promote gender equality. Over 50% of our workforce is female.<br>Do you have any CSR projects for 2019?<br>We are one of the few companies that is driving a busy corporate and social agenda. In 2018, we launched various activities, which are ongoing, and are part of a five-year plan. Diageo partnered with Kunhadi and launched 'Save The Night,' a program that includes on-trade staff training for responsible serving, venue protocol, and promotion of industry code of practice. In November 2019, we launched the National Road Safety Research and Data Center in partnership with the National Road Safety Council and a university. This is intended to provide evidence and data to support policy reviews and improve enforcement of traffic laws. We celebrate life every day, everywhere; however, we want it done in the right way. We are looking to create a database with the help of universities to build evidence for support strategies in a bid to reduce alcohol-impaired driving crashes. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Allianz SNA developed its regional presence? </h4><p>Allianz SNA has a 56-year history, having begun with a company called Société Nationale d'Assurances, one of the first insurance companies in the country. In the 1990s, the Allianz group entered the company and gradually took a 100% stake, with the strategy of using Lebanon as a stepping stone into the wider Middle East. With a total premium of 146 million, Allianz SNA is market leader, with a strong coverage of both life and non-life. Through our presence in Lebanon, Allianz SNA intends to serve the region, focusing on Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the UAE. Our strategy is focused. We do not aim for a general footprint in all countries, but rather a strong, market-leading presence in a few. In Egypt, we are number three in the market and hold a 95% stake in two companies, with a 75% concentration on life. In Saudi Arabia, we were the first listed company with a foreign market participation to advance to a majority shareholding (51%) in a joint venture. In the UAE, we work with several players and look forward to consolidating our presence there. Besides these core markets, we have a participation in Jordan and Bahrain. Lebanon plays a key role in our strategy as a regional hub from which we can export best practices and human talent, while maximizing synergies. </p><h4>How does Lebanon compare to the region in terms of insurance regulation? </h4><p>Between 10 and 20 years ago, Lebanon was at the forefront of the regional industry in terms of market size, expertise, and regulation; however, since 2007, Gulf countries started to open up their markets and establish their regulatory base. While they rapidly evolved and created a modern insurance framework—KSA and UAE now hold arguably the best regulations and regulators in the region—Lebanon lagged behind. Prevailing Lebanese insurance laws are 50 years old; few amendments have been made, and they do not accommodate new sectors like online, bancassurance, credit, agriculture, or even life. Moreover, the criteria for the solvency of insurance companies is completely obsolete. In order for Lebanon to become a proper insurance hub to serve the region, the regulatory framework must be updated and the process for hiring foreign workers liberalized. I partly disagree with the oft-mentioned statement that the Lebanese insurance sector is overcrowded. The high number of companies here is at the root of the sector's considerable innovation, which we have then exported throughout the region, and the highest penetration rate of the insurance market in the region (3.1%). What Lebanon needs is not fewer companies, but rather stronger ones; key to this is modern, up-to-date regulation to enable innovation and consolidation.</p><h4>How would you describe your presence in the market?</h4><p>As a multinational market player, we apply the Allianz standard and added value in each market we serve. Our presence in Lebanon is divided evenly into life and non-life. We are multi-segment operators, covering large corporate risks, mid-core and retail, thus serving the needs of all customers. We have a multi-access strategy, working with several distribution channels. Our own network of agents, representatives and brokers, and online sales reflect the ever-changing behavior and needs of customers. Our multi-segment and multi-access approach is key to our success. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main accomplishments for Chedid Capital?</h4><p>In September 2018, we celebrated 20 years for the first company in the group, Chedid Re. We started as a reinsurance broker and soon became a major player in the region. In the last few years, Chedid Re has become the largest reinsurance broker in MENA and one of the top 20 in the world. In June 2015, we were registered as a Lloyd's broker—an important accomplishment and seal of approval to our longstanding collaboration with Lloyd's. Aside from the reinsurance business, in 2010 we launched our insurance and insurance brokerage business, developing them along the regional footprint of Chedid Re. International diversification is another key to success, as the best strategy for expansion comes from providing regional solutions to economies of scale. Our group today comprises 45 countries, from Pakistan to the UK, and employs over 500 people. We provide reinsurance solutions for all lines of business across the whole region, counting on a highly qualified team in all sectors, from legal to economists, engineers, and actuaries. The insurance brokerage side is focused on the Gulf, Levant, Mauritius (a recently opened location from which we cover East Africa), as well as supporting our clients wherever they develop through our network and alliances.</p><h4>How have opportunities evolved in your 20 years of existence? What is your outlook on the future? </h4><p>Between 2004 and 2014, insurance markets in the region grew quickly. While this brought a huge amount of opportunities to reinsurance companies, it also meant increased competition, with a number of new companies claiming a share of the pie. This was not problematic as long as the market kept growing, but things have turned around in the last four years. Due to the economic and political situation in the region, the insurance industry is not growing, and we find ourselves with an excess of reinsurance. For this reason, the industry's near future will be quite challenging until it reaches a higher degree of consolidation. Today, the priority for any reinsurance company in the region is to be the most resilient and the most agile to adapt to the dynamic regional situation. We are doing so by upgrading resources and capabilities through new recruitments and trainings and by raising the bar when it comes to customer services, risk management, corporate governance, and running all our operations with transparency and ethics.</p><h4>How can Lebanon compete with Dubai as a reinsurance hub?</h4><p>Lebanon can hardly be compared to the much larger economies in the Gulf. Nevertheless, opportunities are there. In my opinion, instead of rivaling Dubai as a reinsurance hub, Beirut and the broader Levant should be seen as complementary markets to the Gulf. Both Dubai and Beirut can play a role as international centers of excellence, and companies like ours can capitalize on and develop both. The relationship between Dubai and Beirut should also be seen as a mutual synergy. If Beirut grows, Dubai does too. In terms of the benefits we derive from our hub in Lebanon, one of the key factors of our success is that we can rely on the highly skilled workforce in Lebanon. Lebanese youth are multilingual, multinational, multicultural, and resilient and adept at crisis management. We have arrangements with Lebanese universities, as well as with other territories where we have a strong presence, which allow us to draw from their vast pool of promising talent, train them, and assimilate them into the group. This model has worked well for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[wave-of-opportunities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your prospects for the country and the insurance sector for 2019? </h4><p>We are extremely optimistic about the formation of a new government and the wave of opportunities brought about by the CEDRE projects. The set of reforms demanded by the government will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the economy and on the insurance market. Even during the past years of economic uncertainty, the insurance sector performed positively, increasing by 20% between 2016 and 2017, and premiums have been increasing by 3-4% YoY. Since insurance touches all sectors and lines of business, growth in our market is a positive indicator for the economy as a whole. We act as a barometer of the economy. Regarding the prospects for 2019 for the insurance sector, there are a great deal of opportunities. The bulk of infrastructure projects will need to be insured. Motor insurance in Lebanon increases every year by 50,000 to 60,000 new vehicles. There are also interesting prospects in the oil and gas sector, although the real premium will materialize in six years or more. Meanwhile, the market has to prepare itself to insure this nascent industry. For the last four years, our association has been organizing conferences and seminars on the subject, involving international insurers, insurance, and reinsurance brokers. Furthermore, we want to have all local insurance companies involved by creating a pool so that each company receives a share. Finally, life insurance is an important part of premium income. It will develop in the future because people are becoming increasingly aware of private pension. </p><h4>Would you say the Lebanese insurance sector is overly competitive? </h4><p>The insurance sector is overcrowded, although still marginally profitable. There is fierce competition due to fact that risks are decreasing, thus allowing rates to drop and the company to remain profitable. However, there are too many insurance companies in a small market. There should be ways to merge or acquire companies in order to increase the capital base. The Insurance Control Commission (ICC), with the help of the World Bank, is introducing certain amendments to the law, in particular for corporate governance and solvency on risk-based capital. This will encourage insurance companies to merge. We need strong insurance companies to meet the challenges of the future, in particular for the reconstruction of neighboring countries and expansion abroad.</p><h4>How is the Lebanese insurance market adapting to the innovations brought by technology?</h4><p>We have always been at the forefront of developments in the MENA region, including digital distribution. Most local insurance companies have developed a line of digital solutions and insurtech. Important areas of focus for the future include cyber risk, which is a worldwide problem. Up until now, 85% of the business has been in the US. Lebanon is now catching up along with the rest of the world. The future of insurance is also a central pillar of the association. We hold conferences and seminars, and we are in contact with universities to assist their programs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[weathering-the-storm]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history and mission of EuroMena? </h4><p>We established EuroMena in 2004, when opportunities and prospects for growth in the region were strong. We set up a private equity fund with the help of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and other institutions such as the IFC and the French, German, and British agencies for development. Today, we manage USD350 million and are raising a new fund worth USD200-250 million. While regional conditions have deteriorated, EuroMena maintains its commitment to the region, becoming one of the few teams capable of investing in hostile environments, while still making returns to shareholders. EuroMena aims to develop the economy of Lebanon by tackling opportunities across borders and serving the diaspora. We see this as the main way forward for an economy as small as Lebanon's, but which can still count on a solid presence across the globe. </p><h4>What is the key to your success? </h4><p>Diversification. In order to mitigate risk, we have diversified our range of investments, both geographically and by sector. We invested in 14 sectors across 20 countries, and every company we invest in makes a regional impact. Thus, we try to build companies that are shielded from devaluation or local currencies. Beside MENA, we have an active interest in Africa, supporting Lebanese entrepreneurs on the continent. Every fund has a 10-year-long life, so we have a long-term interest in supporting the companies we invest in. Regional conditions in the last 15 years have been quite challenging, and investing in Europe would have been a more cautious choice. Nonetheless, MENA and to an even greater extent sub-Saharan Africa provide huge opportunities for development. It is great for us to be based in Beirut and to play a role in the development of the region; at the same time, we are cautious and have offices in each of the companies in which we invest, in case things at home turn for the worse. </p><h4>What are the main challenges and opportunities for investments in Lebanon? </h4><p>The high interest rates on deposits are currently the largest impediment to investments, since they generate a cash deficit and a liquidity ladder in the country. If the government implements the right set of reforms as it has committed to, interest rates will decrease and the long-term investment climate will improve. Yet for any foreign investor who can afford to wait, there are great opportunities available. Electricity, oil and gas, and real estate are but a few. Moreover, among all the countries we invest in, Lebanon remains the most investor-friendly place. It is the easiest country in the region to open a bank account or establish a company, and is the most open and liberal country when it comes to business. As such, it is easy to get shareholders from any nationality without any requirement for a Lebanese-majority board. Our tax and legal structures are also optimized for selling, and there are low fees and low taxes on capital gains. You can also distribute the proceeds of the sale, including capital gains, to all your shareholders in any country and any currency. Meanwhile, you can also readily take out loans or benefit from subsidiaries. Finally, Lebanon leverages its educated and highly skilled human talent, making it the perfect platform from which to develop business in neighboring countries. All the companies we invest in have the potential to achieve scale at the regional level. </p><h4>What is your outlook for your investments in the retail sector? </h4><p>I am also chairman of the retail company Khoury Home, the market leader in home appliances and decoration. This business has been severely affected by the crisis, mirroring the entire retail sector. Whenever these macro disasters strike, the retail sector takes the first hit. This is because the first victim of the crisis is deposits and loans, which spell a decrease in the purchasing power of consumers. The high interest rates on deposits have also encouraged people to put their money into deposits, rather than consumption. The suspension of the housing support from the Central Bank in 2018 also had a negative impact on our line of business. Finally, the war in Syria has further shrunk the market, limiting Lebanese exports. To respond to this challenge, our only strategy is to compress and limit expenses to achieve higher cost efficiency and weather the storm. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>An essential part of the global finance landscape, electronic trading platforms (ETPs) continue to evolve and grow in Lebanon. Just over a decade ago, most trading activity was executed by banks and financial institutions via phone and in trading rooms. Trading via e-platforms was something relatively new; only a few brokerage companies in Lebanon demonstrated an active interest in investing in their IT and ETP infrastructure. Nevertheless, the results of such investments soon proved to be a winning card for the brokerage houses that ventured in this direction, enabling them to reduce trading costs and offer highly competitive services. Zeina Zeidan, Chair of Royal Financials BoD, recalls her experience: “Back then, Lebanese investors had a choice between investing in the local markets presented by the Beirut Stock Exchange, which has but a few banks and companies listed, or looking for other investment opportunities. Investing in ETPs presented a whole new investment avenue for retail and professional investors. ETPs gave access to the global capital markets and made it easy to invest in liquid asset classes such as currencies, metals, commodities, stocks, ETFs, and CFDs."</p><p>ETPs reshaped the Lebanese trading landscape, granting small investors access to the capital markets and presenting renewed investment alternatives to SMEs. The industry operates in a healthy, regulated environment, whereby competition is based on criteria such as quality of market access, best execution, technology, and pricing. Inevitably, the market has become highly competitive, with a growing number of companies offering low-cost services, a large choice of asset classes, high-speed and high-tech execution, and superior customer service. Investing in IT is arguably the key factor in determining the strength and success of an ETP company. This includes first providing the best platform available.</p><p>Given the elasticity and scope of ETPs, it is unsurprising that these platforms are expected to play a key role in the recovery of the Lebanese economy, where capital markets are in bad need of revival due to many years of falling trading volumes and a depletion of liquidity traded on the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE). The latter has failed to promote a dynamic exchange to attract new companies, resulting in a stagnant number of listed companies and a deterioration in trading volumes. This is also reflected in its small size and short trading hours, with a market capitalization not exceeding USD9.2 billion, meaning the BSE has the fourth-lowest global market capitalization in 2018, dropping by 17% since 2017, with a trading volume down 36%.</p><p>The need for change is evident in certain asset classes, particularly with regards to Lebanese debt. The banking sector and financial institutions are now demonstrating goodwill in response to the current Capital Market Authority (CMA) request for proposal (RFP) strategy aimed at helping the economy by properly establishing and growing the capital markets via digital means.<br><br></p><p>The ETP bid was recently awarded to Bank Audi in partnership with Athena Stock Exchange. This plan includes a new ETP and the development of capital markets to cater for start-ups and provide the proper solution for investors to exit. Indeed, while in the past few years Lebanon has seen a number of laws and initiatives to support investing in start-ups, one of the main disadvantages was the lack of exit strategies for start-ups. The only way to exit was by selling to a private investor, without having the proper infrastructure for these start-ups to get listed. This set of plans should boost the confidence in the VC ecosystem by ensuring easy divestment through various methods and liquidity options. </p>]]></richbody0content>

It is important to note that during 4Q2017, all Ciments Blancs and Holcim Liban bearer shares were transferred into nominal shares following the issuance of law number 75/2016, which imposed on Lebanese companies the obligation of transferring their bearer shares into nominative shares. This transfer of shares has resulted in an increase in liquidity in these companies and can be attributed to the increase in their share price performance. In 2019, we expect a better performance for most of the listed companies because of positive growth expectations and an easing of some of the pressures from the Syrian conflict. </p><h4>To what extent should the existing Financial Market Law be modified to accelerate processes such as the privatization of the bourse?</h4><p>The Financial Market Law does not need modification, at least for the time being, as its articles have been drafted according to the most recent recognized international standards. The slow movement in the privatization of the bourse is due to the bureaucracy that we have in public administration, not due to the law itself. Although the process of privatization is not moving as fast as we need, the Lebanese Council of Ministers approved the formation of the BSE SAL as a joint stock company. It will replace the current BSE, which will be liquidated. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[citibank-lebanon]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Citi adapted its strategy to serve the current challenging conditions of the Lebanese market? </h4><p>Citi's model is target-market oriented. In Lebanon, we focus on standard institutional client groups such as multinationals, corporates, government and financial institutions, and banks. In the last three years, we have specifically focused on large Lebanese corporate groups that have growth in the wider region (i.e. Africa, the GCC, and Europe), including both companies established abroad while retaining ties to Lebanon and Lebanese companies that have expanded abroad. This latter segment has been particularly relevant to our strategy in recent years, as Lebanon has seen a broad outward movement of companies seeking to mitigate risk by diversifying markets and sectors of operations. Few international banks are able to support such an array of companies across vast jurisdictions such as Citi's, which is why this one of the pillars of our current strategy. </p><h4>How would you describe Citi's commitment to Lebanon?</h4><p>Citigroup's presence in Lebanon dates back to the 1950s when Beirut was the bank's training hub for the region. Since re-establishing its fully licensed Lebanon branch in 1996, the bank has been offering a full range of corporate and investment banking services to its target market clients. In addition, Citibank Lebanon is an active corporate citizen with a particular interest in supporting financial education, microfinance, and capacity building through various grants provided annually through the Citi Foundation. Lebanon is our oldest franchise in the region. </p><h4>What is your outlook on Lebanon's economic situation? </h4><p>Lebanon is currently facing a set of pressing challenges—from the current account deficit amounting to 23% to the 11% fiscal deficit—that have deteriorated the credit rating provided by international rating agencies. This in turn has negative repercussions on the behavior of depositors and investors. To turn the situation around, the government must first commit to embarking on the required path of fiscal and economic reform. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[comprehensive-flexibility]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What services do you provide?</h4><p>Bluering is a fintech company specialized in digital lending and credit risk solutions. We help banks offer modern lending services to the marketplace, thus enabling their process of digital transformation. We also help banks comply with regulations and meet credit risk requirements like Basel III and IFRS 9 (International Financial Reporting Standards). We offer products for banks that cover the whole range, from corporate and SME credit to retail lending.</p><h4>What are the biggest strengths of the product you offer?</h4><p>Our biggest strengths are the comprehensiveness and flexibility of the solution we offer. We are able to implement a comprehensive solution that applies to the full range of services covered by any commercial bank, including risk rating, credit scoring, workflow automation, and the definition of credit policy. Our product is also extremely flexible because it can operate in completely different organization structures and credit policies, thus accommodating different banks in different markets. We have the full intellectual property on any code we developed. We are also at the forefront of innovation and technological developments. </p><h4>Do you plan to solidify your presence abroad?</h4><p>We are market leaders in the Levant and looking to expand into neighboring regional markets such as the GCC, North Africa, and Nigeria. Our long-term vision is to become a major global player in the credit risk arena. First, we intend to strengthen our positioning in markets that are similar to the Lebanese one to leverage the necessary resources to later access developed markets. Moreover, since 2014 we have partnered with Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) to become the software platform of its risk rating models they offer to banks globally. This partnership, coming from a global market leader in credit risk, is an important endorsement for us and has cemented our reputation in the region.</p><h4>How would you rate the process of digital transformation among banks, globally and in Lebanon?</h4><p>Digitalization is a global phenomenon. Banks across the globe have been facing the challenge brought by fintech, incorporating elements of digital transformation into their model. At the moment, however, automation and digital transformation are more relevant to retail than corporate credit. While corporate credit accounts for three-quarters of the total lending portfolio, this involves a smaller number of customers. Retail credit, on the other hand, comprises an ever-growing number of customers and transactions that need to be automated to cut costs. With regard to Lebanon, banks are generally neither aggressive nor receptive in terms of digital transformation. Given the difficult conditions of the market, investing in digitalization should have represented an important asset for Lebanese banks. Sadly, however, digitization is not moving at the pace it should, which is related to the overprotective regulatory environment. This reduces pressure on local banks to increase their investments. All of this is reflected in the volume of our Lebanese operations, which does not exceed 20% of our total revenues. </p><h4>What is your opinion of the effect of Circular 331 on the knowledge economy?</h4><p>We started the company from scratch in 2007, long before the support channeled through Circular 331 came from the Central Bank. This was all the more challenging since we were selling our services to banks, which had the resources to purchase from any large international supplier. Nevertheless, we gradually succeeded in growing the company and creating a name for ourselves in the region. The start-up ecosystem considerably changed after 2014, when Circular 331 was issued, whose biggest accomplishment was to establish equity participation for banks in start-ups. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[capital-targets]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do the challenges and opportunities from 2018 compare to 2019?</h4><p>With a prolonged bottleneck in the formation of a government, 2018 presented many economic and political challenges for doing business in Lebanon. In order to minimize the effects of the political deadlock on the market, the Central Bank had to increase interest rates for both Lebanese pounds and USD as a measure to limit capital flight from Lebanon. This turned out to be a major challenge affecting the development of capital markets. Moreover, the lowering of credit rating by Moody's in 2H2018 also posed a challenge, which was reflected in the price of bonds and the overall performance of the market. However, we are optimistic, especially since the newly formed government has committed to prioritizing the economic situation by focusing on reducing debt refinancing and executing hard reforms. Today, as a direct result of the CEDRE Conference, Lebanon will see an investment of USD17 billion—USD11 billion given through soft loans and grants and USD6 billion through PPPs—into a proper capital investment program (CIP), with around 250 infrastructure projects in the pipeline, so the outlook is positive. Capital markets can play a major role in financing project development within the CIP, which falls in very well with the market development plans we are leading.</p><h4>What is the CMA's function in regulating the financial sector and boosting the economy?</h4><p>CMA is fairly new, though in its six years of existence it has managed to prepare a comprehensive regulatory framework for Lebanon's capital markets based on best business practices and international standards. CMA is an associate member of IOSCO, which provides international markets assurance that we abide by international standards. CMA's mandate is to regulate, supervise, and develop the capital markets. All three pillars were created on the notion of investor protection. We do this with the ultimate goal of protecting investors and safeguarding people from systemic risk. We create regulatory requirements for financial institutions and supervise them. We are a compliance-based market, though we seek to shift to a risk-based one. We make sure funds and other financial products offered today have passed through the CMA revision process and are subject to the required approval. Such measures are paramount to boosting investor confidence and therefore attracting both local and foreign liquidity to our capital markets. </p><h4>What is the rationale behind the launch of the Electronic Trade Platform (ETP), and what are its benefits?</h4><p>The greatest challenge for Lebanon's capital markets is the low level of capitalization of the Beirut Stock Exchange, which is around 20% of GDP. We would like to see the number of listed companies double by 2025 and reach a capitalization of around 50% of GDP. As it stands, the government-owned stock exchange will not be able to reach that target. The law that established CMA stipulated that the Beirut Stock Exchange be privatized within a year. As technical issues have delayed the this process, CMA will be moving forward with licensing an ETP, in essence complementing the role of the BSE by providing the ability to trade securities that are not offered by the current exchange such as commodities, forex, derivatives, corporate and government bonds, start-ups, and SME listings. In December 2018, we put out the bid documents for the ETP, and nine companies collected the bids. We hope to have offers by the end of May 2019 and award the license to an operator within two months.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[recipe-for-recovery]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you guide us through FFA's process of diversification? </h4><p>I started the company in 1993 after returning to Lebanon in light of the positive economic prospects brought by the end of the civil war. FFA started as a financial company with four people and has grown ever since. In 2006, we obtained a license to operate in Dubai's International Finance Centre, and in 2007 we transformed our license from a financial institution to a private bank, managing operations from our two headquarters in Dubai and Beirut. We are specialized in investment banking, private banking, and capital markets. The rationale behind our diversification process mainly stems from the need to respond to clients' investment needs; indeed, our core business comprises both investing and assisting corporations that need advisory, capital, raining, or M&amp;A services. Thus, our activities follow different directions based on strategic decisions and our clients' recommendations. We also have a real estate development arm with landmark projects in Lebanon and Europe and will soon to launch an infrastructure mezzanine fund for different kinds of infrastructure projects, mainly PPPs, across MENA and sub-Saharan Africa. We recently signed an MoU with the International Finance Corporation and are looking for an experienced infrastructure developer to join the venture by 4Q2019.</p><h4>What makes you among the best private banks in the Middle East?</h4><p>Our key strength lies in our team, which is composed of highly qualified and dedicated workers. Another essential pillar of our business is our one-on-one relationships with clients. While we do have some products that cater to smaller investors such as online trading, most of them are dedicated to high net worth individuals with whom we maintain a personal relationship built on trust. We want to understand what the client wants, which can take a lot of time. Moreover, the costs of acquiring and supporting the client are so high that we deal only with big ones.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the real estate sector in Lebanon?<br></h4><p>It has been suffering in recent years due to regional crises that have diminished the flow of investments here and increased the weight of the recession and public debt. The situation has also been aggravated by the increase in interest rates on deposits, which has slowed down investments in real estate. It is essential for our line of business to diversify activities, wait for the sector to pick up again, and look for investments elsewhere, especially in Europe. We differ from normal corporate or retail banks in that we do not benefit from soaring interest rates or financial engineering; therefore, it is crucial we find our way to diversify, innovate, and generate revenues.</p><h4>How should Lebanon improve its investment climate?</h4><p>Lebanon needs huge investments in infrastructure to restart the economy. These will have a direct effect on the economy, solving issues like electricity shortages or the budget deficit. The Capital Investment Plan is another brilliant idea to kick off economic growth. We need an efficient internet network, 24-hour electricity provision, and a well-maintained road network to positively affect the business and investment climate. On the front of the budget deficit, the government is showing a willingness to engage in reforms and cut the number of civil servants, which was inflated in the past due to political considerations. However, we would like to see a stronger commitment in this direction rather than simply raising taxes, which will have the opposite effect of restraining initiative from the private sector. For capital markets to have momentum, we need transparency, a growing economy, and a functioning stock market. Key to all of this is privatization. Until the Beirut Stock Exchange is made completely private and independent and follows the letter of the law, our capital markets will not be able to adequately develop. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-eternal-niche]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2018 for Lucid Investment Bank?</h4><p>We are an investment bank, so a good part of our work relies on raising equity and semi-equity. The prevailing high interest rates posed a serious challenge to our fundraising efforts, while investor confidence was also affected by the prevailing economic conditions. That said, there was a great deal of exaggeration. Coupled with high interest rates, this pushed investors away from the equity market, which created a negative equity situation in Lebanon. In reply, we scaled up our creativity and diversified our operations, though it was challenging.</p><h4>What are your criteria for selecting your clients?</h4><p>Our main clients are high and ultra-high-net-worth individuals in Lebanon and the diaspora. These clients have needs on a personal and corporate level, which is where Lucid Investment Bank steps in. We are an investment bank that caters to the needs of companies and provides services that allow them to finance their growth. Companies in a turnaround situation or facing issues often come to us for solutions and restructuring, sometimes even for our specialized financing products. We also serve clients wishing to sell their companies, merge, or make acquisitions. We are not looking to compete with commercial banks on traditional retail banking (although we provide medium- to long-term deposits), but are creating our own niche market. This is our Blue Ocean Strategy; our target is to create alternative investments, and we strive to be leaders in providing the best services.</p><h4>What makes the Lebanese economy so interesting and peculiar when it comes to investment?</h4><p>Currently, there is little fundamental difference in the economy. Recently, investments here have been perceived by foreign investors and expats as risky, though those with an emotional attachment to Lebanon are willing to assume those relative risks. Except for select investments, Lebanon does not have much of a competitive edge or advantage these days. In short, we are an emerging market, and those who understand the risks are also aware of the high returns. It is a challenging environment and truly requires a great deal of out-of-the-box thinking, but remains interesting for carefully selected and innovative investment schemes. </p><h4>What is the effect of interest rates on the investment market?</h4><p>The prevailing high interest rates makes it extremely difficult for equity investments to materialize. The current rates are caused by an increase in interest rates internationally as well as the Lebanese economic situation; however, we have always had problems in our country and have survived. We grew stronger in spite of them, thanks to experience and confidence in the banking sector. That said, the Central Bank of Lebanon and all the relevant regulatory bodies are steadfast in their mission of keeping the sector functioning in an optimal fashion. Overall, the banking sector is performing extremely well, as evidenced by the high level of foreign currency reserves, the stability of the Lebanese pound, and the healthy consolidated balance sheet of the banking sector. Finally, 2018, as is almost always the case, also saw positive net remittances into the country, which further reinforces people's trust in Lebanon.</p><h4>Which sectors are performing well?</h4><p>The banking sector continues to perform well thanks to the strict regulation that focuses on the correct implementation of rules and regulations. However, other sectors such as real estate are not performing well, which is why we created Legacy One, a dedicated real estate investment platform where Lucid is the financial administrator. Overall, most sectors have been negatively affected by the economic situation, as high interest rates  on deposits imply high interest on corporate loans, reaching prohibitive levels for any business to self-finance. However, the tourism sector continues to perform well, thanks to stronger security and the number of international-caliber festivals being held.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you contextualize the risks and opportunities of 2019 relative to the previous years?</h4><p>There are a number of alarming reports on the risks of a hard landing in Lebanon. The situation is certainly precarious but not desperate. If it is true that with a debt exceeding 150% of GDP and a budget deficit of more than 10% of GDP, the stability of monetary, exchange, and interest markets is at risk, Lebanon continues to have huge amounts of underutilized resources. Regarding budgetary revenues alone, the gap between actual and potential revenues stands at 10% of GDP. While part of this is certainly due to fiscal evasion, a large part is attributed also to the inefficiency of the fiscal administration in tax collection. On the spending side, waste and inefficiencies also represent no less than 5% of GDP. When we know that the required primary surplus to bring down debt ratios does not exceed 8% of GDP, we realize that the problem is more an issue of political governance rather than structural macroeconomic imbalances. Hence, the situation is more a question of willingness to adjust rather than availability of resources. Fortunately, the speech of the entire political class in Lebanon converged in 2019 toward the need for a more voluntary approach, which is very comforting.</p><h4>In 2018, Bank Audi registered an 8% increase in net profits. To which strategies and factors can you attribute this growth?</h4><p>2018 was indeed a good year for Bank Audi, which withstood persistently tough operating conditions in the region and managed to end the year with a sustained growth in activity and earnings and an improved financial flexibility within the context of good risk coverage. Bank Audi reported USD501 million in recurrent consolidated net profits after provisions, and taxes rose by 8% relative to the equivalent 2017 net profits. The bank's earnings power has strengthened in 2018 amid effective asset utilization policies, in particular Lebanese entities, which benefited from market opportunities totally offsetting the rising cost of deposits and the impact of new banking taxes. Subsequently, consolidated spread expanded from 2.39% as of end-December 2017 to 2.62% as of end-December 2018. In parallel, our performance management policy launched in 2017 has generated additional cost savings by USD81 million, driving an improvement in the cost-to-income ratio from 51.5% in 2017 to 46% in 2018.</p><h4>How would you describe your bank's comparative advantage?</h4><p>Beyond its size, strong regional footprint, wide diversification, and universal banking offering, which positions the group at the forefront of the Lebanese banking sector and among the top-20 Arab banking institutions, Bank Audi enjoys a number of additional visible competitive edges. The sustained growth and reinforcement of its financial flexibility over the past decades bears witness to a solid risk governance coupled with best corporate governance and compliance practices as well as an insightful management vision supported by a clear strategy. The bank also has implemented best practices in the realm of corporate social responsibility while having one of the best disclosure and transparency practices in the region. Bank Audi is a management-driven institution, which relies on a pool of qualified staff, 87% of whom are university graduates and whose main purpose is providing a dedicated service to all customers. Yet, what continuously differentiates Bank Audi is its unscathed eagerness to always innovate and advance. The international community, in particular rating agencies, has acknowledged all these competitive advantages.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the bank in 2019?</h4><p>Strengthening the balance sheet, reinforcing financial flexibility, and delivering a solid growth of recurrent net profits are the key headlines of Bank Audi for 2019. The group's main purpose remains to achieve quality growth by efficiently meeting the needs of both businesses and individuals in the various countries in which we are present and ensuring long-term sustainable value to all stakeholders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the mission of ICC?</h4><p>ICC has been entrusted with the mission of protecting the interests of different stakeholders in the insurance sector, with a particular focus on policyholders. Recently, ICC aligned its supervisory philosophy with the Insurance Core Principles and initiated sustained and consistent cooperation efforts with the other regulators in the financial services industry in Lebanon, such as the Capital Markets Authority and the Banking Control Commission. These efforts underline the importance that ICC places on the effectiveness of inter-regulatory work in combating illegal money transfers and suspicious transactions that can be engineered along the entire spectrum of financial services. This is all the more important in view of the Mutual Evaluation Report for Lebanon planned for 2021. A key component of ICC's mission is ensuring transparency and best governance practices in the sector. We guarantee this first by maintaining the strict independence of ICC from players in the sector and through a series of initiatives and measures set to align the Lebanese insurance market with international standards.</p><h4>What is the ICC's strategy?</h4><p>Our strategy is based on a combination of incentives and penalties that promote compliance to international best practices and good governance. ICC recently implemented a risk-based-supervision approach, whereby companies are scored according to their financial condition and market conduct dimensions and classified based on their overall risk profile. ICC would allocate minimal supervisory efforts to companies with a good score, while insurers with shaky positions and/or doubtful market conduct are thoroughly scrutinized. The score we attribute to companies reflects the risk-return profile of the company in all its measurable dimensions. Cross-market considerations that could generate systemic risks are identified and treated proportionally. In the same context, the commission is implementing group-wide supervision in cooperation with other insurance supervisors to tackle complex insurance conglomerates, spanning a broad range of insurance and auxiliary activities operating in several jurisdictions.</p><h4>Would you describe the Lebanese insurance market as overly competitive?</h4><p>Not necessarily. Despite Lebanon's limited size, the country could serve as a platform for the region and access much larger markets. In fact, while public attention tends to the high number of insurance companies—51—competing for a small market, the local market is largely concentrated. Respectively, over 85% of the life insurance business and 65% of the non-life business are written by 10 insurers. Concentration has been steadily increasing, which indicates that smaller players are facing growing challenges in achieving sustainable profitable growth. Various supervisory actions, implemented and planned, put pressure on smaller players to upgrade their operations or find alternative business models. In this context, innovation and digitalization in services and process could play a fundamental role in transforming a small ordinary player into a niche player. That can turn into an insurance powerhouse. In case such ventures are challenging, insurers need to join forces to achieve scale. The ultimate objective pursued by the ICC is to enhance the productivity and the competitiveness of the sector, which is extremely promising. The Levant—Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Jordan—has an estimated population of 72 million with a young age pyramid. It can be expected to yield insurance premiums exceeding USD40 billion. This is staggering unexploited potential. The insurance sector in Lebanon can act as a natural platform of insurance services for the region, which was a single jurisdiction less than 100 years ago, where people and capital could move freely in a vast economic space. The fulfillment of this vision requires focused investment in the key success factors, mainly governance, risk management capabilities, digitalization, and consolidation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you contextualize the risks and opportunities of 2019 relative to the past three years?</h4><p>The formation of the new government constitutes an important milestone in the restoration of consumer and investor confidence in Lebanon and is vital for the country's decision-making processes, the proper functioning of its institutions, and the implementation of the necessary reform measures, paving the way for the unlocking of the pledged funds during the CEDRE conference. The effective execution of the pledged reforms, along with tangible progress in the oil and gas sector and the adoption of other initiatives to boost economic growth and mend the country's ailing public finances, will lead to an era of economic prosperity for all sectors of the economy, including the banking sector. In fact, banks' operating environment would undoubtedly improve, with the pressure caused by heightened political and economic uncertainties gradually dissipating and lending opportunities blooming. Nonetheless, such a rosy picture can only see the light if the government effectively honors its commitments to the pledged reforms, which could even prompt international rating agencies to reconsider their recent rating actions on Lebanon. Without these reforms, the risks and challenges that have been plaguing the economy and its banking sector throughout the past year will most likely prevail.</p><h4>Do you anticipate growth or contraction in domestic deposit rates in the next 12 months?</h4><p>2018 saw an important increase in interest rates on customer deposits as banks strived to curb any deposit outflows amid the heightened uncertainties. Notwithstanding the lengthy government formation process, customer deposits at commercial banks in Lebanon increased by 3.23% during 2018 to nearly attain USD179 billion. The start of 2019, however, was earmarked by the long-awaited formation of a government, and slowly but surely, investor confidence is being restored as evidenced by the sharp contraction in Lebanon's Credit Default Swaps (CDS) from around 900 basis points in mid-January to below 800 basis points in March. Accordingly, and barring any setbacks in the political environment, we expect deposits to grow in 2019 and at a faster pace than that registered in 2018.</p><h4>Which actions are most important for the government in the next 12 months?</h4><p>The prevailing economic and fiscal situations, let alone the conditions of the CEDRE conference, necessitate the quick implementation of a wide array of reforms; indeed, the new government's policy statement largely focused on tackling said issue. Amongst the most important and urgent reforms that must be implemented is the involvement of the private sector in the electricity sector, combatting tax evasion and improving the collection of taxes, and promoting efficiency in public institutions. More specifically, the ailing situation of the electricity sector has been a major drain on public finances, constituting 14.5% of government primary expenditures due to low pricing, inefficient generation, and technical and non-technical losses. Meanwhile, tax evasion, be it for the VAT, port and airport customs, or the corporate income tax, among others, constitutes a major opportunity cost for the government, and taking corrective action thereupon would be a much better solution than increasing taxes. Regarding efficiency levels at public institutions, it is imperative to review headcounts and freeze irrational recruitment, with the ultimate objective of trimming public expenditures.</p><h4>You are also the chairman and GM of Credit Libanais, one of Lebanon's leading banks. Does your outlook for the bank mirror your outlook for the sector?</h4><p>The Credit Libanais group recorded a robust performance in 2018, with net profits increasing by 2.42% to USD83.36 million. In addition, the group's total assets rose by 7.77% to USD12.46 billion, with customer deposits and shareholders' equity attaining USD9.34 billion and USD994.46 million, respectively. As far as the prospects for 2019 are concerned, we expect a better outlook for the bank and the sector in the event palpable progress in Lebanon's revamped economic journey is seen.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As governor of the central bank, how would you describe Lebanon's economic situation in early 2019 relative to the previous two or three years?</h4><p>If we look at the results of 2018, confidence remains strong in the financial sector because there was a 3.8% increase in the country's deposit base compared to 2017. That was an important indicator, because Lebanon had political tensions in 2018 that caused a delay in the formation of the government. The banking sector grew its deposits by USD7.8 billion, and there was an acceptable balance of payments. It was also a year when interest rates rose globally, especially in emerging markets. Interest rates increased, though below what they should have been given our ratings by the various agencies. In 2019, the focus is on the government's budget as ratings agencies downgraded Lebanon because they had doubts about the sustainability of funding due to the deficit being higher than it should be. The deficit compared to GDP in 2018 was at 11% but had been expected to be at or below 10%. The reduction of the deficit for 2019 is well emphasized in the budget of this year.</p><h4>The passage of key reforms is crucial to Lebanon's future. Which reforms will be the most important in the coming six months?</h4><p>The new government received the confidence of almost the entire parliament based on the program it presented. It has several pillars to work on, namely reducing the budget deficit, fighting corruption, and implementing economic reforms using CEDRE funds from the April 2018 conference. The government's priority is to fix the electricity sector, which represents the biggest share of its deficit. Reforms go along with political agreements and depending on the political agreements that are supposed to take place, we will be able to judge the efficiency of the implementation. However, the intentions have been publicly stated. If we were to see progress on electricity reforms in the next six months, this would send a positive note to the country and would effectively be the beginning of a structural reform in the budget. This would be the first time in many years because the deficit has been increasing steadily for the last 10 years at least.</p><h4>If the reforms come to pass, would BDL's current toolbox of unconventional policies, which have some attendant costs, remain?</h4><p>The Lebanese Central Bank, like other central banks around the world, has a mandate to ensure stability. Based on this mandate, the central bank has worked, often by anticipation, to maintain a high level of reserves. That has proven to be the right approach because of Lebanon's political—and therefore economic and social—volatility. This is especially true with the Syrian war and its implications for Lebanon in terms of the high number of refugees, the economic slowdown, and the resulting difficulties in exporting and attracting consumers from the Gulf. Given this atmosphere, BDL has continuously introduced tools to fulfill its objective. The central bank will shift to a conventional approach when it feels things are in order. That will be determined when it sees what happens with the budget deficit on the one side and with the implementation of CEDRE on the other, because if we want a productive economy, we need infrastructure.</p><h4>What is your outlook for BDL and the broader economy for 2019?</h4><p>We cannot predict an outlook given the volatility of the region. However, there are certain pillars on which one can rely. The first is that Lebanon has shown resiliency because the country has lived through wars and internal security issues and has continued to perform despite all that. Any good news could trigger more growth in the country. We are not in control of what might happen in the region that could affect us, though if things in the region improve, Lebanon will be in a better situation economically.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main priorities for LCEC?</h4><p>LCEC is the technical arm of the Ministry of Energy and Water for the development of policies and implementation of projects regarding renewable energy and energy efficiency. In the renewable energy field, we are developing four tracks. The first is the implementation of three wind farms totaling 220MW to be operational by 2020—the first project of such magnitude in Lebanon's history. We are also launching a second bid round for windfarms to install an additional 400MW and are finalizing our request for proposals with the support of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Third, we are about to select the 12 companies to build 12 solar farms of 15MW each and hope to have this done by 3Q2019. The fourth track, again with the support of EBRD, is a request for proposals to build 300-MW solar farms with battery storage. Hydro could be used in the future to contribute to our 2025-2030 objectives, though it is not in our immediate targets, because solar and wind are easier to develop and implement. Hydro also entails considerations because it includes different players with the right to access water streams. </p><h4>What about the development of energy efficiency initiatives?</h4><p>In terms of energy efficiency, we have developed two national financing mechanisms with the Central Bank of Lebanon. One is the National Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Action (NEEREA), for energy efficiency, and the other is the Lebanese Environmental Action (LEA), for environmental projects. Another big project is with regards to heat pumps, which we have developed through the support of the Italian Ministry for the Environment, Land, and Sea (IMELS-MATTM). We are working on a decree to make these mandatory in all new buildings together with solar water heaters. We also have some small projects to maintain and repair solar public street lighting. Furthermore, we have converted 10 public buildings to solar photovoltaic (PV) to demonstrate its use in public buildings. These are pilot projects that have potential to be replicated elsewhere. For example, we are supporting the Ministry of Education and Higher Education to have around 130 public schools converted to solar. We are also working on a number of projects on energy-efficient home appliances. The combined result of all these projects will enable us to reach our stated goal of reaching 12% share of renewable energies by 2020 and 30% by 2030. The first goal will be easily attainable as a result of our current and upcoming projects; however, the second goal will be more demanding and will require a commitment from all sectors of the economy.</p><h4>How would you rate the participation of local companies in the green economy? </h4><p>A great deal of the momentum comes from local companies. We already have more than 170 companies working on solar PV, more than 220 working on solar water heaters, and about 40 working on heat pumps. The green economy sector in Lebanon is based on a decentralized approach, and this entails the participation of local businesses. As larger projects come about, we see a mixture of local and international companies, often joining forces. We are developing the bidding documents to oblige consortia to have at least one local and one international company for big projects. Likewise, for joint ventures, we typically see a combination of three or four companies, which seems like a good recipe for success. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key priorities for the Ministry of Environment (MOE)?</h4><p>MOE is facing probably the biggest environmental crisis in the history of Lebanon, namely the enormous pollution that affects our lands, sea, and rivers, the result of decades-long negligence. Expectations from the MOE are extremely high and, unfortunately, not correlated to the budget available at our disposal. The first priority is to deal with the solid waste crisis, which has become a nightmare, especially in Beirut and Mount Lebanon.</p><h4>How do you intend to tackle the waste crisis?</h4><p>We have recently prepared a master plan and road map that I have to present to the Council of Ministers for approval. The philosophy behind the plan is to give the private sector a larger role due to the fact that public institutions were not able to fulfill their commitments and duties. Our role will be to supervise the private sector and put in place rules and regulations. We have divided Lebanon into 12 service zones. Different companies will bid for the contract for each zone, with no more than two zones awarded to the same company, to avoid a monopoly. Competition is key to keeping prices low and service levels high. Companies will also be able to bring in their own technology and solutions based on the market and the types of waste we have in Lebanon (e.g. medical, industrial, household). As a temporary solution, we intend to convert some of Lebanon's 960 illegal dumps into sanitary landfills. This will represent a transition phase, while awaiting the awarding of waste management tenders, which may take up to two years. We are also checking which of the 1,370 illegal quarries can be converted or used as landfills. This means stopping the corruption and illegal decisions that have prevailed to date. We are currently presenting our new master plan for quarries to the Council of Ministers, and we seek to involve public opinion through social media to raise awareness and bypass any political obstacles. I am confident we will see some positive results on this front, especially given the productive and transparent collaboration between the ministries. At the end of the day, taking care of the environment is not only the duty of this ministry, but all stakeholders.</p><h4>What is the MOE's commitment to tackling climate change?</h4><p>Climate change is an important priority for MOE. Lebanon has ratified a number of international initiatives, including the Paris and Montreal agreements. Now it is time to implement these commitments and ensure we reduce the impact of our economic activities on the environment. We receive great support and funding from international donors, such as the EU, to remain aligned with these requirements. An important component of this strategy is reducing emissions from private and public means of transportation. Moreover, Lebanon now abides by international laws such as the Basel Agreement to prohibit certain polluting products. Industries are receiving consultancy services and changing their filtering and production systems and manufacturing lines to ensure environmental conformity.</p><h4>Does the MOE play a role in the nascent gas industry in Lebanon?</h4><p>There is a productive collaboration with the gas industry. MOE has approved the EIA and Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) that was recently undertaken by the Lebanese Petroleum Administration (LPA). More recently, MOE has formed a partnership with the Ministry of Energy and Waters and LPA to access the database derived from the baseline survey undertaken by Total. This will provide us access to diverse information on Lebanon's ecosystem and biodiversity that we did not possess before. The data will also give us valuable indicators and a benchmark by which to determine whether oil exploration has any adverse effects on our waters over time. MOE has also presented a plan to receive a percentage of gas revenues to compensate for the inevitable trade-off between underwater drilling and the environment. Given the ministry's small budget, this money will provide an important contribution to environmental projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are IDAL's mandates?</h4><p>IDAL is an investment promotion and development agency with several mandates. We encourage direct investments in Lebanon in targeted productive sectors such as industry, tourism, agriculture, agro-industry, technology, IT, telecommunication, and media. Unemployment is currently Lebanon's main issue; we want to put a stop to the “brain drain" and provide opportunities to young graduates. We also promote Lebanese exports especially agricultural and industrial products. Agriculture is particularly neglected by development efforts in Lebanon due to the limited size of arable land. We developed a program called “Agri Plus" to encourage exports of products with added value and high return. Since Lebanon cannot compete with mass production, our best bet is to support high-quality production. IDAL provides incentives to the exporters based on the quality of packaging, levels of presentation, and their destination market, so that they can add value to the agriculture produce and create side jobs. We also facilitate access to the international market for some products to boost demand for products on the one hand and guide exporters in the right direction on the other.</p><h4>What is IDAL's involvement in terms of policy recommendations?</h4><p>One of IDAL's roles is to assist the government in policy recommendations that can stimulate investments. This is part of a three-pillar strategy, which includes infrastructure projects through PPPs and investments in new promising sectors (as recommended by the McKinsey report). Our set of recommendations are incorporated also in the UNCTAD's Investment Policy Review of Lebanon, which will later be implemented across all ministries. We started working on enhancing the investment climate in Lebanon, through various reform initiatives. The current priority areas of intervention are the amendments to the decrees of Investment Law No. 360, which will ensure more flexibility and capability to support SMEs. Another priority is the transition to an e-government platform, which is now going to take place in several ministries.</p><h4>What role can the Lebanese diaspora play in terms of investing in Lebanon?</h4><p>We are in direct contact with the diaspora to encourage diaspora direct investment and to strengthen economic linkages with Lebanon depending on their position in their adopted countries and sectors of interest. For example, if a Lebanese entrepreneur abroad resorts to a sub-contractor in Lebanon for a service required by his or her production activity in the host-country, this will have a positive impact on the local export sector. Given the size of the diaspora, its involvement could represent a win card for Lebanon. Since many entrepreneurs hesitate to directly invest in Lebanon due to regional insecurity, we launched a program called “one product, one cluster." Through this program, the diaspora can develop a cluster of one product that is owned by a Lebanese entrepreneur and supported by the diaspora in a win-win situation. This is not a direct investment, but a way to share investment with the local community. At present, IDAL is establishing a cluster for dairy products.</p><h4>From the perspective of a foreign investor, why Lebanon?</h4><p>Lebanon has a great geographic location in between three continents. It boasts an open market economy—one of the oldest in the region—which is entrepreneur-friendly. Our main treasure is our human talent. Another pillar of our offer is the easy access to finance within Lebanon, with deposits of around four times our GDP that grant the country financial stability. We also have several programs that support the production sector. There is also a legal infrastructure that is grounded to help secure ownership and investment within Lebanon. We are now in a process of enhancing our transport infrastructure; once completed, it will transform Lebanon into a hub for production and exports. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the Bank's performance in 2018, and what are your expectations for 2019?</h4><p>BBAC performed resiliently in a year that was marked by a number of sector-wide challenges. BBAC reengineered its financial portfolio to take advantage of new opportunities, posting 5.5% deposit growth that compares favorably to the alpha average of 2.1%. Assets grew 17.3%, comfortably surpassing the alpha average of 11.3%. Despite a growing deficit in the balance of payment, BBAC scored 9% growth in foreign currency deposits, compared to the alpha average of 5.61%. The bank's performance drove up BBAC's ranking in deposits and asset growth to number five nationally, compared to 10th place prior. While net interest income declined 2.95%, the bank boosted non-interest income by prioritizing recovery on non-performing loans, enhancing financial instruments and FX trading, and developing new banking services. This led to a 5.3% growth in net profits, comparing favorably to the alpha average, which declined by 3.36%. In 2019, BBAC will reinforce positive momentum by expanding its branch networking, accelerating a transformation to digital banking, and investing in qualified human resources. These programs will allow for a 6% expected growth in deposits, driving a similar percentage increase in assets and profits.</p><h4>How does BBAC target SMEs?</h4><p>SMEs account for some 82% of all companies in the Lebanese economy. They are a valuable target market. BBAC has pioneered SME lending since the late seventies and is now looking to strengthen its engagement with SMEs. By the end of 2018, the bank had made 42.5% of its performing loans to SMEs. The bank offers preferential terms and zero-commission structures for cheque and cash deposits. Apart from financing to facilitate company creation, BBAC cultivates a lifecycle relationship with SME clients, and services their capital financing needs as the business expands. A recent agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) facilitates BBAC in offering longer-term financing to SMEs at market-beating rates. The bank also sponsors trade unions, manufacturers, and farmers across the country to develop long-term relationships, understand their requirements, and better meet their needs.</p><h4>In what ways do you intend to expand your customer base?</h4><p>A caring ethos is embedded in BBAC's corporate culture. Our close relationship with our clients is the cornerstone of our image and all our activities. This has even been codified in our logo. The logo's interlocking circles portray perfect synergy between two partners—with BBAC represented in blue and the client in aqua—where they both bring value to one another and grow together in mutual harmony. The pursuit of steady growth is focused on building a solid customer base relying on developing a customer-centric approach that incorporates many factors. First, BBAC intends to develop tailored products with a better value for customers, through a Client Relationship Management (CRM) solution that provides a 360-degree view of customer relationship and data insights. BBAC also aims to deliver a higher quality experience to customers by investing in IT infrastructure and upgrading technology. BBAC is catalyzing a multichannel approach where the customer experience is connected across physical branches, digital, and app channels. Expanding digital banking services will be crucial to target different customer segments. Faster and more convenient personalized transactions will boost engagement with younger audiences. Equally important we will be improving the level of BBAC's already superior customer service to satisfy all clients. Finally, BBAC is undertaking a program of physical expansion, looking at new strategic locations in Lebanon and abroad. The bank already counts 41 locations in Lebanon, three branches in Iraq, and one branch in Cyprus, in addition to two representative offices in the UAE and Nigeria.</p><h4>In what terms would you describe the bank's CSR approach?</h4><p>BBAC is cognizant that a responsible approach to business is a decisive factor in determining the long-term viability and success of the bank. For over 60 years, BBAC has actively engaged in a range of well-selected and tailored CSR initiatives. Among some of its most prominent areas of engagement are health and the environment, economic affairs, humanitarian and social issues, in addition to contributions in the arenas of culture and arts, sports, education and youth programs. BBAC also counts on the valuable volunteering and fundraising efforts of its employees. As examples of a few instances of the bank's social commitment, in 2010 BBAC championed the case of women's rights by being the first bank in Lebanon to welcome mothers, acknowledging their right to open a bank account for the benefit of their minor children through the “Mother Account." BBAC also offers a credit card to support the Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon (CCCL), whereby a part of the earnings are channeled to support the NGO's missions and activities. In 2012, the bank entered a partnership with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) on the 'Live Lebanon' initiative. The three-year partnership implemented 42 projects to reach 250,000 direct and 600,000 indirect beneficiaries across the areas of economic development, healthcare, youth support, and environmental protection in rural and underdeveloped communities. For its efforts in the Live Lebanon initiative, the bank received the 2013 Social Economic Award in the 'Rural Development' category. In 2019, BBAC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Saint Joseph University to establish a joint fund in the name of late Sheikh Toufic Assaf, who founded BBAC in 1956. The fund aims at granting scholarships to deserving students in need of assistance to pursue higher education.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Are you optimistic about the changes in the political situation in 2019?</h4><p>The year 2018 was a difficult one for Lebanon. Now things have stabilized thanks to the formation of a new government, which gives us reason for hope. Nevertheless, this government will have a big task in tackling Lebanon's difficult economic situation and undertaking the necessary reforms. The most important item to look at is the decrease in the dual budget and trade balance deficit. If one looks at the former, around 33% stems from the financing of the EDL. Similarly, looking at the latter, the major item we are importing is fuel. Reforming the electricity sector and its revenues would thus result in a significant reduction in both deficits. This would give us a balance we can live with until there are more reforms. The international community is asking Lebanon to proceed with its reforms, and then it will provide funding for infrastructure investment to boost economic growth, rather than giving us money before reforms, as happened in the past. Making aid accountable to the reforms undertaken instills a sense of ownership and value to the process of reformation and creates an incentive for politicians to act. I think that the trade balance presents the main challenge. Due to its large diaspora, Lebanon can also count on a large inflow of remittances. As long as there are dollars coming into the country and increasing the reserves at the central bank, Lebanon will stay afloat. We experienced problems over the last two years because we had a negative balance of payments, which is made up of our trade balance versus remittances from foreign workers and capital inflows. As long as capital inflows are larger than the trade deficit, you have a balance of payments surplus that will finance the government's deficit in US dollars. But when you have a deficit in the balance of payments, dollars move out of the country. </p><h4>Does BSL have a strategy to increase deposits?</h4><p>In 2018, our loan base grew by more than 10% and our deposit base by more than 7%, even when the market barely grew. Our deposits' growth stems from our expansion into the retail and commercial banking arenas. We brought on board several new young branch managers who are dynamic and technology savvy and launched several highly successful retail products (car loans, home loans, cards), which increased our customers' base and allowed up-selling and cross-selling. We also invested heavily in technology by launching first-class personal and corporate online banking in addition to the implementation of a first-of-its-kind loyalty program 'Moments,' based on the idea that 'every moment counts.' This unique program doesn't only depend on spending; almost every transaction done through our bank earns our customers 'moments' that can be redeemed in miles (on almost all airlines), hotel bookings, car rental, cash, or even household appliances. </p><h4>What is BSL's target client base?</h4><p>Our target client base is the younger generation and older millennials, i.e. university graduates between 25 and 45 years old who are in charge of their lives. We have set up a range of products to specifically cater to this group. We have a very attractive housing loan, for example, in addition to a very good car loan. Importantly, while we are targeting this young generation, the base of our banking philosophy is to assist them in their basic banking needs without spoiling them. Banking is a social responsibility. We take a humane and honest approach to banking, with full disclosure and transparency, so our customers know exactly what they are paying for when they get a loan. Given these tough economic times, it is important that banks fulfill their social role. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the vision behind Capital Concept?</h4><p>Capital Concept is a corporate governance and ESG advisory firm; we advise our clients on complying with ESG principles and standards that uphold best-in-class business environmental, social, and governance practices. We have advised the biggest corporations in Lebanon and the region on how to comply with these practices. Our shareholder rights are proprietary methodologies developed with UN Lebanon, IFC, and EBRD. While they are anchored in UN Business and Human Rights Guiding Principles, they are also aligned with investor expectations. In 2014, we also launched a not-for-profit initiative, the governance and integrity rating (GIR), whereby we do research on corporate practices and open-source investigation of banks, collecting all publicly available information. Based on our findings, we rate them and advocate for change, holding corporates responsible for their behavior. To preserve our full independence, we do not give awards or glorify anyone. This triggers a positive inflection point in corporate practices. Among the 1,486 companies that we rated in 2015 and 2017, the ones that achieved excellent ratings sought to retain or improve their ratings while those with low ratings worked hard to improve them. We also have a whistleblowing mechanism; if any stakeholder feels their rights are being infringed, we investigate the violation and expose bad practices.</p><h4>How would you summarize your findings?</h4><p>The banking industry and finance sector are the quickest to adapt and adhere to best practices. All companies that do not belong in highly regulated spaces still drag behind, while banking and financial institutions generally work hard to demonstrate their commitment to the best environmental, social, and governance practices. These financial companies demonstrated a more resilient risk posture in the last 20 years and a stronger ability to absorb shocks. These companies were also able to grow in value faster than companies that are not ESG compliant. Our research exposed higher levels of volatility, turnovers, bankruptcy rates, and insolvency within companies that are not compliant. Thus, given the public administration reforms on the horizon, the banking sector can stand out as an example of transparency and efficiency for our policymakers, and it has been so at least for the last 30 years. Lebanon has to start with serious soul searching to understand that the cost of corruption is much bigger than that of virtuous practices, and that adherence to transparency brings undeniable benefits. The process of dismantling a system that is corrupt at the core will take a long time, though now is the moment to start.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on McKinsey's Lebanon Economic Vision report?</h4><p>The problem with the McKinsey report is that it was published at a time when people were expecting something totally different, i.e. an economic plan to save Lebanon with precise recommendations and a vision of the type of economy to adopt. Instead, the report serves as an analysis of the productive sectors in Lebanon. Moreover, the report did not take into account basic principles such as food sufficiency or energy independence, which are strategic for any nation but were left out in Lebanon's case. The report also ignores essential parts of the social contract behind state and citizens, such as poverty, education, gender equality, and so on. The government's priority is to fight corruption; unless we seriously tackle the problem of corruption, I do not see any chance of saving this country. The government should seriously demonstrate its ability to at least make sure judicial oversight is independent. If we can tackle corruption and seriously commit to these principles and standards, Lebanon will become attractive to investors. If we can commit to best-in-class practices and send the right signals to the international community, then we do not need the USD11-billion CEDRE loans and grants, as Lebanon has the potential attract so much more than this. I am pleased the international community is willing to lend us USD11 billion; however, I would rather be attractive to investors than lenders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of the bank's presence globally and in Lebanon?</h4><p>EBRD promotes the development of the private sector and entrepreneurial initiative in 38 economies across three continents. The bank is owned by 68 countries as well as the EU and the European Investment Bank (EIB). EBRD investments are aimed at making economies in their respective regions competitive, inclusive, well governed, green, resilient, and integrated. In 2018, EBRD financed 395 projects worth a total of EUR9.5 billion. The bank is well on its way to meeting a target of 40% of its annual investments to the green economy by 2020, up from its present share of 36%. Lebanon is EBRD's newest country of operation. Interestingly, EBRD's arrival in Lebanon coincided with a rather critical timing, both politically and economically, as the country faces macro and fiscal challenges that necessitate reforms. This is an important period for the Lebanese people and Lebanon's economy. The country is facing macro and fiscal challenges that necessitate reforms. This would ultimately allow Lebanon's high-capacity private sector to grow and help the people of Lebanon who have been greatly impacted by a period of slow economic growth. The EBRD's investments aim to help the Lebanese economy. We have come at the right time. We will focus on the private sector, but we see a useful role for our institution helping the government with core infrastructure to provide lasting benefits to the country.</p><h4>What is your involvement on the front of the green economy and the energy sector?</h4><p>Energy and the green economy are one of our main priorities in the country. In 2018, we closed our first corporate deal with a private electricity distribution services provider. In 2018, we invested in the first green bond in Lebanon with a partner bank and also introduced a program called the Green Economy Financing Facility with a USD100-million loan that provides financing through a local partner bank to invest in and incentivize the use of energy-efficient technologies and renewable energies. Besides green financing, we are actively exploring key sovereign projects and PPPs, including for renewable energy as well as core infrastructure to improve the provision of electricity. We helped the government develop the first bankable PPA and will provide technical assistance to help develop the tenders for the upcoming solar plus storage tender for around 300MW. We also intend to assist the government with the tender for the second round of wind farms. Another interesting upcoming area of work will be a pre-feasibility study on the potential for a solar PV project in the Tufail region. Following previous work done by the American University of Beirut (AUB) that identified the potential for solar PV capacity in this region, EBRD decided to fund a study to assess the feasibility of such a project. We are still in the early stages, though we are hopeful of positive outcomes.</p><h4>What is your commitment to support SMEs?</h4><p>According to the World Bank, SMEs account for 97% of the Lebanese economy. Due to the high interest rates on deposits, SMEs all across the country experience difficulties in accessing financing, which in turn negatively impacts the economy. We have made SMEs one of our areas of focus through a multi-prong strategy. The first component is providing a SME credit line through local banks, which directly provides financing for local SMEs. The second component is an EU-funded advisory program called Advice for Small Business, whereby through a cost-sharing arrangement, we connect SMEs to local or international consultants to provide them advice on issues such as marketing strategies or accessing a foreign market. The cost-share model ensures a stronger commitment to the ultimate outcome on all sides. We can also directly finance larger SMEs. Finally, from a broader perspective, we will support SMEs by investing in the infrastructure, primarily in the transport and electricity sectors, which represent important preconditions to a healthy business environment. </p>]]></url>

		<url><![CDATA[thriving-city]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your major accomplishments thus far in reviving the city and improving livelihoods?</h4><p>The economy and development of the city are directly related to its infrastructure, which has been one of our major focuses, for example, separating the sewage and storm water systems, upgrading streets and walkways, and doing environmental projects to make Beirut greener and more sustainable. We have contracted 15 projects in these areas, and our target is for Beirut to have a fully sustainable infrastructure that is all connected in four years' time. With respect to cars and traffic congestion, one of Beirut's major problems, we are doing three things. Firstly, we are increasing public spaces and providing more off-street car parking. Every day, some 500,000 cars come into the city, and we need to work on reducing this number as much as possible. We have developed a plan with the World Bank to create a bus rapid transit (BRT) system by 2020 to provide better public transport as well as discourage people from driving. We are tendering for a bicycle lane around Beirut and will encourage people to use electric cars to protect the environment. In addition, Beirut requires 600-650MW of power, though we only receive 450MW. We have worked with an international consultant and came up with a solution to generate 150-200MW to overcome the deficit. This plan complements the Ministry of Power and Water's plan for a 24/7 power system. The municipal solid waste issue is one of our main concerns, and we had to come up with a plan that is sustainable, environmentally sound, and financially feasible. The plan that we have approved will work on: reducing the amount of waste by introducing alternative products that can be used more often and recycled at the end of their lives; encouraging sorting from source, with several initiatives being launched with universities, schools, and government offices to encourage, train, and sort material that can be recycled; and sending the remaining waste to a plant with a state-of-the-art sorting facility and convert the remainder into energy through a waste-to-energy facility. We have incorporated the EU experience with waste management into a tender and have qualified four consortia to build a plant based on a 25-year design, build, finance, operate, and transfer model (DBFOT).</p><h4>Besides infrastructure, what are the city's priorities for 2019?</h4><p>In 2020, we want to start turning Beirut into a smart city. We need to start by upgrading the municipality's own operations and processes, which are still based on paperwork. The population is not satisfied with our performance and transparency. The first step is to automate all our operations and office processes. We are also creating a city ID that residents can use to pay fines or fees without having to come into our offices. Our second step on the way to creating a smart city is to change all our streetlights to LED lighting with an IoT control system. That tender should be ready within 4Q2019.</p><h4>What can the Municipal Council of Beirut do to boost the city's image and get more investors in?</h4><p>The real estate business is a top priority for Beirut, and we are working with the Central Bank on it. Tourism is the second-biggest economy booster. If we have clean beaches, excellent infrastructure, a great airport, and a well-connected transportation system, tourism will grow. The airport and the infrastructure projects are in the pipeline. The municipality is organizing many events every season to encourage domestic and international tourism. We have held major events during Ramadan in addition to other summer events that have been extremely successful. More than 120,000 people attended the New Year mega parties downtown, and we had international television coverage from major stations. I am optimistic; in two or three years' time, I will be able to hand Beirut over to a new mayor in excellent condition. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What should be the new cabinet's priority areas of reform?</h4><p>After having recently adopted the electricity reform plan, our priority is to reduce the fiscal deficit to GDP from 11.47% in 2018 to below 7.59% in 2019. To do that, we have adopted measures to strengthen the fiscal framework and combat tax evasion; these measures are in fact part of an uninterrupted reform process that shall be reflected in the 2020 budget. Lebanon has a widening twin deficit, marked by a USD12.5-billion current account deficit that largely stems from a trade deficit of USD16 billion and a fiscal deficit that we have started to reduce. Besides having low exports of goods valued at less than USD4 billion, tourism has declined in recent years, which has also exacerbated our current account deficit and reduced net income from tourism. Yet, we are optimistic that the situation can be reversed, especially starting from 2H2019. Our present goal is to reduce the budget deficit from USD6.3 billion in 2018 to USD4.5 billion in 2019 and gradually shrink the trade deficit and increase net income from services in order to curb the current account deficit. It is imperative to adopt measures that will foster national production and exports, which requires bold decisions. We are currently working with an inter-ministerial committee toward that end, and a huge opportunity will be presented by PPPs, with at least three projects under consideration: an airport, a megadata center, and a hospital.</p><h4>What is your position on the set of reforms demanded by the CEDRE conference?</h4><p>The CEDRE reforms represent an absolute and voluntary commitment of the government toward reducing structural imbalances and creating sustainable growth. CEDRE is an important catalyzer of funds that will support the re-modernization of Lebanon's infrastructure. However, while we appreciate the support of the international community, it is important to note that the Syrian conflict significantly impacted our economic growth; between 2006 and 2010, Lebanon registered a cumulative positive balance of payments surplus of around USD20 billion. The massive influx of Syrian refugees aggravated the labor market conditions and amplified the demand for the provision of public services, including health and education. Consequently, the quality of provided services has fallen, public finances have been weighed down, and, ultimately, the increase in the size of the public sector has generated a crowding out of private investments. While we have proven to be extremely open and welcoming toward Syrians, now that the country is transitioning to peace with around 90% of Syria safe, it is time to deploy repatriation efforts to secure the safe return of Syrians to their homeland in a humane and dignified manner. With all the required reconstruction, Syria will present plenty of opportunities in agriculture and infrastructure. Therefore, while the funds, concessional loans, and some grants extended by donors and the international community are welcomed, they should be integrated within the framework of a larger and crystal-clear plan to boost real economic growth, improve the quality of services, reduce the trade deficit, and create new value-added jobs in Lebanon.</p><h4>Which are the most interesting trade partners and opportunities for Lebanon right now?</h4><p>Today, Europe and China are the first and second major trade partners of Lebanon respectively, and we are working on other mutually beneficial trade agreements.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>The first half of 2019 was relatively difficult. However, it paved the way for a serious beginning for reform that shall continue in the next couple of years. Therefore, the second half of 2019 will prove to be better than 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the political situation impact the economy and business?</h4><p>The formation of a new government, combined with other factors such as oil exploration and the removal of Saudi's embargo on Lebanon, boosts investor confidence. PPP Law No. 48 was enacted in 2017 and will act as a vehicle for carrying out infrastructure projects. This will instill confidence in the sector and market, provide more transparency, and reduce the level of corruption. Moreover, as Syria is transitioning to peace, there is a giant opportunity for Lebanon to play a role as the hub for reconstruction. We are getting numerous inquiries from clients about the market, tenders, and possibilities. One sector in Lebanon that could greatly benefit from PPPs is electricity, which has attracted widespread attention as one of the main points to tackle within the framework of reforms demanded during the CEDRE conference. The electricity sector was officially privatized 15 years ago. There were some decrees that were supposed to be enacted by the government to supervise the transition to privatization, but that were never started due to a number of political issues. This time, there is optimism regarding long-awaited changes to the sector.</p><h4>What are the strengths of your firm?</h4><p>We are a business law firm dealing with all aspects of business law. Outside of Lebanon, we have offices in Milan, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi. The rationale for the opening of our offices followed an organic pattern, reflecting current partnerships and clients. We count on partnerships with big firms, and our clientele mostly comprises foreign individuals and companies. We have several French, Italian, and Russian clients, as well as Algerians, Saudi Arabians, and Emiratis. A number of international law firms rely on our services to cover Lebanon and the region. We are able to close the cultural gap that may exist between these firms' clients and their regional counterparties, delivering the highest quality of service that they are used to, combined with local expertise and qualification. We always stay on the edge of innovation, coming up with new structures that can be interesting for the clients in terms of governance, taxation, and possibilities to grow locally and globally. We are also a paperless law firm and have put in place the technology to deliver fast and efficient legal services. One of our strengths is legal technology. We work with banks and financial institutions to provide services related to online payments, electronic payment gateways, credit card companies, and so on. We also deal with technical due diligence during takeovers and mergers. We have worked with several online platforms in terms of drafting all the documentation, from user agreements to public-private policies and putting the legal background in place.</p><h4>How will Circular 331 impact the economy?</h4><p>Circular 331 was an interesting initiative launched by the Central Bank to support start-ups and boost the knowledge economy. At first, it had an impact on the economy as it allowed banks to start considering investing with start-ups. Unfortunately, the conditions on the entrepreneurs did not allow it to strive and have a better impact on the future. It expected a number of guarantees that were not always available for small entrepreneurs. Thus, at the moment it is not as efficient as it could be.</p><h4>Is there a piece of legislation that can benefit the business scene in Lebanon?</h4><p>There are a few laws that are under debate at the moment in Parliament. One of the last laws that will change the situation on ground is the Commercial Code, which has not been changed for 80 years. Another step forward is the bankruptcy law. Previously, bankruptcy was more of a penalty that was imposed instead of the Chapter 11 model that allows the company to survive and pay its creditors. The law will also have a big impact on companies' governance in Lebanon. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Toyota is one of the world's largest automotive companies, with operations in over 170 countries across the world. Could you tell us about what differentiates Toyota?</h4><p>A common differentiator for Toyota and Lexus is that quality is at the base of our product; we listen to the customer. This is easier said than done in an industrial environment with multiple choices, technologies, and combinations. Listening to the customer and trying to provide a solution for them is what we try to do.</p><h4>Toyota's European activities underwent a transition in the 1990s when you began manufacturing in Europe for European customers. How does being based in Europe affect your operations?</h4><p>Europe is one of the most challenging markets for the automotive industry. The beginning of Toyota's manufacturing in Europe was difficult because we started with medium-sized cars. Now, we have the whole range of cars being produced in Europe. The challenge lies with the variety of choices and customers in Europe, which I believe is the most diverse in the world. There is so much variety to consider in Europe, unlike other regions such as North America, China, or Japan.</p><h4>While the year before was record-breaking, car production fell 5.5% during 1Q2019 in Spain. What do you think the role of the public sector should be in dealing with this problem?</h4><p>The public sector needs to clearly define clear and stable rules that will not change every few years, as changing an industry takes time and we need time to adapt, change, and evolve. Toyota is starting the production of the first model in Vigo (Galicia) at the end of this year alongside the PSA group. We have been a Japanese manufacturer despite having plants all over Europe. Being a manufacturer in Spain adds more value and is a new dimension to Toyota. Coming soon is the Proace City van, which is a small LCV that will have conventional engines, petrol and diesel. Starting in 2021, it will also be the first electric vehicle in Toyota lineup.</p><h4>You are also launching the Prius PHV, the solar car. How do you think this will revolutionize the sector?</h4><p>The Prius revolutionized the sector 20 years ago. In those days, people questioned our actions and thought the Prius was strange. But now we have more than nine hybrids each in the Toyota and Lexus ranges. We are launching a second engine in the C-segment, which is a competitive segment for those customers that really want a fun to drive experience. We are also launching a 4x4 in the Prius range. Although we believe that EV is part of the future, it is not the full solution. Therefore, for this special project we want to make EV logical as right now it has limitations, including battery technology and price. This will have to change. We have to increase capacity and reduce charging time. We are not linked to one single technology but prefer to have a variety because we understand that the future will be multi technology.</p><h4>What do you think some of the other big trends of the future will be, apart from hydrogen? How do you think cultural habits will move with this evolution?</h4><p>I think that Toyota is changing because the customer is changing. We see a lot of new trends in customers, such as the use of mobile apps to manage cars. These things are pushing us to move into other areas where we did not consider in the past. Previously, each time we launched a car we worried about its size, engine, and the design. However, we were not really interested in the connectivity. Now we have to look for other things and be agile. That is what the customer demands. It is complicated to achieve such agility in this industry. Unlike with clothing, for example, you cannot change your products from one day to the next. A car that has more than 30,000 parts and requires time to adapt to these new trends.</p><h4>How much do you invest in research on an annual basis?</h4><p>It is more than JPY 2 trillion billion (USD 22 million) per year, making us one of the companies that spend more in this area. These days we are launching a hydrogen car to the Spanish market. First, we need the infrastructure in place in order to sell the cars with that refuelling system. I feel it is the same experience as with the Prius 20 years ago. Initial reviews are similar. I think hydrogen will become part of the future, not only in terms of mobility but also in terms of energy solutions. It is a<br>new energy vector that many countries are already investigating. It is a way of storing energy. Instead of losing the energy generated from wind or solar, it can be stored. Once you have the hydrogen, it needs to be consumed. The problem we have is that there is a threshold of investment towards hydrogen made with clean resources. I am convinced it will be a great change for society. For hydrogen solutions, most of the manufacturers already have a prototype. Mirai is the first hydrogen product we launched with more than 6,000 units now in operation worldwide. More than 600 of those are in Europe. Everyone is waiting to see when the demand will come. When the customer requires the product, then we will generate the solution.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for Toyota in 2020?</h4><p>2019 has been a year of transition as we have launched many new products and 2020 will be the year of consolidating these changes. We have renewed RAV4, the creator of the SUV segment worldwide. We have also renewed Corolla and we are introducing the Camry for the first time ever in Spain. We have an avalanche of products that take time to be introduced and then consolidated. In terms of services we are introducing many new ones, including a 10 year warranty. We are the only manufacturer in the marketplace to offer this. We are also introducing Mirai at the end of 2019, with its launch expected in 2020. Finally, we will introduce the first Toyota model produced in Spain, the Proace City. 2020 will be another great year for Toyota and Lexus in Spain.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[11 Marine Vessels Ready]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[iroghama-obuoforibo-chief-operating-officer-starzs-investments-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main services and what projects are you currently involved in?</h4><p>Starzs Investments Company Limited is a maritime logistics company that provides vessel logistics services to international and Nigerian oil companies. We currently have a fleet of 11 marine vessels. Our primary focus and specialization is the provision and operation of ASD tug boats. These boats support the export operations of crude oil from the floating platforms in deep water offshore. During loading and offloading of crude oil from and into FPSOs, our tugs hold the tankers in place while they are being loaded with the crude oil. As long as Nigeria is exporting crude, our vessel fleet will be relevant. The vessels also do other support operations, including cargo supply runs, towing, firefighting watch, and other tasks. We are also a private maritime security company, so we have security boats. We have an MoU with the navy, which means we can put Navy personnel onboard our security boats. We have a sister company called Starzs Marine Engineering Limited, which is a ship repair yard based in Onne, Rivers State. It currently has the capacity to dry dock vessels up to 500 gross tonnage however it is being expanded to provide ship building and ship breaking yard with enhanced capacity to dry dock larger vessels of 7,500 gross tonnage and 89metres long. With the government beginning to ban the importation of vessels, this shipyard will be especially important. We will be able to tap into the new market that is going to emerge. The combination of owning vessels and a ship repair yard gives us an essential competitive advantage with our clients the IOCs and NOCs. They are sure that we have the maintenance support abilities in place, as well as the vessels. This also significantly reduces  operational downtime for our assets.  </p><h4>Are you planning to expand your clientele to local companies?</h4><p>We are exploring working with companies that drill deep offshore; however, a lot of these companies do not like to use long-term contracts, as the IOCs might. These terms are often for as short as 10 days within a given month. We are trying to see how we can expand our asset base in order to have assets available for more short-term, daily jobs. This would allow us to work with many different companies in a single month, while also having our assets available to be used for 85-90% of the month. We would prefer, however, to have long-term contracts in place, as this allows us to better prepare for our own long-term growth. It is tougher to invest or to get financing when contracts are so short.</p><h4>As an indigenous company in a capital-intensive and foreign-dominated industry, how did you manage to establish your reputation? </h4><p>Some of it is thanks to certain policy decisions, such as the Cabotage Act. This law gave us the confidence to go out there and seek opportunities. We knew that the playing field was equal, although not entirely favorably tilted in our direction. Additionally, back then, there were far more long-term contract awards. It is useful to have, for example, five-year contracts with the option for two-year extensions. These contracts allowed us to negotiate funding much easier, because financiers trusted that their capital would be protected by the contracts. Right now, long-term contracts are slow in coming and tender processes are drawn out, this is probably because there is so much uncertainty.</p><h4>How did you fund your expansion, and what investments have you had to make? </h4><p>We took advantage of opportunities arising after the passage of the Cabotage Act. We started with one vessel and we gradually built our asset base. We have grown the company organically, and that means we have borrowed with as little risk as possible by borrowing against contracts and not against prospect. By using this strategy, we have developed and maintained a healthy balance sheet. Much of the profits are reinvested back into the company. Our chairman is disciplined. That discipline is consistent throughout the company. The reputation that this focus has helped us develop has contributed significantly to our sustained success over the years. We are adding as much value as we possibly can to our clients. We have built a successful 9-year relationship with Total, and it is thanks to this focus on discipline. We have brought in a number of new assets in order to successfully meet demand from Total. Our partners at Total see us as an indigenous company in which they want to invest in and grow. Our commitment to quality service delivery and operational efficiency makes Total see us as a firm they want to support and partner with over the long term.</p><h4>How do you see the dynamic between the international and local service companies developing? </h4><p>With the introduction and evolution of Cabotage, this dynamic has been forced to change. We are now seeing more local companies coming into the industry and building capacity. They are entering partnerships and collaborating in order to achieve their goals. However, we still have yet to reach a balance. I do not believe that we should kick out all the international companies. We still need the competitive drive that international players bring to the market. We want the industry to be driven forward by everyone trying to be better. The NOCs are always looking at the IOCs to figure out what the other is doing so they can improve. We need a balance. Now, we are seeing more partnerships.</p><h4>Considering the development of new oil and gas assets in other African nations, what needs to be done to maintain the attractiveness of the Nigeria's resources?</h4><p>The government has a role to play in enabling a healthy market. If the relevant structures, infrastructure, fiscal policy and other relevant policies, etc. are not in place then we will not see the right kind of growth that we have the potential for. We need to make doing business in Nigeria easier. If we do not, we are going to lose out. No economy can thrive if the government is not working to provide an environment where people feel confident in their investment. There is a larger role that the government can play in making the economy attractive to investors. Other African nations are already catching up. Other nations will use Nigeria as both a model for what to do and what not to do in managing their energy sectors. This means that they will be able to leap-frog past us, if we are not careful. The potential and the desire are there, but Nigeria needs to start developing projects and taking steps necessary for long-term success. We need to move away from plans and move into execution. We need to change our playbook in order to see development.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2020?</h4><p>We are hoping to consolidate our current business. We want to consolidate our tug fleet. We now have a drilling rigs division that we have been working on, and we have a participated in a number of tenders so far. We have partnered with a reputable international drilling company called Foresight Offshore Drilling to offer services in this area. We hope to have a few projects ongoing by 2020. We are interested in strengthening our strategic alliances and partnerships to develop our technical and operational expertise. We want to improve all areas of our service delivery and take it to the next level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>A series of tragedies in the 20th century, including the Lebanese civil war and numerous Arab-Israeli confrontations, stained the Levant's reputation as a historic mosaic of cultures conducive to trade. However, the worst came in 2011 with the outbreak of civil war in Syria, which would go on to burn centuries-old Levantine towns and villages to ashes, and lead to the rise of the so-called Islamic State in 2014-2015.</p><p>Today, the conflict's intensity has decreased from its bloodiest days, but the Levant, from the borderlands of Egypt to Iraq, is left in a state of uncertainty. The situation is far worse for Iraq and Syria, the scene of much conflict, though Lebanon and Jordan, among others, have not remained immune to the repercussions of war, while also hosting a sizeable population of refugees.<br>There is no denying that, to embark on reconstruction, both Iraq and Syria are in need of international aid and investment, but potential investors are still eyeing the region, as a whole, with some apprehension. This has a negative impact on the business ecosystems of countries such as Lebanon, which was not directly involved in the conflict, but feels its effects nonetheless. <br>Lebanon held general elections in 2018, and though the new government was not formed until January 2019, now that the new cabinet is up and running, it can use Lebanon's leverage in the region to create a better Levant. In particular, as the new cabinet is one of the most pluralistic in Lebanese history, it will be in a position to engage with various stakeholders in the region, including those forces that are closer to the West and those with ties to Iran, at least informally.</p><p>At the current critical juncture and despite the ebbing of conflict in Syria and Iraq, the threat of a backslide to tit-for-tat warfare is never completely out of the question. Such a threat could cancel out the little progress that has been made so far. No player in Lebanon or elsewhere in the Levant is now looking for a fight, but one has also to allow for the possibility of “black swans" and errors of judgment quickly escalating into fully fledged warfare. An unexpected breakout of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, for example, could set back Lebanon's development irreparably.</p><p>One should not despair, however, as there are positive prospects, too. Since the discovery of the Leviathan gas field in 2010, major international oil and gas companies such as Noble Energy and Total have been drawn to the region. Meanwhile, the Italian oil giant, Eni, struck gas off the coast of Egypt in 2015.</p><p>Though this may be a case of wishful thinking, some analysts believe that Israel's determination to discover and export hydrocarbons will force it to restructure its relationship with Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey—and even the Palestinian Authority—in order to achieve more stability in the region.</p><p>Since 2018, Lebanon, too, has been looking for potential oil and gas reserves with the help of a consortium comprising Total, Eni, and Russia's Novatek. The progress was somewhat slowed by Lebanon's political limbo, but it is expected to gather momentum now that a new Minister of Energy is in office.<br>In Syria, hostilities are fading, though Assad has managed to stay in power. Syria's exhausted economy will eventually return to the regional scene, but will quite probably remain subdued for years to come. At the same time, the world will remain wary of hostilities resurfacing in the country in some new form. At least, however, Islamic State and its reign of terror has met its end. By March 2019, the last remaining fighters faithful to the so-called caliphate were killed or captured. The extremist group that once controlled the cities of Mosul and Raqqa and threatened the entire region has now lost its last shreds of territory.<br>This is definitely an improvement for regional peace, but the ISIS ideology is an ongoing threat that regional leaders will need to continue taking seriously.</p><p>With ISIS out of the picture, Iraq too will have to begin rebuilding its economy. The process will undoubtedly be long given the presence of sectarianism and the influence of foreign powers in the country. However, the country's parliamentary and provincial elections in 2018 are good omens, provided that they are followed by economic reforms and anti-corruption measures to create a more stable Iraq and Levant. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define the ties between Italy and Lebanon?</h4><p>First, I would like to extend my warmest wishes to the recently formed Cabinet, which in many ways resembles Italy's own current governmental contract. Our two countries are linked by a profound and ancient friendship, based on mutual respect and a common Mediterranean identity. We both share a strong interest for peace and stability in the region. Italy stands side by side with the Lebanese population to offer its own contribution to the process of peace, dialogue, and social cohesion in the country. We are proud of the role played by Italian forces in the framework of UN-led missions, in particular of the UNFIL mission that Italy is directly coordinating. I have already had the chance to offer my gratitude to the efforts of the Italian contingent under the guide of General Del Colle. At the moment, Lebanon finds itself facing a set of important challenges. However, I have seen Prime Minister Saad Hariri determined to implement the economic and social reforms that the country needs to sustain its positive record of development and distance itself from regional instability.</p><h4>Which are the main channels for bilateral cooperation between Italy and Lebanon?</h4><p>During a meeting with Prime Minister Hariri in 2019, I had the chance to discuss a number of topics for bilateral cooperation in-depth. First, with regards to the Blue Line, we want to encourage all involved parties to engage in constructive dialogue, which we see as the only solution to solve international tensions. I confirm Italy's availability to act as a mediator. We have also examined opportunities for bilateral partnerships and trade. In recent years, Italian enterprises have made huge investments in a range of sectors in the Lebanese economy, including oil and gas, wastewater management and electricity. The Lebanese government has committed to fulfill demands by the international community so that the inflow of loans and grants agreed upon during the CEDRE conference can be facilitated. I warmly reiterate PM Hariri's invitation to welcome the participation of Italian companies and businesses in this investment plan and build partnerships with the Lebanese private sector. We are pleased to contribute to the growth of Lebanon's economy through the competences and technological capabilities of Italian businesses. We have established a series of plans and technical committees to assess the impact of Italian investments and evaluate the possibilities of involvement of Italian companies. We have also discussed the main regional crises and agreed on ways to promote mediation, always under guidance of the UN. It is crucial to proceed in a way that avoids exacerbating the weight of sanctions on the regions' economies. Finally, we discussed the impact of the presence of refugees on Lebanon's economy. Lebanon currently hosts the highest percentage of refugees in the world, equal to around 30% of its population. Italy has continually shown solidarity to Lebanon through a number of humanitarian initiatives and development projects. Once again, I intend to reaffirm Italy's commitment to support the Lebanese government through an approach that is strictly inclusive and never invasive, respecting the sovereignty and policy guidelines determined by the Lebanese government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the commitment of the newly formed government to the country's development?</h4><p>Lebanon managed to form its Cabinet nine months after elections; however, before that, we had to wait 10 years for those very elections to take place. Thus, forming the government was not an easy task. The most important thing is that we have set a clear roadmap with all the necessary reforms to attract more foreign investments into Lebanon. We struggled for a long time with corruption, waste, electricity shortages, and other issues such as outdated laws from the 50s or 60s. The focus of this government is to set the path to modernize the country and bring long-awaited development. The CEDRE conference, supported by players such as France, the IMF, and the World Bank, has played a pivotal role in establishing a roadmap for the top priorities to tackle. For example, one of the most pressing recommendations from the IMF was to lower our budget deficit, which is one of the first actions the government will undertake. We are working with the World Bank to pass new laws to enhance transparency and fight corruption. We have already passed some nine of the 15 laws recommended after CEDRE, while the remaining will be part of the cabinet statement. Political affiliations must be left aside to carry out the necessary reforms to save the economy. All parties agree on the importance of implementing the CEDRE reforms, and all the political parties are united in their will to fight corruption. We are excited to introduce and implement all the preconditions for a healthy investment climate. One thing is clear: investors want political stability. The unity of the political powers in this cabinet provides the required stability.</p><h4>What is your stance on the inclusion of women in Lebanon's political and business landscapes?</h4><p>Supporting women is not just a matter of human rights or humanitarian reasons. Women represent half of Lebanese society. Not including women in the workforce and politics is a huge loss for our GDP. For this reason, this cabinet has for the first time in Lebanon's history four women in leading ministerial positions. The choice of Interior Minister Raya el Hassan was particularly crucial in the framework of the direction we want to give to this government. Raya is a reformist, and what we need most now is reforms. Lebanese people should get used to the idea that women can handle high positions in the government and even become prime minister, president, or the head of parliament.</p><h4>Do you blame the refugee crisis for the economic and political situation in Lebanon?</h4><p>Many Lebanese people might blame all the problems on migrants; however, they are lying to themselves. Before blaming others, we need to change our own system and laws that prevent us from doing trade or having the transparency that we need. The massive presence of migrants certainly constitutes a challenge. We are not in the position to solve situations of regional instability and war by ourselves; however, we can work on improving our country so we can offer better opportunities to everyone. With each challenge comes a wave of opportunities. In Lebanon during 1996 and 1997—a prosperous era in Lebanon's history—we had over 800,000 Syrians working in Lebanon on infrastructure projects. If our economy was to work smoothly now, we could absorb the foreign workforce in a similar way today. Therefore, the focus of this government is to reform the economy and develop infrastructure projects. This will be the key to solve all other problems, including the Syrian refugee crisis. In the end, migrants will return to their countries. We cannot just sit and wait and say we have 1.5 million migrants in Lebanon and thus cannot do anything. We should change ourselves. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes the brand Montegrappa unique?</h4><p>Montegrappa has existed for more than 100 years. It was founded in 1912 in a part of Italy traditionally well-known for metal work and silver and goldsmith work. There is a great deal of talent in the area of craftmanship. Just before World War I, the refillable fountain pen was a crucial means of communication, and during the war, the company found itself on the frontline of the fighting. The Montegrappa building was one of the few that remained as a pen factory; most of the other buildings in the area were converted into ammunition factories to support the war. The company survived the war, and its building remains almost unchanged to this day. What is great about Montegrappa is that there is a genuine history around the brand, it has been in the same building for 108 years, and is one of the region's historic traditions of craftsmanship.</p><h4>How has the making of the pen evolved over time?</h4><p>In the early days, the company  made gold and silver pens because people just wanted a good quality refillable fountain pen for function rather than a piece of art. As the brand evolved, it started making increasingly exclusive, high-price products based on themes for limited editions. For example, it made 1942 pieces of a limited edition pen dedicated to the great boxer, Muhammad Ali.  Another example is the famous dragon pen, which was produced in a quantity of  1,912 pieces because that was the year of the company's founding. These sorts of limited productions created a increased demand for exclusive items, changing the luxury industry. In the luxury business today, consumers want their own, personalized objects that no one else has.  Our talented craftsmen, such as Mario, and others who work in our factory and design studio, can create  a piece of art on a pen in  silver or gold, and this a beautiful art form it plays nicely into what customers demand today.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the process of making pens?</h4><p>The pen, including the engravings, is entirely made by hand. There is some level of industrialization in the process, though that is all done in Italy in our factory with our engineers and staff. What is also interesting is the materials we use; in addition to silver and gold, we also use other unusual materials. Celluloid is a material made from from cellulose, an extract of cotton fibres, and it takes 18 months to harden to make a suitable component for the pen. This cotton-based material looks similar to resin, and Montegrappa is one of the only companies in the world remaining that still can produce celluloid. The company has developed a  configurator on the  website that allows customers to create their own pens. For example, they can choose a yellow cap, a green body, a wooden barrel, and a broad nib, etc. They can add their initials and perhaps a ruby or stone of their choice on the top or clip, and that becomes a unique piece, one of millions of possible configurations that can be created from the components and options on offer. The   order comes in to Montegrappa, it is assembled , and send  out within 10 days.</p><h4>Has technology become a threat to the high-end luxury pens market?</h4><p>There is a great similarity between pens and watches. The Swiss watch industry was an industry born out of incredible human ingenuity that lasted for hundreds of years. In the 1960s, when Quartz watches appeared, this beautiful industry that mankind mastered through human ingenuity suddenly became obsolete. It is sad to see something like that happen because it did affect the Swiss watch industry badly. Thankfully, people recognized the beauty of that industry and the craftsmanship involved in making those things. They wanted to preserve it, as it is such an important representation of a human achievement and today, there is a flourishing industry in fine watchmaking, supported by watch collectors and aficionados, that goes beyond the hedonistic pursuit of creating beautiful items, but that is preserving a crucially important part of human history and creativity. Pens have a similar story. The pen has been around since Plato started writing the teachings of Socrates and we moved away from being an oral society. The pen changed society and civilization forever, and human history began with the pen. The pen is the representation of knowledge being passed on and being transferred from generation to generation. So while we may not need a Swiss watch to tell us the time today, or an expensive pen to write notes, these fine accessories are incredibly important symbols and it is only fitting that these should be highly valued and treasured items. It is also about the esthetic and tactility, as one's brain is physically connected through their arm and through the paper they write on. More recently, it has been discovered that hand writing is important for brain health and delaying the onset of degenerative brain conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's. We are seeing a significant increase in the demand for fountain pens. There is a movement toward retro and vintage that we are also embracing. The fountain pen symbolizes the writer, and people are going back to it.</p><h4>How does the brand fit within the Dubai market, and how do you foresee the brand in the coming years?</h4><p>The demand for customized products in the region is not just at the individual level. The brand has developed some collections to celebrate local historic and cultural events. In 2011, Montegrappa produced a 40-year national day pen and, more recently, a pen dedicated to the national anthem of the UAE, Ishy Biladi,  with the words of the national anthem inscribed around it's barrel. For the year of Zayed in 2018, Montegrappa produced a pen bearing the logo of Sheikh Zayed. In terms of demand, a peculiarity of the UAE market is  Arab hospitality, and as a result there is a culture of gifting. People still gift high-value items to a great extent, so people are not always buying for themselves. Other regions do have cultures of giving as well, though in Dubai and the GCC the price point of gifts might be higher.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[BBAC continues to grow despite economic challenges]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ghassan-t-assaf-chairman-general-manager-bbac]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the Bank's performance in 2018, and what are your expectations for 2019?</h4>
<p>BBAC performed resiliently in a year that was marked by a number of sector-wide challenges. BBAC reengineered its financial portfolio to take advantage of new opportunities, posting 5.5% deposit growth that compares favorably to the alpha average of 2.1%. Assets grew 17.3%, comfortably surpassing the alpha average of 11.3%. Despite a growing deficit in the balance of payment, BBAC scored 9% growth in foreign currency deposits, compared to the alpha average of 5.61%. The bank's performance drove up BBAC's ranking in deposits and asset growth to number five nationally, compared to 10th place prior. While net interest income declined 2.95%, the bank boosted non-interest income by prioritizing recovery on non-performing loans, enhancing financial instruments and FX trading, and developing new banking services. This led to a 5.3% growth in net profits, comparing favorably to the alpha average, which declined by 3.36%. In 2019, BBAC will reinforce positive momentum by expanding its branch networking, accelerating a transformation to digital banking, and investing in qualified human resources. These programs will allow for a 6% expected growth in deposits, driving a similar percentage increase in assets and profits.</p>
<h4>How does BBAC target SMEs?</h4>
<p>SMEs account for some 82% of all companies in the Lebanese economy. They are a valuable target market. BBAC has pioneered SME lending since the late seventies and is now looking to strengthen its engagement with SMEs. By the end of 2018, the bank had made 42.5% of its performing loans to SMEs. The bank offers preferential terms and zero-commission structures for cheque and cash deposits. Apart from financing to facilitate company creation, BBAC cultivates a lifecycle relationship with SME clients, and services their capital financing needs as the business expands. A recent agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) facilitates BBAC in offering longer-term financing to SMEs at market-beating rates. The bank also sponsors trade unions, manufacturers, and farmers across the country to develop long-term relationships, understand their requirements, and better meet their needs.</p>
<h4>In what ways do you intend to expand your customer base?</h4>
<p>A caring ethos is embedded in BBAC's corporate culture. Our close relationship with our clients is the cornerstone of our image and all our activities. This has even been codified in our logo. The logo's interlocking circles portray perfect synergy between two partners&mdash;with BBAC represented in blue and the client in aqua&mdash;where they both bring value to one another and grow together in mutual harmony. The pursuit of steady growth is focused on building a solid customer base relying on developing a customer-centric approach that incorporates many factors. First, BBAC intends to develop tailored products with a better value for customers, through a Client Relationship Management (CRM) solution that provides a 360-degree view of customer relationship and data insights. BBAC also aims to deliver a higher quality experience to customers by investing in IT infrastructure and upgrading technology. BBAC is catalyzing a multichannel approach where the customer experience is connected across physical branches, digital, and app channels. Expanding digital banking services will be crucial to target different customer segments. Faster and more convenient personalized transactions will boost engagement with younger audiences. Equally important we will be improving the level of BBAC's already superior customer service to satisfy all clients. Finally, BBAC is undertaking a program of physical expansion, looking at new strategic locations in Lebanon and abroad. The bank already counts 41 locations in Lebanon, three branches in Iraq, and one branch in Cyprus, in addition to two representative offices in the UAE and Nigeria.</p>
<h4>In what terms would you describe the bank's CSR approach?</h4>
<p>BBAC is cognizant that a responsible approach to business is a decisive factor in determining the long-term viability and success of the bank. For over 60 years, BBAC has actively engaged in a range of well-selected and tailored CSR initiatives. Among some of its most prominent areas of engagement are health and the environment, economic affairs, humanitarian and social issues, in addition to contributions in the arenas of culture and arts, sports, education and youth programs. BBAC also counts on the valuable volunteering and fundraising efforts of its employees. As examples of a few instances of the bank's social commitment, in 2010 BBAC championed the case of women's rights by being the first bank in Lebanon to welcome mothers, acknowledging their right to open a bank account for the benefit of their minor children through the &ldquo;Mother Account." BBAC also offers a credit card to support the Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon (CCCL), whereby a part of the earnings are channeled to support the NGO's missions and activities. In 2012, the bank entered a partnership with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) on the 'Live Lebanon' initiative. The three-year partnership implemented 42 projects to reach 250,000 direct and 600,000 indirect beneficiaries across the areas of economic development, healthcare, youth support, and environmental protection in rural and underdeveloped communities. For its efforts in the Live Lebanon initiative, the bank received the 2013 Social Economic Award in the 'Rural Development' category. In 2019, BBAC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Saint Joseph University to establish a joint fund in the name of late Sheikh Toufic Assaf, who founded BBAC in 1956. The fund aims at granting scholarships to deserving students in need of assistance to pursue higher education.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main recent accomplishments and developments for BAT Malaysia?</h4><p>BAT has a long and successful foothold in Malaysia that dates back to 1912. In 1999, BAT Malaysia was formed from the merger of Rothmans of Pall Mall (Malaysia) Berhad and Malaysian Tobacco Company Berhad, to create the country's largest tobacco company with a portfolio of reputable brands such as Dunhill, Rothmans, Peter Stuyvesant, Kent and Benson &amp; Hedges. Since then, we have always been market leaders and are listed on the stock exchange as a PLC, which means a lot of publicity always surrounds the company. We are proudly listed on Bursa Malaysia, and are highly regarded for our governance and integrity, which we protect with care. The industry came under pressure at the end of 2015 when the Malaysian government suddenly decided to increase excise by 40%. This deeply affected the market and gave a dramatic boost to the illegal cigarette trade. At the time, consumers had already been struggling with affordability, and in 2015 prices reached a level where many could not afford legal cigarettes anymore and moved from legal brands to the illegal market. Ironically, the total consumption in Malaysia has actually grown over recent years because of widely available illegal cigarettes, which are cheap because the price does not include excise. Malaysia's long borders and coastlines allow traders to ship illegal cigarettes into the country quite easily, and after the 2015 excise hike Malaysia's illegal cigarette market rose from 30-35% to 63% in just a couple of months. The effect of the excise hike was compounded by the fact that enforcement is insufficient.</p><h4>How are you addressing new tobacco-related trends?</h4><p>Globally, we are witnessing trends such as e-cigarettes, heated-tobacco-products, snus, and chewing tobacco. These products are categorized as potentially risk reduced products (PRRPs) and supports our harm reduction agenda. We are obviously also looking at these trends in Malaysia, because the BAT Group globally has a strategy of transforming tobacco and working consciously on the harm reduction agenda. The legislation in Malaysia is still a little bit challenging. We would be interested in commercializing vaping in Malaysia, but it falls under the Poisons Act and is totally illegal apart from medicinal use. We are trying to work with the government to see if there is an opportunity to open this up and what kind of legislation needs to be in place. We have a keen interest, but it would require an enormous investment to build up the brands and the R&amp;D behind it, so first any legislation that would allow it needs to be stable. </p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>We have an exciting portfolio plan for 2019 and are looking into opening a few new segments in the market. These are mostly circled around our key brand, Dunhill, but we also have exciting plans for Rothmans. BAT is about brands and about people, and we have invested heavily in the development capability of the latter.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you introduce Berjaya Sports Toto Berhad and tell us about the company's most recent milestones?</h4><p>Berjaya Sports Toto Berhad is a gaming and lottery company that was incorporated in 1993. Over the past 25 years, we have evolved significantly. We are now present in several countries, having started off in Malaysia in 1969 under a subsidiary called Sports Toto Malaysia, and thus our history here goes back half a century. In Malaysia, our concept outlets are one of our most important recent accomplishments. These are fully air-conditioned and equipped with electronic information on LED televisions to enhance customer service and customers' experience. We are the largest number forecast operator (NFO) in Malaysia in terms of both our market share of approximately 43% and our geographical distribution, having presence in every Malaysian state except Kelantan and Terengganu. We have a suite of seven games comprising three digital games, three lotto games, and one hybrid digital-lotto game.</p><h4>What are your strengths and competitive advantages?</h4><p>As a lottery operator in Malaysia for almost half a century and as a lottery manager in Philippines for 25 years, we believe we are a strong company offering various benefits. There is our experience in managing lottery businesses and developing products and games that are interesting and suitable for local interests and local customer preferences. For example, while four-digit games are highly popular in Malaysia and Singapore, this is not so in other countries, such as in Hong Kong or Australia. We also offer a competitive advantage of being able to develop the back end software and lottery systems for a country's lottery needs through our US subsidiary, International Lottery and Totalizator Systems (ILTS) Company. Here in Malaysia, as well as in the Philippines and Vietnam, we work with government bodies that are entrusted with regulating the lottery industry. Our people are able to coordinate such partnerships and have close teamwork that brings about high-quality lottery systems and facilities within a country.</p><h4>What are the main trends changing the business environment in which you operate?</h4><p>We have been working closely with government bodies. All lottery operators, especially in Southeast Asia, are extremely dependent on approvals from government bodies. Over the past seven years in Malaysia, we suddenly had a huge increase in the number of illegal gambling operators, which impacted our sales and those of all NFOs. In 2018, there was an increased effort by the government authorities to reduce and eradicate illegal gambling operations in Malaysia. This will have a huge impact on our sales and improve the government's tax revenues. In Malaysia, the NFO industry is highly regulated, though fortunately the government also recognizes the advancement of technology worldwide and understands the requirement for the NFO industry to move online as well. Mobile applications would be a logical next step for us. We want to explore the options for games online to attract the next generation.</p><h4>What strategies are you implementing to further enhance your market share in Malaysia?</h4><p>There are three main players in the industry here. Sports Toto Malaysia has the most outlets, though this is regulated by the Ministry of Finance, and we cannot simply decide to increase the number of outlets. We do not see the other NFOs as our competitors; rather, we ask them to relocate with us if we move to build a new market together, with a varied offering to customers. We have the best sales in locations where all three operators have outlets. We have also been working closely with the other NFOs to battle against illegal gambling operators. So rather than competitors, we are all in the same boat, with a shared interest in the industry. Even our goal to go online is something we will do together as an industry, for example, when we ask for the necessary government approvals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was your vision behind opening Glojas Health Clinic?</h4><p>After obtaining my medical degree, I had an interest in aesthetics and hair restoration. After receiving the Aesthetic License from the Ministry of Health, I went on to study and research hair restoration with the American Board of Hair Restoration Surgery (ABHRS). This institution is the highest governing body for hair restoration surgery and strictly requires a student to be a medical doctor before going through rather vigorous training and exams, before granting you certification with the ABHRS. I am still Malaysia's only Hair Restoration Diplomate. Having equipped myself with the right education and experience, I rebranded my medical practice as Smart International Aesthetics, under Glojas Health Clinic. I am the inventor of SMART technology, which I have legally patented. It is only available at Glojas Health Clinic. This technology provides the best and most effective hair transplant procedures and formulations of treatments, and caters to patients with varying circumstances and issues in order to obtain premium results for all our patients. Our vision going forward is to continue being a world-renowned hair transplant and plastic surgery specialist clinic. </p><h4>How do you plan to further grow and develop Glojas Health Clinic?</h4><p>We have built this business on trust, and our focus is to further develop internationally as the preferred choice for all aesthetic procedures and cosmetic surgeries. We aim to establish a much larger presence where we will be significantly turning Malaysia into an international medical hub, all with the help of the Ministry of Health's Medical Tourism initiative. This will bring a small but nevertheless important contribution to Malaysia's economy. Tourists from around the world now go to Bangkok and South Korea as their first choice for aesthetic procedures. We hope to bring the Bangkok and Korea aesthetic business models to Malaysia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2019 marks the 50th anniversary of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). How do you assess the role that the organization has played in promoting cooperation in the Islamic world?</h4><p>The OIC is the collective voice of the Muslim world, and this has been the case since the establishment of the organization in 1969 when the OIC announced its fundamental mission to “safeguard and protect the interests of the Muslim world in the spirit of promoting international peace and harmony." Since then, the mandate of the OIC has been the generation and accomplishment of a unified vision adopted by all the member countries. As the second-largest inter-governmental organization in the world, the activities of the OIC cover many aspects of people's daily life including politics, economy, culture, religion, education, sports, and arts, among others. In order to create comprehensive and integrated solutions for various issues, there are several subsidiaries and agencies under the OIC, the headquarters of which are in Saudi Arabia. </p><h4>How do the different programs of the annual Muslim World Business and Investment Zone contribute to the further development of the Islamic economy?</h4><p>In fact, contributing to the overall development of the Islamic economy is the fundamental goal of our annual international trade event, the Muslim World Business and Investment Zone. We have designed the event to be a comprehensive platform where businesses from various industries in all 57 OIC member countries and beyond can find long-term partners and also get updates of the market based on extensive research by experts. The Muslim World Biz has three main components: the Exhibition Zone, where products and services from many countries around the world are showcased; the Conference Zone, where current practices are assessed and new strategies formulated; and the Award Ceremonies to honor the achievements and celebrate the success of individuals and organizations from around the Muslim world. The programs of the Muslim World Biz cover a wide range of sectors including Islamic banking and finance, manufacturing, trade and investment, higher education, Islamic tourism, food and beverages, healthcare, agriculture, fashion and lifestyle. The profile of participants includes senior government officials, ambassadors and high commissioners, CEOs, entrepreneurs, vice-chancellors, and business professionals. Over the years, the outcomes of the Muslim World Biz have been overwhelming and progressive in a way that is reflected in the expansion of the event itself, and also in the increasing participation of individuals and organizations from across the globe, beyond the 57 OIC member countries. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead and what will be your main strategic objectives?</h4><p>We will continue to do what we have been doing for more than 15 years. We believe that there are many opportunities out there, and we also acknowledge the existence of several challenges facing the development of the Islamic economy. Therefore, our objective is to continue to expand the Muslim World Biz to accommodate more participants and also to offer new programs. Together with our strategic partners and supporters, we are going to enrich the programs of our platform so that each of the OIC member countries could benefit from the outcomes of the event every year. Another important goal of the OIC International Business Centre is to promote the opportunities within the Muslim world to other individuals and organizations from non-Islamic countries. We believe that we all can live together in peace and harmony. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Looking at the three pillars of the Centre's strategy — Islamic finance, halal industry, and Islamic lifestyle, how is work under each pillar progressing?</h4><p>The three economic pillars of the DIEDC Strategy, Islamic finance, halal industry, and Islamic lifestyle, were inspired from the foundations of the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to transform Dubai into the global capital of Islamic economy. The Centre's activities, initiatives, and/or projects, feed into one or more of the three economic pillars to boost the economic activity within them, which is one of the objectives of DIEDC's strategy. Naturally, increasing the economic activity of Islamic economy sectors will increase the contribution of Islamic economy to Dubai's GDP, as well as support Dubai's economic diversification drive, further reinforcing the emirate's position as a global Islamic economy capital. To complement the three economic pillars, we devised three enabling pillars that are also part of the DIEDC Strategy. The three enabling pillars intertwine with the economic pillars, and provide the needed support to be able to achieve our aim of boosting the Islamic economic contribution to Dubai's GDP. The first enabling pillar is knowledge, including research, education, and bridging the talent gap. The second is the Islamic digital economy, because we need to adapt to the various trends that will allow us to reach a wider audience more quickly and efficiently. If the Islamic economy sectors were to flourish, they would need to embrace technological and other innovative developments, such as fintech. The third enabling pillar is the development of Islamic standards to govern economic activity. All 36 initiatives that have been launched feed into one or more of these six pillars. The strategy is comprehensive and covers the entire spectrum of the Islamic economy. We have developed ways of measuring and highlighting how those economic pillars benefited Dubai and created economic value.</p><h4>How do you measure the ways in which the Islamic economy contributes to Dubai?</h4><p>We have been working closely with the Dubai Statistics Center, a strategic partner of DIEDC, for some time now to develop the best ways to measure and quantify the contribution of Islamic economy sectors to Dubai's GDP. Initially, it wasn't easy to take these statistics and conduct an accurate analysis, since some of the sectors had experienced growth independent of the growth of the Islamic component. Therefore, we had to develop surveys and communications that could gain a more nuanced perspective. DIEDC, in collaboration with other institutions, has been doing that for the last two years. Last year, for the first time, we issued the study of the Dubai Statistics Center on the contribution of the Islamic economy to Dubai's GDP. Measuring Islamic finance and internal halal trade in Dubai, the contribution to Dubai's GDP was close to AED31 billion as of 2016. In June 2019, we announced the new results with two new updates. First, the study was expanded to cover more than just Islamic finance and halal trade, so some of the lifestyle components such as sharia-compliant food in hotels, were measured, and other leisure activities were added. Some of the manufacturing was also measured, such as fabrics being produced that are used in sharia compliant clothing. Taking into account the additions, the Dubai Statistics Center revised last year's study to make comparisons possible. Using the expanded scope, 2016 registered a contribution of AED39.9 billion, which increased to approximately AED41 billion in 2017, registering a growth rate of 2.4% and accounting for 10% of Dubai's GDP.</p><h4>How does DIEDC coordinate this contribution to GDP?</h4><p>We are committed to advocate for the Islamic economy, and to promote Dubai as the global capital of Islamic economy. In that regard, we work closely with our strategic partners to advocate for and implement various initiatives and projects. We also leverage our international network of industry stakeholders to ensure complete backing and support. For example, halal certification was unheard of three to four years ago. While most items that are imported into the UAE are sharia compliant, companies did not go beyond in getting the halal stamp on their products. Now, a significant percentage of commodities in retail outlets are stamped with the UAE halal mark. Producers understand the benefit of increased sales due to having this certification; this includes not only local producers, but international companies such as McDonalds and Burger King, too, whose advertising now reflects the halal marks. This cultural shift happened because of Dubai's vision to become the global capital of the Islamic economy. DIEDC is the centralizing and coordinating body, and we continually monitor and facilitate the progress of initiatives. At inception, the 36 initiatives were actually the ideas of the relevant stakeholders to support the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Makotum. Their realization required a central body facilitating and coordinating their research, development, and implementation. The sukuk initiative by the Dubai Financial Market and NASDAQ Dubai was the first initiative with the goal to make Dubai a leading hub for the issuance and listing of Islamic bonds. That initiative has been going strong since 2013, and will continue because we want to maintain our number-one position. In just less than a year and a half, Dubai went from number three globally, in terms of sukuk listing value, to number one. The value of active sukuks listed in Dubai is now above USD60 billion, including the recent celebratory announcement of the government of Indonesia listing USD2 billion of their green sukuk on NASDAQ Dubai. The cornerstone of the center's success has been its structure and collaborative approach. In terms of working with stakeholders, there is always the bottom-up approach where we recommend to the board before it gets adopted and then implemented. Looking back at the last five years, the strategy has worked well since we have been able to sustain the momentum of these initiatives. These are now within the DNA of Dubai's economy.</p><h4>How does collaboration translate into making Dubai the Islamic capital of the world?</h4><p>Our philosophy revolves around collaboration with other jurisdictions and the universal vision to make Dubai the global capital of the Islamic economy. We cannot achieve that vision if we are not working with other centers and jurisdictions. The majority of our initiatives are global in scope, such as the halal industry. In 2016, in partnership with the Emirates Authority for Standardization and Metrology, we attended the International Halal Accreditation Forum to harmonize the processes and standards that the accreditation bodies use when they accredit halal certified companies. There are many accreditation bodies around the world and each has its own processes and standards. We conceptualized the establishment of one platform where these bodies join hands, harmonize, and develop a process that gets implemented across those certifications, paving the way for international trade between any two jurisdictions. This was set up in 2016 with nine countries, and today there are over 35 countries that are represented through their accreditation bodies. Surprisingly to some, several are in non-Muslim countries because there are companies that produce halal products in countries such as the UK, the US, New Zealand, Australia, and Italy. Ultimately, the goal is to reach a globally unified halal standard.</p><h4>Do you believe that the direction of knowledge transfer has shifted whereby other markets are looking to Dubai as the standard?</h4><p>We have proof that this has happened because we have over five Memorandums of Understanding with other jurisdictions who want to implement our strategies. We have MoUs with some of the CIS countries, South American countries and European countries.  In addition, we recently signed an MoU with Hong Kong through the Hong Kong Trade Development Council to collaborate on the development of the Islamic finance and halal industries. Many believe in the potential that these sectors hold, and the flourishing future they could create for their economies, but they would like the assistance of DIEDC. We have seen an increasing interest from others to learn more about what we are doing.</p><h4>How is the center leveraging Dubai Expo 2020?</h4><p>It is a pivotal event, not just for DIEDC, but for Dubai and the wider UAE. The benefits of Expo 2020 are comprehensive. Expo's themes of opportunity, mobility, and sustainability, naturally fit well within the Islamic economy landscape. Take sustainability: many values we talk about in terms of the Islamic economy are actually related to creating sustainable economies. Whenever we talk about Islamic finance, the differentiating factor is that the principles of Islamic finance are engineered in a way to help develop a sustained economic environment. Halal food has the same concept of sustainability, because it involves several quality checks. We are working with the Expo 2020 team to see how we can fully leverage the groundbreaking event through conducting activities together.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Amadeus play in Saudi Arabia's digital transformation and how are its priorities aligned with vision 2030?</h4><p>Amadeus is a global technology company, listed in the Spanish Stock Exchange with 19,000 employees connecting over 1.6 billion people a year to local travel providers in over 190 countries. The company started more than 30 years ago as an IT system provider for airlines to then evolve into a leading company providing advanced technology solutions for the global travel industry. Technology has always been critical to developing global travel, increasing scale and access. Mobile devices, artificial intelligence and data analytics are continuing that evolution, giving people ever more ideas, options and control over their journey. Thus, today we are positioned at the heart of the country's digital transformation, and as a key enabler of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030. The country is adopting the latest technology and is committed to lead in the IT segment rather than to follow. Organizations must keep up with the extremely fast pace of changes powered by cloud technology, and this also means being open to new sectors that are currently being digitalized, such as Hajj and Umrah, entertainment and sports.</p><h4>How do you expect demand for the Live Travel Space to evolve and what will be the key drivers?</h4><p>Today, our Amadeus Travel Channels business embraces the concept of Live Travel Space, a new concept powered by cloud technology called “Amadeus Travel Platform“ - a robust platform built on open systems, harnessing intelligent use of data, integrating new interfaces and architectures to provide our travel channels B2B and B2C levels (retail, online travel agencies, business travel and corporations) access to all global travel content in one single place. The world is changing, and so as the behavior of travelers as 80% of consumers worldwide own smartphones and expect information on demand for new content, destinations, and better booking travel experience that they can manage themselves on any digital platform. At Amadeus, we develop technology every day, harnessing intelligent use of data, integrating new devices and architectures to deliver personalised and integrated journeys. Our technology ensures transparency, choice and simplicity for travelers and gives our customers the tools to drive growth and efficiency. These are created, under our Live Travel Space concept to serve the country's path towards Vision 2030.  Indeed, the creation of new cities and new attractions, for either entertainment or business, and the increase of education and knowledge demand is transforming the country, and we have to cope with this.</p><h4>How has customer experience demand changed and how do you seek to adapt this for the business?</h4><p>The internet and big data completely changed the rules of the game, even in the travel industry. Today, everything is available on the Internet, and the digital technology provides intelligence and analysis about customers' experiences and views. At Amadeus, customer support is one of the key pillars of our service offering simply because we want to be the technological partner that contributes to the success of our customers. For example, we provide a 24 hours one-stop shop customer service portal called “Amadeus service hub“ that enables our travel agency customers to train and service themselves online via multiple platforms while providing access to how-to and troubleshooting articles, view videos and download technical guides. We also rely on the user experience to develop all of our products, so we are sure that there is a demand for whatever we are developing. The user experience and artificial intelligence and knowledge that has been increasing day by day will all be fed within the Live Travel Space and will be available for the customer.</p><h4>How do you expect artificial intelligence to impact 5G and IoT connectivity to impact the Saudi business environment?</h4><p>AI has been around for a while, but the leap, which started only a few years ago, will be tripled or quadrupled in the next few years. There will be increased dependency on AI especially for IT companies where customer support is an important service of their business. In user experience, AI is important because once the system sees a profile they will immediately come up with suggestions and anticipate your needs. AI will be at the heart of our technology and user experience. It will increase user benefits through agility and flexibility. Additionally, 5G networks will demand AI because they are far more complex than previous-generation networks. IoT is a huge market with far-reaching implications for several industries and travel is no exception. That being said, the advent of IoT is both a challenge and an opportunity. Thus, we are also pleased with the recent partnership with the world's leading IoT service provider, “Sigfox“, a global network operator together with our Amadeus global expertise, to explore use cases where IoT technology could solve some of the challenges faced by travelers throughout their journeys.</p><h4>How should Saudi Arabia balance fundamental R&amp;D efforts that expect result in the long-term projects and applied research to solve specific issues?</h4><p>Increasingly there is a tendency to work in 'agile' mode meaning develop faster with shorter product lifecycles getting sooner to market with pilots etc. This won't happen obviously in every scenario but it is becoming common to bring new features or test new technologies. Using the agile approach, Amadeus has already built live features for 20 different airlines, covering mobile, web and messaging. The quicker something is live, the quicker it can start. Products are built over a number of program increments, consisting of six two-week sprints. Concentrating on agile benefits in terms of “time to value“ means some projects are carried out so quickly that they hardly warrant being called a project. To give an example, recently, we have also taken another step towards the creation of a common, centralized industry platform for biometrics at Ljubljana Airport, reducing the average boarding time by approximately 75%. The biometric technology enrolls passengers using an Amadeus smartphone app that captures a 'selfie' alongside their passport photo and boarding passes, which are all stored securely on a remote server. Photos of the passengers are then captured at the boarding gate and matched against those stored on the server to validate passenger's identity and flight status. Upon successful matching, a message is conveyed to the Departure Control System for every passenger to board smoothly. All biometric data is deleted within 48 hours ensuring GDPR (General Data protection Regulation) compliance. The new technology promises to enhance the passenger experience by making boarding faster, simpler and more secure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[80-of-production-exported]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has Novopan played in developing the wood exporting industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>
	The wood industry in Ecuador is old, and Novopan has played a vital role in the market since the company started in 1979. We represent about 50% of Ecuador's panel wood exports. Novopan's history is slightly different from that of other regional companies because it started as a company focused on exporting. Between 1979 and 1982, we saw an impressive expansion of the industry with regular exports to Colombia and Venezuela. From 1982-1992, our export activity fell, as some countries started to limit imports. This period taught us to adapt to the circumstances. We started finding opportunities in the local market and eventually made two investments to improve quality of our product. We reached our highest production level of 30,000cbm a year in 2007, and since then have been growing. We moved to a different place in Quito that was better connected, and we installed a plant with a capacity of 300,000cbm. Currently, Ecuador offers interesting opportunities, as the country is adopting a more business-friendly approach. In 2019, we inaugurated a new plant taking advantage of the country's new regulation for investments. Our production capacity is now at 600,000cbm, and we employ 500 workers, with each direct worker creating on average 10 additional indirect jobs.
</p><h4>How does Novopan ensure its economic activity is in line with socially responsible practices?</h4><p>
	The wood industry in the country has taken decisive steps to guarantee that its activity is sustainable in the long-term economically, socially, and environmentally. 60% of the wood we use comes from planted forests, while 40% is recycled wood. We receive up to 15,000 tons of recycled waste that before used to be a problem for communities. All the collection of these recycled wood is done through small entrepreneurs who started supplying these materials to us 20 years ago. We have more than 200 people working in the business of supplying recycled wood for us. When they started, they had old vehicles, and now each has brand-new trucks to collect the waste that they sell to us. In addition, we are one of the few industries that have a carbon-neutral effect. Any company that wants to look at 2030 and 2040 must not forget the social and environmental areas. For Novopan, that is clear; even the dust generated through our daily operations is used as fuel. We sell our products in Ecuador exclusively through our own franchise Novocentro, which has more than 50 stores across Ecuador. Families are our target profile for our franchisees. As a result, this has had a social impact across the country.
</p><h4>How is Ecuador's new trade policy expected to impact the wood industry and its export activity?</h4><p>
	The wood board industry needs economies of scale, and Ecuador has a 16-million population; therefore, it is difficult to build economies of scale in a small country. Thus, we are competing globally. Novopan exports 80% of its production, and we compete with Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Bolivia, USA and Central America, among many others. Any step taken to facilitate trade with our neighbors is welcome by the sector, such as the case of Ecuador joining the Pacific Alliance. Our market is the American continent, so any further integration in the region can be beneficial. This will be one of Novopan's priorities in the short term: reaching out to new markets in an orderly fashion.

		<url><![CDATA[ryyan-tarabzoni-ceo-saudi-air-navigation-services]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have SANS' operations evolved to adjust to the increased demand for traveling and traffic management services that Saudi Arabia is witnessing?</h4><p>2019 was a successful year in which we established solid foundations that helped us to fulfill our transformation strategy journey and plan, where the main focus was on uplifting the infrastructure, standardization plan, and shaping the journey to optimization. In addition, we defined five strategic pillars to support our strategy: safe operation, efficiency, human capital and people focused, financial effectiveness, and strategic partnership. We obtained the first ever Air Navigation Service certificate in Saudi Arabia from GACA, moved ahead with our Safety Maturity level to meet international standards, and by 2020 we will have achieved huge enhancements in our operations through our new ATM system, new surveillance and communication systems. At an employee level; we have invested considerably in ensuring our air traffic controllers, technicians &amp; engineers, and broadly speaking, our leaders, received multiple certifications to guarantee the quality of our staff remains at the highest levels. From a financial aspect; we focused on cost effectiveness as well as starting to diversify our revenue income beyond the traditional navigation fees. We contracted our first project—NEOM airport—which included installing and commissioning of the navigation systems. We look forward to having system installation, project management, maintenance, technology, and navigation design services among the key areas in which we seek to expand our operations in order to diversify our revenues, for which we will pay special attention to new and secondary airports. Finally, we were recognized as the first ANSP in the region to establish a CRM system to improve customer relations, thus allowing all our customers to easily share their comments and concerns. Receiving such feedback will allow us to take the entire service and experience to a new level. Indeed, 2020 will see us continue our journey with a focus on optimization and how we can take our services to the next level through safe operations, more efficiency and adding value to our customers.</p><h4>What is the current status of the aviation industry in Saudi Arabia, and what does the future hold?</h4><p>With Vision 2030 and GACA aviation strategy, we look forward to transforming Saudi Arabia into a true hub for the region and ensuring efficient cooperation and communication among all stakeholders involved in the aviation industry. Developing the appropriate infrastructure will be crucial, which is why the new terminal at King Abdulaziz International Airport will play out as a new operation ground for all aviation players to come together to accommodate growing traffic at the safest and most efficient operational level. That being said, a healthy balance between skilled people, capital and advanced technology will complete the circle. The capability of talents in the future will be different. Technology is moving faster than anyone imagined, so everyone must adapt to the new innovations, and the entire ecosystem needs to be ready to stay ahead of the curve. While air traffic control will still be needed, navigation technology will force a new set of skills to be adopted by our controllers. For example: virtual and digital capabilities and skills. Infrastructural technology changes will require talents and skill changes, which is why our training department is working closely with our engineering department to predict the direction and scope of technology in the next five to 10 years and adjust the hiring and training process accordingly.</p><h4>What emerging technologies are shaping the field of air navigation systems, and how should Saudi Arabia position itself with regard to localizing technology?</h4><p>Digital/virtual towers and drone systems are two hot topics shaping the conversation in the aviation industry, though implementing these new technologies with the appropriate safety and standardized practices presents both an operational and regulatory challenge. However, this challenge can be also seen as an area for growth, and finding the right balance to ensure this growth remains sustainable in the long-term is therefore crucial. On one hand, large government entities like SAMI are working on localizing technologies to deliver long-term sustainable growth of the aviation industry and the overall Saudi economy. On the other hand, some advanced technologies may prove too costly to be developed locally. In this sense, partnerships, especially small partnerships, are critical for future technologies to be implemented in operations. There is a great appetite for foreign players to invest in the country, and Saudi Arabia can handle a great deal of that externally induced growth to then transfer it internally over the years. Moreover, Vision 2030 allows stakeholders from the civilian front to engage constantly with their military counterparts, which in our case, led to the delivery of multiple areas of flexible user airspace. This proves once more how all factors are aligned for the aerospace industry to grow organically within the country and act as a true economic catalyst for the new era of Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The objective of QDB is to develop and empower Qatari entrepreneurs and innovators to contribute to the diversification of the Qatari economy. What have been the main milestones and areas of activity of QDB in the recent years?</h4><p>Qatar Development Bank (QDB) was founded with the main objective to grow Qatar's private sector and diversify its economy. Since our establishment in 1997, we have been at the forefront of these efforts. We have worked with thousands of Qatari entrepreneurs and enterprises. We have provided investment and guidance to entrepreneurs, start-ups and well-established corporations. And we have built a reputation for identifying promising investment opportunities. To promote the local private sector, we extend wide-ranging financial and non-financial support to entrepreneurs across a myriad of industries, including a series of initiatives to promote an entrepreneurial spirit and create private startups. Our development schemes, such as the eco-friendly Jahiz I and Jahiz II initiatives, have empowered local SMEs operating across a diverse range of industries, including chemicals, electronics, plastics, wood materials as well as food and beverage. As the SME landscape grows ever more intricate and complex, we turned our attention to strategic partnerships to further support and empower local entrepreneurs. Our focus is on the market gaps: access to training and information, access to funding, and access to markets. In 2010 we introduced Al Dhameen program — our partial loan guarantee scheme, whereby we guarantee up to 85% of loans through our partner banks. The following year we launched Tasdeer, the Qatar Export Development Agency, to level the playing field for exporters. When we merged with the Enterprise Qatar in 2014, our goal was to create a one-stop-shop for entrepreneurs and SMEs. Today, our scope extends from ideation to market launch and export support. In 2018, we provided training for 3,000 beneficiaries, supported development of more than 50 feasibility studies and incubated over 200 companies. We have also supported 13 companies to start exporting, as well as engaged 26 companies in trade missions, identified more than 500 business opportunities for our customers and achieved QAR3.6 Million in signed deals. Through Al Dhameen service, we supported 310 clients to obtain the guarantees and achieved QAR955 Million in outstanding guarantees. We have also extended Direct Lending support amounting to QAR6.2 Billion to more than 540 customers.</p><h4>Qatar Development Bank is working on the launch of business incubators specializing in sports and fintech. How do these sectors complement the diversification of the Qatari economy? What other areas do you identify as key for the development of a modern society towards 2030?</h4><p>Qatar Development Bank has launched incubation centres as part of its accelerated efforts to support startups and SMEs and achieve economic diversification in Qatar's private sector. The new incubation centres are dedicated to financial technology (FinTech) and sports technology (SportsTech). They provide support in every way possible to budding Qatari entrepreneurs who aspire to participate in transforming Qatar into a knowledge-based society. Powered by Startupbootcamp, the world's largest network of innovation programs, Qatar SportsTech accelerator hosted its first QST Demo Day in May 2019. The Demo Day celebrated the graduation of the first batch of ten international SportsTechs that have been accelerated during the three-month program. This year, the startups will be presenting solutions for the benefit of the sports industry using the most advanced technology available. The need for a robust sports technology industry is only going to increase as we approach the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and it will continue well beyond. Thus, the creation of Qatar SportsTech Accelerator which will play an increasingly essential role both locally and globally, in taking the sports industry to the next level.QDB is also planning to invest more into the Venture Capital initiatives. In May 2018, we signed deals with nearly six international Venture Capital firms providing QAR100 million worth of funding for Qatari SMEs. Currently we have more than 24 investments and we been looking into more investments. QDB is making tremendous efforts to offer much needed push to Qatar's financial landscape, backed by technology. The ensuing year was big for Qatar's fintech aspirations with QDB playing a key role to support the industry with an array of measures announced recently, and with more interesting developments to be announced soon. As per the guidance from Qatar Central Bank, and in collaboration with key government organizations and financial services industry players, QDB is working on a Qatar Fintech Hub initiative to support the development of the fintech industry in Qatar. We aim to facilitate collaboration among all relevant participants and stakeholders to create a vibrant fintech ecosystem. Another recent fintech initiative hosted by QDB was the Fintech Pitching and Coaching Day held in December 2018. During the event, QDB signed a cooperation agreement with Finastra, one of the largest UK-based fintech collaborative platforms with representations in major hubs across the world. QDB is also overseeing the Qatar Business Incubation Centre (QBIC) which is a unique mixed-use business incubation center, providing support services to help entrepreneurs who either have an idea for business or want to grow an existing business.</p><h4>Time after time, exports are facing a relevant increase in the country due to the surpluses. In that sense, how is QDB assisting the local companies to export?</h4><p>The number of SMEs in Qatar venturing into foreign markets has been growing. Qatar Development Bank is implementing an aggressive campaign to encourage local manufacturers to expand into regional and international markets. Over 300 non-hydrocarbons companies have exported their products in 2018 under the various programs of QDB and have generated about USD2.1 billion in revenue. There is a good potential for Qatari products, due to their good quality as well as the time and money that we invest in to exporting companies and their offerings. QDB provides full support to Qatari SMEs by promoting Qatari products in international exhibitions and corporate matchmaking events. The bank also conducts exports readiness assessments for companies to develop and equip entrepreneurs with the necessary skills needed to expand into foreign markets. Exporting is related to the awareness of the investor that his/her products can compete outside. And we're now increasing awareness among the local manufacturers that their products can really compete outside the country. Our participation in several global exhibitions and trade shows of global levels offers our SMEs the much needed platform and confidence to showcase their product offerings to the global audience. We strive for their better future and work towards supporting Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><h4>What are the QDB's plans and strategy for 2019-2020, and your perspective on the evolution of the market in the following years?</h4><p>The GCC blockade affected the country to a large extent especially in terms of essential imports. Qatar though took it as a challenge to be self-sufficient. It started many projects to promote “produce in Qatar“ which have started yielding impressive results. QDB has been working hard for years on implementing Qatar's economic and industrial diversification strategy, by extending all kinds of possible support to SMEs and budding entrepreneurs. Some of its popular initiatives include the credit guarantee program (Al Dhameen) and export promotion program (Tasdeer), incubation program, and many others. Moving forward, our success will lie in our ability to embrace the fast pace of development in the world of technology, strengthen our connectivity with one another and the markets around us, and truly immerse ourselves in the digital age. In the days to come, embracing its national responsibility, QDB will continue to empower the nation's citizens to tap into the latest wave of economic globalization and evolve Qatar's economy as outlined in National Development Strategy (NDS) 2017-2022.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Dubai's sport scene positioned within the region?</h4><p>Dubai, without a doubt, is a leading sports destination; that is not just in the region, but globally. This is thanks to the visionary leadership of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and the guidance of HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of Dubai Sports Council. Dubai is a brand that is synonymous with quality in every sphere. It is no different in sports. We believe in hosting and delivering events of the highest quality and making sure both athletes and fans return with unforgettable memories of their stay in Dubai. We have some of the world's best sporting infrastructure, but our biggest advantage is our leadership, who love sports and have worked tirelessly to build infrastructure and to encourage both Emiratis and expatriates to embrace sports and a physically active lifestyle.</p><h4>How do sports contribute to Dubai's soft power and the Emirate's brand?</h4><p>Sport is, has been, and always will be on the top of our government's agenda. It is one of the top objectives of the Dubai Plan 2021. Our wise and visionary leadership understands that sport plays a big role in the growth and appeal of a truly global city. Sport is also becoming an increasingly important element in the tourism industry. According to some studies, the sports tourism industry is worth billions and is expected to grow at a rate of more than 6% in the coming years. In Dubai, we have been building and investing in our sports industry for more than 40 years. Today, we can boast of sporting landmarks like the Meydan Racecourse and the Hamdan Sports Complex. We also have some of the world's best golf courses, including one in Hatta, transforming Dubai into one of the leading golf tourism destinations in the world. Name the sport and we have it here, from cycling, tennis, table tennis, badminton, squash, aquatics, to cricket. Dubai is home to more than 200 nationalities and our sporting calendar embraces this diversity. Our focus is on encouraging every segment of our community to not just watch, but embrace sports and physical activity because, as studies have shown, sports is a fountain of positivity and happiness in society. You could call Dubai a City of Challenges as well. We have four different challenges on four different surfaces: ice, sand, mud, and the challenging hills of idyllic Hatta. These Challenges are a huge hit among the community and attract a great number of participants. The numbers keep increasing with every event.</p><h4>How is the government and its policies helping the sports brand of Dubai here and internationally?</h4><p>We are blessed to have a leadership that has always emphasized the value of sports and an active lifestyle. They love sport and understand the meaningful role it plays in creating a healthy and vibrant society. Sports have always played a positive role in an individual's development. In addition to the physical benefits, sports help in building character and developing strategic, analytical, and leadership skills. The government wants to harness this power of sports and create an oasis, where values like tolerance and inclusiveness. We hope these values that sports encourages and promotes can become the norm for generations to come.</p><h4>How does DSC add value to Dubai through its attraction of sports events and sponsorships?</h4><p>Our greatest advantage is our visionary leadership, who through their persistence and hard work have turned Dubai into the jewel of the Gulf. Every time a top sports event or international sports federation decides to come to Dubai, they are assured of quality. Look around you and you will see quality everywhere—from the Burj Khalifa to some of the world's swankiest hotels and malls, from one of the busiest airports in the globe to the world's favorite airline. The list goes on. This assurance of quality is the reason why all the world's top sports stars, events, and international federations want to keep coming back to Dubai. Beyond events, the sports stars keep coming here for their vacations as well because this is one place where they are assured of privacy. Dubai is their favorite haunt, their favorite destination to relax and recharge. Their families also want to keep coming back because Dubai is a complete family destination, with multiple attractions to charm the young and old, men, women and children.</p><h4>What are your expectations and plans for the future?</h4><p>The plans and strategies of DSC have always been aligned with the strategic objectives of the Government of Dubai, and our focus has been on creating a distinguished and happy sports community. Moving forward, this goal will remain the same. We will remain committed meeting the government's strategic objectives and help create the most physically active community in the world, as our Chairman HH Sheikh Hamdan envisions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Amadeus has been working for the modernization and advancement of the travel and tourism industry for 30 years. How has this corporate experience translated into the Colombian market?</strong><br>Our headquarters are in Madrid, our development and technology center is in Nice, France, and our data center is located in Erding, Germany. Amadeus has invested more than EUR4 million in R&amp;D in recent years. We work at the forefront of advancing technology in the tourism industry. Colombia and the rest of the region are in the process of development, and Amadeus has the upper hand in latest tourism trends because its headquarters are in Europe. Notably, the recent trends in developed countries favor Colombia. Brazil and Colombia are the most important players in the region. On the other hand, Argentina is undergoing a challenging period, and Mexico is adjusting itself under the new government. Colombia is becoming fashionable among tourists across the world. We have taken advantage of our 30 years of technological development to bring all the latest developments and technologies to Colombia. </p><p><strong>What growth opportunities are there for Amadeus in Colombia?<br></strong>If we help the sector grow, we also benefit. What's important is to develop the sector in collaboration with all the stakeholders. If there are more reservations and movements through technology platforms, Amadeus will benefit. One prominent issue in Colombia is the lack of quality infrastructure, but that can be improved through proper management. As this infrastructure grows, both domestic and international tourism will grow. The government understands this and is working on infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Amadeus recently presented the Live Travel Space initiative. What is this initiative, and how will it change tourism and travel?<br></strong>Live Travel Space is an ecosystem that brings all stakeholders on a single platform that is accessible by travel agents across the world. Live Travel Space works with all the airlines, hotels, car rental companies, and tourism providers. Tourism is evolving with technology, and at present, airlines and tourism providers are not only using a global distribution system (GDS) but also new initiatives such as The International Air Transport Association's (IATA) New Distribution Capability (NATA). Then there are APIs that connect different agencies and airlines. Amadeus integrates all these technologies into Live Travel Space. Live Travel Space means having the whole world of travel on a single platform.</p><p><strong>What are the sectors that still need a digital transformation in Colombia?<br></strong>We need a hotel infrastructure. There are many international chains, but Colombia needs hotels not just in the major cities but also in remote places. Moreover, if Colombia wants to become a regional tourism hub, we need to train people in languages, tourism services, and technology. Equally important, we need to think beyond Bogotá, Medellí­n, and Barranquilla. Moving forward, only agencies that invest in technology and automate their processes will survive. Technology is not necessarily expensive; there are solutions available for USD100 a month. If Colombia can get things right, it can become a big name in the tourism industry. For perspective, Mexico and Colombia receive around 34 million and 4 million tourists per year, respectively; the difference is that Mexico has infrastructure, language skills, and other services.</p><p><strong>What are your future plans?<br></strong>We are working hard on big data and business intelligence. We have an impressive source of information in our system, which has more than 600 airlines. This allows us to let agencies know about clients' travelling habits so they can make personalized sales. We work with process automation. We are a technology agency, and we offer front-end and back-end services. In Colombia, we must work on automating processes to avoid manual errors. It will also help us become more efficient. Undoubtedly, tourism can spearhead Colombia's economic growth. Amadues grew by 6.3% in 2018 and it is targeting 10% growth in 2019.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of your operations in Colombia?<br></strong>We are the third-biggest company globally in terms of the number of cinemas and the second in terms of the number of attendees per cinema. We have 5,600 screens around the world. We arrived in Colombia 10 years ago and are present in Bogotá, Cali, Medellí­n, Manizales, Valledupar, and soon we will expand to Barranquilla and Cartagena.</p><p><strong>What international expansion plans does Cinépolis have?<br></strong>The company is exploring opportunities in the European and Asian markets. In Latin America, we are in the most relevant countries concerning attendees: Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. We are excited to know what other Latin American markets have opportunities for growth. We depend on the architectural development and construction of shopping centers.</p><p><strong>What is your expansion strategy in the Colombian market?<br></strong>Cinépolis evaluates the types of people that visit a particular shopping mall. In commercial centers with a high or medium-high socioeconomic level, we have traditional cinemas; however, depending on the mall, we might offer different formats, such as IMAX, 4DX, as well as three or four VIP lounges. In Plaza Claro, we found an exciting market opportunity because people from upper-middle class live around the area. We therefore decided to open seven VIP theaters in Plaza Claro. On the other hand, Procinal in Salitre and Cine Colombia in Gran Estación are two cinemas with standard services. Notably, we opened the first junior theater in Colombia, an exclusive room for children with slides, games, and pool balls. In that room, only the last three rows are regular seats, while the rest are sofas and puffs. We are the only company to offer this and since it has been successful, we are planning to open a junior room in Cali as well. Our VIP rooms include a bar, restaurant, and reclining leather seats. We also provide waiter services, and the opportunity to enjoy international cuisines, cocktails, and wine. When looking at projects, we ask ourselves how we can serve a different audience differently. There is a great deal of growth for such alternative experiences.</p><p><strong>What kind of innovations have you planned?<br></strong>We are working on the development of the cinema of the future in 2022 or 2023, with fully automated services and digital lobbies. It is a way of projecting the company in the future. We differentiate ourselves from the competition and anticipate trends, reasons why we have been so successful.</p><p><strong>What is the possibility of Cinépolis expanding into gaming centers and virtual reality?<br></strong>We are not considering them in the short term. It is more long term because it requires a lot of adjustments. We already have a room where approximately 18 people can fit into teams and interact in different scenarios; however, these services are extremely niche and sacrificing a movie theater to provide a service for 18 people requires careful planning.</p><p><strong>How has cinema attendance grown in both standard products and specialized services in Colombia?<br></strong>This industry depends a great deal on foreign productions, especially Hollywood. People have become more demanding about the movies they watch. Anten had great blockbuster movies, but more specific niches have developed in recent times. For our VIP rooms, we look for films related to different markets and locations; it's extremely important to know your audience. At the same time, we try not to neglect the films that attract less attendees.</p><p><strong>What can we expect from Cinépolis in 2019 and beyond?<br></strong>In 2019, we will open a VIP cinema in Barranquilla. We are studying an opportunity in Cartagena and more strategic positions in Bogotá, our main market. We are also evaluating Cali and Medellí­n. The company has a global interest in buying chains such as Cine Hoyts in Chile, Village in Argentina, and Yelmo in Spain. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The CEOE established its international division at the end of 2018. How would you evaluate its first year of operations?</h4><p>Our president, Antonio Garamendi, has been clear, since the beginning of his mandate, that he wanted to strengthen the international arm of the CEOE. The degree of openness of the Spanish economy, representing more than 66% of GDP, is 20 points higher than what it was in 2009 and nine points more than the highest point prior to the 2007 crisis. The Spanish economy is more international and open as compared to other countries such as Italy, the UK, or France. The number of companies that export on a regular basis has been expanding year after year and Spain is one of the main recipients of FDI. However, the climate in which international economic and trade relations take place has worsened. In the EU, developments such as Brexit generate great uncertainty and within the national context, imports outweigh exports. Given these circumstances, CEOE International advocates intensifying efforts to identify new opportunities for Spanish companies abroad and correct existing barriers. After a year of operation, we can say that the activity of CEOE International has increased on the back of its proactive agenda that defends the interests of Spanish companies.</p><h4>Digitalization is a topic much discussed in all the sectors as it has become an inevitability. What is CEOE international doing to help companies in this process?</h4><p>CEOE has developed a roadmap to improve Spain's position in the digital field in the international context, specifically within the framework of the European Digitalization Strategy, the 2025 Digital Plan. This incorporates more than 280 concrete proposals, based on three crucial areas: education, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Given its cross-cutting nature, which encompasses all sectors and actors including civil society, business, and public administration, the plan entails a series of challenges, chief among them is increasing the digitalization of Spanish society by 10%. In turn, this could increase Spain's GDP by 3.2% by 2025 as well as raise the employment rate by 1.3%. The plan also aims to create 250,000 additional jobs, further developing the enterprise ecosystem and doubling the number of startups by 2025.</p><h4>Spanish companies are increasingly present in the region, particularly in the construction sector. What importance does the Middle East have for Spanish companies looking to expand globally?</h4><p>The Middle East plays an important role in the internationalization of Spanish companies since it is a highly diverse market with great potential for growth. Large-scale projects are currently being developed in the region in priority sectors such as infrastructure, engineering, energy, transport, and environment. Good examples include the largest solar park in the world in the UAE and large tourist complexes and infrastructure projects in Saudi Arabia. The participation of Spanish companies in these projects is a great business opportunity that can also help to consolidate Spain's position as a global leader. In addition, given the geostrategic position of the Middle East, it represents a good entry platform for both Asian and African markets that may encourage the expansion of Spanish companies further.</p><h4>Spain has some of the highest unemployment rates in the EU, estimated at 13,9% in February 2019. What does the CEOE propose to tackle this problem?</h4><p>This figure of unemployment represents, without a doubt, our biggest concern; however, we should not overlook the important progress made in creating jobs. Over the last six years, we have generated 2.5 million jobs, more than any other country in the EU. The number of unemployed people reduced from 6.28 million to 3.35 million and the unemployment rate declined from 26.9% to 14.7%. This is testament to the strong recovery of the Spanish economy, which is in its sixth year of economic expansion. This strong progression of our economy is the result of macroeconomic measures, structural reforms adopted between 2012 and 2014, and the strong sense of responsibility shown by all social partners. In this sense, we must not only highlight the 2012 labor reform that reduced some rigidities of the labor market, but also the II National Agreement on Employment and Collective Bargaining (AENC) signed by business organizations and unions for 2012, 2013, and 2014. The signing of this agreement, which was renewed later through the III and IV Agreements of the AENC, were essential to contain the increase in salaries and recover the productivity that had deteriorated during the pre-crisis period. We hope that this good trend in the labor market will continue into 2019 and 2020, years in which the economy is expected to grow by 2.1 and 1.8%, respectively, and create around 700,000 new jobs, which would put the total number of unemployed below 3 million. However, there is still some way to go. Therefore, we insist that the 2012 labor reform is not reversed and that it continues to be implemented in order to overcome flaws in the labor market, whose main indications are the high rate of youth and main wage earners with temporary contracts. We believe that the high social contributions borne by companies hampers the competitiveness of companies and reduces the number of employed people. With that in mind, the education and training systems must be adapted to the needs of the knowledge economy in order to reduce imbalances in the labor market. Furthermore, continuous training to ensure the transition of an employee throughout their working life is crucial. And, finally, it is essential to achieve an integrated labor market that promotes territorial mobility to reduce unemployment and the imbalances between the different regions.</p><h4>What are CEOE's objectives for 2020?</h4><p>The business community faces multiple challenges, such as globalization, digitalization, and innovation. Therefore, we are proposing a greater investment in R&amp;D because the current allocation of 1.3% of GDP is clearly insufficient. In addition, we have an important roadmap that includes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), that mark the strategic plan of our organization. Undoubtedly, we also have to increase the weight of industry in Spain to 20% of GDP, in order to meet the target initially set for 2020. At present, including the electricity sector, this percentage is only 16.5%. In terms of taxation, a key issue for the competitiveness of companies is the difference between social contributions in Spain, of 30%, and the rest of the EU, where the average is below 25%. At 25%, corporate tax in Spain is also high as compare to the European average of 22.5%. Therefore, the CEOE continues to insist on legislative efficiency and market unity. The fight against the shadow economy, which represents 22% of GDP, is an important issue; if proper policies are implemented it can add EUR200 billion to national coffers.<br>And, finally, we want decisive measures to support internationalization, especially of SMEs. For this, CEOE will continue to strengthen its areas of influence and the coordinated work it develops with international institutions such as BusinessEurope, the Ibero-American Business Council, the OECD, the International Organization of Employers (OIE), and the B20, among others.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Could you brief us on Despegar's operations in the country?<br></strong>Despegar is a company that started in Argentina in 1999. At present, it is in 20 countries in Latin America and is the largest OTA in Latin America. The company has been listed on the US stock market since 2017 and sells different products for airlines, hotels, packages, transfer activities, and amusement parks. Colombia is one of our largest markets, and we have been here since 2000; we have been growing exponentially year after year. We also have a call center in Colombia with around 500 employees.</p><p><strong>How would you describe the role of Colombia in Despegar's portfolio?<br></strong>As Colombia opens up, we believe that technology and companies like Despegar will be the tools that facilitate how Colombians travel inside and outside the country. Along with technology comes other innovations such as smartphones and mobile applications, and Despegar is a key player when it comes to mobile and app transactions. The company's app recorded over 46 million downloads as of September 2018, representing 30% growth YoY. The app is not only a sales platform, but also a customer satisfaction and customer service platform.</p><p><strong>What can we expect from Despegar in 2019 and beyond?<br></strong>We believe 2019 is going to be a great year for Despegar. We are betting big and hard on no-interest installments, since we believe they hold great benefit for our clients. We are also betting on our mobile app to offer more development and benefits. As well, we are working to get to as many Colombians as we can through our call center and different channels. We are putting efforts throughout the country because our main goal is to make it to the point where all Colombians can travel through Despegar.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tourism in Colombia today is a different industry than it was in the past. What has been the role of Aviatur in this?<br></strong>We have never stopped promoting Colombia as a tourism destination, even during times when we knew it was a utopian effort. During the period of civil unrest and Pablo Escobar, we still participated in international trade shows, fairs, and exhibitions. In 1967, we opened offices in Paris, Miami, and Caracas to promote tourism. We were highly successful until the Palacio de Justicia event in 1985, but nonetheless, we continued to promote Colombia. At present, we are highly active in the online business, which accounts for 30% of our activity on average. We have 55 bungalows in Las Islas, and on any day around 20% of visitors arrive through Leading Hotels of the World, 17% through travel agencies, 15% directly through the hotel, 10% through our offices, and 20% from online booking. On a daily basis, we have around a 60% capacity rate, with an average of 29 rooms booked. </p><p><strong>How is Aviatur working toward promoting sustainable tourism?<br></strong>We provide any type of tourism on request as well as tailor-made plans for any special interest. This is bringing a new type of tourist to Colombia. We are receiving an increasing number of requests for specialized tourism, such as those to discover archeology, flora, and fauna; Colombia is an ideal destination for ecotourism because a good percentage of its territory is untouched. Meanwhile, the mechanisms of “consulta previa," or popular consultation, established by the 1991 constitution require the government to ask the local communities if they want tourism, and if so, what type and in what capacity. After discussion with the indigenous communities, the government communicates the information to prospective investors.</p><p><strong>Your new hotel in Baru is a pioneering high-end, luxury establishment. How can the Colombian coast take advantage of high-end luxury tourism?</strong><br>Every country has to decide on what type of tourism it wants to develop. The important matter to consider is not the number of people coming, but the revenue they generate for the country. The number of international tourists may be small, but the majority of them are high-income individuals. This is a policy that the Maldives, Botswana, Uganda, and Bhutan, among other countries, have adopted. It will prevent problems that cities such as Venice face, where there is a movement to oppose tourism. We are beginning to face this problem with cruises in Cartagena, for example, which flood the city to the annoyance of locals.</p><p><strong>Do these new types of tourism present an opportunity to regions other than Cartagena?<br></strong>Recently, a number of major players from different cities posed this question to me. We have to know where the tourist sites are and what they represent, for example, in terms of speleology, transparent rivers for kayaking, fauna, and flora, and so on, in order to engage in effective promotional activities. We have a company called Aviaexport, which was instructed to appraise our entire offerings, and only then present the opportunities in each region to the specialized travel community. Simultaneously, we have to prepare guides to check circuits and try to use the existing infrastructure as much as possible, before seeking additional facilities. </p><p><strong>Can you tell us about Avialegal?<br></strong>Ours is a country of lawyers, with one out of two professionals being one, and also a country with too many laws despite a slow legal system, in my view. In the tourism field that we specialize in, we know which errors to avoid. We are the only travel agency in the world that besides having external consultants, employs nine full-time lawyers. Therefore, we have decided to outsource these services to the Colombian tourism industry. When a group of our employees propose a partnership with us to provide a service we do not yet provide, we pursue the opportunity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does the university manage its initiatives with the public and private sectors to have a positive impact on Medellí­n and the region?<br></strong>Universidad de Medellí­n is a private institution that does not receive financial support from any government or private entity; therefore, it must generate the resources for its administration and growth. Alliances are a fundamental part of our strategy; the institution belongs and participates in the University Company State Committee that oversees aligning Higher Education Institutions of the region and the country. This alignment considers the needs and contributions of the state and private businesses. In relation to this, the Universidad de Medellí­n has 17 patents that contribute by providing solutions to environmental problems in areas such as civil engineering, energy engineering, the IoT, and audiovisual communication, among others. Likewise, we developed a factor risk conformed by several software that measure and provide advice on financial risk issues. A materialization of the impact of the Universidad de Medellí­n in Antioquia and Medellí­n is the installation of a solar light pole in the community surrounding the campus. Regarding the relationship with private companies, teachers at the university developed an IoT technology that allows the detection of gas leaks in kitchen countertops. This invention is supported and financed by the Haceb organization, which develops household appliances. It is in these scenarios where Universidad de Medellí­n generates and applies science as a service for society.</p><p><strong>How do you help prepare students for a globally competitive economy?<br></strong>The Universidad de Medellí­n, through its international relations division, has established relationships with the world for the internationalization of its academic and administrative processes. We currently have 140 agreements with universities across the world. Every year, an average of 150 students from Universidad de Medellí­n go abroad, and similarly, around 130 international university come to Universidad de Medellí­n. Approximately 80 of our teachers visit other countries for academic papers, postdoctoral internships, and research agreements and during that same period an average of 80 international teachers visit Universidad de Universidad de Medellí­n to fulfill the same purposes. Furthermore, an agreement such as the Peru 18 program has allowed young people with special socioeconomic situations in the Republic of Peru to study with full ride scholarships at Universidad de Medellí­n. </p><p><strong>How does the university manage its internal policies to foster an inclusive environment?<br></strong>Since our foundation, we have taken inclusion as a missionary foundation, which is why we are one of the few Colombian universities that base their enrollment fees on the socioeconomic stratification of the applicants. In this sense, we are also the institution with the most enrolled scholarship holding students in the region. An average of 2,632 students benefit from scholarships, academic incentives, and discounts for sports and artistic activities. Likewise, our permanence quality program is focused on serving the student population with the objective that they do not abandon their careers and successfully complete their programs. This is focused on five specific workshops: anxiety management, concentration and attention, reading comprehension, logical thinking, and individual attention. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the cannabis global environment like?<br></strong>There are over 50 nations that have either legalized or decriminalized cannabis. As noted in our recent The Global Cannabis Report — 2019 Industry Outlook, New Frontier Data estimates that in 2018, the global cannabis retail sales market was worth USD344 billion, with the number of legal and illegal users totaling approximately 266 million. Sales and production of hemp, the non-psychotropic cousin of cannabis from which CBD extraction is also possible, has experienced 20% CAGR for the past five years, a double-digit growth at par with some of the fastest-emerging markets in the world. While North America is still considered the epicenter of the industry, regions such as Europe and Latin America, the foundation of the cannabis market today, are beginning to take center stage. Europe now has 29 legal markets, all for medical use, and is potentially set to have the fastest-growing B2B and B2C demand for hemp and cannabis in the world. B2B demand is set to potentially increase much more rapidly as FMCG large enterprises in sectors such as beauty products, apparel, beverages, and edibles explore introducing hemp- and CBD-based products.</p><p><strong>How does Latin America and Colombia fit into the global cannabis market?<br></strong>Given the surge of demand in Europe, Canada, as one of the most mature cannabis markets in the world, has positioned itself to meet such demand. Canadian exporters, while experiencing their own domestic production challenges, have now begun to look at Latin American nations to complement its export volume to Europe, starting with Colombia. Latin American nations have optimal climates in which to grow hemp and/or cannabis, for the most part are already seasoned agro-based economies, and can offer much lower labor costs. While New Frontier Data has identified Brazil as having the largest consumption market potential due in part to its population size and current support from both government and populous for medical cannabis, countries like Colombia and Mexico present potential for faster growth in their export markets rather than domestic ones. While Europe presents the biggest export opportunity, it will be interesting to see how both Canada's fast-increasing domestic adult use and medical demand, as well as the US potential federal legalization, may open additional exports targets and opportunities for Latin American nations.</p><p><strong>Have there been any surprises in your cannabis market research to date?<br></strong>Most recently, we have begun to assess preliminary research suggesting hemp may not only have medical applications, which continue to widen as far as conditions treatable by CBD-based medicine, but also fairly advanced industrial applications. Beyond textile production and even widely adopted soil regeneration and cleaning properties, hemp seems to also have battery life extension and conductivity properties and applications. Early research in Asia shows that carbonized hemp may be able to surpass graphene's conductivity. While China continues to aggressively pursue a global competitive edge in all things technological, it will be important to track its potential transition from hemp cultivation for textile production to more advanced industrial applications, which would have a global socioeconomic impact.<br><br><strong>How can data help cannabis operators and new emerging cannabis industries?<br></strong>Investors cannot measure risk and possible ROI without data; entrepreneurs cannot introduce new businesses effectively without understanding supply, demand, or the competitive environment; and existing operators cannot develop new products and services, nor maximize profitability, without understanding consumer behavior, price sensitivity, or macroeconomic factors. Policy makers and regulators are ill equipped to set effective rules and tax brackets without having viable data, and researchers cannot achieve scientific progress without the access to shared information. New Frontier Data has developed a state-of-the-art digital platform, Equio, to facilitate the reporting and sharing of said critical data to all cannabis market stakeholders. Our team has predicted market shifts both qualitatively and quantitively with increased accuracy, helping inventors, businesses, and governments navigate and succeed in the exciting, yet mercurial, global cannabis market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role could a fully developed and established medical cannabis sector play in the Colombian economy?<br></strong>Colombia has low-cost, large-scale, sustainable production methods and a centralized geographic location to support global distribution routes. In short, Colombia is ideally positioned to be a global hub for what some predict could ultimately be a USD500-billion industry. Latin America alone is projected to be a USD12-billion market for medical cannabis. Both Colombia and FCM Global are aligned with powerful industry trends. The greatest initial impact will be on the agricultural sector, leveraging Colombia's existing leadership in agribusiness knowhow. In Colombia, we still need to deliver a great deal of education before the country starts producing at scale for the medical sector. However, it will happen, and when it does, thanks to Colombia's robust medical cannabis legal framework, the impact will be large and lasting.</p><p><strong>How has the attitude of Colombia's financial sector changed in regard to the medical cannabis industry over the last year?<br></strong>Attitudes have evolved significantly since early 2018, and Colombia's financial sector is now looking closely at the industry. There are now several commercial banks actively participating in the medical cannabis industry. Change can always be faster; however, there are complexities, which include international and US regulations. Development agencies are getting involved as well. But the onus is not completely on banks. To accelerate the evolution, Colombia's medical cannabis companies need to play their part, be good actors, and build strong viable businesses.<br>What education does Colombia need to fully realize the industry's potential?<br>We do not want only private companies taking the lead; the industry's future has to be coordinated with the government, otherwise inefficiencies will surface and innovations will be put at risk. Cannabis awareness is not just about seminars, but about showcasing products and doing roadshows with global specialists from leading countries such as Israel, Germany, Switzerland, and Canada.</p><p><strong>What does FCM Global's “Co-Sourced Colombia" model mean, and how does it give you a competitive edge?<br></strong>FCM Global does not compete with its clients, who are manufacturers in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and wellness sectors. Instead, we provide customized cannabinoid extracts as inputs for our clients' finished products in a way that meets their standards for safety, consistency, and quality. Additionally, we have the collaborative R&amp;D capabilities to help clients create new cannabis-based products, with the necessary extracts to match. Our goal is to become the “Intel of medical cannabis" in supporting top-tier clients across legal markets worldwide. Colombia helps FCM Global extend its early-mover advantages and realize lower production costs, due to its equatorial climate, optimal growth cycles, and low costs of energy, resources, and land. We can pass these lower costs on to our clients in a way that doesn't sacrifice quality. In fact, the FCM Global's “soil-to-oil" platform operates to both Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards, and benefits from a transparent governance model.</p><p><strong>What is the next step for FCM Global?<br></strong>2018, and now early 2019, has been a transformational time for FCM Global. We continue to invest in and grow our world-class team of agricultural, operational, and scientific professionals.  We are extremely proud that our entire team is sourced locally and that we didn't leave Colombia for expertise or IP. FCM Global has been granted a license for five proprietary genetic strains and we are working on getting approvals for our 100-plus strains. We have three areas of focus: expanding and consolidating our operations in Tolima to ensure we have a consistent, reliable supply of extract; increasing the participation of the financial sector so that the industry does not face a lack of finances; and forming partnerships around the world to help develop and distribute final products. The first project is scheduled to be completed in 2019 and the other two in 2020. We are excited about the future and believe we are on track to meet significant global industry demand at unique price points and scale. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>One thing that sets PIDEKA apart is the way it's designing its growth operation, which is set to be the largest indoor operation in Colombia. What advantage does this give you? </strong><br>PIDEKA is the first and only indoor-licensed producer with a tissue culture laboratory and solvent and solvent-less extraction labs in Colombia. Soon, our labs will be GMP certified. Indoor facilities allow absolute control over all variables such as moisture, temperature, lighting conditions, nutrition, and every other possible consideration in terms of variable control. This is the most efficient way to consistently produce high-quality, medical-grade product, and the only way to have consistency in cannabinoid and terpene concentrations.</p><p><strong>How does PIDEKA's model gives it an enhanced presence in international markets? <br></strong>The international impact of PIDEKA is based on its indoor model, which has the highest technology and state-of-the-art precision controls. In addition, we will have GMP certifications that will allow us to compete internationally.</p><p><strong>What role has PIDEKA played in the development of the cannabis sector in Colombia?<br></strong>PIDEKA has focused on the development of research processes with a model of 20 plants, which at the time was what the law allowed; this helped us to generate a pilot study with patients of different symptoms, supported by health professionals with whom we were able to create a database that served to assert that cannabis had medicinal uses. Thanks to this, we were able to contribute knowledge and share it with the sector and thus create an industry that was additionally leveraged by emerging regulations. PIDEKA was the sixth company in the country to obtain a license in 2015, and it was recertified again in 2019.</p><p><strong>What is your development strategy for a market that's growing more competitive?<br></strong>The main strategy is to achieve the standardization of production processes and products to become competitive in the international market, all the while positioning our products strategically and differentiating ourselves from the competition.</p><p><strong>How is PIDEKA advancing the scientific status of medicinal cannabis? <br></strong>The company has started to generate cooperation initiatives in development and research with recognized national universities such as the University Jorge Tadeo Lozano and the ECCI. Progress has also been made in agreements with high-level public entities such as AGROSAVIA, which will validate all PIDEKA production processes through its globally certified laboratories.</p><p><strong>What is your approach toward developing products for medical care?<br></strong>In the pilot phase of research, test products were developed based on the global theoretical framework already in use, and with our new infrastructure we will be able to guarantee the standardization of our products. Additionally, our alliances with pharmaceutical laboratories will allow us to generate new forms of administration for different symptoms and treatments.</p><p><strong>How can Colombia fully exploit its advantages to become a medical cannabis leader?<br></strong>The International Narcotics Control Board has awarded Colombia a 44% quota of the global cannabis market, which means the national industry has the opportunity to supply an emerging market and generate significant income for the country. On the other hand, thanks to the current law, if a company has the capacity to produce on a large scale, it is allowed to contribute toward this quota. </p><p><strong>What is next for PIDEKA?<br></strong>We will focus in particular on brand positioning, international growth, strategic alliances in the US, Canada, and Europe, and the creation of new pharmaceutical products thanks to our alliances and studies developed by the department of agronomic research and development. PIDEKA will be recognized as one of the main producers and distributors of medicinal cannabis derivatives, and with our phytosanitary certificate, we will be the world's seed bank. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Aiming for 50% Export Rate]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[suleyman-oncel-chairman-board-sentez-grup]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sentez Grup was originally founded to serve the packaging needs of Selçuklu Holding, but later developed into a global packaging producer. Can you outline the most important steps along Sentez Grup's timeline?</h4><p>The purpose of Sentez Grup's establishment in 1992 was to manufacture boxes for pharmaceutical companies. Later on, when Mehtap Kitchenware joined the Holding, we started manufacturing boxes for housewares as well. Realizing that it is a promising market, we had decided in 2002 to increase our packaging production using our experience in the pharmaceutical sector. We had a three-step investment process. In 2003, we made our first phase investment in machinery and facility. We moved to a 2,500sqm facility from a 500sqm facility. We soon established a new facility of 18,000sqm. We also expanded through our subsequent acquisitions of Gül Offset and Naturel Packaging, two of the leading packaging companies in Turkey. We held three facilities, employing roughly 550 people. In order to benefit from the shared competencies of these structures, we decided to gather these three facilities under a single roof in 2011. As a result, in 2014 we completed these investments. Since that year, we have been operating in our current Dilovası Facility, which has 55,000sqm of indoor area. Our operations here are an example of an industrial profile that is rarely seen around Turkey; even around the world. The logic underlying our establishment is to be able to produce any kind of packaging the customer may demand.</p><h4>How has the growth of the food sector driven Sentez Grup's expansion and helped shape its product offering? </h4><p>The increase in the volume of our business and the packaging industry could only be possible with the growth of the food sector first. Today we hold a market share of around 1%—which is quite large considering the size of the global market. We constantly develop and produce various products ranging from inner packages to outer packages and flexible packages in order to fulfill all the packaging needs of our customers, which are mainly from the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMSC) industry. We target a balanced growth in these packaging groups within the framework of our customers' demands. Since our establishment had commenced its operations with cardboard packaging, our production volume in this group is larger than the flexible packaging group. Currently, 25% of our packaging is flexible and 75% is cardboard. We are one of the three largest cardboard packaging producers in Turkey. We continue our efforts to balance our flexible package production and cardboard package production. </p><h4>What percentage of Sentez Grup's overall revenue comes from exports and in what markets are you working to expand your market share?</h4><p>Our current export rate is around 25%. However, we plan to increase that figure in the near future. In the short term, we work towards the goal of attaining a rate of 35%, and then reach a balanced export rate of 50%. We primarily export to European countries, and the neighbor countries of Turkey. We want to achieve diversified export customers. To achieve this, we have recently begun cooperating with an American firm that has facilities at various different regions of US. The trading volume of the packaging industry is much higher in the US, so it is our most important target market in the first phase. There is also a huge trading volume with our southern neighbors as well. Iraq is a major market for us, but the political situation there affects the business tremendously. In a relatively tranquil period, we see a serious volume of business, but when there is a conflict then the business suddenly comes to a halt. Likewise, Syria has the same problem. If everything goes smoothly in world politics, that would be a huge benefit to Turkey's exports. Looking to Europe right now, we are primarily engaged with northern Europe. We also aim to expand to central European countries.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges you face in the sourcing of raw materials?</h4><p>Our pricing is mostly based in euros in our domestic sales and exports. Sometimes our suppliers can give their prices in dollars. The fluctuations in USD/EUR parity may cause problems in our costs time to time. This is not an operational issue related to the supply chain. Yet, we have alternative suppliers that can offer pricing in both currencies. Of course, such supplier shifts do not always occur easily. Our top priority is always maintaining quality. A couple of years ago, the Chinese government shut down many cardboard facilities due to environmental concerns. This had a huge impact on world trade. Aside from the increase in paper prices, firms were forced to find alternative suppliers. Recently the trade dispute between the US and China, and the restructuring of global trade cause the producers to act much more carefully and sensitively.</p><h4>Over the short term, what are Sentez Grup's investment plans and primary objectives?</h4><p>We plan to make a huge investment especially in machinery and facility in the near future since we had arrived to this stage with continuous investments. Quite recently, we had signed a subscription contract worth of EUR6.5 million with Heidelberg, one of the leading companies in offset printing technology. Thanks to this investment, we can now produce what we used to produce with four machines using only two machines. This is an agreement that includes indirect control and lots of support elements. We have new machines and their capabilities are excellent. We have a capacity that will fulfill our mid- and long-term targets. We have a project that we have been working on for seven years to develop our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. We are working with a Portuguese company to achieve that upgrade. Currently, all of our ERP modules are integrated with each other. However, the project requires a second step, which we started in 2018. We have an intense schedule to complete this upgrade within the next 18 months. We named it the “Completion Project," as it is a project that will finalize all of our other projects that we have done so far within the scope of Industry 4.0. It is a structure, which enables the control and tracking of all processes within our facility. Right now, we can do it with a 60% flow rate. It is a project that will increase that rate to 100%. From now on, we will put emphasis on increasing efficiency.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How did the company evolve to where it is today?<br></strong>GHC was formally founded in 2017 as a result of the initiative of a team of Santanderians that saw an opportunity in the medical cannabis market. We started the project's pre-feasibility phase with our own capital, obtained the licenses required by the different ministries, and complied with the legal and technical procedures of entities like Colombian Institute of Agriculture (ICA) and National Narcotics Fund (FNE). Thereafter, we designed and built our pilot automated greenhouse with innovative local engineering. Aiming to consolidate the project with investment and transfer of knowledge after evaluating different options with companies in Australia and Canada, we decided that partnering with Canada-based Cannaverde Pharma was aligned to our strategy and business philosophy. At present, we have a strong competent team with national and foreign talent that adds value to each of our processes. We are finishing the construction of 17,100sqm for production greenhouses and 2,000sqm for mother plants and the agronomic evaluation. We have the finances to advance the development for next stages.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of being located in Santander?<br></strong>In Santander, we have the environmental, social, legal, academic, and scientific conditions to develop the medical cannabis cluster. GHC incorporates the regional strategy for leading the local cannabis sector through a sustainable agricultural production, including extraction and refining processes and investment in R&amp;D to develop innovative products.</p><p><strong>How are you working to ensure the sector develops in a sustainable and responsible manner?<br></strong>The advantage of being pioneers of the sector in Santander is that we can build the columns for the industry with a sustainable consciousness. We are generating formal employment that directly benefits local communities and impacts the local economy. We promote transfer of knowledge by providing alternatives to develop several key skills. We are convinced that, if the environment and community grow positively, our organization will follow suit. Our processes are resourcefully designed to be environmentally friendly. At GHC, we collect rainwater for irrigation within a controlled system; we only use organic fertilizers and we do not use pesticides. Moreover, we use the biomass left over from the extraction process as compost for our crops.</p><p><strong>How is GHC making a difference in the sector?<br></strong>One of our key pillars is research and development processes. Medical cannabis has great potential, but it must be formally explored and developed. We have human talent specialized in each part of the process, seeking best practices and generating knowledge. We are working on consolidating cooperation agreements with important universities, like Universidad Industrial de Santander and Universidad Nacional de Colombia's Institute of Biotechnology. Another key pillar is our corporate culture; we are fortunate to have a competent, passionate, and integrated team that gives its best every day.</p><p><strong>How do you perceive the cannabis market, and what potential do you see in Colombia and globally?<br></strong>According to Euromonitor International, at present, the cannabis industry is valued at USD12 billion, and by 2025 the sector is predicted to grow by 1,283% and reach USD166 billion in value. The medical cannabis legislation in Colombia covers all legal and technical features, making it a benchmark for regional countries looking to enter the sector. Colombia's medical cannabis sector has a great opportunity to become the leading exporter of high-value cannabis-based products and represent 0.5% of the country's GDP, equal to bananas and flowers exports together.</p><p><strong>Which products have the most potential for GHC?<br></strong>The most popular and studied components of cannabis are CBD, which provides therapeutic benefits, and THC, the psychoactive component that has its own unique medical properties. However, there are more compounds that are released in the extraction process like terpenoids and flavonoids, which, among others, give the aromatic features to the plant and have anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties that have not yet been studied deeply, opening a whole new range of opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What will be the role of higher education in the integration of people affected by the conflict?<br></strong>The role of education is extremely important in this. The goal is for Colombia's various territories to participate in the country's development in order to help the regions and cities that could not develop due to war.  The Territorially Focused Development Programs (PDET) are aimed at former guerrillas who have rejoined society and are in need of education. When we talk about rural education and post-conflict, UNIMINUTO participated in promoting the National Ministry of Education's efforts in 2018. We are present in regions such as Cantagallo, Istmina Chocó, Tibú, Catatumbo, and Nariño. Former governments, as well as the current one, have supported our presence in those regions. UNIMINUTO is a rural impact institution with a large territorial approach; we work in more than 70 places located deep into Colombia, representing the commitment of the institution. Our mission is to make those places reachable and help to educate the uneducated.</p><p><strong>Where does UNIMINUTO stand in Colombia's educational landscape?<br></strong>At 110,000 students, UNIMINUTO is the largest institution in Colombia in terms of the number of students. According to the Observatorio de Universidades, we are the largest university after the National Learning Service (SENA). We have 26 departments out of the 32 present in Colombia. We are currently working a project that aims to incorporate the base of the pyramid into the educational system, giving people access to social mobility and the possibility of inclusion in an unequal society. UNIMINUTO makes up 5% of the total number of students enrolled in higher education in Colombia, according to the National Higher Education Information System (SNIES), the statistical agency of the Ministry of National Education. Though we have provided higher education to large masses of Colombians, we make these admissions with quality, and that makes UNIMINUTO a commendable institution. Around 65% of our student population comprises women, and many of them are the head of their families. We also have people with disabilities. We give everyone an opportunity, and no one is left outside, which is part of the missionary commitment of the institution. We seek to maintain the training of our students and help them to position themselves in the market and be competitive and productive. We create social mobility, and that is our mission coherence.</p><p><strong>What is the importance of inclusion in higher education for the Colombian economy and its competitiveness?<br></strong>Colombia is a diverse country with different contexts and possibilities of development for different regions. We can talk about the possibilities of inclusion as we train people in these regions; the people we train go on to contribute to their territories and encourage development. The National Development Plan has a perspective of equity with a regional approach. Inclusion will not be possible if the regions are not empowered in their internal logic of development through knowledge and appropriate training. It is a challenge for Colombia to ensure that these regions have the human talent and the appropriate knowledge to cover their specific needs.</p><p><strong>How have the regional or departmental governments articulated these efforts with UNIMINUTO to achieve the goal of educational inclusion?</strong><br>We collaborate extensively; UNIMINUTO is a university of alliances. We would not have been able to do what we have achieved thus far without our alliances with both the public and private sectors. We have been able to do many projects thanks to the partnerships with the government of those regions. They support us, and we bring our educational project, training models, and desire to serve. We try our best to ensure that the work we do is synergistic in nature because that has been a part of the UNIMINUTO culture since its foundation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How have the attitudes of the medical community evolved since you started?<br></strong>The attitudes of the medical community, both in Colombia and internationally, have evolved significantly since we began operations. In partnership with Universidad CES, one of the leading medical schools in Colombia, we have been training doctors for more than a year now and developing courses for them in universities, training over 80 doctors to date. They are extremely enthusiastic about learning more about medicine with cannabis. We have also been working with four hospitals to develop services in pain and physical therapy, and they have been very open to learning new treatment methodologies. </p><p><strong>What are your investment and expansion plans for PharmaCielo's newly raised capital?<br></strong>Now that PharmaCielo is publicly listed, we are extremely focused on several areas intended to deliver ongoing value to the enterprise and shareholders. Our largest area of capital investment is the expansion of our industrial capabilities, with the construction and certification of a research and technology center as a GMP facility in 2019 being principal among them. This will be complemented throughout the year ahead by continuing to expand our processing abilities and capacity through the addition of more processing technologies. As we have announced strategies for both Mexico and Italy, it goes without saying that we will also make investments in new operations in those markets as well, along with whatever else 2019 chooses to unveil.</p><p><strong>How do environmental concerns inform the company's philosophy?<br></strong>From the beginning, we have been extremely focused on environmental and social responsibilities. All the farms that are part of PharmaCielo are certified Florverde. The cannabis industry is young; therefore, it is highly important for the industry to identify and obtain appropriate certifications that might have been applied to other sectors in the past. In 2019, PharmaCielo will receive certifications such as ISO 9000, ISO 14000, and good manufacturing practice (GMP). Overall, there are seven different certifications that PharmaCielo is set to accomplish in 2019. Our overall cultivation system is based on producing cannabis in a natural environment. To that end, we have established 10 different natural insecticides and fungicides, including different nontoxic practice methods like using sticky traps and vacuums to extract insects. Combined with these initiatives we also use the water collected from the greenhouse covers in our reservoirs. Through the efforts of our charitable foundation, Fundación PharmaCielo, we have been helping some of the communities with a variety of activities ranging from educational agriculture best practice programs to community development. One example is working with identified conflict zone communities where they were growing illicit crops.  The CSR initiative focused crop substitution programs and helping with reforestation efforts and consulting about agricultural best practices. All of these efforts combined demonstrate PharmaCielo's uncompromised commitment to building a new industry in Colombia.</p><p><strong>What major achievements did 2019 hold for you? <br></strong>Our activities in 2018 laid the groundwork for some significant achievements in 2019, including PharmaCielo becoming a publicly traded company on the Toronto Venture Exchange as well as one of only two companies to receive approval for licensed strains from the Colombian Institute of Agriculture. PharmaCielo also announced new business initiatives in Mexico and Italy to establish global operations. All these developments make us more excited about the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What's your corporate mission in Colombia?<br></strong>Our corporate mission is to stabilize the international cannabis sector. So far, we have only had five years to stabilize the sector; in comparison, aeronautics had 200 years and auto had 100 years. The number of countries that have flipped to legalization just over the last 24 months has further made it harder to convince the international banking authorities to allow money transfers related to the cannabis industry. Moreover, an equally significant challenge is finding bulk buyers interested in repeatedly acquiring high-quality cannabis products. In order to stabilize the industry, we had to find a way to control these projects. We built a methodology called Benchmark SOLUTION, which is a consultancy service that plans, designs, implements, and manages the facilities for a minimum five years. So unlike other consultancies, we see it through a team that is present at the facilities all around the world. This solution comprises five different of lines of business and each one has a director in each country. So, all directors and teams understand the regulation and processes for any particular project. The industry is at a point now where large-scale wholesale opportunities are absolutely real.</p><p><strong>What's the importance of certification to stabilize the cannabis market? <br></strong>That's an absolute weakness. The variety of different standard requirements to manage the process from raw material to final product supply chain is huge. On the analysis side, just making sure that the date and labeling is reliable under the ISO:17025 standard is a challenge. The problem is to find labs that handle cannabis or are accredited to do cannabis analysis. In case one does find a lab, the question is if that lab will buy or subscribe to a firm that is using methods that other governments have adopted. We purposely partnered with a firm to use their methods globally, which are specifically developed for cannabis. Next, we have the good management practice (GMP); the problem is that different governments have different standards. Then, there are organizations that are working to develop their own methods for all of this, called consumer-level standards. We have large institutions like SGS as auditors that do this work themselves.</p><p><strong>How are the banking and financial issues limiting the development of the industry in Colombia?<br></strong>I am surprised the sector even survived this long without the banks. In Canada, we worked with Scotiabank, with which we had a history of 14 years. Up until November 2016, all operations were running smoothly, but then our account was flagged because it belonged to the cannabis sector. We did not process or distribute cannabis, but we consulted in applications for cannabis and they gave us 18 days to close our account. So, trying to scramble to get another bank account was exceptionally difficult. That said, many of the businesses related to the cannabis industry across the world face similar problems. Some of these businesses have shifted entirely to cash, however, in our case, everything has to be done through wire transfers.</p><p><strong>How do you see theracann INTERNATIONAL's future working with Colombian firms in the next five years?<br></strong>Well, Colombia is at the crossroads, honestly. It has to start to demonstrate it can produce high-quality traceable cannabis, or it will get black-marked. Countries that get black-marked never come back. They just cannot get the confidence of an international jurisdiction that things are going to work well. The other challenge is that the Colombian banking system has a perception of the old days. We need to build the competence to show the cannabis industry in Colombia is working well. On the contrary, I have seen projects in which cannabis that should not be coming from a specific area is finding its way. Why? Because the auditing in traceability is not strong enough. We do projects in which crop production and quality controls are lacking, so there is still a lot to be done. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[go-to-market]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What are the next big markets for your products?<br></strong>The biggest news is cannabis and the proposed end of prohibition in Mexico. Mexico is a country of 130 million people with a massive middle class. In any economic category, Mexico is around eighth in every category. Cannabis is no different. This is massive news, though this is also a complex market. We have a former president of Mexico on our board of directors, and our medical director lives in Mexico City. We will make more hires there as well. Another massive market no one talks about is Brazil, with 240 million people. It is a complex market that we are playing attention to and planning for any future deregulation. We are not waiting for a press release from the government; we are working there and building partnerships. Europe is the next big battle ground globally, and we should be able to have low-cost products in Colombia sold at full retail in more developed countries. This is something we can contemplate. We have already diversified the agriculture component of our business. We are up and running here in Colombia, we have recently announced our dealing in Chile, and a third region will be coming out in the region shortly and then a fourth. We are diversifying our climate, geopolitical, and regional risk across multiple jurisdictions. It is not about square feet but diversifying our risk. We want to create wealth in the countries where we are operating. That is an important distinction between us and everyone else. We are hiring Chileans in Chile and Mexicans in Mexico. We do not want to have one central business and spread it out from there, but rather a regional business that embraces the spirit of the regulation. Colombia did an amazing job; the spirit of the regulation here is a matter of public health. The second leg of that is creating economic opportunity. We have as many people in marketing as we do in cultivating. Our vendor list went from something like zero vendors in 2018 to over 200 now.</p><p><strong>What is your capital market strategy, and how does it help you stand out in this market?<br></strong>We have adopted a public markets strategy. We have leveraged capital markets to raise the capital we needed to grow the company and have raised around USD40 million. In the meantime, we have maintained over 30% insider ownership. We have about three extremely supportive shareholders that make up another 30%. We have spent the last 12 months from a capital markets perspective, building a strong foundation. We are the first non-resource company to go public out of Colombia. That is a massive achievement for us. We have been able to tap capital markets efficiently while keeping our share count low. Our capital structure is tight and allows us to be nimble and look at other opportunities without diluting ourselves too much. We have adopted a strategy of communicating with high-net-worth individuals. They provide us with the capital for the business so far, and they will continue to support us.</p><p><strong>What is your advantage in facing uncertainties?<br></strong>From a regulatory standpoint, we have an exceptionally great handle on the regulations and how they are changing. We operate in multiple jurisdictions, and our regulatory team has done an essential job in keeping us on top of that. There is no political risk in things changing. It is not only a hot topic in banking and finance, but in politics as well. We have to be experts on the regulatory environment. On the commercial side, we have to be focused on what consumers actually want. We spend time in mature markets like California and Colorado, and we observe the patterns and learn what people want.</p><p><strong>What future do you see for Khiron in the US?<br></strong>I believe in the imminent end of prohibition in the US, and it will be sooner than people think. 63% of people agree on legalization; that is more than people who agree on god. The same numbers apply in Mexico and other markets where we operate. We have excellent optics on all kinds of ideas in the US today. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-global-vision]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is the company investing to position itself in Colombia?<br></strong>We see Colombia as a highly strategic investment opportunity, not just to position the company as a local market leader, but also to develop a complete end-to-end platform that will enable its expansion into wider international markets. In order to drive market leadership, we will be focusing on maximizing some of Aphria's key competitive advantages and strengths, including the execution of a consistent global vision that aligns with the company's core values as well as a solid go-to-market strategy that touches all critical elements of the value chain. Part of our commitment to Colombia is to assure that we manage and control the entire process in the value chain, from seed genetics to the patient-doctor experience. This means ensuring that Aphria's high-quality cultivation and extraction processes, technology, product development, distribution, and medical enablement are led by its team of experts. Besides investments in infrastructure and other material assets, one of our biggest priorities is to continue investing in human capital. We are proud of the talent base that we have integrated into our organization through the acquisition of Colcanna, a local Aphria subsidiary, and of our ongoing investment in the development of our people. </p><p><strong>How is Aphria building relationships with the Colombian medical community?<br></strong>We are currently executing multiple medical initiatives and alliances that involve partnering with respected educational and medical institutions in Colombia. One of the most exciting initiatives that we executed earlier this year was the exclusive partnership agreement with the Colombia Medical Federation (CMF), which plays a fundamental role in enabling Colombia's medical community and assuring that Colombia maintains global awareness and leadership in medical developments that impact the overall health sector. Notably, the CMF has over 2,000 affiliated doctors and a data base of about 70,000 medical professionals. We plan to work closely with the CMF to sponsor research initiatives, develop medical training programs, and design certified medical cannabis courses that leverage their virtual training platform.</p><p><strong>How is Aphria creating long-term value for its shareholders in a competitive market?<br></strong>As the medical cannabis industry continues to grow, and its business potential becomes clearer, we will see more companies try to participate in the marketplace. We are very confident in our ability to maintain sustainable long-term market leadership in Colombia due to our many competitive advantages that derive from Aphria's global strengths, experience, and expertise across the industry. We are building a business model that replicates the very best of our Canadian best practices, standard operating procedures, and technology, and we are committed to not cutting any corners if it means sacrificing the end result: low-cost, high-quality products, and best-in-class doctor and patient experiences. Shareholders can be confident that Aphria's vision and investments, backed by a solid go-to-market strategy, will represent high production yields and high profitability margins for the company. We are building state-of-the-art greenhouses and laboratories based on the most reliable and advanced technology available. When you combine this with Colombia's ideal climate conditions and amazing skilled labor force, you have a winning strategy. As far as our export business potential, we truly believe that Colombia will become a highly important international hub that will expand Aphria's market reach across boundaries and into many international markets.</p><p><strong>What are the key advantages that this region presents as a cannabis cultivation zone?<br></strong>Colombia represents ideal climate conditions, consistent weather, and a long historic tradition of highly skilled labor. Our primary local operations are located in the coffee zone, which offers us even additional competitive advantages. The coffee zone is known for its many contributions to the Colombian economy, most notable in the agricultural industry, and so we carefully assessed the potential of this particular location in order to assure that our investments were concentrated in the most ideal part for this particular industry in Colombia. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Khiron's research focus allowed it to take the lead in developing cannabis-based products?<br></strong>We come up with many of our own formulations, and these are the result of research. We spent six to seven months with chemists to understand and develop our products. Also, there are plenty of companies developing R&amp;D that we can integrate. We seek to continue developing our plants to maximize yields and improve the quality of the cannabis we are extracting. Another area of research is about making it, for example, odorless and tasteless. This is extremely important for certain types of nutraceutical products. In some cases, we are able to develop partnerships with universities and research centers and other companies. We are reaching a point where we will need to develop hundreds of products every three years, and this takes a great deal of dedication and resources.</p><p><strong>What is the potential of the alternative cannabis wellness market in Latin America?<br></strong>The cosmetic market in Latin America is growing more than 10% per annum; I would call it almost recession proof. Within this area, CBD products are an interesting area that has not been fully explored. We are building a brand that uses CBD in a scientific and innovative way. We have nearly 40 high-quality products that will come out soon. One of our goals was to come up with products that disrupt the traditional view of cannabis. Our products are aesthetically beautiful and supported by fantastic spokespeople. Additionally, we are present across a variety of media channels. We have to constantly think about the delivery technologies we want to utilize and transform. The challenge in 2020 is to sustain the novelty of the products, thereby sustaining some of the excitement around them. We want to keep it from becoming a commodity, and innovation will keep the company on top.</p><p><strong>How does Khiron continue to work to advance the conversation around cannabis and dispel misconceptions?<br></strong>This is not a short-term process. I am proud that the company is leading conversations across many different communication channels. In terms of medical patients, we have seen a paradigm shift. We hosted the first conference on medical cannabis in February 2018, with over 500 doctors in attendance. Since then, there have been symposiums or conferences across the country almost every month. We now have four medical association endorsements, and every medical association in Colombia seeks to partner with a cannabis company to advance research. Our endorsement by the Neurological Association of Colombia was the first-such endorsement in Colombia.</p><p><strong>What new markets does Khiron seek to break into?<br></strong>We are extremely focused on Latin America. In 2019, our focus will be to continue to lead in Colombia, delivering on our promises to nearly 50 million people. Latin America has a growing middle class with great medical needs and fewer competitors. We just have to work to understand the geopolitical specificities of this entire region. Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, and Brazil form a market of 450 million people. We have to focus more on delivering in these countries than entering new countries. We are in the process of developing a market that will be bigger than Canada and Europe combined.</p><p><strong>What expectations do you have of the new government?<br></strong>This new government is pro-business; it cannot ignore the amount of FDI this industry has brought. The government is focused on the reputation of Colombia and is keen to ensure that everything takes place exactly as stipulated. This means it will be strict when it comes to managing this process. As a publicly listed company, we already hold ourselves to a strict and high standard. To a certain extent, it is on us to show the government that this industry is for real, and we welcome that challenge.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What does it mean to be a Colombian company in a market with a great deal of international attention and participation?<br></strong>It means that we have big challenges and great opportunities. That is why in April 2018 Clever Leaves became the first Colombian company to be fully licensed in medical cannabis cultivation and transformation. With this, the company materialized its purpose and desire to bring top-grade medicinal solutions to millions of patients. We actively promote shared benefits for all stakeholders by abiding to fair business models. Colombia is a country where one needs to know how to move because regulations are complex. There might be many investments and projects by companies that have started abroad; however, they have to come here and understand the realities on the ground. They have to find the right partners to get up to speed and become competitive.</p><p><strong>How does Clever Leaves work with the scientific and academic sectors to alter social perceptions and advance the field?<br></strong>The main goal is not to change the perception of medical cannabis, but to build knowledge on medical cannabis' impact on health. We are committed to doing R&amp;D with universities from a medical and scientific perspective. The education of patients and physicians and research communities is also extremely relevant to us. We already have partnerships with medical treatment centers in the country. We also have R&amp;D groups at universities.  Our next step will be oriented to be pioneers on building our own medical treatment business model that focus on medical research.</p><p><strong>What commercial strategies differentiate you from other players in the industry?<br></strong>Clever Leaves is positioned to lead the production of low-cost, high-grade medical cannabis extracts. Everyone is talking about quality; however, no one is investing from the beginning in location, procedures, and certifications like us. We have invested in our own distribution model for Europe. Having control over distribution will help us truly stand out; everyone seeks to produce in large quantities, but only a few know how to sell. We need people who can combine pharmaceuticals along with the agro-industrial sector as well as regulatory people who know both the local and international markets, and business people who can develop a great strategy.</p><p><strong>What can we expect from Clever Leaves in 2019 and beyond?<br></strong>Clever Leaves' objective is to become the world's largest medical cannabis grower by 2023 with over 10 million sqft (100ha) of  cannabis.  Clever Leaves is in the process of a significant expansion and becoming the leading cannabis operator in the world. The company already has more than a 450-employee working team, 13ha of fields for production located in the Municipality of Pesca (Boyacá), an extraction and production lab located in Tocancipá (Cundinamarca), and corporate offices in Bogotá. We are expecting to close 2019 with 25ha and 600 employees. Clever Leaves has already developed and strengthened associations with different clients around the world, portraying itself as a company that is not only cultivating cannabis, but also adding value to the development of the industry.</p><p><strong>How do you ensure high quality in your products?<br></strong>Clever Leaves is a vertically integrated licensed producer of medical cannabis in Colombia. Our cultivation complies with good agricultural and collection practices and our laboratory was built under European Good Manufacturing Practices (EU GMP) standards, with a top-of-the-line extraction facility with a capacity to produce 3,000 liters of EU GMP compliant full-spectrum cannabis oil a year. Clever Leaves covers the entire chain of medicinal cannabis, starting from the harvest of the seed all the way to the patient. The patient's well-being is Clever Leaves' focus. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the contribution of tourism to Malaysia's economy?</h4><p>The tourism industry in Malaysia has been identified as the key driver in the services sector. The industry continues to be the main source of foreign exchange that contributes to economic growth, investment, and employment and strengthening of service accounts in the balance of payments. In Malaysia, the tourism industry is one of the major contributors of the national services sector, with a contribution of 14.9% to GDP or MYR201.4 billion (USD49.315 billion) in 2017. Receipts from the tourism sector contributed MYR84.1 billion (USD20.593 billion) to the national economy in 2018, up by 2.4% compared to MYR82.2 billion (USD20.127 billion) in 2017. In addition, tourism industry employment recorded a high of 3.4 million people, representing 23.2% of total employment in Malaysia.</p><h4>How do you view the potential to further develop ecotourism, particularly in Sabah and Sarawak?</h4><p>Malaysia has formulated the National Ecotourism Plan 2016-2025 to maximize the potential of ecotourism and ensure sustainability in line with the State Government of Sabah and Sarawak Ecotourism Strategic Plan. This plan embodies the spirit of the theme, uplifting communities, opportunities, and economies. The National Ecotourism Plan 2016-2025 is a roadmap for conservation of ecotourism sites in the country through 19 strategies and 86 action plans. It is geared toward developing the ecotourism sector in order to further increase the tourism industry's contribution to the economy. Under the National Ecotourism Plan 2016-2025, eight ecotourism clusters in Sabah and nine ecotourism clusters in Sarawak that comprise matured and emerging clusters have been identified for further development to maximize its potential through several strategies. The strategies include upgrading and development of ecotourism infrastructure, product development, capacity building, and implementation of sustainable tourism development best practices as well as marketing and promotion.</p><h4>What are the requirements to further strengthen Malaysia's position as a tourism hub in Southeast Asia?</h4><p>In order to strengthen Malaysia's position as a tourism hub in Southeast Asia and the world, we need to focus on innovation and quality, human capital development, connectivity, travel facilitation, and sustainability. To remain relevant, it is important for Malaysia's tourism industry to transform by harnessing public-private partnership and embracing digitalization to drive innovation and competitiveness toward sustainable and inclusive development.</p><h4>What main sources markets for international tourists would you like to develop moving forward?</h4><p>Tourism income is an indicator that has a more economic impact on the country. This does not mean the number of tourists is not important; however, the focus will be on the amount of money spent as well as their length of stay. This is what we called a quality or high-yield tourist, which mostly come from medium to long-haul markets.</p><h4>How do you assess the attractiveness of Malaysia as a destination for tourism-related investments?</h4><p>Malaysia has so much to offer compared to other countries. Our long-running, global brand positioning “Malaysia Truly Asia" serves to highlight our pillar of strength, namely the diverse cultures and multiracial communities living in harmony and peace in one beautiful and blessed country. With the highest regard for conservation and preservation of nature, ecotourism will be one major segment to look into. This is in line with the development of the ecotourism clusters implemented under the National Ecotourism Plan 2016-2025. It will also benefit locals by contributing to the existing supply chain via integrated development that complements each other. Under this plan, 60 ecotourism clusters across the whole country have been identified for potential development by attracting foreign investors.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead, and what will be your main objectives?</h4><p>We have our Visit Malaysia 2020 (VM2020) plan, where we target earning MYR100 billion (USD24.486 billion) from 30 million tourists. The ministry has a big task in ensuring the involvement and cooperation of all stakeholders including the public and private sectors, non-governmental organizations, local communities, and industry players in achieving this target.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the contribution of Monash University Malaysia to the development of Malaysia's higher education infrastructure?</h4><p>Monash University celebrated 20 years in Malaysia last year. When the country opened up to international branch campuses, Monash was the first to establish a presence here. Over the last 20 years, we have developed into a fully comprehensive campus with more than 8,000 students, providing degrees in business, engineering, medicine, pharmacy, IT, science, arts, and social science. Monash is Australia's largest university, and Malaysia is its third-largest campus. The 16,000 graduates we have delivered are our most valuable contribution to Malaysia. About 75% of our graduates are Malaysians who are now working in businesses, government agencies, and NGOs throughout Malaysia. We have contributed to the development of human capital by providing young Malaysians with an international education at an affordable price. We have been recognized for the quality of our education, with a six-star SETARA rating awarded by the Malaysian government, the best possible. This places us at the top of Malaysia's higher education system. Celebrating our 20th anniversary was a great chance to pause and reflect on our achievements and look forward. We had our best-ever student intake in 2018 and have surpassed this in 2019. This speaks about our brand—that it is valuable and powerful. Health research is also an advanced area for us. We have many people working on diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. This is highly relevant to Malaysia, as like many countries in the region, Malaysia is transitioning from the health challenges of poverty to those of affluence. Our research attempts to address challenges directly relevant to the future development and sustainability of the country and the ASEAN region.</p><h4>How do you address global trends and changes in the ways students acquire knowledge?</h4><p>Information today is everywhere. Universities used to have an advantage when we were the primary brokers of information. This advantage has been lost. They have had to rethink and move away from focusing on providing students with content and engage more with developing their skills. In a nutshell, the way we are addressing this is through active learning. We are moving away from lecture-focused teaching toward workshops, seminars, and collaborative learning. We want our students, and our graduates, to be active partners in learning. </p><h4>What are the main challenges in Malaysia's higher education sector?</h4><p>Malaysia has a large higher education sector, though the range of quality is too large for a country that wants to be an international education hub. There has to be some rationalization and focus on excellence in higher education. This range in quality means that Malaysia has a regulatory system focused on avoiding problems at the bottom of the system, rather than enhancing quality and innovation at the top. This needs to be addressed if it is to flourish as an international scholarly hub. Fortunately, there are some positive signs coming from the new government on this issue. </p><h4>What will be your key objectives for the near future?</h4><p>Monash Malaysia is recognized as one of the most successful branch campuses in the world. We are successful in a number of dimensions, such as student numbers, educational quality, our financial position, and, most importantly, our research performance. The big evolution for Monash Malaysia going forward is to move from being a branch to becoming Monash University's platform in Asia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the contribution of UNM to the development of Malaysia's higher education infrastructure?</h4><p>We celebrated our 18th anniversary in September 2018 and are gearing up for our 20th, which will be a significant milestone. The original joint venture agreement was signed in 1998, and we commenced in 2000 with 86 students, being the first to establish a UK overseas campus in Malaysia. UNM has been a catalyst for other UK universities to come to Asia and Malaysia, specifically. Today, we are one of five UK universities here and are pleased to be considered the most global one. An international presence has become necessary for universities; however, when we first ventured out, that was not the case. I hope our actions have provided a sustainable model for globalization. The first five years were about building ourselves and attracting students. In 2005, when we moved to our current campus, we started developing a healthy research portfolio. UNM delivers world-class teaching reflected by our Tier-5 rating in SETARA 2017. We also have a five-star rating in the Malaysian Research Assessment (MyRA), making us the highest-rated international university in Malaysia in terms of quality of research and innovation. Doing research in Malaysia is different than in the UK, as there is no margin and we have to invest from our primary income streams, which are tuition fees. Despite this, our dedicated staff produces great research that cannot be done in the UK. We delve into subjects such as food security and the feasibility of certain crops in a tropical climate. We also investigate the human-elephant conflict. The elephant population is falling, and one reason is that they follow certain routes that are likely obstructed by human development. For example, when a road is constructed through the jungle, elephants are nervous to cross such roads, which can divide populations. We can see from statistics that our research publications have a real impact.</p><h4>What will be the main challenges and opportunities in the higher education sector in the coming years?</h4><p>One of the challenges in Malaysia is around visa regulation. On the one hand, the Ministry of Higher Education wants 200,000 international students by 2020. On the other, the immigration authorities need checks and balances, which can create difficulties for students coming to Malaysia. Some countries make the process much easier, and Malaysia has to recognize that international student recruitment is a competitive environment, and it should seek to ease immigration obstacles for those wishing to study here. We are one of 10 foreign-branch campus institutions in Malaysia, meaning we are a foreign university with a campus in Malaysia with degrees awarded by the host country, the UK in our case. Therefore, we have the added challenge of having to go through two quality assurance processes, the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) in the UK and the Malaysian Qualification Agency (MQA) in Malaysia. This takes additional time and resources. If I had one wish, it would be that MQA fully recognized QAA so that most, if not all, of the checks that MQA does could be removed. Indeed, there is an MoU between the two quality agencies, and my wish is for it to be developed to a stage where a UK foreign branch campus just had to go through one process. If we could achieve this it would make us more competitive and agile and reduce a great deal of the bureaucracy that we currently have to adhere to. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about the history of MUST and the vision on which it was founded?</h4><p>MUST was started in 1997 based on the vision of Tun Mahathir, the Prime Minister at the time. His vision was to have a world-class university in Malaysia that would mirror the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1998, the Malaysian government signed an agreement with MIT with funding of MYR100 million (USD23.89 million). The key focus was to bring the system, structure, and culture of MIT to Malaysia and create a postgraduate school in the disciplines of business, IT, and logistics. The first intake was in 2001, though the business faced some tough challenges since it was extremely expensive to maintain the relationship with MIT. Eventually, the agreement with MIT ended in 2009, and the university was unable to sustain itself without external funding. In October 2015, our chairman, who had invested funds to keep the university operational, was in the midst of surrendering the university back to the government, which is when I joined. Within five months, I managed to ensure self-sustainability. When I took over, we had 342 students, and today we have 1,600. If our programs are robust enough and meet the needs of industry, we will be able to take this program to other countries with our existing partners. This platform will first be tested out in Malaysia to determine if industry takes up this program at the PhD and master's level. Undergraduates provide better profit margins than postgraduates, so we will retain our current numbers to keep the university going and support our focus on postgraduate. We have a niche market that is in high demand, and our first-mover advantage allows us to determine the price. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the contribution of tourism to Malaysia's economy?</h4><p>The tourism industry in Malaysia has been identified as the key driver in the services sector. The industry continues to be the main source of foreign exchange that contributes to economic growth, investment, and employment and strengthening of service accounts in the balance of payments. In Malaysia, the tourism industry is one of the major contributors of the national services sector, with a contribution of 14.9% to GDP or MYR201.4 billion (USD49.315 billion) in 2017. Receipts from the tourism sector contributed MYR84.1 billion (USD20.593 billion) to the national economy in 2018, up by 2.4% compared to MYR82.2 billion (USD20.127 billion) in 2017. In addition, tourism industry employment recorded a high of 3.4 million people, representing 23.2% of total employment in Malaysia.</p><h4>How do you view the potential to further develop ecotourism, particularly in Sabah and Sarawak?</h4><p>Malaysia has formulated the National Ecotourism Plan 2016-2025 to maximize the potential of ecotourism and ensure sustainability in line with the State Government of Sabah and Sarawak Ecotourism Strategic Plan. This plan embodies the spirit of the theme, uplifting communities, opportunities, and economies. The National Ecotourism Plan 2016-2025 is a roadmap for conservation of ecotourism sites in the country through 19 strategies and 86 action plans. It is geared toward developing the ecotourism sector in order to further increase the tourism industry's contribution to the economy. Under the National Ecotourism Plan 2016-2025, eight ecotourism clusters in Sabah and nine ecotourism clusters in Sarawak that comprise matured and emerging clusters have been identified for further development to maximize its potential through several strategies. The strategies include upgrading and development of ecotourism infrastructure, product development, capacity building, and implementation of sustainable tourism development best practices as well as marketing and promotion.</p><h4>What are the requirements to further strengthen Malaysia's position as a tourism hub in Southeast Asia?</h4><p>In order to strengthen Malaysia's position as a tourism hub in Southeast Asia and the world, we need to focus on innovation and quality, human capital development, connectivity, travel facilitation, and sustainability. To remain relevant, it is important for Malaysia's tourism industry to transform by harnessing public-private partnership and embracing digitalization to drive innovation and competitiveness toward sustainable and inclusive development.</p><h4>What main sources markets for international tourists would you like to develop moving forward?</h4><p>Tourism income is an indicator that has a more economic impact on the country. This does not mean the number of tourists is not important; however, the focus will be on the amount of money spent as well as their length of stay. This is what we called a quality or high-yield tourist, which mostly come from medium to long-haul markets.</p><h4>How do you assess the attractiveness of Malaysia as a destination for tourism-related investments?</h4><p>Malaysia has so much to offer compared to other countries. Our long-running, global brand positioning “Malaysia Truly Asia" serves to highlight our pillar of strength, namely the diverse cultures and multiracial communities living in harmony and peace in one beautiful and blessed country. With the highest regard for conservation and preservation of nature, ecotourism will be one major segment to look into. This is in line with the development of the ecotourism clusters implemented under the National Ecotourism Plan 2016-2025. It will also benefit locals by contributing to the existing supply chain via integrated development that complements each other. Under this plan, 60 ecotourism clusters across the whole country have been identified for potential development by attracting foreign investors.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead, and what will be your main objectives?</h4><p>We have our Visit Malaysia 2020 (VM2020) plan, where we target earning MYR100 billion (USD24.486 billion) from 30 million tourists. The ministry has a big task in ensuring the involvement and cooperation of all stakeholders including the public and private sectors, non-governmental organizations, local communities, and industry players in achieving this target. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision behind Evyap moving to Malaysia?</h4><p>Evyap is an FMCG company focusing on personal care products, mainly bar soap. In 2010, Evyap Group made a strategic decision to shift the feedstock for its soaps from tallow to palm oil. Palm oil had in recent years become an important feedstock in the FMCG industry, and in terms of supply chain security, palm oil is the future given there is more than 75 million tons of global production. Evyap sells over 100,000 tons of bar soap per year. In this context, getting the supply chain right is crucial. Traditionally, bar soap was made from tallow, but as the business scaled, it was deemed too risky to base the whole supply chain on a single source of oil. Tallow is not readily available in Turkey and is relatively expensive. Evyap decided to open a factory in either Indonesia or Malaysia, as these countries are together responsible for the vast majority of global palm oil production. Eventually, the group opted for Malaysia because of several factors, including the ease of doing business, the infrastructure, and overall supply chain reliability. For a good bar soap to be made from palm oil, a good oleochemical factory is required for splitting columns and distillation. When building the factory, we decided to create more capacity so we could engage in the oleochemical market. Oleochemistry studies the use of animal and plant fats. </p><h4>Could you tell us more about the role of oleochemical &amp; contract manufacturing in your business operations?</h4><p>We started with a capacity of 300,000 tons and in January 2019 added another 80,000. Initially, 40% of the plant capacity was distributed to our bar soap production, and the remainder was sold externally. Today, we have grown the oleochemical business significantly thanks to our excellent sales team and efficient production. I am glad to say that our internal dependency has reduced tremendously to the extent that bar soap requires only a quarter of our total oleochemicals output, and 75% is sold to the open market. </p><h4>What are your key markets and how do you differentiate yourself from competition? </h4><p>Our key export markets for bar soap include Turkey and Turkic countries, Central Asia, the Middle East, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Russia, and the Ukraine. The oleochemicals, such as fatty acids and glycerine, are sold everywhere in the world. Our capacity is mid-sized, so we enjoy economies of scale. We serve approximately 300-400 customers globally, and are looking to expand this base further. It is important to have a sound understanding of the market's potential. We do a lot of research on oleochemical, bar soap demand, potential customers, and their needs and wants. We always aim to fulfill and exceed our customers' requirements, as sometimes they need customization. Evyap started as a B2C consumer goods company and has carried the same customer-oriented mentality and mindset to its B2B business. Coming from the personal care industry, we are used to tweaking products to provide solutions. Most big players like Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever have switched from tallow to palm oil, although some large players such as Biersdorf have not made the switch. We do contract manufacturing as part of our portfolio, and some of these companies are not only our competitors, but also our customers. Our team continuously tries to convey the benefits of palm oil to these companies, and most of the industry has accepted a future in which palm oil will play an important role and has moved full steam ahead with palm oil. </p><h4>What are the main challenges faced in the oleochemical sector in Malaysia?</h4><p>The main challenge in the oleochemical industry is that it is still in a state of overcapacity. The global supply capacity is around 13 million tons, while demand lags behind at around 8 million tons. The lingering capacity is putting a damper on the industry in terms of profitability. The second challenge is that we continue to have a disparity in palm oil prices with Indonesia, where it remains cheaper than Malaysia by 3-4%. Oleochemicals are essentially a commodity where even a marginal difference in the cost of raw materials plays a significant role in the profitability of your business. That being said, we remain positive about the ease of doing business in Malaysia. Malaysia is developed and competitive and industry is appreciative of this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Top Glove moving toward adopting Industry 4.0?</h4><p>In the past two years, we have improved significantly. Our sales revenue increased by more than 20% and our profit by almost 30%. The main driving force behind this was the manufacturing improvements we implemented through digitalization. We have invested in automation, computerization, and the IoT, which resulted in higher quality while saving on the cost of more than 1,000 workers per year. We expanded our R&amp;D department from 20, when the department first started in 2015, to 160 staff in January 2019, recruiting engineers, chemists, and scientists. We employ 19 PhD graduates and more than 20 with masters. Innovation and the adoption of Industry 4.0 have been extremely important to us. We have increased our capacity through organic growth by adding new factories and acquisition. To reach 30% of the global market by 2020, we need to continue to grow both organically and through M&amp;A or joint ventures. In the new factories, we use new machinery that will incorporate more digital aspects such as automated packing machines, automated warehouse management systems, and temperature sensors that control the content of the chemicals. We have real-time insight on the speed and production of the machinery, and we use cameras to detect glove defects faster than a human eye. We aim to build around two new factories each year with new machinery of higher quality and cost efficiency.</p><h4>In addition to glove manufacturers, what businesses could offer interesting M&amp;A opportunities for Top Glove?</h4><p>Recently, we acquired our supplier of inner box packaging material and a company that supplies and markets dental dams and exercise bands. We also invested in a chemical dispersion plant and a factory to produce molds for glove dipping. In addition, we invested in a condom plant, as that market is growing. Other products related to gloves, healthcare, or rubber production are also on our radar. We are always on the lookout for interesting businesses, though our main focus will remain rubber gloves.</p><h4>What are some of the most prominent recent innovations you have commercialized?</h4><p>R&amp;D is extremely important. We need to innovate through R&amp;D to give customers new and better products. Research creates tremendous value, and without it a company has no future. What was good yesterday will be outdated tomorrow, and we need to look for areas to improve every day and do this together. Our target is to commercialize six new products a year. One of our recent innovations has been wet donning, which enables users to put on gloves easily, even if their hands are wet. We have also developed a new biogreen biodegradable Nitrile glove that biodegrades when it comes into contact with the soil. This comes in addition to another glove made from synthetic rubber we recently introduced that is extremely flexible and resilient. Each year, we continue to develop new and unique products for adults and children. One of these is the HydraPlus Moisturizing Nitrile glove, which protects skin while improving hydration. </p><h4>What is your forecast for the glove market in 2019?</h4><p>The market for Nitrile gloves could grow by 10-15% per year, with demand mainly from the US, Europe, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. We also see high demand for natural rubber gloves from Latin America, Africa, China, and India. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision behind opening plants in Malaysia, Oleon's first outside Europe?</h4><p>The history of Oleon in Malaysia goes back to the 1980s when the company was still named Oleofina and part of the Belgian FINA group. The Malaysian palm industry was developing at that time, and that sparked our interest in Malaysia. After some years in Malaysia, we left the country and moved our offices to Singapore. After we became Oleon and independent in 2001, we relocated our commercial office again to Malaysia. In 2007 the plan was adopted to increase our global footprint by establishing a production unit close to the source of tropical vegetable oils. I joined the company that year to develop this plan operationally. We scanned the region to look for the most suitable location and in particular assessed Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. We ruled out Indonesia due to its logistical challenges. Singapore was the second option, and although it has excellent logistics, it strongly depends on other countries to import base oleo-chemicals. Besides, acquiring land was not possible unless as a short-term lease. Finally, we decided to establish our production in Malaysia because of its good logistics, the fact that we can secure raw materials from within the country, and our history there. Nearly 95% of our production is exported. </p><h4>Do you have any plans to add additional capacities moving forward?</h4><p>In 2014, there was a huge drive for investments in the oleochemical industry in Indonesia, as the country was following the same path that Malaysia took earlier in developing oleochemical activities. Indonesia was granting a lot of resources that boosted investments in the region. This resulted in a saturated market and regional growth rates that are more or less mature. We keep investing in our Malaysian plants each year to keep them efficient and able to respond to market demands, but do not foresee full-fledged capacity increases in the upcoming years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>FMM celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018. How do you reflect on its contribution to the growth and modernization of Malaysia's economy?</h4><p>FMM remains the voice of Malaysian industries, specifically for manufacturing and related sectors. We have always emphasized fostering a positive relationship with the government and believe we have to be at the forefront with our approach, acting prior to policymaking rather than in reaction to. FMM was established in 1968 with 215 member companies and has since evolved to 10,000 companies that are involved in the manufacturing supply chain. Our core function is to provide support for the overall manufacturing spectrum of the country, be it bigger companies or SMEs, which account for 97% of Malaysian industry. One of our aims is to leverage and move them up a layer in terms of operating efficiency, technology, and market prospects by integrating these firms and working as a common platform to nurture them. We participate actively in almost every ministerial function relevant to the manufacturing community.</p><h4>What are some of the main challenges and opportunities Malaysian manufacturers will encounter in the adoption of Industry4WRD?</h4><p>Three factors will play a role. First, it is vital to develop a common and true understanding of what Industry 4.0 means. At present, the general thinking is that it is something extremely sophisticated with factories driven by robots and sensors, but that is only the pinnacle of what it ought to be. The real challenge we are facing is how to migrate from 2.0/3.0 to 4.0. Some manufacturers feel resistance toward this change because they believe that since they have been doing well there is no need to transform, so this is a matter of changing mindsets. Second, we must factor in the economic cost of migration tied to technology acquisition, especially for SMEs that do not have the resources or knowledge. Third, the critical issue is that technology is adopted together with a skilled workforce to understand and expand the technology into a real practical scenario. Therefore, we need more widely available skilled and competent manpower. FMM is working hard to address the first factor of changing mindsets about Industry 4.0. We explain to manufacturers that they do not have to move immediately to a 4.0 scenario, but can migrate in an organic and structured manner. Working on small pilot cases can help the industry and SMEs at large to see the bigger opportunities. </p><h4>What steps should Malaysia take to develop the right human capital for an economy where Industry 4.0 plays a large role?</h4><p>The human capital issue has to be seen from a holistic point of view with a mid-term and long-term approach. For the mid-term approach, we have to take practical steps to overhaul our education system. In order to migrate to 4.0, we require at a tertiary level the creation of an ecosystem where the upcoming graduates are equipped with AI-related knowhow as basic and fundamental knowledge rather than a specialized skill. The education methodology in the training structure has to be looked at and the curriculum has to evolve. We need to realign the human capital toward a function that is more value-added and has a raised level of competency and skill. Industry4WRD will transform the community and give opportunities to younger generations to explore. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will high-tech sectors play in Malaysia's transition to a high-income and developed economy? </h4><p>A strong manufacturing sector would pave the way to enhanced productivity, job creation, innovation, a high-skilled talent pool, economic prosperity, and social wellbeing. The national policy on Industry 4.0: Industry4WRD was developed with four specific overarching goals, namely to drive growth in manufacturing, increase national productivity, create higher-skill employment opportunities, and raise innovation capabilities and competitiveness. Industry 4.0 will revolutionize the manufacturing sector by pushing down costs, expanding market reach to consumers, and create new competitors. For Malaysia, which still heavily depends on foreign labor for its production, there is a need for a change in mindset to embrace new technologies, increase efficiency and productivity, and expand into markets through digital platforms. Accelerating labor productivity is key to pushing Malaysia to becoming a high-income nation, something that can be achieved by embracing the Industry 4.0 adoptions. Ultimately, the policy will drive Malaysia to become a strategic partner for smart manufacturing and related services in Asia Pacific, a primary destination for the hi-tech industry, and a total solutions provider for advanced technology. Our readiness to adapt to this evolution will have huge bearing on our economic success. </p><h4>How do you assess the impact of trade tensions between the US and China on Southeast Asia's supply chains, Malaysia in particular?</h4><p>The continuous US-China trade conflict affects the supply chains in Southeast Asia. It is expected that most economies, including ASEAN member states (AMS), as well as AMS' companies with investments and businesses based in the US and China, will be affected in the medium and long run due to their interconnected supply chains in the global market. UNCTAD estimates that about two-thirds of world trade now occurs through global production. The current trade tensions can affect Malaysia's trade and investment in a number of ways, for better or worse First, our direct exports to the US could decrease because of tariffs, which include some of Malaysia's major exports. The same goes for our trade with China, since some of our exports there contribute to the export of final products to the US, as well as other markets. Moreover, any slowdown in China's economy could also affect our exports to China. However, the US could also substitute some of its imports from China with imports from Southeast Asia, including Malaysia. Investment diversion is another potential positive impact, as investments shift away from China. Hence, the tariffs imposed on China have the potential to generate trade and investment spillovers in Malaysia's trade and investment with both. Being a small open economy, Malaysia is highly interconnected with the global economy through its active participation in global value chains (GVCs) and FDIs into the country, especially the non-resource-based sector, such as electrical and electronics (E&amp;E). Against this backdrop, change is inevitable, unrelenting, and overarching. Strategy and timing are essential; Malaysia must be careful not to get trampled by the trade conflict, but it can still reap maximum benefits from a trade war by attracting more high-quality investments. In fact, Malaysia has already benefited from American and Chinese companies relocating here to hedge against broader risks. It is also an opportunity for Malaysia to build its status as an Asian tiger by becoming the most attractive investment destination for quality investments in the region. Despite positive signs, the country remains cautious the conflict will create a domino effect. This is why we have no choice but take the helm in global trade by being technology-driven, proactive, and an attractive trading partner and investment destination. This is the crux of our fourth industrial revolution. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for commencement of commercial operations from the RAPID project?</h4><p>The complex has progressed as planned. To date, we are still maintaining our target to commence commercial operations in 4Q2019. Our current production capacity stands at 12.8 million tpa. Upon commercial operation of PIC, our total production capacity will increase to 14.6 million tpa. Once the petrochemical projects in Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) come into operations, it will not only strengthen PETRONAS Chemicals' ability to be flexible and reliable in meeting customers' needs, but also bolster the company's position as the second largest MEG producer. We will also introduce isononanol to our product offering, and with 250 kilotons per annum production, this will position us as the second-largest isononanol producer in Southeast Asia.</p><h4>What is your strategy to grow PCG's specialty chemicals activities?</h4><p>Global consumption of specialty chemicals is expected to increase in volume at an average annual rate of nearly 3.5% in emerging countries from 2016 to 2021. Among these countries, China is expected to have the highest regional growth rate in the said period. Overall, the emerging markets offer more dynamic prospects for the specialty chemicals industry because of rising consumer-driven economies and industrialization. PCG is now well positioned to pursue the second prong of its strategy by diversifying its portfolio into derivatives and specialty chemicals to future-proof its business. In the medium to long term, the chemicals industry is projected to grow about 4% CAGR, and PCG's goal is to maintain its growth at a faster pace than the industry, with the aim of double its earnings. Our growth levers beyond 2020 will include extending the value chain by maximizing value from molecules in PIC and existing complexes. PCG is also targeting building upon the specialty platform by venturing into attractive segments based on future megatrends. This can be realized via M&amp;A or partnering. Investment in innovative and breakthrough technologies through internal R&amp;D and corporate venture capital are also being pursued.</p><h4>What are your expectations for market demand for chemicals in Southeast Asia, and what catalysts for growth do you see?</h4><p>The combination of a growing global economy, technology development, and megatrends such as urbanization, rising population, and affluent consumers will result in increasing demand for chemical solutions. Oil and gas companies are increasingly pursuing integration along the chemical value chain as well as diversifying their portfolios into specialty chemicals. The volatility of the global economy will also have an impact on demand growth across all energy and petrochemical markets. Nevertheless, the supply and demand of the petrochemicals industry is expected to remain robust in 2019. Coupled with continuously strong Asia Pacific GDP growth, the industry will remain competitive. As a key player in the Asia Pacific petrochemicals market, PCG will be ready to take advantage of opportunities that arise and weather challenges by focusing on its efforts to maintain its competitive position and continue to deliver on its strategic priorities for sustainable value creation. We will continue to prioritize our operations and commercial activities, as we drive our productivity and efficiency group-wide. In 2019, the global economy is projected to expand moderately, following slower growth in both advanced and major emerging market economies. Over the longer term, demand for petrochemicals is anticipated to strengthen, thus presenting us with exciting new options to drive sustainable growth. Asia's increasing middle-class population with significant discretionary spending power is expected to lead to higher demand of sophisticated and multipurpose consumer products such as personal care, nutrients, and pharmaceuticals. There will also be an increasing need for modern and efficient living where chemicals are needed to expedite the construction of buildings and drainages. The increasing global connections will also have a big impact on packaging and transportation sectors and will drive chemicals as solutions for durable plastic packaging and lightweight and high-strength automotive plastic parts. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[greener-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Malaysia's transition toward becoming a climate-resilient green economy?</h4><p>Malaysia is among the 197 signatories of the Paris Agreement 2016, aimed at reducing carbon emissions by 2030 and pledged to cut its greenhouse emissions by 45% by 2030, and has undertaken a number of mitigation and adaptation strategies to tackle climate change. From the energy perspective, we focus on reducing our dependency on petroleum products, mainstreaming environmental considerations, while ensuring reliable, affordable energy and safeguarding energy security. The promotion of renewable energy remains a priority for Malaysia, and we have set a target of 20% renewable energy in the installed electricity capacity mix by 2025. The intention is to shift from the conventional path to a greener trajectory—green growth—which will ensure that socioeconomic development is pursued more sustainably. Green growth is therefore a game changer because it is not just a standalone strategic thrust, but a development trajectory that considers all three pillars of sustainable development—economic, social, and environment—and better prepares the nation for future challenges. The Global Energy Transition Index 2019 by the World Economic Forum ranks Malaysia the highest among the emerging and developing Asian region. Its energy access and security scores are also among the top 20 out of the 115 countries analyzed. This augurs well in terms of our readiness to transition toward more renewable energy in our mix. Another significant statistic reported out by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) recognized Malaysia as the ASEAN region's biggest solar PV employer, with more than 54,300 people working in the industry in 2018 up from 40,300 in 2017.</p><h4>What improvements have been made to the Net Energy Metering (NEM) scheme this year?</h4><p>Under NEM, energy produced from the installed solar PV system is to be consumed first, and the excess will be sold to Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB). Since January 2019, under NEM 2.0, a one-on-one offset was introduced to the system, where every 1kWh exported to the grid will be offset against 1kWh consumed from the grid with gazetted tariff. An eligible consumer with excess energy is allowed to export it to the grid offsetting it at the same consumption tariff provided by TNB. This revised program gives better returns of investment and increases electricity savings per month to the owners of solar PV systems. It has a quota of 500MW ending in 2020. Under the previous concept, NEM was based on net billing, and the fixed rate for excess solar electricity sold to TNB was lower than the typical average electricity tariff of the residential customers. Consumers can implement rooftop solar on their homes and commercial, industrial, and agricultural business premises to support Malaysia's green agenda while saving costs on electricity. As for service providers and investors, renewable energy resources represent a potential source of jobs and economic development. The new NEM program is a boon for consumers, as they can now net off their excess electricity to TNB at the same rate that they buy from the utility company, allowing them to save more in electricity bills every month. Since the NEM's revised scheme was introduced in January, there has been an encouraging growth in NEM's take-up rate. As of June 2019, a total of 25MW of NEM has been approved, compared to 18.24MW total in 2018. According to a study by SEDA, the 500MW of NEM quota is expected to generate an estimated 15,000 employment opportunities and MYR2.5 billion capital investment in solar PV systems. Peninsular Malaysia has approximately 4.1 million buildings with an estimated technical potential of 37GW. The greater take-up of solar PV rooftop generations will help the government to achieve its aspirational renewable energy target of 20% of the national installed capacity mix by 2025, excluding large hydro. Solar PV rooftop installations will help democratize the electricity market and engage the public at large to be part of solution to climate change. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have you identified as the main trends in business travel?</h4><p>The industry has been growing steadily, and this is attracting new players while increasing a trend of consolidation. This means that while there are fewer travel agencies, they are expanding. We make forecasts each year, studying the trends on airfares and hotels. A lot is linked to existing market demand, whether there will be an increase in flights, and what routes will be available. The same is true for hotels. In Mexico, an increasing number of hotels are being built. Therefore, we foresee that rates will go down. We predict that airfares in Latin America will drop by 2%. The statistics show there is more on offer and a growth in new routes. This creates more seat offerings, which push down average ticket prices all the more. </p><h4>How much of the market does BCD Travel cover?</h4><p>We are one of the top two global players; there was a recent merger that took the third player out of the market. We have a number of global customers in addition to several strong local Mexican companies that we have been servicing for years. Our customers fly everywhere, but our single-most popular destination from Mexico is Sío Paolo, Brazil. We organize all our clients' business trips and have global agreements with the clients we serve in over 100 countries. Some agreements are only for Mexico or Latin America. We help the companies to organize and administrate their travel program. Having a better-administered travel program generates healthy savings, especially for larger companies.</p><h4>What are your sales expectations for 2019?</h4><p>Over the last few years in Mexico, we have continuously registered growth rates higher than 10%; Mexico remains a growing marketplace for us. However, we don't foresee our growth in 2019 reaching double digits. We are cautious of the new government, as well as the new agreement with the US. We still need to see how this will come into place. Many of our customers are in the manufacturing business and automotive industry. Therefore, we need to wait and see if their travel patterns will change. Normally the impact is two to four months before an economic event happens. Good news is that, as of yet, we have not seen the big companies cutting back on their travel expenses. Corporate travel is the first cut in trying economic times, though our biggest growth years also coincided with years of high financial pressure. Once people experience our service, they stay. Remarkably, our retention rate was above 98% in 2018. Globally, our target is 95%, which is high compared to our competition.</p><h4>Why do you think emerging technologies will disrupt tourism?</h4><p>Everything will end up on the mobile and become available through an application. As a total trip management platform, TripSource is our answer to our customers' needs. We have invested heavily in it; it focuses on itinerary management, flight alerts, alternate flight lookup, gate changes, hotel booking, and imports outside bookings. We are now globally in the rollout of air bookings, custom policy messages, emergency response, global risk alerts, and branding. An example of transformation of the digital travel experience are policy specific notifications. The platform delivers notifications right when travelers need them, providing financial and emotional value about their travel program. Another aspect is big data and finding savings opportunities and how to administer them better. We make suggestions and reports to show how a client can travel smart and run analytics and predictions on how to save money. DecisionSource platform helps our clients run a smarter program; it gets support from stakeholders and plays a bigger part in a company's success. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[defining-your-niche]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the company's most important achievement in 2018?</h4><p>Our most important achievement was to consolidate our growth by completing the first integration cycle of National Car Rental and Enterprise Rent a Car, two brands we represent in the south and southeast of the country. In 2018 we grew by 15% YoY. Another important achievement was to substantially improve internal processes and our quality of service, which resulted in a significant increase in our clients' satisfaction. After a continuous improvement program that started two years ago, we saw the results of consistency in processes and our staff's focus on service culture. We have had sustainable growth in recent years, allowing us to invest in continuous training and improve the internal work environment. We are focused on meeting the needs of our employees and customers.</p><h4>What factors influenced the results in 2018?</h4><p>The commitment of our staff has contributed to increasing our portfolio of repeat customers, as well as obtaining new sales channels supported by an excellent level of attention. The flow of international reservations increased in 2017 thanks to joint efforts between our corporate entity in the US, the economic conditions of the region, and the interesting and competitive proposals we offered our clients.</p><h4>What type of expansion plans do you have to consolidate your presence in the region?</h4><p>We plan to continue to cover the cities where we are not present. We are maintaining our expansion plans even amidst economic uncertainty and insecurity issues. This demands us to employ greater planning and analysis.</p><h4>How is the sharing economy's growth affecting your business?</h4><p>These digital platforms are not yet significantly affecting the industry. Applications based on the sharing economy offer similar services, but are not substitutes—there is a defined niche market for us and these applications. Though limited markets could be affected, such as areas with high traffic or parking shortages, there are still cities where car rentals offer competitive advantages as compared to such platforms.</p><h4>What are the main trends impacting the car rental market in Mexico?</h4><p>The large online tourism marketing agencies (OTAs) have influenced the way of booking tourist services, including car rental. We are in permanent collaboration with them to make sure we can offer the public the best offers. Service quality is also a relevant issue among service providers and has a critical impact on customer preferences. A few years ago, we started a program of continuous improvement in service with the help of the corporate Enterprise Holding (EHI). We are 100% focused on customer satisfaction through the modification of processes in the back office and constant contact with the customer through the front desk. We receive continuous feedback from our clients through e-mails, calls, or surveys that we conduct every day. Technology impacts every industry, and our sector is no exception. We invest continuously in information technology in all areas of the company but with a strong focus on improving customer service. Speed and reliability are key to everything.</p><h4>What potential does southeast Mexico offer to the car rental market?</h4><p>Economic growth is not manifesting as expected, and greater support is needed from the federal and state governments to leverage southeast Mexico's economy. Indeed, the region requires oil, growth projects in maritime docks, and support for tourism promotion. In addition to these, safety and reliability will remain critical for travelers renting cars.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were your operational results in 2018 and how do they compare to 2017? </h4><p>We achieved 18% growth in 2018 YoY. Our goal is to grow 12% in 2019 with annual sales of MXN900 million for car rental and international royalties.</p><h4>What differentiates your services from other car rental companies?</h4><p>We offer an inclusive product on our website with a simple rental process and the lowest required deposit in the market. Our variety of cars stands out in the market. We plan to expand our presence in Querétaro, Culiacán, and two locations in downtown Mexico City. We will also expand our affiliate program, which at present is in 42 locations in 20 different countries, to 100 locations in 35 countries. Notably, we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint. We will replace 400 vehicles in our fleet with hybrid cars such as Toyota Prius, Prius C, Hyundai Ioniq, Toyota Camry, Rav4, and Kia Niro, among others.</p><h4>Why is the company deciding to expand into three more cities? </h4><p>Querétaro's airport has the highest growth percentage in the country. Even though it is a small airport, its potential is relevant for the business sector and Mexico-American travelers that come back to Mexico to visit their relatives. Moreover, the airport in Culiacán is being consolidated for the business sector. It is essential for every business in Mexico to have presence in the capital, since it has the highest number of tourists flying to other locations across the country.</p><h4>What is your outlook on tourism in Mexico, and how does this impact demand for your services?</h4><p>Approximately 73% of the tourism in Mexico is domestic, which we find amazing. The growth of low-cost airlines impacts our industry positively since they now connect different destinations within the country. This leads to an increase in demand for our services.</p><h4>What will the future of mobility in Mexico look like?</h4><p>Car sharing and ride hailing will continue to have relevance for new generations. The traditional car rental is obligated to evolve so it can work as a hybrid. We are also focused on making the rental process simpler in different ways. For example, in the future, the owner will have most of the responsibility, not the driver. We are adapting to this changing reality by investing in our technology department to add value to every chain of the company. We have developed a ride-hailing platform and will soon launch our car-sharing platform as well. We estimate to launch these by end-2019. The ridesharing project is our priority, and ours is a great and stable platform. Equally important, ride sharing will help to reduce our carbon footprint significantly.</p><h4>When it comes to providing transportation to and from airports, in what ways are you starting to discuss it with the public sector? </h4><p>We are also willing to collaborate with the public sector on transporting people to and from airports on electric buses. There are many ways to approach it; however, coordination is needed between airports and the private and public sectors. Our proposal is to develop a mobility center in each airport according to the air traffic of every terminal. This plan must feature, depending on the infrastructure, mass transportation, shared transports, and personalized transportation.</p><h4>What would you like the new administration to prioritize in terms of mobility?</h4><p>The focus should be on promoting and supporting the car sharing industry. The public sector should also promote car sharing in government departments to make efficient usage of public resources and parking spaces. Another idea is to incentivize the use of electric or hybrid cars. The government should also standardize and coordinate mobility centers at airports to promote the organized use transportation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your overall outlook on the tourism industry?</h4><p>Mexico is one of the hottest tourist spots, and the tourism industry has grown notably over the years, especially in Oaxaca, Cancún, Tulum, and the entire Yucatán peninsula. Formerly, the majority of the visitors from the US, but we now see people from all over Europe, Asia, and South America. Particularly in Tulum, tourism has grown immensely, making it one of the most recognized places globally. The tourists who visit this part of Mexico comprise a market keen on diversified concepts. Azulik, for example, has a reconnection concept that is truly different from most other hotels. </p><h4>What kind of opportunities motivated the founders to open a unique ecological resort?</h4><p>Our visitors are particularly socially conscious, respecting nature and seeking it out. No trees were cut during the construction of Azulik; we opted instead to build around those that were already present. We don't have the common amenities that other hotels may offer such as artificial light, TVs, and air conditioners, and that absence represents a different value. It invites us to arouse our consciousness about how we affect the ecosystems that we depend on and redefine the concept of luxury as an opportunity to enjoy pristine nature. </p><h4>What attracts high-profile guests to stay at Azulik?</h4><p>Azulik Tulum offers a different experience compared to other hotels in the area. It is not only about immersing in nature through our unique architecture but also reconnecting with ourselves and the people and elements around us. At Azulik, it is the small things that we sometimes take for granted that make a difference here. On the other side, high-profile guests are looking for privacy, which is guaranteed through our unique approach to people and guests. Most of the time, celebrities come without announcing their arrival, booking rooms under a false name to maintain anonymity and reconnect with themselves in a relaxing space away from the paparazzi. We provide them exactly the space they need to disconnect and find peace.</p><h4>What strategies does the hotel use to maintain the element of surprise?</h4><p>People still don't fully understand what Azulik offers. They are surprised by the architecture of the place, and love being completely immersed in nature, with views of the ocean from our rooms and villas. A wind blows almost constantly. In fact, ik means “wind" in Mayan, and Azulik means the place of the blue wind. It is about being present in the moment, feeling the wind, seeing the waves crash beneath you, watching pelicans fishing, or turtles laying their eggs. Such unique experiences are what our guests value the most, along with all the services that we offer. We have four restaurants, a clothing boutique where we sell our own brand, a spa that focuses on many Mayan rituals, a beauty salon, an art gallery that is the first in the area, a sunglasses store, and our tours and experience packages. </p><h4>What promoted your recent launch of an environmentally aware art gallery? </h4><p>The art gallery opened in April 2018 to bring together emerging artists. Tulum is a culturally well-informed place that adapts to our guests. We not only wanted to offer a different experience to our guests, but also be the first to open an art gallery in Tulum. Many more art-related future projects are planned nearby.</p><h4>What other projects is the group developing?</h4><p>We have just launched a new haute cuisine restaurant at Azulik Uh May, a complex that will also include 15 eco-villas by the end of 2019. Soon to come at Azulik Tulum are jewelry and furniture store. A boutique and two restaurants in Valladolid as well as a project near Mexico City that will be announced later. In the short term, in one or two years, our focus will be on the Yucatán Peninsula and Mexico City; however, we have medium- and long-term plans to expand beyond Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges did you face during the creation of Mundo Cuervo?</h4><p>There were two main challenges: transforming the entire infrastructure that was not made for tourism and locals' livelihoods. People were accustomed to working in some of the distilleries; they did not know about public relations or speak several languages. We work extensively with young people; they have understood the importance of learning languages and hospitality principles. As a result of the training, they now provide high-quality service. People are surprised to learn that we trained our employees in house. Another challenge was to convince the town that it could become a touristic destination. We have been successful; Tequila has 40,000 inhabitants and it received around 500,000 visitors last year.</p><h4>How do you seek to strengthen the perception of Tequila as a brand?</h4><p>Don Juan Beckmann, our president, ensured that Tequila, the region's name, was seen as the denomination of the spirit. The blue agave only grows in certain regions. Production is continuous; agave is not like grapes, which can only be harvested during a certain season. That is why we sought to have the designation of origin, and UNESCO has recognized the agave landscape as a World Heritage Site. We want people to know tequila is much more than just the drink.</p><h4>How was 2018 as compared to previous years?</h4><p>The company has been growing over the last few years. Three years ago, we opened our first hotel due to the high number of weddings taking place. We decided to set up our first hotel, a colonial-style hotel that today belongs to the Relais &amp; Chateaux chain. We have an average occupancy rate of 42%, which is great for a three-year-old hotel. Don Juan created the Tequila Route in the region, with eight municipalities with different characteristics located around the volcano. For example, there is a region called the Guachimontones, which has extremely interesting circular pyramids. The route is 13 years old, and notably, the number of visitors has grown from 200,000 in the first year to 1.4 million in 2018, and the economic spillover has grown more than 300%. The Jose Cuervo Express is one factor that has greatly improved our circumstances. Moreover, Tequila is an hour away from the city of Guadalajara, and there is direct access from the airport, further boosting the number of visitors. An average of 1,500-1,600 people visit our facilities daily. In 2018, we acquired another hotel, a boutique hotel with 20 rooms. In 2019, we will build another 20 rooms. Some 15 years ago, there were 43 simple rooms in Tequila and at present, there are 460 rooms, a third of which are four- or five-star rooms.</p><h4>What strategies are you using to fulfill the Smart Pueblo Mágico project?</h4><p>Our vision for 2040 is to receive at least 2 million visitors a year. This figure is, of course, conditional on the infrastructure and the tourist dynamics of Tequila. It is a projection based on the average growth of recent years. Five or six years ago, we started working on this smart city project so that visitors can have connectivity wherever they are.  This helps a great deal in terms of planning. We have 100% connectivity in the historic center, traceability, mobility, and big data. Visitors can download our application and if they want Mexican food, they can search from the restaurants on the app and make a reservation. The same applies to parking. We want people to use technology but without losing the authenticity of the place. The historic center is currently smart, and we want the entire city of Tequila to be smart by 2030. In total, we have invested nearly MXN200 million on the whole development and around MXN15 million on the smart city. Tequila is the only Smart Tourist Destination in Mexico certified by the Spanish Ministry of Tourism (SEGITTUR).</p>]]></richbody0content>

The infrastructure required for the project can be used for many purposes, but the most important thing is the territorial reorganization because many other functions can be allocated for land use that is not being promoted. Southeast Mexico has gone 30 years without significant investment. Most of the tourism in the area is concentrated in Cancún, but the formula that was used to grow the industry was not well thought out. It requires workers to live far away from the hotels that they work in. We intend to change this whole process with a different strategy. We will consider the locals, and we will diversify the markets to avoid only the development of selected cities. We must plan from the generation of a development platform with four axes: economy, environment, society, and culture. If these four pillars are balanced, we can create a long-term sustainable development platform. The focus is to ensure no pillar dominates; the platform must be inclusive. In the Mayan Riviera and some parts of Mérida, developments affect many communities because workers are moving away because of the cost of the land. Our design puts all the components of the city in a functional relationship so that workers have to commute the shortest-possible distance.</p><h4>How does the project plan to collaborate with the private sector?</h4><p>The tourism business will not pay for the train; the cargo business and different developments that are involved with the project will. The train will initially have 15 stations. Private and public investment will make up 90% and 10% of total investment, respectively. The cargo service is central because many inputs come from across the country to the southeast, such as fuel, food, and building materials. We are going to have 10 tenders: seven for construction, one each for rolling stock such as locomotives and wagons, signaling, and operation.</p><h4>In what ways will the project use additional financial tools such as Fibras to acquire additional capital?</h4><p>In the case of Palenque, the land was contributed, including 200ha of federal land and 600ha of private land. We established a trust for people who contribute land for infrastructure. If that trust goes well, it can be transformed into a real estate trust or a Fibra. The state drives the business because it generates the permits and handles the management. In the beginning, there will be 15 trusts for each station, and each station will have land contributions. We will obtain the necessary resources through the stock market to grow according to market demands. Our aim is to complete this project in four years.</p><h4>Besides Tren Maya, what other objectives are your prioritizing for FONATUR?</h4><p>The first objective of FONATUR is to optimize and improve all its current projects. We are a highly valuable institution for the Mexican state. FONATUR has had great success in Cancún and Los Cabos, but there have also been failures such as Loreto or Playa Espiritu in Sinaloa. To improve further, we are applying a strict program of internal re-engineering of the structure. Moving forward, we will ask the market and the private sector and not the government for capital for developments. We have many ambitious plans for the tourism industry. The most important aspect is integral development. The territorial reorganization will allow us to attract investments in other complementary sectors. We are developing a supply center and a fuel distribution center in Cancún and we plan to integrate the ports into these plans. Campeche, Progreso, and Caleta are the three ports that are bound to grow once they are linked with the train. We have solid plans to turn Cancún into a financial center that competes with Miami or Panama. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-real-growth-industry]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Clever Leaves' long-term strategies for expansion in Mexico?</h4><p>We have always seen Mexico as an interesting geography for a variety of reasons. Mexico is a country with over 100 million people with interesting consumption patterns for the kind of product Clever Leaves wants to sell. Mexico is the cornerstone for any Latin American expansion and will play a significant role in the global cannabis industry. You have a country that is used to producing high-quality agricultural products at significant scales with efficient costs, which bodes well for creating a sophisticated, high-quality, and low-cost cannabis operation. Mexico also has many pharmaceutical manufacturing factories, which makes it a strong location for the pharmaceutical processing of cannabis. Finally, given the way its regulation is shaping up, Mexico will not only be an extremely successful market but also an attractive location from a manufacturing, production, and cultivation standpoint.</p><h4>How would you assess the political will in Mexico to strengthen the sector?</h4><p>Legislation has passed and continues to evolve, demonstrating the country's commitment to recreational and medicinal legalization. Should that happen, Mexico will immediately become one of the largest in the world with such a position. It is much more than talk; the political will is there.</p><h4>What lessons can Mexico learn from medical cannabis in Colombia and vice versa?</h4><p>Mexico has already implemented a few things taken from the Colombian legislation, since there are certain similarities in what it is proposing and what we have. One of the things Mexico has done well is positioning itself as a country that can supply the world, whether medical or recreational, whereas Colombian law limits production and commercialization to medical cannabis. Though I agree that whether or not cannabis should be legalized for recreational purposes is an issue that must be resolved locally, a country's ability to position itself as a world supplier is economically promising; Colombia could adopt this part of the regulation from Mexico. One thing Mexico could learn from Colombian law, on the other hand, is that it abides by all the international treaties and agreements. In Colombia, we have to get quotas approved with the ICNB, restrictions today that will be an asset for the country from a regulatory standpoint in the long term. </p><h4>What will be the socioeconomic impact of a robust medical cannabis sector for Mexico?</h4><p>The potential is huge. A lot of the healthcare system in Mexico is state run and highly centralized. If Mexico continues down this path, patients will have access to affordable, high-quality medical cannabis relatively soon. From a social standpoint, medical cannabis does not have a great deal of push back. Recreational is a different story, though the medical benefits will be well received. It is clearly a win-win situation for doctors and patients alike. </p><h4>Do legalization or decriminalization efforts in the US present an opportunity for Mexico?</h4><p>The Farm Bill passed, which is important, though there are many regulatory changes that still need to happen for that to be reality. Certainly, however, Mexico's proximity and close trade partnership with the US, in particular its efficient logistics and customs systems, present a huge opportunity. As legalization occurs, Mexico is the best-positioned country in the world to serve the US market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Juan Valdez grown as a company and brand nationally and internationally?<br></strong>Around 1960, there was a strategy to promote Colombian coffee around Juan Valdez. Many people knew they liked premium mild Arabica coffee but did not know it was Colombian. In 2002, when Procafecol was established, the National Federation of Coffee Growers saw the need not only to promote an ingredient but also a product and commercialize a cup of coffee whereby value would be maximized for coffee growers. At the time, producers' incomes were falling, since the roasters and coffee sellers were keeping the margins. Procafecol is owned by the National Federation of Coffee Growers and 18,000 coffee growers who invested directly in it. At Procafecol, we proudly say we are the only company in the world that is owned by its producers. We do not own the brand Juan Valdez, as this belongs to the National Coffee Fund, and we have the right to use that brand by paying royalties. We developed a strategy to promote the coffee from the beginning to make it visual through important stores, and we had a great deal of visual presence to promote our brand. We have been on a journey for 17 years, where we are now in 13 countries with operational stores and 28 countries in which we commercialize packed coffee. </p><p><strong>How has Procafecol improved conditions for Colombian coffee growers?<br></strong>We contribute to producers' incomes in three ways. The first is by paying royalties for the use of the brand, and since the brand is theirs, we give back directly to the brand. Second, we pay a premium to producers for export-quality premium coffee that we sell across our channels. The third is an economic contribution through the profits of Procafecol. We have not shared dividends yet, as we are reinvesting in the company. We also create social and environmental value via our actions with several projects including gender, organic, and youth programs in which we strongly recommend, commercialize, and market coffee from these segments. Almost 50% of the municipalities in Colombia produce coffee, and we also buy from them. Our programs not only bring us close to the communities and produce economic value but also provide education and facilitate the introduction of infrastructure through the National Federation of Coffee Growers or other entities. </p><p><strong>What is the importance of the stores and the brand in promoting the image of Colombian coffee globally?<br></strong>The stores are like an embassy and a visual point to which anyone in the world can go and feel like they are in a little piece of Colombia. There is an economic reason behind the stores, and we have different partnerships and franchises in the world. We seek for them to be truly profitable and grow.</p><p><strong>How do you approach opening new markets?<br></strong>In Colombia, about 70% of our stores are privately owned, which is our main expansion channel. We have different franchises in Colombia that are growing in places where we cannot grow or reach consumption occasions where we are not present. We have two different models around the world, one of which is partnerships, where we are shareholders of the company that operates the stores. We have partnerships in Chile, Ecuador, Spain, and the US and they have grown extremely well.</p><p><strong>Which markets have the biggest growth potential?<br></strong>We are not thinking about new markets right now in terms of stores, as we are focusing on the 13 countries in which we already have operations. We are opening one store in Argentina, and going back to Mexico is our priority for 2019. In terms of retail markets, we are optimistic about the US, Mexico, and Central America, where we already have a presence with some stores but can go through to retail. We are pursuing a retail business in Japan and South Korea, and we look forward to establishing a retail presence in other countries through supermarkets or e-commerce.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How has TIPSA contributed to the development of Pereira city and region?<br></strong>We are always thinking about projects that have an impact on the economy and tourism and develop different types of projects for typical living community apartments and houses. We started our company developing land in Ceritos, Pereira, which is a family property. We then started doing country housing and have been preserving a lot of the original forest as we are in a dry rain forest. We are protecting this area near the mountains, an exclusive location. We are neighbors with the Country Club of Pereira, which has also been a successful project. We have done six projects already with a lot of families living there. And now we are in a new stage of the Maracay Country City development. We are starting to plan a commercial area, hotel, and a senior living center in this area, and have completed other commercial projects and country living residences.</p><p><strong>How does your emphasis on sustainable development and working with the local environment add value to your projects?<br></strong>More and more, customers are concerned with reducing their impact on the environment. We have been working with the community on efforts to recycle all the waste from our developments: glass, plastic, paper, metals, and so on. It is not easy, but it is possible, and we are making a great impact.</p><p><strong>How is TIPSA contributing to the preservation of biodiversity of the region?<br></strong>Instead of only doing more residential development, we want to preserve the land and contribute to tourism and very responsible housing alternatives. We are going into the industry with hotels that are low impact and looking for partners for this type of project and to develop the rest of the land.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been some of the major developments over the last year?<br></strong>VECOL is a well-recognized company in the market. We have been present in the veterinarian market in Colombia for 64 years, developing an excellent image and recognition because of our products. A very solid company, we are self-funded and have an excellent cash flow for future investments, which is something to consider for future growth. Equally important, the company's employees have a strong sense of belonging and are highly committed to the company. In return, VECOL has always provided great benefits for its workers. VECOL has five plants that produce the aftosa vaccine (for foot and mouth disease) and other pharmaceuticals.</p><p><strong>What strategy will the company implement in the coming year?<br></strong>It is important to think about the next level in terms of regulatory demands from the government. Our plants are in line with the current requirements of the main regulatory body, but there are going to be new ones in the near future, so we have to update our plants accordingly. That requires an investment in order to not only meet new requirements, but also to exceed them and guarantee the quality of our products.</p><p><strong>How does the Colombian agriculture sector compete in terms of exports? <br></strong>It is important to differentiate between the animal health and agriculture sectors. We produce for the animal health sector, whereas we import for the agriculture sector. We are in the process of developing a strategic plan for the next five years with the support of a recognized consultancy. Our strategy will establish a clear path to develop new products in animal health and agriculture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Agriculture is a pillar of the economy. How can the government's development policy aid it?<br></strong>The purpose of the policy is to order two of the most important processes: production and marketing. The first is through a strategy of production management, and the second is via the “Coseche y Venda a la Fija" (contract farming) strategy. The former seeks to promote agricultural transformation, strengthening planning processes to make efficient use of resources, smoothing oversupply and scarcity cycles, reducing price volatility, encouraging innovation and technological development, improving quality according to market demand, and integrating agribusiness production with small- and medium-sized producers, all while enhancing the competitiveness of national production. Furthermore, the strategy will concentrate public and private investment in the most productive regions identified by the UPRA, prioritizing the following 10 areas: potatoes, onion, rice, corn, avocado, panela, forestry, cotton, milk, fishing industry, and aquaculture. The production management strategy relies on five components. The first is the agricultural frontier, which entails the identification of the best performance municipalities through a zoning model. The second component is productive planning with a focus on reducing price volatility. Another element is technical assistance through the regulation of Law 1876 of 2017 for the provision of the agricultural extension service. The fourth is access to finance through Finagro services such as Special Credit Lines (LEC), the Agricultural Guarantee Fund (FAG), and the Agricultural Insurance Incentive. The last component, improving infrastructure and marketing, includes, for example, access to land adaptation, processing and storage infrastructure, as well as the strategy of contract farming and tackling agricultural smuggling. Coseche y Venda a la Fija is a well-defined strategy designed by the national government using the contract farming model. This model can be defined as agricultural production carried out according to an agreement between a buyer and a farmer, which establishes conditions for the production and marketing of a farm product. Through this strategy, the national government seeks to generate greater equity in the distribution of generated profits throughout market chains, such that producers obtain better and more stable income. To encourage the coordination of small- and medium-sized producers with the industry, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has designed and implemented financial and technical incentives. Finagro, through intermediaries such as banks and financial cooperatives, will give the producers financial incentives. </p><p><strong>What role does agriculture play in Colombia's export economy, and how will the government's strategy to improve it affect the agriculture sector?</strong><br>Agriculture has historically been among the major engines of the Colombian economy, allowing it to position itself as a supplier of high-quality and differentiated products such as cocoa, coffee, flowers, and bananas. Our strategy of boosting the country's exports is based largely on the promotion of non-traditional products and overcoming trade barriers for agricultural goods. Being a tropical country with unique agro-ecological conditions and a variety of products with global appeal, Colombia has great competitive advantages in the agribusiness sector.<br>In partnership with Canada, the ministry has launched the “Agroemprende Cacao" program to support entrepreneurship in the cacao sector. What does this program seek to achieve?<br>The program aims to increase productivity of the farms under 5,500 cocoa producing families by 30%; increase women empowerment and participation in the sector; sow or improve over 3,300ha of cocoa; increase the volume of cocoa sold through 55 associations and cooperatives; and establish funds or commercial alliances to support cooperatives. The project will be implemented in Putumayo, Meta, Boyacá, Santander, and Antioquia, among others, and seeks to strengthen and support at least 3,300 ha under agroforestry systems, including cocoa, plantain, and timber. It also aims to improve access to new markets and consolidate sustainable business at the cooperative level with Canada, the 13th-largest importer of cocoa beans in the world, representing 1.9% (USD180 million) of global sales.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What drove you to create Helix TCS?</h4><p>My professional background has been highly invested in frontier markets. As these develop, there are necessary components that must be put in place to enable a truly open and transparent marketplace. This is especially critical in the cannabis sector, as there are social equity, law enforcement, and social cost concerns that do not exist to the same degree in other markets. We recognized very early on in the development of legal cannabis that this type of integrated critical infrastructure platform would be needed in order to create a global marketplace, which is our vision.</p><h4>What is the main added value you offer to the growing Latin American medical cannabis market? </h4><p>We provide critical infrastructure services such as seed-to-sale tracking, security, transport, and wholesale marketplaces that are necessary to facilitate a global B2B cannabis marketplace, and allow Latin American countries to realize the full economic and social potential of their competitive advantages. We are facilitating the transition from the black market to the legal market, which means billions of dollars in revenue to governments, communities, entrepreneurs, and employees. As the global market matures, product manufacturers or dispensaries in large consumer markets like the US will begin seeking ways to import products from competitively advantaged markets. They will demand a means of verifying that the product was grown legally and carries verifiable test results, all of which must be backed by a government stamp of approval. Our critical infrastructure platform provides all such services in a single place, supported by the data analysis that gives business, governments, and investors the ability to track financial, operational, and other market outcomes. </p><h4>How can you help new companies overcome the biggest challenges of the market? </h4><p>One of the biggest challenges is certainly the ever-changing compliance requirements. All of our services are tailored to the unique operating requirements in any given jurisdiction. We currently provide seed-to-sale tracking services for dispensaries and grow facilities as well as government traceability through BioTrackTHC, our leading technology services provider; security and transport services through Helix Security, which is the largest cannabis-focused security operator in the industry; and the oldest and only fully compliant wholesale marketplaces through Cannabase and Amercanex. All of our businesses function together to create an unmatched data source for the global industry.</p><h4>What are the main advantages that the Mexican market offers the industry, and what strategies are you using to enter the country? </h4><p>Mexico possesses a climactic advantage and is capable of producing massive amounts of legal cannabis and industrial hemp year-round at a lower cost than the US or Canada. In addition, Mexico will have a significant medical cannabis patient count that could result in a lucrative market. We already have a strong foothold in several Latin American and Caribbean markets including Colombia, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. In the latter, we provide the government cannabis traceability system to oversee the island's entire medical cannabis supply chain. We provide a Spanish user-interface for seed-to-sale tracking through BioTrackTHC, supported by Spanish-speaking technical support agents across multiple time zones. As soon as there is a legal product and thus, a need to track it, we expect to enter Mexico immediately.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2019?</h4><p>Our performance has kept pace with the rapid growth of the industry. Helix TCS was established in 2015 and since then it has reached quarterly revenue of USD3.45 million, with 199% revenue growth in 1Q2019. We are the largest provider of security services in Colorado, and BioTrackTHC has been publicly identified as the leading provider of dispensary POS software in the US. As the industry expands, we are poised to grow alongside it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your early reading of the new administration's views regarding medical cannabis?</h4><p>The government is looking at the issue with a more progressive view. It is looking at the benefits of medical cannabis as well as the social benefits of legalizing most other cannabis uses, including recreational use, supplement use, cosmetics, and so on. The positivity around Mexico is tremendous, because the government has stated its full support of cannabis. Now, it is about understanding strategies and how to position each company within the market niches. It has been positive for everyone, and we are already looking at strategizing how we can lead the market forward.</p><h4>How does Mexico's position in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) affect your long-term vision for Khiron's potential in the country?</h4><p>In the next 10 years, we will see interesting developments. Eventually, the US will legalize cannabis; Canada and Mexico are also taking similar steps. It is hard to fathom no commercial synergies between the economies of Mexico, Canada, and the US. When this happens, being a Canadian company with Mexican operations will be a tremendous advantage for Khiron Life Sciences. On the other hand, we have to look at the reality in the coming years. Cross-border cannabis trade will be tougher, as each country is developing its own industry. Right now, the last thing the Canadian industry wants is to have a flood of Mexican cannabis entering the country, because it has invested billions of dollars in developing its own infrastructure. We are also particularly well positioned to take advantage of this, because we are a Canadian firm with Mexican operations. In the meantime, we have to think about and develop a country-by-country strategy. The opportunities for export will depend on the different regulations developed in different countries. It may well be that products like cosmetics can be shipped across borders, where the regulatory requirements for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products are more complex. However, my goal is to expand our presence and take advantage of the great potential in Mexico. Canada has a population of 35 million, while Mexico is more than 130 million. For companies such as ours, we are trying to keep an eye on the ball and focus on Mexico.</p><h4>What role does Khiron's office in Mexico play in the company's R&amp;D processes?</h4><p>There are three distinct periods: five years down the road, two years down the road, and today. Today, we have a two-year advantage on understanding how to maximize cultivation. This year, we will start to produce medical cannabis that we can use for trials. Today, Colombia has this two-year advantage. In two years, as these products are exported to Mexico, and the regulation allows for cultivation, we will start to develop trials with products that originate in Colombia. In five years, there will be multi-national research opportunities. Our strategy is based on the synergies between Chile, Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia; each country has its own R&amp;D, though eventually they will all be connected so we can develop the best products in the most efficient way. In Colombia, we already have our own clinics with our own patients, and we can advance research much faster compared to other places. Eventually, we will do the same in Mexico. The speed with which the Mexican government is developing changes in the cannabis industry will help the country easily catch up to Colombia within five years.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019 regarding advancement in the industry and your strategic goals for Mexico?</h4><p>In Mexico, Khiron will be able to position itself with products in the cosmetics, supplements, and non-THC medical products area. We will also work on building a stronger presence in Mexico, because it is four to five times larger than Colombia. This depends, however, on the speed the government is able to issue regulations. I am extremely optimistic, though these things can take time. Regulation takes time, which is why we are focused on CBD products at the moment. In 2020, when the government is clearer about what it wants from the THC space, then we will see this market opening up. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main trends have you identified in Mexico's anti-aging market?</h4><p>Cenegenics Elite Health was developed 30 years ago with the vision of promoting preventive and personalized healthcare. Our main focus is to maintain an optimal quality of life as long as possible. With this vision, Cenegenics has been developing the Elite Health program since its foundation. Our specialty is researching all the factors that affect human health, including the environment. Chronic degenerative diseases afflict every country. Mainly these diseases develop due to a change in lifestyle; people no longer walk, exercise, eat properly, and sleep well. These things reduce our endurance capacity. That is why chronic degenerative diseases begin to appear at an earlier age. Unfortunately, we have observed that developments in medicine leads to more degenerative diseases. The goal of Cenegenics is to prevent the appearance of these diseases. </p><h4>How do you plan to expand?</h4><p>The center in Mexico was our first outside the US. We have already consolidated the market for four years and now we will start expanding. In 2019, we opened in Monterrey and we are planning to open two more in 2019. At present, we have almost 300 patients and we expect to have 450 by end-2019. Outside Mexico, we are developing a center in Colombia. Also, we plan to open in Greece, the UK, Vietnam, and Nairobi. </p><h4>What kind of programs are you planning to launch for young people?</h4><p>We have identified that people aged between 20 and 35 have a lot of interest in health. One program is Elite Health Youth, and we have another corporate program that will focus on executives who live under daily stress. Stress generates inflammation and inflammation generates chronic and degenerative diseases. At Cenegenics, we are developing a specific program for that and it will be launched in August 2019. This youth program was created initially for Mexico, but we will take it to the other centers around the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the priorities for the new government in terms of fostering innovation and efficiency within the medical devices and healthcare sectors?</h4><p>It is important to solve problems; for example, what I expect from the government is a commitment to using innovation to achieve universal healthcare. We have always claimed Mexico has universal healthcare, which is true; however, the government system is not delivering the expected results needed to solve the country's diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular problems. Innovation is how we can work together—both the public and private sectors—to create a healthcare system that finds solutions.</p><h4>What medical devices are there in terms of progressing toward Industry 4.0?</h4><p>Many of our and other companies' devices already have built-in wireless capabilities or network connectivity that allow for remote patient monitoring or image sending. The problem is that we do not have a business model where it makes sense to use the technology, so the technology itself will not make a difference. We have patients with heart failure who need to go to third-level specialized hospitals to get a device implant. We can save millions by remotely monitoring patients and investing in other patients or extending access. We must work on creating a treatment model where technology makes sense and is connected to a treatment process.</p><h4>What are your goals for Medtronic in 2019?</h4><p>We have been posting double-digit growth and are continuing to evolve. We started the journey four years ago to truly capitalize the opportunities on offer. Now, we are in the phase where we need to start creating the next growth wave, which goes along the path of how we create the conditions to establish a dialog where we can help the system provide greater access in a holistic way and how we can develop new business models to serve this emerging middle-class segment of 20 million people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[enkontrols-clients-in-colombia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Enkontrol is undoubtedly a market leader in Mexico. How has that experience and leadership translated to its Colombian operations?<br></strong>The first two years were difficult for us because we had to adapt to Colombia's rules, laws, and culture. After that initial period, we worked hard to open up the Colombian market, and at present, we have some big names in our client portfolio.</p><p><strong>Why do longstanding sector stalwarts choose Enkontrol in Colombia?<br></strong>The biggest factor is our experience. In Mexico we run with maybe 80% of the big players in the market, not only in construction, but also in the infrastructure and real estate segments. Moreover, in the Mexican market we have 20 of the biggest companies as clients, so we are a big name in Mexico and Latin America. After the US, Indian, and Chinese markets, Mexico has the biggest housing development market. This is why the big players in Colombia pay attention to Enkontrol and its software.</p><p><strong>What is the profile and mix of Enkontrol's clients in Colombia?<br></strong>The company has a large portfolio of clients in Colombia and features some of the biggest names in real estate and construction, including Acierto, Multiplika, Hycsa, and GA Cadena, as well as the financial sector, such as PEI, Accuro, Inverlink, and Sociedad Fondo de Inversion. Our portfolio in Colombia is wide, and 100% of our clients work with the construction industry in a variety of ways, such as infrastructure, housing, real estate, and so on.</p><p><strong>How can ERP providers solve structural issues in Colombia?<br></strong>Across Latin America, construction is a sector without technology and processes, so ERP can bring not just faster processing of operations and data to these clients, but also structured processes. We can really help all the big competitors in the sector without ERP offerings.</p><p><strong>How is Colombia's construction sector doing in terms of its digital transformation?<br></strong>The construction sector in Colombia is slow to adopt new technologies. Most of the players are still thinking about technology as a cost rather than an investment, which makes it hard for us to change that perception.</p><p><strong>How do you evaluate Colombia's construction industry recovery during 2019?<br></strong>It was obvious once the new government came in that the sector will reactivate activities and projects. However, so far it has been really slow for us; the YoY recovery is only around 5-10%.</p><p><strong>What new opportunities does this represent for Enkontrol?<br></strong>More international investment creates a big opportunity for us, particularly because a couple of international brands already know us elsewhere. For example, Grupo HYCSA is an infrastructure client in Medellí­n that was initially our client in Mexico.</p><p><strong>What can we expect to see from Enkontrol in Colombia over the coming years?<br></strong>We are fighting to become the principal competitor in the industry. We want to have the big names in our portfolio of clients. In two or three years we hope to see the Enkontrol brand being used by all the major players in the construction, infrastructure, and real estate industries in Colombia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What competitive advantage does IFM have in the market?<br></strong>Over the years, IFM has had positive cycles as well as cycles where it had to rise above the challenges and improve. The company has grown to become a service integrator, a capital integrator, and a benefits integrator for all stakeholders. We integrate supply and tailor-made services to deliver the best products and services to our clients. We focus on providing solutions in the field of drinking water and basic sanitation.</p><p><strong>Why is the integration of solutions the best option for industrial clients in Colombia?<br></strong>IFM's corporate vision of sustainability, which is also the fundamental axis of its vision, and cost-effectiveness are key to its success. When we design something particular for a client, we receive a lot of valuable feedback that helps us generate an effective solution in terms of cost, maintenance, and results. This is the reason why clients choose us over the competition.</p><p><strong>What is the importance of the approach to sustainability in Colombia? What challenges do companies face to reach sustainability goals?<br></strong>The public sector's approach toward water sanitation is changing under Colombia's vision 2030. This change is framed within the vision's sustainable development objectives, and IFM has the products that seek to deliver the required quality. We want to change the system of compliance with a system of service efficiency to minimize the impact on the community and the environment, seeking its continuous improvement.</p><p><strong>What is the added value that makes the municipalities choose the services of IFM?<br></strong>In addition to quality and compliance to industry best standards, IFM is renowned for efficiency. For example, Yopal's strategy to solve its drinking water problems began in 2011; however, it has still not been finalized. IFM came up with an innovative proposal with the support of other firms to create a solution that would provide water to the entire population of Yopal in eight months. IFM is an integrator that studies, designs, improves, constructs and delivers according to the client's needs.</p><p><strong>IFM has operations in Peru, Colombia, and Panama. What is the advantage of this international presence?<br></strong>It allows us to expand our field of action. We integrate our experiences and lessons from one country to another. Colombia is our biggest market; of the 118 projects we have carried out, 112 have been in Colombia.</p><p><strong>The needs and parameters of water use in the country are changing due to climate change. What services does IFM have to counter future challenges?<br></strong>The rational use of water is a challenge for our company, the country, and society in general. For this, IFM has developed improvements for its technologies. The availability of water during summer seasons is a challenge, and IFM has developed alternative systems to alleviate the situation. Our project in Yopal is one success story. We have installed groundwater treatment systems to optimize the use of water and protect the aquifer. IFM finds alternative uses of wastewater where previously potable water was used. We use LEED sustainable architecture for these projects, and so far we have completed and tested two cases in Colombia.</p><p><strong>How do you evaluate policies in terms of sustainability in water use and maintenance?<br></strong>Public policy has improved over time to build models where private participation is promoted. At present, we have a tariff framework that allows the private sector to come up with competitive solutions; however, regulation is still needed for the arrival of private companies with greater competitiveness. The public sector must implement and improve technology, as Colombia has outdated technology for wastewater treatment. There are no incentives for companies and users to improve quality. These things should be considered important in Colombia's future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[private-and-charter-flights]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the market for private and charter flights in Colombia evolved since Searca started its operations?<br></strong>We had a humble beginning helping the medical and social security sector with a health program in Urabá. We experienced moderated growth until the year 2000, after which there was greater national security, a result of which was oil companies wanting to return to the country. The growing oil and mining sector became the biggest piece of our operation. At that time, we started investing in 19 passenger-pressurized aircraft that could go to all the destinations required by these companies. Due to high demand, we added four aircraft per year for seven years in a row, which resulted in our current fleet of 30 aircrafts.</p><p><strong>How has the evolution of the oil sector affected the need for private and charter flights?<br></strong>As a result of the growing demand from the oil sector, we increased the number and versatility of our fleet with larger, faster, pressurized aircrafts. 10 years ago, we started with executive jets and Hawkers 400 for eight people. Seven years ago, we added two Gulfstreams for longer flights to Europe and Africa. We give executives the possibility of not losing time at airports by reducing the amount of connections and waiting time. These advantages make the cost of private jets worth it when considering the opportunity cost and gains in efficiency.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you describe DHL's performance in Colombia in 2018?<br></strong>DHL in Colombia belongs to Deutsche Post Group, which has a presence in 220 countries. We have different business divisions such as cargo, storage, and courier. For us, it is extremely important to understand the needs of the local market and the way we connect through our service to contribute to the development of international trade. Colombia is a market with great opportunities for growth and is increasingly oriented to the international market, which is part of our mission. In Colombia, there are important opportunities in different industries such as the SME segment; more than 90% of companies in Colombia are SMEs, and they have a strong contribution in GDP and exports. With that in mind, we created a program called Pymexporta, which has a team of executives prepared to advise the client who wants to go to the international market. The service includes advice regarding tariffs, paperwork, packaging, and any other aspect to make a Colombian product successful on the international market. Colombian coffee growers are full of opportunities for a decree that allows exporting coffee in smaller quantities. DHL created another program called Pymexporta café to cater them and help them develop their opportunities. Another important segment within Colombia is e-commerce, and Colombia aspires to become the biggest Latin American country in this sector. For DHL, this is a great opportunity. The traditional retail-business model in which a consumer goes to a store to buy is changing. Some companies are already born under the electronic business model, while others are developing to incorporate both models. We have focused on the logistics of e-commerce to be able to provide our customers and their customers with the best shopping experience. Another relevant aspect is the US. More than 45% of courier business in Colombia is related to the US market. Earlier in 2018, we incorporated a new flight with a 767-400 aircraft that has a capacity of 50 tons. Through this, we can connect with the US in 24 hours. At DHL, we are pleased to know that we are accompanying the sector of the Colombian economy that is highly relevant in the US. In the global economy, time is critical and being able to connect a product sample or a spare part for a final consumer in the shortest time possible means an opportunity for growth. To that end, DHL has invested in assuring the market that it can connect with the US as quickly and safely as possible.</p><p><strong>What role does Colombia have in DHL's regional and global portfolios? <br></strong>Latin America is an important market for DHL, and Colombia is one of the largest markets within the region. Our approaches in Colombia are supported with investments that we have been making in the last 10 years. Our fleet includes vehicles that seek to reduce the carbon footprint—the company has seven electric vehicles and plans to incorporate more in 2019. Similarly, we invested in systems and technologies to streamline procedures and invested in training our international advisers to understand global trade and our customers clearly. To focus on growth, we must focus on investing, and we have invested around EUR17 million. During the last nine years, we have connected the needs of the client with the evolution of our services to spur Colombia's international growth.</p><p><strong>What particular challenges does DHL face in Colombia? <br></strong>The challenge is to make the process to go to the international market simpler. DHL works closely with the authorities and is respectful of local legislation. One of the challenges is to connect with the world in the fastest way; that is why we incorporated the aforementioned flight. For example, the flower sector has greatly benefited from it. We travel overnight and are able to quickly deliver products with a short shelf life.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>You closed 2018 with a 19% market share, and project an even larger one for 2019. What is your strategy for doing so? <br></strong>In 2018, the industry in Colombia saw positive growth for the first time after three consecutive years of decline, closing with 255,682 units sold and 18,086 more than 2017.  At the end of 2018, Chevrolet obtained 19.5% of market sales, some 49,866 units sold, which positioned the brand as a leader in the automotive sector for 32 consecutive years. Currently, General Motors South America West is working intensively to consolidate its operations in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Uruguay, and Paraguay. Our main objectives in the region are to ensure the competitiveness and sustainability of the company, exceed customer expectations with innovative products, and strengthen Chevrolet as a brand that continues to evolve with a broad and renewed portfolio of global vehicles and trucks. At GM, we are optimistic about the future and committed to the country. The projections in market sales are between 255,000 and 260,000 units. Chevrolet seeks to have about 21% market share, leveraging the evolution of the brand with a broad and renewed portfolio of global vehicles and trucks that incorporate the latest in technology, design, and safety.</p><p><strong>How is GM investing to reach its country targets?<br></strong>GM intends to take advantage of commercial agreements that provide the opportunity to reach new markets such as the agreement with Mercosur countries. The short-term objective is to achieve the allocation of new production projects and expand our exports to other destinations such as Central America, Brazil, and Argentina. In the last 10 years, General Motors has invested nearly USD300 million in innovation in its Colombian plant and is the only vehicle assembler in the country to invoice USD56 million to purchase materials from local suppliers in Colombia and Ecuador. The consolidation of General Motors South America Oeste has allowed the plant in Colombia to increase exports to Chile, Bolivia, and Ecuador with vehicles such as the Chevrolet Spark and NQR bus. In 2018, General Motors exports totaled MXN384.2 billion, equivalent to 12,827 units. The 2019 projections for exports amount to MXN444,500 million, or 13,357 units.</p><p><strong>What is the role of the automotive sector, and GM Colmotores in particular, as a driver for Colombian growth and employment?<br></strong>At General Motors Colmotores, we are focused on the competitiveness and sustainability of the business and are confident that with an open dialogue and working hand in hand with the government, workers, suppliers, and business allies, we will strengthen operations in Colombia to continue being the engine of development for the country. General Motors today contributes to the economic and social development of Colombia through the generation of more than 1,033 direct jobs (plant workers, administrative, and Zoficol free zone) and 16,000 indirect ones (concessionaires, suppliers, and contractors). For the development of business activity in Colombia, Chevrolet moves 50% of the country's cargo with its trucks and transports 43% of Colombians on their buses. The first Corporate Contact Center operated by Colombia for Spanish-speaking South America was recently added to the services of Chevrolet. Through this platform the customer is taken care of for any information related to the brand, sales, and booking of appointments in dealerships. In addition, Chevrolet has a solid network of 28 dealers and 106 service points.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What is the importance of a solid network of tertiary roads for Colombia, and how is the government addressing the issue?<br></strong>Colombia is not only a geographically complex country but also an extremely diverse one. It has a long extension which increases the need to build a solid network of tertiary roads in order to reduce costs for the agricultural and tourism sectors and to integrate the rural communities with the urban ones. Although private investors have invested in tertiary roads, since 2015 the national government has not followed suit. Considering all this, President Duque and the Colombian congress approved a USD150-million program for tertiary roads in the national budget for 2019. We are expecting the government to invest at least USD1 billion in building the tertiary road network over the next four years. In that light, at present, we are debating to enlarge this budget for 2020, 2021, and 2022. Colombia has around 140,000km of tertiary roads, of which 90% are in need of maintenance or improvement. In our program, Invias (National Roads Institute) will supervise the whole development of the roads. We have developed a program with a prioritization criterion that has to do mainly with production sectors. The plan is to give maintenance and improvement to the roads that connect rural to urban areas, giving priority to agricultural products and prioritizing ecotourism routes under the new economic development plan. This program also includes the possibility of adding capital from different sources. This includes the national budget, royalties from the OCAD mechanism, and taxes paid by companies in the agricultural and mining sectors, where they can put money in public works in exchange for taxes. We are also looking for resources from international cooperation and other sources as it is important to have a solid system of road maintenance and construction. </p><p><strong>How is the government planning to restart and complete the 4G projects?<br></strong>The government has already delivered. When the new government came into power, out of 30 projects six were working as planned, three had some issues, and 21 were halted. Notwithstanding the contracts signed between 2014 and 2016, only minimal work had been done on most of them. This was for many reasons—administrative, environmental, and a lack of government coordination. Designing, structuring, and financing a project is one thing, but constructing it is something else. The National Infrastructure Agency (ANI) was a new entity that was strong on the financial side but weak on the territorial and execution side. We established an economic activation room to sit with the attorney general's office and primary actors to diagnose problems and propose alternative solutions. Once this public document was released, we started executing decisions and solutions. We had set the target to enforce 70% of the projects by March 2019 and achieved this with 21 projects underway by the end of that month. Civil construction decreased during the first three quarters of 2018, respectively, and by the last quarter of 2018 we increased it by 5.5%; during 1Q2019 the sector increased by 6.5%, which is more than the economy as a whole. During this period, we had two new financial closes and by December 2019, we will deliver at least five more; notably, some projects are working even without the financial closure since people are putting money in with a bridge loan or equity. We took decisions, negotiated transaction agreements, signed modifications to contracts, and developed a strategy with the Colombian environmental agency to give alternatives to several projects, such as “La Ruta del Cacao," which did not have financial closure due to uncertainties about an environmental license. The original proposal was rejected but we provided time, space, and an alternative location for the road, which gave the bankers the certainty they needed to close the deal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>The ministry has projected 3.7% growth for the construction sector. How does this compare to the rate of growth in previous years?</strong><br>In the last 10 years, the construction sector in Colombia has grown at an average rate of 2.6% per year. Our projections for 2019 show the consolidated recovery process that the sector is experiencing, which is expanding at higher levels than the national economy. In fact, the ministry estimates that the building sector will become an engine for productive activity, which is expected to be 3.4% during the year. It should be emphasized that there are currently favorable perspectives for the sector. It has experienced two consecutive quarters with strong signs of recovery. For example, the GDP of the building sector registered growth rates of 6.2% and 4.4% for 3Q and 4Q of 2018, and the leading indicators, including employment and the willingness of consumers to buy houses, have shown positive growth rates in the first three months of the year.</p><p><strong>The ministry has a four-point plan to boost the construction sector. What reforms will the ministry advance, and how will they affect the sector's growth?</strong><br>Our strategy to promote digitalization and technological progress needs to respond to present conditions where the procedures for licensing not only increase costs, but also affect the transparency of the whole process. For example, evidence has shown that the time spent on the paperwork required to issue construction licenses can increase costs by up to 10%. However, the highest delay comes in obtaining the necessary certificates to apply for construction licenses, which, by law, must be issued in 45 days. The ministry will expedite this procedure through a transactional information system called Terra. This system will be the result of the application of technological tools and the improvement of inter-institutional coordination. Digitalizing the process will allow the integration of the acquiring of certificates that are needed to get the licenses in a single system. However, the coordination between government entities becomes a key factor as this means to ensure that the information that lays in the system remains updated and certified. This is possible through the standardization of content and its interoperability with other existing information systems. The possibility of having standardized information and a platform that allows one to carry out the procedures will significantly reduce the time required to collect the necessary documentation to apply for the construction licenses. This time-saving will result in a reduction of overcosts currently faced by project developers and increase productivity in the sector.</p><p><strong>How can the ministry foment the digitalization and technological advancement of the sector?<br></strong>One of the core elements in our productivity strategy is digitalization, specifically, the application of building information modeling (BIM), which is currently implemented at a low rate in Colombia and with a limited number of projects. Whereas in the UK 74% of the companies of the sector implement it, in Colombia this percentage goes as low as 37%, ranking below Chile, which is a regional benchmark, with 52%, according to the IDB. The implementation of BIM translates into a reduction of times and costs in construction projects, and therefore an increase of productivity. McKinsey Global Institute estimates that the adoption of good technological practices, including BIM, generates a cost reduction of between 4% and 6% and an increase in productivity between 14% and 15%. These gains are the result of the reduction of design risks and improvements in project planning. Our goal is to encourage the use of BIM so that at least one third of the companies use the methodology in more than 80% of their projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were Renault-Sofasa's major achievements in 2018?<br></strong>2018 was an historic year for RENAULT-Sofasa in that it was the first time we reached the top position in the market. It had never been our goal to be first, though we knew that we were in good stead to do so based on our work. We achieved this based on our strong work on our portfolio of products and services. For many years, we have been working to develop vehicles that are well suited for the Colombian market. We managed to do so with products such as Sandero, Sandero Stepway, Logan, and Duster, which are the top four produced here and adapted to the needs of the Colombian market. In addition, we did a great deal of work on customer experience within our network. We have the largest network of dealers in the country and have worked extensively with them to increase the quality of service in sales and aftersales for our customers. Another part of our success is our financing company, Renault Credit International (RCI Colombia), which we launched in 2016 and which finances more than half of our sales. It is the number one firm for the financing of new vehicles in the country after merely two years of history. Now, we have perfect financing and excellent products and service, which is how we reached such sales levels and a top position in the market. The electric market is still a small one but is growing rapidly. We have been a pioneer in Colombia with electric vehicles since 2014, first with the Twizy and later with the Kangoo Z.E. In 2018, we launched the new Zoe and reached the number-one position in the electrical vehicle market. We also had more than 78% market share in the electrical vehicle market in 2018.</p><p><strong>What did the modernization process of your plants entail, and what will it mean for Renault-Sofasa in the coming years?<br></strong>We produce about 70,000 cars per year and export about 40% to more than 10 other countries in the region. It is extremely important for us to maintain these exports. This is not just based on its efficiency, but also on having modern installations, new lines, and new investments. We invested USD5 million in our plants to make sure we retain our high level of competitiveness. We are the most competitive plant in Latin America and a top seven global Renault plant and want to keep it that way. We have an extremely labor-intensive plant; we do not have many robots or automation and invest a great deal in our human resources and talent to make sure we continue to be the most competitive in Latin America. This year we will celebrate our 50th year in Colombia; if we want to be here for another 50, we have to continue to stay competitive.</p><p><strong>Which markets are currently the biggest destinations for export?<br></strong>Mexico is our biggest customer; in 2018, we exported 13,751 vehicles there, most of which were Dusters. The second is Argentina, where we exported 6,044 Dusters in 2018. Chile and Ecuador are also successful markets, while we also export to all the smaller countries in the region.</p><p><strong>What plans do you have for the coming year?<br></strong>Our entire focus is on sustaining our leading position. Our midterm vision is to be the leader of the market, industry, and people. We reached 23% market share in April, which is excellent, and we will continue to meet the high demand we have seen. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Industry Leader]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[industry-leader]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What market opportunities has Médica Sur identified in the local health sector?</h4><p>The main opportunities in the Mexican health sector revolve around the basic needs of our pa-tients. Many people do not have access to healthcare because private healthcare is expensive. The industry is trying to develop the best medicine at the best price. We try to be as effective as possible when it comes to our supply chain. Our goal is to have the best quality at a lower cost. We also collaborate with insurance companies to remain competitive. The market has become more competitive as there are more private hospitals than before. In the past 10 years, more than 20 new hospitals have entered the market, rising to the second level and providing general surgery services, orthopedics, and more. However, many are not highly specialized in neuroscience, cardiology, or oncology.</p><h4>What is the main differentiator of Médica Sur?</h4><p>We have one of the best processes in the country. We are certified by the Joint Commission International and are one of the only two hospitals in Mexico to achieve it. This places Médica Sur at the same level as hospitals in the US. Moreover, we are partners of the Mayo Clinic Care Network. We strive to have a competitive staff to keep the business efficient and sustainable. There is a thin line between ethics and business in medicine; Médica Sur has a clear vision on the ethics side, and we will always prioritize patients before money. Oncology, general surgery, and neurosurgery are the services that are high in demand. Cardiovascular disease is the top cause of death in Mexico.</p><h4>What services will see great demand in the coming five years?</h4><p>Everything is moving to outpatient services. The traditional model, wherein a patient recovers in a hospital for a long period, is diminishing, as the average stay of patients is currently 2.7 nights. Recovery times are faster, and procedures are less invasive. We seek to shift to outpatient services as much as possible, whereby patients are in and out of the hospital in less than 24 hours. The market is moving toward less expensive, aggressive, and invasive procedures.</p><h4>How are you hoping to tap into medical tourism?</h4><p>We have a department working hard on it, and we see more demand along the borders and in the Caribbean. In Mexico City, we see fewer but more complex cases. However, medical tourism is a great opportunity. We are working with partners around the world on this. Our idea is to develop a one-stop shop in which we provide a hotel on site, transporting the patient to the hospital from the airport. </p><h4>How much will the hospital invest in new clinics?</h4><p>In 2019, our budget is around MXN500 million (USD26 million), of which MXN300 million (USD15 million) is for hospitals and MXN200 million (USD10.5 million) for diagnostics clinics. For the past three years, we have been upgrading the hospital and our equipment, and opening new laboratories. We manage three brands: Médica Sur, La-boratorios Médicos Polanco, and Laboratorios Ruiz in Puebla. The hospital has a presence in six states, and we seek to enter new markets across Mexico. We have a presence in Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Tlaxcala, Puebla, Morelos, and Querétaro, and want to enter Yucatán and Quintana Roo soon. In 2017, for example, we realized our concept of a new high-end competitively prices clinic in Cuernavaca, Morelos.</p><h4>How will the change in administration impact the health industry in Mexico?</h4><p>We see a reduction in insurance policies, and many people in the public sector will lose their medical insurance policies. Insurance companies want to provide policies to retain those clients. We need to continue to provide the best prices and conditions so patients can continue to use private services and not be forced to use public health services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major challenges regarding clinical trials do companies face when bringing medicine to Mexico?</h4><p>The biggest challenge is definitely regulatory affairs. We are not sure yet about the Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks' (COFEPRIS) impact on review process under the new government, but I hope there will not be a significant impact in this field. We are doing fine regarding quality and patient recruitment because companies know that we will produce the results. Throughout Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico are the top three countries in terms of medicinal products. For us, it helps that we are next to a country like the US that has a large pharmaceutical industry. But they still have molecules that we don't have access to. Usually, the development of new molecules takes place in the US, the EU, China, and India.</p><h4>What clinical trials are you working on?</h4><p>Our main areas are rheumatology, pediatrics, immune respiratory diseases, urology, and dermatology. We are working with a stage-two and stage-three rheumatoid arthritis clinical trial and medical monitoring. This trial is focused on small molecules since it is part of a biological therapy. The medicine was launched in 2018 but we still have 41 patients who have been taking the medicine for the last five years. Mexico has many types of medicine, including those that are considered new drugs. There might be a medicine against orphan diseases that is available around the world but not in Mexico because of low demand, and these are most likely to be the ones that you cannot find in the country. COFEPRIS has the power to authorize medicines in Mexico, and this facilitates the process. Once it's in Mexico, it can be easily found in Latin America, even if the US doesn't approve it. COFEPRIS and Latin American audits have gained this recognition.</p><h4>How do you use alliances to improve your clinical trials?</h4><p>Bioclinica is a global research network that works with all kinds of pharmaceutical companies. It offers projects to us since it has the quality they are looking for. The main advantage is that we have direct contact with them and not through an intermediary. Therefore, they offer feedback on things like our recruitment system. We also work with big laboratories, such as AbbVie, that have partner research sites and are looking for sites that guarantee quick regulatory affairs, patients, and quality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is your ministry facilitating Malaysia's transition toward a climate-resilient green economy?</h4><p>The Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment, and Climate Change (MESTECC) increased its 2025 target for the share of renewable energy in the total electricity generation of the country from 2% to 20%, excluding large hydro. This means we need to add 3.9GW of installed renewable energy capacity in the next seven years. We announced a new policy on net energy metering to incentivize people to install rooftop solar panels. We have 3.2 million residential properties, 450,000 commercial lots, 90,000 terraced factories, and 21,000 factories, which illustrates the great potential for rooftop solar in Malaysia, though we should maximize unused land first. In addition, MESTECC has liberalized solar leasing, which makes it easier to arrange supply agreements. The asset owner no longer needs to be the building owner, which incentivizes companies. With the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, we are going into energy efficiency, one of the lowest-hanging fruits to decarbonize the economy and save money. With about 5,000 buildings, the government is the largest property owner in Malaysia, but many of them are not efficient. Moving forward, we want to close the Energy Performance Contract in which companies invest in retrofitting these buildings and then share in the savings. In 2019, we will do this with 50 government buildings as a pilot. Going into electricity performance contracting will catalyze the energy service industry in Malaysia and help us be more efficient without having to make huge public capital outlays. We are finalizing a standard template to share, educate, and incentivize the government on all levels to go into energy performance contracts. Another important initiative of MESTECC is the roadmap toward zero single-use plastics, which incentivizes companies to replace hydrocarbon-based single-use plastics with eco-friendly alternatives. In November 2018, the Ministry of Finance announced a tax incentive status for companies that invest in biopolymers or bio-products. We want to create an ecosystem that fosters this green agenda regardless of any government investment. This ecosystem depends on four pillars: talent, technology, the regulatory framework, and private capital investment. Eventually, we want to see Malaysia as a green economy and green financing hub for green projects in the entire Southeast Asia region. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the Large Scale Solar 3 (LSS3) scheme?</h4><p>MESTECC has announced the LSS3 scheme tender for 500MW worth USD450 million, which will close in August 2019. I expect LSS3 to be even more competitive than LSS2 and LSS1. We have more local players with whom foreign players can start a joint venture. Local regulations require 51% Malaysian ownership, which is not a restriction for FDI. </p><h4>What are some ways in which the value chain in the power sector can become more competitive?</h4><p>We aim to reform the sector and open it up to more competition. Investors will see a more comparative electricity power sector in Malaysia, with a more competitive environment. I see the power sector as a nurturing ground for our players to eventually export their services to other Southeast Asian countries. The goal is to make Malaysia a pivotal point for FDI in Southeast Asia. We will be more cost-competitive than Singapore, with the same high level of talent, technology, and regulatory framework, and a competitive local market located close to other important Southeast Asian markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most important trends and developments transforming the healthcare sector?</h4><p>The biggest changes have been the internet and digital health. The availability of knowledge is now so widespread, and it is not restricted to just specialists and doctors. Another trend is technological innovation; Prince Court is a leader in adopting and using new technologies. We acknowledge that the trend will increasingly move toward robotics, though we are waiting to see greater acceptance from insurance companies and the medical community as a whole. Medical equipment is becoming even more specialized and expensive, resulting in increasing healthcare costs. Healthcare technology continues to develop, and we must ensure that we do not deprive people of healthcare services as we head toward more robotics and innovation. Digital equipment and wearable technology will also continue to develop and will particularly change, especially in primary healthcare.</p><h4>What needs to happen for Malaysia to develop further as a prime medical tourism hub in the region?</h4><p>Malaysia has all the necessary ingredients to be a prime medical tourism market. In order for our medical tourism sector to develop, our general tourism must also take off. Thailand is a great example of a country with a strong general tourism industry that transitioned into strong medical tourism. We are working with the public sector to determine the best way to develop medical tourism in Malaysia. Matters such as ease of visas to visit Malaysia for medical treatment should be addressed. Moreover, medical tourists often come as a family, so we should work toward attracting families. We can package our general tourism services with our healthcare tourism services to create the perfect mix.</p><h4>What are the main source markets for foreign patients that come to PCMC, and which markets show signs of strong growth?</h4><p>We would like to stress that PCMC is a hospital for Malaysians, expatriates, and international patients; however, due to its quality clinical and service standards as well as its location, we receive tourists and travelers as well as expatriates from many different nationalities across the world. We have the most diverse patient load in the country. Patients from Indonesia, the UK, the US, and Japan are important markets for PCMC. We work closely with many embassies to support their staff, their citizens working as expatriates in Malaysia as well as visitors and medical travelers. PCMC also attracts Singaporeans and expatriates from Singapore mainly because of Singapore's strong currency. We have catered to many large groups from China that are interested in health screening as well as our IVF services.</p><h4>How will you realize your vision of becoming a leading healthcare provider in Asia?</h4><p>For the last few years, PCMC was recognized by Medical Travel Quality Alliance (MTQUA) as one of the world's top 10 hospitals for medical tourism and the top in Malaysia. PCMC has many firsts among its services, among them: the first private hospital in Malaysia to have the Da Vinci robot for surgery; the first and still the only private hospital doing kidney transplant including ABO or incompatible transplant; the only private hospital to have a full-fledged burns unit; the first corneal transplant; and the only dialysis center in Malaysia using beds and not recliners for the comfort of our patients. One of the frequent accolades from our patient is that PCMC does not look, feel, or smell like a hospital. We have 'zen' areas within the hospital building that provide peaceful sitting areas for patients and their families. One common grouse of hospital stay is the quality of food. PCMC is well known for the quality of its inpatient meals. We employ two five-star hotel chefs who oversee our kitchen, and every patient meal is cooked ala carte. Despite being well established for the high quality of our clinical, nursing, and customer services, we will not rest on our laurels but will continue to strive to improve our services in all areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2019 marks the 10th anniversary of MHTC. How do you assess MHTC's contribution to the development of medical tourism?</h4><p>MHTC is a government agency that has been entrusted with the responsibility of curating the country's healthcare travel scene. It was founded in 2009 to facilitate and grow Malaysia's healthcare travel industry under the brand “Malaysia Healthcare" with the goal of making the country a leading global healthcare destination. Since then, MHTC has worked to streamline industry players and service providers into a more focused development strategy to raise Malaysia's profile in healthcare travel on an international stage. It is an example of a successful model of PPPs in growing the healthcare travel sector. In facilitating the industry, MHTC works closely with the private and public sectors and as a result we have seen a double-digit average YoY growth of 16-17% resulting in Malaysia attaining MYR1.3 billion in hospital revenue and more than 1 million healthcare travellers in 2017. Malaysia is now known as one of the leading global healthcare destinations. The local medical travel industry offers healthcare travelers a complete package with all the right ingredients: world-class quality, easy accessibility, and affordability while having ease of communication, being a global halal hub, and a travel destination. As a result, Malaysia was crowned “Destination of the Year" for healthcare travel from 2015 to 2017 with a highly commendable mention in 2018 by UK-based International Medical Travel Journal. Additionally, in 2018 LaingBuisson, a healthcare research specialist based in the UK, ranked Malaysia eighth out of the top 25 medical travel destinations by value. Since MHTC was put in place, Malaysia has emerged from being the hidden jewel of Asia for healthcare travel. A relatively young player in comparison to our regional competitors, the country has successfully played catch up and is now a strong industry player within Southeast Asia.</p><h4>What sets MHTC apart from regional competitors?</h4><p>Healthcare travel industry in Malaysia is driven by the government and is well regulated under the Ministry of Health (MoH) and facilitated by MHTC. MHTC has set up a partnership program, for which it has identified 76 hospitals in Malaysia, most active in healthcare travel. In enhancing end-to-end seamless healthcare travel ecosystem, MHTC has introduced a call centre and a concierge and lounge at the KLIA/PIA airport, and established partnerships in key target markets such as China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar. With all these acknowledgements and others, Malaysia has made a name for itself on the global stage. We aim to continue propelling Malaysia's profile as a global destination for healthcare.</p><h4>What are the most important trends and developments in the medical travel sector, and how is MHTC addressing them?</h4><p>As the market for medical tourism continues to develop, Malaysia has strengthened its preventive care offerings. The holistic care available in Malaysia gives healthcare travelers the opportunity to combine their treatments with alternative recovery packages. The range of wellness treatments available in Malaysia offers wellness tourists a host of alternative medicine and treatments such as yoga, ayurveda, traditional complementary eastern medicine, detoxification, mental health retreats, and anti-aging treatments. In addition, Malaysia's growth in medical tourism will be linked to more infrastructural development, an expansion of serviceable cities, investment in human resources and advanced international patient training, quality standardization, and enhancing marketing to international markets.</p><h4>In which fields do you see the largest potential?</h4><p>MHTC has identified fertility and cardiology issues as the rising trends and developments in the medical travel sector. Many couples from China have sought fertility treatments in Malaysia due to the easy access to quality treatments available here, which are quite affordable. In addition, Malaysia has been a strong center for cardiology treatment. Aside from that, lifestyle changes in the recent years have increased concern of cardiac health from Malaysia as well as globally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have Borneo Benar's operations evolved over the years?</h4><p>Borneo Benar was established as a timber trading and manufacturing company by my father about 30 years ago. About 20 years ago, he had the opportunity to supply timber to the Maldives, which was experiencing rapid growth as a tourist destination. Being situated in the middle of the ocean, the Maldives faces a harsh environment. Airborne salinity is high, and there is moisture that needs to be dealt with as well. Malaysian hardwoods can and do stand the test of time in the Maldives, as they are the most durable and suitable for the area. Word spread about our timber, and from that onward, clients in the Maldives suggested constructing villas. We have been lucky to work with some major brands in the Maldives, like Shangri-La and Constance Group of Hotels. My father truly built up the brand within the Maldives and the region, and the company became known for providing quality products. Moreover, since we were associated with major brands, people approached us when they had plans for a high-end resort.</p><h4>How would you like to further develop Borneo Benar's international presence?</h4><p>We have been involved in projects in the Seychelles, Mauritius, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka and are looking at further expansions. The Maldives has been our primary market for the past 20 years but it may reach a point of saturation as the number of resorts has skyrocketed. At present, there is a shift happening toward the development of mega resorts, as opposed to one island one resort. There are man-made integrated islands now with shopping malls, marinas and conference halls. We are now looking to grow the business and expand into areas outside the Maldives. We have been in talks with some potential clients in the Pacific and have also been asked to consider opportunities in the Middle East. The Southeast Asian market is competitive, but we are aiming to participate in some of the upcoming tourist developments here in Sabah itself. Sabah has so much natural beauty to offer and has the potential to become a key player in the luxury tourism sector. We hope to be able to utilize our experience and expertise to contribute to the local industry here.</p><h4>How do you assess the contribution of Borneo Benar to the development of the timber and wood-based industry in Sabah?</h4><p>The fact that we are one of the few timber-based companies in Sabah that manufactures value-added products sets us apart. The majority of the timber companies here tends to focus on sawn timber. We are one of the few who have succeeded to get exposure to international clients and let them realize there are companies from Sabah with the capabilities to produce finished products.</p><h4>What needs to be done to further promote local production of value-added wood products and move away from timber exports?</h4><p>Support from the government is crucial, and the current government is doing a fantastic job. Borneo Benar is lucky in the sense that we are involved in and get to oversee the entire process from log to finished product, which is what our clients love about us. However, over the past few years, the local timber industry has encountered issues with log availability and it has been increasingly difficult to get hold of raw materials. The majority has been exported overseas, which has hampered the growth for some local timber players and made it impossible to survive for others. We need policies that prioritize local producers. The Chief Minister of Sabah is working on log export policy to protect the supply and ensure that local companies are able to fulfill their orders. There are many value-added processes that can and should be done here, and there is ample room to improve. Sabah has not promoted itself enough and has not tapped into its actual potential. There is room for so much growth, but it just needs a little bit of support and guidance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you introduce the history behind and vision underneath the Medini City master plan?</h4><p>Medini City is part of the comprehensive national agenda to grow Iskandar Malaysia. There are five flagship zones in Iskandar Malaysia, and Medini City is the central business district of one of the flagship zones, Iskandar Puteri, which was declared the 14th city in Malaysia in November 2017. Almost 80% of the components in Medini City are commercial property developments, and the remainder are residential developments and pockets of public parks. One of the important elements of Medini City is job creation, which will propel economic and population growth. Medini City consists of 2,230 acres of integrated township with the vision of creating a smart, green, and sustainable development. Medini City is strategically located, five minutes away from Singapore's Tuas immigration checkpoint. Medini City was launched in 2008 with the vision of becoming the icon of future city living and, in this pursuit, has come forward with many industry firsts. Together with that, Medini City has attracted many iconic projects such as LEGOLAND Malaysia, the first LEGOLAND theme park in Asia, and many other unique offerings not only provided by Medini Iskandar Malaysia but also by more than 10 active sub-developers who own lands and co-develop different parts of this city. MIM as well Medini City's sub-developers bring up this place at a faster pace in a collaborative and strategic manner. That, in a nutshell, is the vision of MIM.</p><h4>How do you encourage and incentivize investments?</h4><p>Investors who come to Medini City to lease or build facilities and whose activities fall within the scope of six promoted service sectors can enjoy a 10-year income tax exemption for these qualifying activities or a five-year full investment tax allowance. These promoted service sectors are tourism, healthcare, creative, financial and global business services, logistics, and education. In addition to this tax exemption scheme, knowledge workers residing within Iskandar Malaysia and working in qualifying activities within the five flagship zones are eligible for a 15% income tax rate, and they are eligible to import or purchase certain items duty free. In terms of real estate, there is no price cap for foreigners to purchase properties in Medini City, as opposed to other areas in Malaysia. Complementing the development within Medini City are the other catalytic projects located nearby such as EduCity, where their prestigious international universities such as Reading University, Newcastle University, Southampton University and a few more have attracted both foreign and local Malaysian students to receive best-in-class education at a fraction of the cost.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>It is not only about the hardware; the software is just as important. Two of the key elements are the culture and the lifestyle we want to create. As a master developer and planner, we bring together the communities to sustainable living through our events and activities. We have 22km of cycling paths, nature and sustainable living classes, and green markets held at the Edible Park. We want to share sustainable values, and we start from the young, which is why we engage with schools and colleges as well. Because we are a greenfield development, we have the opportunity to shape the city. The master plan was meticulously prepared more than 12 years ago, and what keeps us close to our development intent is the urban design guideline to ensure a systematic and organized development.  Nevertheless, as a master developer we continue to study trends and technology advancements to adopt and adapt. We are excited to see more developments, people, and companies moving into this place. In addition to LEGOLAND, visitors to Medini City can soon enjoy Sea Life, a large aquarium, and can go to Puteri Harbor to sail their yachts. They can enjoy the parks and the greenery. We feel privileged to create and shape a city that is distinctive, sustainable, and enjoyable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you give us a short introduction to the history of SAA and the evolution of operations?</h4><p>SAA was founded in 1975 as a government-linked company under the purview of Sabah's Ministry of Finance. The company's purpose was to provide air transportation to rural and other remote areas that were not accessible via the national airline, Malaysia Airlines. Today, we have a fleet consisting of 11 helicopters, two fixed-wing turboprop aircraft, and one fixed-wing jet aircraft. SAA's workforce comprises about 150 staff, with another 50 employees working at our subsidiary Sazma. SAA essentially does everything except transportation services to and from oil and gas rigs, which are carried out by Sazma. SAA's niche markets are the transportation of passengers and VIPs, aerial photography, medical evacuation, and air ambulance services. SAA has excellent facilities, including a large hangar and various workshops, such as our overhaul workshop. Our maintenance facilities and our Continuing Airworthiness Management and Safety Management Systems are both approved by the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM). Most of the work we do is for the government, though we seek to move away from our dependency on the government to diversify our operations.</p><h4>What areas of opportunity would you like to tap into going forward?</h4><p>In expanding our operations, we are particularly looking at two areas: aerial photography and air ambulance. For the latter, we need a partner that will provide the doctors while SAA can provide the transportation. We are in the process of acquiring three 19-seater fixed-wing aircraft that we aim to use for different purposes, such as aerial photography, transportation of goods and persons, and air ambulance services. We will also do couriering or postal express services with these planes. These are our plans for the next five years. In terms of aerial surveys in Malaysia, we have created a niche and have earned our reputation over the years. Moving forward, we want to build on that reputation and expand further, perhaps even into ASEAN if the opportunity arises. Our vision is to be the leading general aviation operator in ASEAN, and this is exactly how we are proceeding. We practice excellent corporate governance and uphold a high level of safety, while we work on continuous improvement of our strengths and reduction in our weaknesses. SAA also collaborates with other companies in areas where we do not have the capabilities, such as training. We do not want to spend too much money setting up systems for everything, so we do what we are capable of and cooperate with other specialists who provide in-house training for us at our own training school.</p><h4>How do you assess the ease of doing business in Sabah?</h4><p>Sabah is somewhat isolated from the rest of the world, so there are many things we have to do ourselves. This is the reason why we have our own school to train our people. Yet, geographically, we are also in a great position, given our proximity to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Australia. In addition, the tropical scenery is an attraction for tourists. We are relatively undeveloped compared to places like Bali, so there is room for expansion. In terms of aviation, we can offer competitive prices because local salaries are relatively low. There is still room for expansion and investment, though it is paramount that those involved in the aviation industry must have the capabilities and knowledge to run an aviation business. We need the right type of aircraft that is reliable and not likely to become obsolete because it will then become a burden with spare parts and after-sales service. This is my 50th year in the aviation industry, so I like to think I know what I am talking about. I am also a trainer myself, having set up the training school. Our strategy is to be conservative with expenditures, but never at the expensive of safety. </p>]]></richbody0content>
