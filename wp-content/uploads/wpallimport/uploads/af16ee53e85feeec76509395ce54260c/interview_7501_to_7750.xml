		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2014, President HE Ilham Aliyev decorated several employees of the Ganja Automobile Plant with medals. How important is the training and vocational development of company employees?</h4><p><span></span>The President has repeatedly spoken highly of Ganja Automobile Plant. He has praised the quality of the vehicles assembled by our enterprise and emphasized the role our enterprise is playing in the agricultural and industrial development of Azerbaijan. The Director of Ganja Automobile Plant PU, Kamran Gilman Nazarov, was awarded the Tereggi Order. In December 2014, we celebrated our 10th Anniversary of operations. The success we have achieved in these 10 years is the result of hard work. When we started operating in 2004, our plant had a team of only 80 people, and now 500 people work with us. Our professional team has contributed hugely to the plant and it individuals. We emphasized the role our company is playing in developing more experienced professionals to learn on the job. Then, they are transferred to assembly lines. Automobiles and tractors are changing rapidly, and it is important to keep abreast of the latest technological advances. To enhance the knowledge and skills of our staff, we send our specialists to other automotive plants around the world. Our engineers also visit the enterprises we cooperate with to allow an exchange of experience and knowledge. </p><h4>What models have been manufactured recently, and do you expect to produce any new models in Azerbaijan in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>The motto of the Ganja Automobile Plant is “Step by Step from Small to Large Volumes." We have been working hard since 2004 to live up to the attention and support of the President of Azerbaijan. We began by assembling VAZ 111113 OKA vehicles in a small workshop 10 years ago, and now we assemble six models of tractors, 10 models of MAZ trucks, and various units of agricultural hardware. This is made possible by three cutting-edge assembly lines, a painting site, a welding shop, and a mechanical workshop. In 2014, we signed a distribution contract with Russia, which envisages the assembly of KAMAZ trucks in Azerbaijan and their sale to third-party countries. Under the agreement signed, a new assembly line has already been installed at our plant. This will enable us to start the assembly of KAMAZ trucks in the near future. The document will provide Ganja Automobile Plant to expand the range of its hardware and equipment, as well as facilitate our sales both domestically and internationally. According to the agreement signed, we will continue the assembly of MTZ-622 and MTZ-422 mini-tractors, which we started in 2014, as well as begin manufacturing 10 MAZ truck and six tractor models.</p><h4>Who are the most notable customers of Ganja Automobile Plant and is there potential for expanding the customer base?</h4><p><span></span>Since the quality of our equipment complies with customer requirements, there is no problem with demand. The fact that we have service centers across the country is also helpful; every vehicle we sell is serviced at one of our centers within the warranty period. We are currently cooperating closely with AgroLeasing. Our plant manufactures tractors and other agricultural machinery for state orders and other agencies. Our customers include business people, farmers, district authorities, and municipalities. Strategic cooperation agreements with MTZ-Holding will further enable us to sell to third countries, thereby providing us with access to foreign markets. Our marketing department is currently working in this direction and exploring the markets of neighboring countries.</p><h4>In January, 2015 was declared the Year of Agriculture. What contribution is Ganja Automobile Plant making to the development of this sector?</h4><p><span></span>Our company largely manufactures agricultural machinery, with the exception of MAZ trucks. Ganja Automobile Plant is one of the largest manufacturing enterprises in the region. The agricultural machinery we manufacture in accordance with the agreement signed with AgroLeasing is available in all Azerbaijani regions. Our enterprise also provides maintenance of this machinery, which is important for our clients. In 2014, our company alone produced 1,265 tractors of different models and modifications, out of which 1,220 were handed over to AgroLeasing. Over this period, we have also assembled 942 units of suspended equipment and 17 tractors. In 2015, we plan to manufacture around 1,500 tractors, 1,000 units of suspended equipment, and 30 tractor-trailers. </p><h4>What opportunities do the inaugural European Games, which will be held this year, present for the development of the Ganja Automobile Plant and the automotive industry as a whole?</h4><p><span></span>The fact that the first European Games have been awarded to Azerbaijan is a great success of the country. Baku European Games Operation Committee has announced Nakhchivan Automobile Plant (NAP) as its official partner. This will certainly elevate domestic automotive industry to a new level. The inaugural European Games will contribute not only to the development of the automotive industry, but also to the establishment of a modern sport and tourism infrastructure. </p><h4>What are the goals and expectations of Ganja Automobile Plant in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Innovation and development are top priorities, and we constantly look for new opportunities and projects. There are other companies interested in cooperating with us. We intend to manufacture more than 1,500 tractors of different modifications, 1,000 units of suspended equipment, 30 tractor trailers, and more than 400 special purpose vehicles in 2015. We will also continue assembly of MTZ 422 and MTZ 622 mini-tractors and heavy-duty semitrailers. We will also continue to manufacture municipal machinery based on the trilateral agreement signed between Germany MTHaller, Minsk Automobile Plant, and Ganja Automobile Plant. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the global aluminum market affected the production of the company?</h4><p><span></span>The peak of the aluminum crisis has now passed, and recently prices of primary aluminum on the London Metal Exchange (LME) have increased by 10% or more. Global demand for aluminum is increasing annually by 6-8%. However, this indicator does not apply to all sectors. Major increases can be seen in the car-manufacturing sector, as well as in the construction and packaging industry. Aluminum is three times lighter than steel, and as a result, the automotive industry is increasing its use of aluminum in the process of car manufacturing. The use of lightweight aluminum increases the performance potential as well as efficiency levels. Lighter cars use less fuel and produce fewer harmful emissions. Without any doubt, this is a great export item on our list.</p><h4>What are the export plans of your holding, in terms of volumes, production, and geographical coverage?</h4><p><span></span>Today, we are exporting our products to Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Germany, Poland, Russia, and Belarus. Our evaluation of the export potential of Azerbaijan is high—every year the industrial capacity of the country is growing. Aluminum production is a good example of this growth.</p><h4>Due to the scale of its production, Det.Al Holding has turned from an aluminum complex into a full industrial center. What new production lines are you planning to introduce?</h4><p><span></span>Currently, our priorities are to create a full production cycle, enhance the mechanism of processing, and organize the extraction of the local alum stone in order to produce aluminum oxide, which until now the country has been importing from abroad at a high rate. Det.Al will increase its production and become a center with adjoining production enterprises that will form the main industrial zone of the Republic. Manufactured products are much more profitable than raw materials; the production cost of the product increases, but selling the end product is much more profitable for us. The difference between market price of metal raw materials and end product oscillates between $650-2,800, including expenditures. The difference is visible enough, and the final profit from the manufactured product is much higher.</p><h4>How does Det.Al currently cooperate with other companies to further its presence on an international level</h4><p><span></span>Aluminum, like petroleum, is sensitive to shifts in the global economy. The demand for aluminum keeps growing every year, demonstrating that it is the product of the future. Our holding is taking into consideration all current trends in manufacturing and for the realization of aluminum produce. For this, we are trying to participate in international forums on science, economics, and commerce. Today, Det.Al Holding is an indispensable part of the global aluminum industry. Det.AL AZE is an officially registered trademark, widely known all around the globe. We are collaborating with many international companies and financial institutions. This collaboration has a favorable impact on the enterprise's image as a global supplier of raw aluminum and aluminum products, and strengthens its trust in us as a partner. We are open to collaborations with all enterprises and companies that work according to modern principles of industrial and trade partnership.</p><h4>What are your plans for the development of the complex and its transition to the industrial center?</h4><p><span></span>The Det.Al aluminum complex will eventually turn into one of the best developed industrial centers in the region. Our main purpose is to organize aluminum production in Azerbaijan based solely on locally extracted raw materials, by introducing ecologically pure and economically sustainable technologies of aluminum extraction and alum stone processing. We have used local scientific potential and global economical experience, as well as the possibilities of leading scientific and research institutions in this sphere. Azerbaijan could become one of the leading suppliers of a wide range of aluminum products and we are capable of competing with other exporters. Det.Al Holding is the driving force behind this process, and we will use all our potential to improve the economic power of the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How successful has EVRASCON been in developing its corporate position and human capital, especially in recent years?</h4><p><span></span>EVRASCON is a dynamically developing company capable of performing a full range of complex construction works. The position of EVRASCON as a leading multi-functional construction company in Azerbaijan is determined by the colossal experience in the construction of bridges, tunnels, highways, hydro-technology, reclamation and marine facilities, industrial and civil installations, and power stations. </p><p><span></span>It operates a large fleet of machinery manufactured by the world's leading companies and has more than 1,000 units of specialized equipment The core of the company is made up of construction and design engineers with 25-40 years of experience and young talented individuals nurtured by them. The company's team consists of 5,800 highly qualified professionals, which enables it to implement operations of any level of complexity. The number of employees is evidence of a stable workforce and the full range of social guarantees for the staff.</p><h4>EVRASCON is the rebranded name of Azerkorpu. What were the reasons for the change, and how does it reflect your current strategy?</h4><p><span></span>The name emerged as a result of the rebranding of Azerkorpu in 2013. The new name is more consistent with the geography of the company, and reflects the rapid growth in demand for the company's services abroad. The company has been operating since 1968, and over the years it has undergone a number of structural changes. The Bridge Unit-100, established under the USSR's Ministry of Transport Construction in Baku, was transformed into Azerkorpu as a result of privatization in 2001. In essence, we have experienced an evolution of a state agency narrowly focused on the building of bridges into a multi-functional corporation. Over this relatively long period of activity, the company has accumulated considerable experience in the construction of various facilities both in Azerbaijan and abroad. Thanks to the high quality of work and the innovative solutions applied today, EVRASCON successfully competes with many foreign construction companies. </p><h4>Historically, what were some of EVRASCON's major projects, and what expertise allowed EVRASCON to continue these projects?</h4><p><span></span>A well-deserved reputation allowed EVRASCON to participate in projects funded by recognized international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the Saudi Fund for Development, the European Commission, and the TACIS program. Among of these Projects the Construction “Alat-Gazimahammad Highway", the “Khanarkh Canal" (phases 1 and 2), “Shamkir-Gazakh Highway Project",  and “Samur-Absheron Canal" (phases 1 and 2). In recent years EVRASCON was heavily involved in the “Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline Project", Baku-Supsa (Western Route Export Pipeline) Projects, the “Shah Deniz Gaz Export Project", “Astara Boat Basin Project", ports and mooring berths in the Caspian basin (Aktau, Kazakhstan, and Baku, Azerbaijan). Such International Quality Certificates  as  ISO 9001:2008, ISO 18001:2007 and OHSAS 14001:2004 were certified to EVRASCON by renowned Swiss company SGS. </p><h4>How successful were EVRASCON's domestic projects in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>In 2014, we carried out construction activities on a number of major sites. The most important projects were the Baku International Sea Trade Port in Alat;  highway bridge over the Kura in Shirvan on the Hajigabul-Goradiz highway; a railway bridge over the Kura in Poylu at KP 73 of the Tbilisi-Baku railway; two road bridges in Gazakh District;  highway bridge over the Kura in Salyan at KP 55 of the Alat-Astara highway; the Alat-Astara road at KP 31—54 and 55—80; and a bridge in Pirallahi. We continued the construction of Tovuzchay water reservoir and built shore-protection walls in Gabala District, as well as walls for the V-3 underground station and a tunnel flight. In addition, we worked on the reconstruction of the Absheron trunk canal, which was 73 km  long. Among  these facilities, the first phase of the Baku International Sea Trade Port in Alat and the following three sites were successfully commissioned in 2014. The construction of the other facilities is still underway.</p><p><span></span>One of the most significant projects implemented by EVRASCON for Irrigation and Water Management has been the construction of the Takhtakorpu waterworks, which is strategically important for the water supply of Baku, Sumgait and the Absheron Peninsula. The construction of hydro system and the power plant will enhance energy supply of surrounding districts.</p><p><span></span>A bridge across the Tovuz-chay river has been built on the bypass highway of Tovuz. The bridge has a modern design and is the highest bridge in Azerbaijan to date (34 meters high and 278 meters long). The authority of EVRASCON has allowed it the opportunity to expand the geography of its activities and implement a number of projects in Kazakhstan, Turkey, Ukraine, and other countries.,The corporation has built a pier and a breakwater as part of a project on the expansion of Aktau seaport to the north. The Aktau seaport is Kazakhstan's important strategic facility and the only competitive commercial seaport of the republic that meets all the requirements of maritime safety and vessel service.</p><p><span></span>Restoration of 40-km dams on the Lake Sarisu has been completed according to the resolution of  Cabinet of Ministers dated 2010, along with the construction of two bridges, the main facility and pipelines on the bed of the Araz river.</p><h4>Focusing on EVRASCON's foreign projects, what  were some of the advantages and challenges of managing such a wide portfolio?</h4><p><span></span>The foreign projects carried out by EVRASCON at the present time include the following: the construction of an underground station, Peredelkino, and a railway flight in Moscow; the A-2 Shimkent-Tashkent road at KP 774-806; the A-2 road at the border of the Republic of Uzbekistan (toward Tashkent)-Taraz-Almaty-Khorgos through Kokpek, Koktal and Bragoveshchensk with approaches to the border of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan at KM 774—806, which was 29.4 km in length. We have also worked on the reconstruction of the A-380 Guzar-Bukhara-Nukus-Beyneu at KM 315—335, and KM 335-355, both of which are 20 kilometers; and the R road Chisinau—Sculeni at KM 6+446.8 and 24+050 17.4 km in length. </p><p><span></span>As you know it is more difficult to build facilities abroad than at home. In order to successfully participate and win a tender, and then successfully complete a foreign project, you first need to become familiar with the market and building conditions of the region. Every foreign project is carried out on a turnkey basis on  design-construction basis. Therefore, each construction project involves a large team of design engineers. A striking example of this has been the long-term cooperation between EVRASCON and Gidrotransproyekt. We acquire and study the regulatory framework for the construction and design in each foreign country. Every construction project is then examined and approved by the state, after which a building permit is issued. The presence of the foreign affiliates of our company, the timely establishment of construction sites, sites and quarries of building materials are key to the successful implementation of dozens of projects in different countries. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of Holcim in meeting domestic demand for cement?</h4><p><span></span>In 2008, Holcim made a decision to improve the current production facilities and launched development of an up-to-date dry kiln line. Commencement of construction operations was approved the same year after the analysis of the feasibility project and expediency. Channeling $321 million into this project is one of the largest investments in the non-oil sector of Azerbaijan. The new technology upgraded 80% of the production unit. With the new dry kiln line, production capacity of the plant increased by 30%. I believe that 2012 was the starting point for a new era in the cement industry of the entire South Caucasus region. The changes enabled Holcim plant to be one of the most advanced and environmentally friendly in the whole of Europe. </p><h4>What are the new products and services presented for your customers?</h4><p><span></span>Holcim Azerbaijan holds a leading position in the market with the introduction of innovations as a result of the careful analysis of customer needs as well as the demand of the local market. In 2015, we have introduced a new bag product, Garadagh Expert Bag, to the market. Garadagh Expert cement is mainly used in production of extra-strong concrete for reinforced concrete structures as well as insulating and paving materials. Furthermore, we have launched Garadagh Solid Plus cement product. Construction companies encounter difficulties in the protection of concrete structures at places exposed to ground and seawater, as well as sulphates in salt medium. The solution for this problem is Garadagh Solid Plus cement, which is produced using a special process. We should state that this cement product provides high durability and strength, prevents erosion, and protects the internal integrity of the concrete. It carries the highest strength class as a sulphate resistant cement. The quality management system fully complying with ISO 9001:2008 standard is applied to the production process of Garadagh Solid Plus. </p><h4>Can you please provide further information about the Road Binders?</h4><p><span></span>In 2014, we have started to develop a new product in Azerbaijan, Road Binders. This is an innovative global product, which is directly related to the road construction industry. With our solutions, road binders will increase the load bearing and durability parameters of roads. And we are sure that the application of road binders in Azerbaijan will strengthen our roads and increase efficiency. Holcim brought technical professionalism and expertise for production of these products in Azerbaijan. Laboratory tests were conducted in cooperation with governmental institutes and show that we can increase our load-bearing ratio by 50%. At the same time, we have conducted on-site industrial trials with customers. It also reveals excellent results for enhancing load bearing. All these create an opportunity for Holcim Azerbaijan to have a competitive advantage and cooperate with our customers on a long-term basis. </p><h4>Apart from cement production and application, which social projects does Holcim Azerbaijan implement?</h4><p><span></span>From the start of operations in Azerbaijan, Holcim has been actively involved in social projects. According to our strategy, we are not only supporting the families of our colleagues, but also community members. Holcim has developed various educational institutions and cooperates with local organizations for sustainable development of the community around our operations. An example of successful CSR initiative of Holcim Azerbaijan includes the Employment Center. This was opened in 2011 with the aim of improving the socio-economic situation of the Sahil settlement inhabitants by enhancing the education level and increasing access to the labor market. We have conducted various workshops and training in cooperation with local organizations. At the Employment Center, we create opportunities to access the job market. More than 270 people were employed, 1,200 people took part in various types of training and 70 people benefited from state support programs. Another successful initiative is the newly established Youth Development Center, which is a key asset in the Umid settlement. It provides opportunities to learn, lead, and develop. At this Center, various seminars and workshops are conducted, including English language and computer courses, and leadership programs conducted for the first time in this community. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>In January, the President announced that 2015 would be the Year of Agriculture. What is the role of the ministry in supporting this initiative of the government?</h4><p><span></span>The Ministry of Agriculture is a coordinating body in the organization of the Year of Agriculture. The decision is a logical continuation in connection with the beginning of a new stage in agrarian reform in Azerbaijan. Strategic tasks in connection with the development of the agrarian sphere have already been identified by the President. The Ministry has now prepared a relevant plan of action to implement these ideas. </p><h4>In which spheres did agriculture see a greater growth in 2014, and in which segment are there more opportunities?</h4><p><span></span>Except for grain, the production of local agricultural products, especially fruits and vegetables, saw solid growth in 2014, which created abundance on the market. The amount of fruits and vegetables imported into the country dropped by 13.5% and amounted to $25.2 million in 2014. In natural terms, the amount of fruit imports dropped by 32.7% and vegetables, melons, and gourds by 47.3%. The role of local production has increased considerably in meeting the demand of the local market for agricultural produce. At the same time, the amount of fruit and vegetable exports, which form the basis of the country's agricultural exports, increased by 16.1% compared to the previous year and reached $291 million. Azerbaijan currently produces more than 50 types of fruits and vegetables. On the basis of evaluations carried out with World Bank experts, the comparative advantage of fruits and vegetables produced in our country is high. The country has enough export potential in this sphere. Fruits and vegetables form the basis of our agricultural exports. Cereals, such as wheat, barley, and maize, are produced only to meet domestic demand. Due to unfair competition that emerged as a result of subsidies in cotton growing in other countries, this sphere has become weak. We used to produce 400,000-500,000 tons of cotton per year; however, now this indicator has dropped to 40,000-50,000 tons. Animal husbandry, which is aimed mainly at meeting the demand of the domestic market, is also well developed in Azerbaijan. Cattle, sheep, and poultry breeding form the basis of this.</p><h4>The Ministry of Agriculture attended the 37th World Congress of Vine and Wine in Argentina in November 2014. What is the potential of the Azerbaijani winemaking industry for accessing new markets?<br></h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijani wineries currently export their products to 10 countries, predominantly in the CIS region, Russia, and Ukraine in particular. We are now focusing on diversifying our export market, because the potential is great. In the 1980s, there were more than 200,000ha of vine plantations in Azerbaijan, which produced more than 2 million tons of products. The 180 vine-processing factories that operated at the time manufactured more than 60 brands and 120 million deciliters of wine. Joints projects are being implemented with European companies in order to develop the spheres of vine growing and winemaking. New vine plantations are laid out and new factories working with the latest equipment. Over the past 10 years, the volume of vine production in the country has increased by 2.7 times, wine production by 2.5 times, and the volume of export by 2.8 times.</p><h4><br>Technological innovations throughout the world are an important growing part of agriculture. How well does Azerbaijan accept the need for technological achievements?</h4><p><span></span>The main focus is the intensification of production using modern technologies. The natural reserves and climatic conditions in our country are favorable for agriculture, but are limited in terms of the land available for cultivation and water reserves. For this reason, we are taking measures to expand production using intensive technologies. We import highly productive animal breeds from France, Germany, and other European countries. The intensive farming model has been identified as the priority task in the agrarian policy of the government. We have started creating agricultural parks that act as a new business technology used in the production of agrarian food products and that makes it possible to produce a large harvest in small areas. In addition, the application of modern technology in management is one of our top priorities. Thus, we have started developing “E-agriculture" system which is very important tool to increase the transparency and effectiveness. This system is among our priorities inline with the European experience. Seven modules of the system will cover the full automation of the system of land plots and farms, the receipt of requests for subsidies and payments and other requests. Apart from that, we have started a joint project with the World Bank, which is aimed to manage the sphere of animal husbandry in our country.</p><h4>Agriculture is a sphere that has the highest number of employees in Azerbaijan and is growing as a sector. How can the ministry continue to support those working in this field?</h4><p><span></span>About 37% of those working in the country are engaged in agriculture, and about 90% of agricultural products in Azerbaijan are produced by family farms. From this point of view, state support for manufacturers of agricultural products is of social importance. In 2014 alone, 150,000 manufacturers were given AZN20.1 million for sowing wheat and rice in the fall of 2013, while 384,000 manufacturers received AZN51.8 million in aid for the fuel and motor oil they used. The mechanism of offering adequate subsidies has been a top priority. The volume of discounts for the fertilizers selling to manufacturers of agricultural products this year increased from 50% to 70%. Also, a 40% discount was made in the initial cost of agricultural equipment leased or sold through leasing by JSC Aqrolizing. The state also supports manufacturers of agricultural products in the field of supplies with seeds. For example, all production expenses on original, elite, and super-elite seeds produced by scientific centers are currently covered by the state budget. In addition, farms receive subsidies for seeds and seedlings of the first and second reproduction sold by farms that produce seeds and seedlings. About AZN6.5 million were paid from the state budget in 2014.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the government's attempts to diversify the economy in the non-oil sector, especially its attempts to develop small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in agriculture?</h4><p><span></span>Despite the relative decline in oil production in the country, economic growth has been secured due to the development of the non-oil sector. The share of the non-oil sector in GDP increased from 50.3% in 2010 to 61% in 2014. Currently, the state has set up various institutions in order to develop SMEs. The National Fund to Support Entrepreneurship and the State Service for Agricultural Projects and Credit Management under the Ministry of Agriculture are issuing preferential loans to SMEs. On top of this, manufacturers of agricultural products are exempt from all taxes, except for the land tax, until January 1, 2019. The measures that are currently being taken to provide manufacturers, including SMEs, with seeds, increase technical support for this sphere and improve the breed of animals, as well as other measures that will lead to qualitative changes in agriculture. The measures that are being taken also aim to strengthen market principles in agriculture and create competitive manufacturers. One of the priority aims is to develop various economic forms in agriculture, including SMEs. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the current products that are manufactured and distributed by Ganja Sharab?</h4><p>Ganja Sharab-2 is one of the most recognized brands in Azerbaijan. After being privatized, the factory underwent complete overhaul and modernization, and there are no traces of the enterprise that was commissioned in 1984. We have been trying to apply the most advanced and successful practices available in the global wine making industry. We have built new workshops and sites, and even our own spirits factory. In addition, the company has 400ha of vineyards, which we use in the production of wines. The blessing for our vineyard came from our President Ilham Aliyev. When he visited our factory several years ago, we had just established the vineyard, and it only covered 150ha. On the recommendations of our Head of State, we have increased it to 400ha. Today, we produce and sell 40 types of wines, 27 types of vodka, and six types of cognac. Our products are sold both in domestic and foreign markets. Our company currently employs around 600 people, and their average salary is $380.</p><h4>What is the production capacity at Ganja Sharab, and how much can that increase in the coming years? </h4><p>The installation of state-of-the-art equipment in recent years has certainly contributed to increasing our capacity. Our company can currently produce 500,000 decaliters of wine and 300,000 decaliters of vodka a year. In next few years, we intend to further increase our production capacity by expanding the range of our products.</p><h4>Where are your main export markets, and what is the current customer base?</h4><p>In addition to selling our products in the local market, we also export a portion of our merchandise. In 2013, we sold 400,000 decaliters of wine, of which 200,000 decaliters was sold to the Russian Federation. In order to enhance the value of our products, we have participated in a number of international competitions, where our company received diplomas and medals. The most notable of our products are Chardonnay, Sevgilim, and Cabernet Sauvignon. These results of competitions have allowed us the opportunity to expand the geography of our export.</p><h4><br>What are some of the additional features of Ganja Sharab that makes it unique within the market?</h4><p>In order to ac<span style="background-color: initial;">hieve a worthy place on the market today, every company has to pay significant attention to the quality of its products. We attach great importance to that, and at the same time we are trying to ensure that our products meet the requirements of customers of all categories. Our surveys and observations show that the price of our products should correspond to the purchasing capacity of the population. It is no coincidence that we produce 40 different types of wines: the broader the assortment the broader the choice for the customer. This also applies to the price.</span></p><h4>How does Ganja Sharab work with local SMEs in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Our company sells about $23.75 million worth of wholesale products each year. This is a difficult process. The production of one type of wine requires, in addition to the main raw materials, 30 auxiliary materials. Ganja Sharab-2 works with local business on the basis of agreements. Cooperation with these companies is beneficial both to them and to us. We hold regular meetings with them to exchange views and address the arising concerns.</p><h4>The President announced 2015 the Year of Agriculture for Azerbaijan at the beginning of the year. In what way can the government's focus on agriculture support the development of both Ganja Sharab and the sector in general?</h4><p>The announcement that 2015 is the Year of Agriculture has delighted all of us; however, at the same time it has placed tremendous responsibility on our shoulders. It is no secret that the activity of Ganja Sharab-2 is directly linked to the situation in agriculture. It is beyond doubt that 2015 will be a watershed year for agriculture. The development of grain growing will have a positive impact on the production of ethyl alcohol. It will also accelerate development in the area of viticulture and, consequently, wine making. We have set ourselves the goal of increasing our vineyards to 500ha. I am sure that the government's attention to this sector will facilitate the development of viticulture and wine making</p><h4>Azerbaijan is renowned for the energy sector and is now in the international spotlight due to the upcoming First European Games in Baku. How can international events, such as this, support the development of the non-oil sector?</h4><p>The fact that the inaugural European Games will be held in Baku is an indication of the authority our country enjoys in the world. In addition to the President, the Goodwill Ambassador of UNESCO, MP Mehriban Aliyeva, is doing a tremendous job in this area. Such events make a great contribution to the development of the non-oil sector, as well as tourism and transport spheres. The steering wheel is in safe hands, and the leader of the country, Ilham Aliyev, is well known all over the world. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the biggest successes and projects for Atropatena in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>Atropatena is both a distribution and, over the last 7 years, an investment company. We started 3 projects in 2014, which are ongoing. We are setting up a dairy plant, a 3,000-head cattle station to ensure supplies of quality meat for the company's meat processing plant, and Fresco retail project. We are expanding in terms of our product range as well. One of the major highlights of 2014 was the contract that Atropatena signed with Danone. We will be producing Danone's products at our facilities. In a way, we are pioneers in producing global brands for Azerbaijan's market. 2014 was also the Year of Industry in Azerbaijan. The Ministry of Economy and Industry awarded us with a prize for our implementation of high technology and innovations in the agriculture sector.</p><h4>At the moment, what is the balance between the distribution and production side of your company?</h4><p><span></span>Any business starts with sales, and we are quite experienced in that area. We partner with about 10 TNCs, including Danone, Kimberly-Clark, Nestle, GlaxoSmithKline, Henkel, Schwarzkopf, and others. Once the market is deep enough, we start production. That is the case in each and every market segment we are operating in. At Atropatena we always consider the potential of each product. </p><h4>What is the potential for manufacturing elements to increase?</h4><p><span></span>We are in the early stages of our manufacturing business, as it has only been four years. The market is quite young and is still developing. For example, the share of the dairy products produced industrially is quite insignificant, and so there is great potential for it. On top of that, we are studying export options. We consider Russia, Kazakhstan, and Georgia, as well as some Arab countries as key potential markets. There are quite a few successful examples of Turkish dairy producers exporting their goods to Arab countries. Thus, we have prepared for further expansion and obtained various international quality certificates such as the ISO-22000 and BRC Global Standards. In 2014, we gained special Danone food safety certificates. The company's laboratory has also obtained international accreditation. Now, we are expanding our resource network to ensure the consistency of supply and to launch exports to neighboring countries. </p><h4>In terms of revenues for the future, how important are the investments to the dairy factory and cattle farm?</h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijan is encouraging the development of the non-oil economy. One of the alternatives is agriculture—the sector enjoys government support and has a great potential for growth. Development of agriculture is essential for replacing imports, and we are actively contributing to that with our distribution network and marketing support. </p><h4>With 2015 being the Year of Agriculture, in what way can Atropatena have an impact on the success of the sector? </h4><p><span></span>Naming 2015 the Year of Agriculture was not random as there is a great potential in this area. Atropatena runs the largest dairy plant in the country with a capacity of 250 tons of milk, which is a significant amount for Azerbaijan. On top of that, we have a large cattle farm. We have two major areas to develop. The first is creating feed supplies for the cattle, which is most likely to be our focus this year. The second area is developing small farms. Atropatena will transfer its knowledge and quality standards to small (30-100 head of cattle) Azerbaijani farms. It will allow us to manufacture high-quality products in line with our standards. Focusing on feed supplies, we are trying to get a plot of land and are preparing a project that will allow us to grow all the necessary feed supplies. It will, in turn, increase the capacities of production and reduce the costs of the dairy products. The average amount of milk a cow produces daily is 28 liters, and we aim to increase that to 33-35 liters. The leading producers in terms of efficiency are Israel (12 tons of milk per cow a year) and the USA (9-9.5 tons per year), the European average is 7 tons. Atropatena is between Europe and the US in terms of efficiency. </p><h4>The first European Games are coming up. In which ways can the games benefit Atropatena?</h4><p><span></span>It is a milestone event for the country, and we are all getting ready for it. Atropatena is launching a number of products dedicated to the Games. On the other hand, we are a distribution company and will provide distribution support. It is a mutually beneficial partnership. </p><h4>What are your main expectations and targets for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>It will not be an easy year, and we have been preparing for it. It will be necessary to be more productive this year. The devaluation is affecting purchasing power; however, it is also creating opportunities in the domestic market, as well as for exports. The cheaper the manat is, the cheaper our products are. Our goal is to grow in double digits and to maintain our leading position. Over the past few years, the manat was stable and we all got used to that. In 2014, we felt that the manat was overvalued and it was hard to develop our exports. It was quite noticeable when compared to other currencies, such as Georgian lari, Turkish lira, and Russian ruble. Thus, their exports were cheaper, and it was hard for us to compete with them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerbaijan has a notably young population. What challenges and opportunities does that provide for the Ministry of Education?</h4><p><span></span>Continued investment in education and healthcare has allowed us to nurture an independent minded, healthy, and creative youth that features prominently in every aspect of our development. The guiding principles of this investment are enshrined in Azerbaijan 2020: the Vision of the Future and the National Strategy on Development of Education in the Republic of Azerbaijan. The State Program on the education of Azerbaijani youth abroad in the years 2007-15 has enabled our brightest students to continue their education at leading institutions around the world. While instruction and learning have seen considerable development in recent years, the provision of affordable and equitable access to education remains a government priority. Another challenge is bridging this gap between the labor market and the current education system, which presents several challenges regarding the reform of content and the delivery of education. Considering the substantial investment being directed toward this, the adequate support systems need to be in place to continue this development. </p><h4>How can the First European Games contribute to the development of education in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>Baku European Games Operation Committee has undertaken important steps in order to ensure the smooth running of events and will recruit around 22,000 volunteers for this purpose. It is important to note that the majority of the recruits will be university students, which will get a chance to hone their skills and abilities along with their studies; an experience that will undoubtedly be valued highly by potential employers in the future.</p><h4>The State Program on education of Azerbaijan youth abroad in the years 2007-15 has become a significant feature of Azerbaijan's education policy. What new plans are being made for the next stage of this program? </h4><p><span></span>This program provides a unique opportunity for the most successful students to continue higher education at leading universities all over the world. As of today, the total number of scholarships awarded has been over 3,000, and there are more than 800 graduates. The main objective of the Program was to train professionals in the appropriate fields and provide our youth with the necessary skills to be a productive part of the rapidly developing economic environment. Our graduates have had successful careers in a variety of fields and have contributed to national development in a range of ways. They are in great demand in the private sector with their international experience and academic record, and the majority of the graduates currently hold leading positions in industry. The government has also created special mechanisms for State Program alumni in order to fast track them into civil service. We must use our experience to design tools to reach our objectives in the next stage. Azerbaijan 2020: Vision of the Future envisions the approval of a new State Program on the study of Azerbaijani youth abroad in the years 2015-20. Whereas the first State Program was regarded as a short to medium-term tool in meeting the immediate need for skilled cadres, the new stage presents wide ranging strategic goals and transformations. The new program will involve the exchange of academic staff in addition to the support of Azerbaijani youth studying abroad. It will contribute to the improvement of our educational system and the implementation of scientific research. Faculty staff will get a chance to enhance their skills and academic experience through training and the engagement of the foreign faculty in local higher educational institutions will help improve our universities. </p><h4>How would you assess opportunities for foreign students to study in Azerbaijan and opportunities to develop the current situation?</h4><p><span></span>Traditionally, the Oil Academy, Baku State University, Azerbaijan Construction and Architecture University, Nakhchivan State University, and Azerbaijan State University of Economics have attracted students from neighboring countries, mostly in the fields of energy, medicine, and oriental studies. Since regaining independence, we have worked to create new centers in order to appeal to a broader audience while maintaining interest in traditional fields. We promote a competitive environment in higher education in order to encourage research and teaching in various fields. The new generation of universities established include ADA University, which set a goal to prepare innovative global leaders and drive collaborative research on public and international affairs. The improvement of education of foreign students has always been at the center of attention. As a result of this policy, students of 72 countries have been granted a chance to study in Azerbaijan. The improvement of legislation in addition to joint action and cooperation between the Ministry of Education and universities make Azerbaijan an attractive destination for students. The participation of our universities in various exchange programs, such as the Erasmus+ has demonstrated an increased interest in Azerbaijani higher education institutions in recent years. We are building upon these positive trends in order to create a framework for an improved cooperation with foreign students in the long term.</p><h4><br>What opportunities do Azerbaijani students have to be involved in scientific study in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Scientific research plays a vital role in improving educational quality in higher education. Several recent legislative documents including Regulation on organization of the scientific-research activity of learners in higher education institutions and regulation on Students Scientific Community with the aim to coordinate this engagement, were implemented in the 2014-15 academic year. Higher education institutions in Azerbaijan have expanded their efforts to establish new scientific-research laboratories in addition to renovating outdated ones. Nanotechnology, biotechnology, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron microscopy laboratories, and other scientific-research laboratories now function in different centers. Many students and experts have received the opportunity to conduct scientific research—many have received international grants in order to update their equipment and infrastructure. Moreover, Students Scientific Communities aim to engage youth in research and encourage their active participation, through the organization of annual seminars, international and local conferences at different branches. These events assist students in obtaining presentation skills, and allow them to hone their research and contribute toward their theses and other academic work. Students and higher education institutions also cooperate closely with Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences (ANAS), which in turn facilitates the involvement of young researchers at its centers.</p><h4>How effective was the assistance of employment centers for Azerbaijani students in 2014 and what further steps can be taken in this direction?</h4><p><span></span>While we focus on education delivery, we must take pause to consider the future prospects of our graduates. Career and employment centers currently function in universities. One of the main objectives raises awareness among students and employers, and establishes durable links with both the public and the private sector. Recent events have seen representatives of leading companies presenting information on future employment opportunities and engaging with students early on in their academic and professional career. In fact, several companies have carried out selection of future employees among Bachelor's and Master's degree students during these meetings. We aim to establish appropriate departments for work with graduates in all higher education institutions in the future, in order to coordinate and streamline the active dialogue for meaningful study and employment. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Manchester United has collaborated with AFFA for some time and an official agreement was signed in September 2014. What are some of the details of this partnership, and how important was this in the development of football in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>This collaboration with Manchester United FC is of great importance to our Association. It provides us with a unique opportunity to train young talented players using the best practices of Manchester United FC and in accordance with European standards. In addition to the training sessions, selected young talents take regular English lessons. This type of cooperation and projects form the foundation from which players of the future emerge.</p><h4>In what ways has 2014 been a successful year for AFFA, especially in terms of fostering national interest in the sport?</h4><p><span></span>First of all, it should be mentioned that in September 2014 during the Euro 2020 Announcement Ceremony in Geneva, Baku was announced as one of the UEFA Euro 2020 Hosts. Our six months intense Baku 2020 Bid Book preparations resulted in this significant decision of UEFA Executive Committee. We hope that hosting this unique event in Baku will create an unforgettable experience for many young people, both in Baku and throughout the country. In May 2014, the International Football Volunteering Forum was organized in Baku. Volunteers are key to the long-term development of football. They provide services to support grassroots programs, club development, and the hosting of matches and events. The development and use of volunteers has increased significantly since AFFA launched its volunteering program in 2011. To increase fan numbers and encourage greater interaction, in September 2014 AFFA launched its official social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. The launch received much attention on both sport and non-sport media website. The social media accounts were promoted during the Azerbaijan versus Uzbekistan friendly match through banners on the pitch, perimeter boards, and promo-videos on the giant screen. Since their launch, official media accounts of AFFA have attracted thousands of followers.</p><h4>How successful has 2014 been in the development of youth football in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>In 2014, we launched U-10 Youth League (2014-15 season). This is an excellent sign of increasing participation in football in Azerbaijan. Our youth leagues now cover the age categories from U-10 to U-19. Youth leagues provide important organized football competitions for young people, enabling them to experience playing in a team. The creation of youth leagues also provides an opportunity for AFFA to monitor the number of players through their registration. This allows growth to be measured more effectively in relation to development plans. The number of youth teams required by licensed clubs has increased by 60% from four teams in 2004 to 10 teams in 2014. This clearly demonstrates AFFA's commitment and success in developing youth football across Azerbaijan.</p><h4>The inaugural European Games in Baku will take place in 2015. How significant is this event specifically for AFFA and football in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>This is an extremely significant event for our country. No major sporting event of this scale has been organized in Azerbaijan to date. It will have great influence on all kinds of sports. It is a great responsibility to organize such a large event in Baku. A number of buildings were constructed to facilitate the event. The National Stadium, with total capacity of 68,195, is the largest among them. This new multi-functional stadium exceeds international standards requirements for technical excellence. The stadium is being constructed to the highest design standards, including accessibility and sustainability. It is a part of a master plan for the area integrated with the city's public transport and highway system, with new high capacity access roads ensuring easy access for all event vehicles. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the latest developments taking place at the CMA?</h4><p>It is essential as a regulatory authority to continually review existing rules and regulations. Our intention is to protect investors in the capital market and policyholders, with regards to the insurance sector. We are members of IOSCO and IAIAS, the global regulatory bodies for capital markets and insurance respectively, and operate in compliance with their principles and requirements. We work hard to make sure players in both markets comply with the rules, regulations, and international best practices that we have adopted. We have been working to amend the capital market law, in particular Article 60, to facilitate investigation of any wrongdoing in the capital markets. We have amended a law on the basis of a signed MoU with IOSCO, whereby all members of IOSCO are required to provide any and all information upon request. Since the law was passed in November of 2014, it has allowed us to work on the internal regulation of sukuk. We have also been working on the takaful law, now in its final stage, which will ensure it is compliant with necessary requirements. Once the law is passed, we will additionally work on further related regulation, and we have already licensed two companies to operate in this area. In regard to SMEs, we are working to find a platform for these companies to assist them not only in raising funds for operations, but also to give them supervisory assurance and other support, thereby increasing their credibility, and ease of doing business with potential clients and third parties. We hope to integrate SMEs into the Muscat Securities Market (MSM), not merely as special or separate exchanges, and to create more activity. We have also been working to enhance and develop our corporate governance code, even though we were the first country in the Middle East to introduce a corporate governance code in 2002. We are now in the process of issuing a new code, which will be offered to the public for review. Once we receive feedback, we will endeavor to incorporate it into the code and introduce a new corporate governance code before the end of the year.</p><h4>Is there a mechanism in place to facilitate cooperation among GCC markets? What would better integrate regional markets?</h4><p>There is a mechanism in place today. The Supreme Council of the GCC has resolved to integrate the GCC market. A committee has been formed consisting of the presidents and CEOs of the capital regulators in the GCC, and we meet quite regularly to discuss the issues. We have been trying to unify and bring rules and regulations closer to each other in order to ease integration and collaboration. It is challenging, but working nonetheless, and we are moving slowly but steadily toward integration. The idea is not to create one exchange, but to build linkages between multiple exchanges to render the market more attractive, liquid, and accessible to investors in the region and internationally. We also need unified or similar regulations. Second, when it comes to operations, it is important to have proper infrastructure for these exchanges to integrate. I would say the currency is still hindering this integration. If you want to settle a transaction in Saudi Arabia for example, funds first need to be transferred from Omani to Saudi riyals through a banking transaction in Oman. Also, we need a central clearing house in the GCC. This will take some time, but progress is being made.</p><div class="quote">“My expectation for the capital markets and insurance sectors is for the markets to assume a fuller role in the economy."</div><h4>Looking internally, what is the mechanism in place for utilizing capital markets in funding economic projects in Oman?</h4><p>This is a vital issue, and indeed, one of the roles of the capital markets is to finance large economic projects. These kinds of projects are needed in Oman in order to grow and diversify the economy, to move away from a dependence on oil and gas, and to create jobs for Omanis. The main instrument to finance such projects is the capital market. We are not lacking financial liquidity, but we need people who can initiate projects. Funding from investors can be channeled through the capital market in order to finance these projects. This is the central role of the capital market, and is a key part of our strategy for the coming years—to focus intently on activating and enabling the capital market to play its natural role in the national economy.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the CMA for the coming year?</h4><p>My expectation for the capital markets and insurance sectors is for the markets to assume a fuller role in the economy. In terms of the total capitalization of the market we are talking about 30% of GDP. There is still considerable room for growth, although we will need to further activate the capital market in order to better serve the national economy. In the insurance sector, a major component is motor insurance, which is mandatory. We now need to encourage people to consider additional coverage for non-mandatory lines of insurance. Health insurance is a very promising sector, and currently growing at 35% per year. Life insurance, on the other hand, remains small and is growing relatively slowly. We need to make people more aware of the importance of life insurance and how savings work to their benefit. Having more people using and benefitting from insurance products will also add to the pool of insurance funds, and the capital will help finance a good portion of the economy. Overall, we are working to make sure the capital and insurance markets are credible, liquid, stable, and thus attractive.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of this year's Summit of the Americas for Panama?</h4><p>The Summit of the Americas that Panama hosted was of great importance, emphasizing the projection of the country's image as a meeting and convergence point between countries, promoting dialogue to resolve conflicts, thus contributing to greater unity in Latin America. From an economic point of view, preliminary estimates made by the directors of tourism organizations concluded that the private sector managed to generate over $100 million due to the entry of a large number of visitors, which positively impacted hotels, restaurants, trade, and transport activities, as well as other relevant sectors. In the political sphere, Panama became the stage for the resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and Cuba, with the presence of the presidents of both nations, thus ending a diplomatically silent of over 50 years, which had become an obstacle to wider unity in Latin America. The event also proved conducive to holding a number of meetings between different countries. The development of parallel forums in which we saw civil society and social actors, promoted mechanisms for consultation, dialogue, and exchange for the participation of civil society and social actors. The Youth Forum of the Americas allowed the youth of the region to actively participate in the process. In addition, the CEO Summit of the Americas allowed receiving important employers in the region, where trade and investment opportunities were analyzed in the Latin American region, of which our country is a very active part. As President of the National Coalition for Development, I welcome the fact that topics discussed at this summit coincide with the strategic objectives agreed by Panamanian society in 2007. These agreements were signed and still remain in place, including poverty reduction, sustained and balanced economic growth, geographically balanced and environmentally sustainable growth, and efficient, transparent, participatory, and democratic public institutions. The topics discussed at the Summit such as education, security, energy, the generation of investment aimed at improving the economic environment and market conditions of work, and thus job creation, are one of the main responsibilities of the Ministry of Labor and Workforce Development, which concerns me directly.</p><h4>What is the current state of development of the labor market in Panama?</h4><p>As a result of high economic growth (8% on average), all labor market indicators have been favorable. Around 96% of the workforce is busy, youth unemployment has decreased significantly, and so has informality, while we managed to increase female participation in the labor force. While the dynamism of the economy has decreased, there have not been drastic changes in the labor market, among other reasons, due to the ambitious investment program we pursue with both the government and the private sector. The sustainability of economic growth is a key factor to generate decent jobs and is a priority for the Ministry of Labor and Workforce Development, which I currently head. To achieve this, along with a policy of transparency in the management of resources, we plan to strengthen the human capital program, as a gap remains between available training and demand for skills by the productive sector. This affects the country's competitiveness and prevents the inclusion of a large segment of young people who have dropped out of the system and are embedded in the informal sector, many in conditions of vulnerability and insecurity. Another important task for this institution is to ensure that our workers enjoy better conditions in terms of security, access to adequate pay, and that their benefits are paid, as has been established in by Panamanian law. As part of a migration policy, we progress in a participatory manner in the design of mechanisms to allow for the orderly entry of foreigners into the country to fill the gaps left by the lack of training of local labor and that has become more evident in light of the significant national growth of the past decade. Both economic growth expected for the coming years, and the introduction of new processes and services and the establishment in the country of transnational corporations and high technology, will demand the hiring of highly skilled international workers, so it is necessary to adopt a strategy to facilitate the flow of immigration to meet this need without affecting productivity and economic growth.</p><h4>What role does the private sector play in the development of qualified and expert human resources in Panama?</h4><p>The private sector invests in schools in Panama, from pre-school to university. In fact, of the 30 existing universities in the country, only five are public. On the other hand, the private sector, by law, is part of the Board of INADEH and includes three representatives appointed by the Council of Private Enterprise, an institution tasked with approving all plans and programs of vocational training as well as other job skills programs. The development strategy of the Ministry of Education is to offer students an education that reflects the realities of the working world. The Ministry also works with multiple chambers to coordinate efforts and prepare students to work in certain sectors of the economy. Bilingual Panama is a running program that foresees the training of 10,000 English teachers in the country, again, meeting the demand of the private sector. On the other hand, in face of the difficulties businesses face to fill jobs, especially in the technical area, INADEH is heading to training programs based on the needs of the private sector and with its dual training program, which allows students the opportunity work experience at companies.</p><div class="quote">“As a result of high economic growth (8% on average), all labor market indicators have been favorable."</div><h4>What is the strategy of the government to retain talent in the country?</h4><p>The government is aware of the importance of retaining talented and skilled workers in the country to provide a quality service to the country and improve efficiency and effectiveness in governance. Some of the incentives offered by the government are regular training and exchange programs abroad for public officials to improve their professional background through masters or internships. A commitment of the institution is to assure the appointment and appropriate salary to their training. Many of these scholars are promoted, while others also participate in internships. There is also an administrative career that benefits a large number of officials, ensuring employment stability. Despite this, and the lack of qualified human resources in the country, many highly qualified employees move into the private sector where wages are higher and there are greater opportunities for promotion.</p><h4>What are the objectives of the Ministry and its top priorities for 2015?</h4><p>The goals of the Ministry of Labor in 2015 are framed both in its responsibilities and programs being developed. Among these are the following: the Pro Youth Program is expected to train 2,000 young people to insert them into the labor market. This will help improve the employability of this segment of the population—with the participation of INADEH, it is expected to develop a comprehensive training program designed to create the skills that the productive sector needs and increase productivity and competitiveness, while reducing the degree of informality in the labor market, which today stands at 38.3%, although it has declined from the 2005 figure of 46.6%. The number of inspections to ensure compliance with labor laws will increase by 10%. Meanwhile, we work on the immigration policy in order to respond to the need for specialized human resources, something the country still lacks. We should terminate the policy this year and finally modernize the facilities of the General Directorate of Employment and provide it with specialized human resources to ensure better care for visitors and better management.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Peru's healthcare sector has been underserved for many years. Clinica Delgado, your most recent project, is unique as it includes funding from several investors. Can you talk about what Group Auna represents for the sector in Peru?</h4><p>At Auna, we have more than 2,000 people who are really inspired and committed to working in a different way to make our vision a reality, i.e. transforming the healthcare experience in Peru. We are proud to have Delgado Clinic as our flagship, not only because it is our most important project, but also because it represents the essence of thought and philosophy of our founders and shareholders, who aspire to delivering higher quality healthcare services to Peruvian citizens. This means offering Peruvians the highest possible level of patient security, integrated processes, medical technology, and professionalism of medical doctors and clinical staff, all of these in a world class healthcare facility. These offerings exceed the standards we have seen in the country until now. For us, Delgado Clinic is a tipping point in the evolution of private healthcare services in Peru and it should stimulate competition and that is very good for Peruvian families. We have noticed that this is already happening, and some of our competitors have already invested in improving their facilities and are now claim to offer better services. We believe we have started a chain reaction in healthcare here in Peru. This in turn is leading to a transformation in relationships between hospitals and medical doctors, the interactions between insurance companies and healthcare providers, and the way in which the general population is being introduced to medical services.</p><h4>One of the topics of frequent discussion in our markets is access to capital, which is difficult for nearly every sector in an emerging market, but you found innovative solutions here. How did these investors influence the final outcome of the Clinica Delgado project?</h4><p>In a market in which there is a deficit of private health services, Auna has developed a value proposition for our patients that is attractive for different international stakeholders. The expectation of our international stakeholders has influenced Delgado Clinic in providing the patient and his family a world-class experience. As a result, this hospital was designed by Gresham, Smith &amp; Partners from Tampa and built by San Jose and JG, Spanish companies that specialize in hospital construction and engineering. Our technology is entirely state of the art. These standards also apply to our environmental impact. Our facility has been awarded a LEED HEALTHCARE certification, confirming its low environmental impact. We have paid close attention to the details, such as energy conserving windows.</p><div class="quote">“Delgado Clinic is a tipping point in the evolution of private healthcare services in Peru."</div><h4>Group Auna runs a successful Oncology program, Oncosalud. What impact has that business had on the sector in Peru, and on the quality of available cancer care?</h4><p>Oncosalud has 720,000 members in its pre-paid cancer program. We are the largest provider in the prepaid cancer service sector. This scale allows us to invest in scientific research, prevention centers, and clinics specializing in cancer treatment, as well as being a center to attract the best doctors and nurses in the country. Over these last 25 years, Oncosalud has developed a vast expertise in cancer protection, not just in terms of financial security, but also in medical coverage. We offer our affiliates early prevention programs and opportune treatment. We can proudly say that two out of three patients at Oncosalud go into remission, or are cured after five years. Over time, Oncosalud has come to set the benchmarks for quality in cancer prevention and private treatment in the country. We remain the market leader in cancer protection. Our strategy is to expand our coverage and services in the provinces, where there is still much work to be done.</p><h4>Only around 30% of the country's population lives in Lima. What are your plans to expand outside the capital?</h4><p>Auna's challenge is to develop an offer providing value healthcare to as many people as possible. Some provincial cities are growing rapidly, driven by mining, agriculture, retail, and tourism. Convinced that this represents an opportunity, we have developed clinics in Piura, Chiclayo, Trujillo, Arequipa, and Callao. There are cities near Lima that are demanding our services. These are areas that have seen impressive growth, and where people from around the country have been migrating for generations to find work in Lima's rapidly growing service industry. These new facilities will be modern, but different from Clinica Delgado, where we offer a one-stop-shopping experience. The other clinics will meet a demand for primary outpatient services. Our facilities network will focus on the mainstream sector, while internationally accredited Clinica Delgado targets a different high income and international patient sector. However, Auna intends to have province facilities services such as radiology linked and informed centrally from Clinica Delgado in Lima. This telemedicine will help to provide second opinions and maximize the use of our professional resources. This integration also comes via the shared Electronic Medical Record, another first for the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Tekfen is contracted to the construction of the Baku Olympic Stadium that is being constructed for the European Games. How did the company cope with the challenge of such a prestigious project?</h4><p><span></span>The project is completely different from any other, because when we first came to this area years ago, it was a dumping site for oily waters; all of the lakes were full of waste oil. We started in November, and the winter months made the work challenging. Improving soil condition, took a long time. In addition, the foundation was a massive job. The challenges occurred from the very beginning. When we started, we knew that we had to stick to our deadline, which was very strict because if we missed it, there would be no European Games. It was a stressful project, starting from nothing to creating a facility for 6,000 spectators in two years time. It is one of the first projects of its kind here, and is significantly different from the Istanbul Ataturk Stadium. We were a construction partner for that project also, whereas here we stand alone. </p><h4>Tekfen is also involved in two projects at Shah Deniz. What is the significance of your operations in the energy sector?</h4><p><span></span>Tekfen's main business in this sector involves industrial types of projects and pipelines. We created this part of our company about six years ago, and we have been named as a pipeline contractor for these types of projects. When we first came to Azerbaijan in 1994, we began building relations with SOCAR and became a part of many of their projects. Our existence in Azerbaijan starts from 1996 with the industrial types of projects. Then, projects at the ACG field came up, and we were involved at Sangachal there. After this, we were involved with the platforms for CWP, PCW, and COP. Now, we have two platforms combined with other offshore extension, which are important projects for Azerbaijan. Gas can be brought to markets in Europe because of these projects. We are happy to be a part of this, because we are part of Phase II of these projects. Platforms will help to bring more gas in from the sea, and the terminal will help to get that process fitted with a compressor. A compressor is part of the main facilities. We know this project well because we built up to the previous one. We would like to use our experience in knowing what the client is looking for. </p><h4>What kind of potential is there for new projects in the energy field in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>Everyone is talking about the Oil and Gas Processing Complex (OGPC), and we would like to be a part of that; it fits our experience. As a gas processing plant before that, there have been plans to build it up. I am sure it will happen in the near future; however, time runs quickly. If you are not able to get involved in the beginning, then you will miss opportunities. Those are the main areas that we are looking for in Azerbaijan, as well as working on the existing refineries, which may be another situation where we are in the picture. Tekfen is known as an industrial contractor; however, we have shown our civil capabilities through road contracting. We are involved as a road contractor in Qatar, and we constructed the longest highway in Turkey, which was a $2 billion project. We have experience with infrastructure and civil works in Azerbaijan, and Tekfen has shown our capabilities with the stadium and the SOCAR Tower, which is 95% completed. When you drive at night on the main road, you can see the lights on both the stadium and SOCAR Tower.</p><h4>Tekfen, as a pipeline contractor, has won a tender for Lot 3 of the Trans Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) project. What is the importance of being involved in that one in particular?</h4><p><span></span>We have many projects related to pipelines. The most recent of them was the OCP Slurry Pipeline. Tekfen built the largest part of this pipeline as part of OCP's contract. In Turkmenistan, there was also one constructed of a similar size. For 27 years, we have not built a pipeline in Turkey, and, as this is the very first time, I am telling my colleagues that we are backing a significant project. It is important for Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Europe. There are three lots in total. Lot 1 will be about 300km from the border, Lot 2 is also in the same area, and then we have Lot 3, which is our section, is about 509km away. It will be quite challenging and extensive. </p><h4>What is the balance between Turkish and Azerbaijani workers? </h4><p><span></span>When we started working in Azerbaijan in 1996, we worked together as an alliance with Azfen. When civil works came out, because of SOCAR, we decided that Azfen would carry the flag for industry and civil works. For other types of projects, we work together. Due to the fact that we have been here since 1996, we have really minimized the Turkish workers, because we have been involved in so many projects. Continuity has given us the advantage to train people and not lose them for the most part. Training is important for this sector, because qualified workers are a necessity. Trained people are part of the pool that we choose from for these project types. That means getting a smaller number of workers from the Turkish content, and a larger amount from the Azerbaijani pool for such an experience. One major project might have a really large pool; however, at the same time, when working on many projects, everybody is trying to use the same pool. We have aligned ourselves with SOCAR in Azerbaijan, and once we find out what the project requires and what requirements will be, we will do that. Each and every project has its own way of ticking, because there is always a challenge to meet time deadlines.</p><h4><br>What are the competitive adantages of Tekfen?</h4><p><span></span>If you compare the market to 2000, it is tough. Local companies are gaining experience in the market and bringing their own workforce; however, we have expertise in civil and industrial works. We share our know- how with our local company Azfen. Having Azfen is a huge advantage for us, and it was the most logical investment for Tekfen as it is a way into Azerbaijan. For the civil works, we are focusing on large sizes and fast tracks. Each client wants a fast track and with high quality. Cost-wise, we are a reasonable contractor. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can an increase of international events facilitate the attraction of FDI? </h4><p><span></span>Every year, we organize various international business and investment forums, sporting events, music contests, and international trade exhibitions. In a competitive world, these events are an important way to raise the profile and awareness of Azerbaijan amongst key business decision makers. The portfolio of events to be held in Azerbaijan shows that our country has the necessary attributes to attract FDI in non-oil sectors. Our hosting of the World Economic Forum 2013 in Baku is evidence of our sincerity to offer an attractive business environment. Although we are a young country with only 24 years of independence, the hosting of the first European Games will put Azerbaijan in the exclusive company of countries that have hosted a complex event such as the Olympics. Additionally, the forthcoming Asian Development Bank AGM in May 2015 will be held in Baku, with 3,000 key decision makers from business, government, and international organizations. For many, it will be their first time in Azerbaijan , and I am convinced they will leave Baku with a better understanding of what Azerbaijan has to offer, and reduce their perception of the risks of investing. Our country recognizes that investors have a choice when they are investing and our international events will show to the investor that Azerbaijan is the right choice for them.</p><h4><span></span>What opportunities for international investment have the First European Games provided, and how has AZPROMO contributed to this?</h4><p><span></span>The Games have provided opportunities for international business to expand into new markets, and demonstrate their products and services using the stage of Baku to broadcast to the whole of Europe. In particular, significant business opportunities have been provided in construction, infrastructure, tourism, services, and many other areas.  Foreign investors working with Azerbaijani companies and people have created impressive venues around the country for the long-term benefit of the country. In 2014, the value of these foreign investment opportunities was $11 billion. Like previous international events, we expect the Baku Games to generate an increased awareness of the non-oil investment and trade opportunities available in our country. Whenever I travel overseas, I tell my fellow business travellers that Azerbaijan was at the center of the Silk Road, and was where the Nobel brothers made their fortune that funded the Nobel Prizes. AZPROMO is ready to help these opportunities become a reality, by providing authoritative information, advice on company establishment, and matchmaking to domestic investment projects. </p><h4><span></span>Which sectors of the economy have been the most lucrative for investment and export in 2015, and where is there the greatest potential in the medium term?</h4><p><span></span>Economic diversification is an important goal for Azerbaijan. Two decades ago, oil and gas was the dominant industry and the most lucrative sector. Today, we have made progress to re-balance our economy. With a 61% share in GDP and average annual growth of 7% to 10%, the non-oil sector has become a driving force of economic development. In recent years, the GDP contributed by the communication services has increased eight-fold, industry has almost tripled, and agriculture has grown by one and a half times. As our economy diversifies, opportunities in agriculture, food processing, machinery, and chemical industries can increase while new technologies, such as pharmaceuticals, IT, space industry, and nanotechnologies have also developed. The construction sector has boomed in recent years, especially in the production of construction materials. The metallurgy industry in Azerbaijan is also being established and new production facilities have been developed with the focus on end product. The services sectors, where a large part of foreign investments have accumulated, have been growing in recent years including in communications, transport, banking, insurance, tourism, and healthcare. Sumgait Chemical Industrial Park (SCIP), Balakhani Eco-Industrial Park, and High Technologies Park provide opportunities for state-of-the-art investment in mentioned sectors of economy. As for exports, 2014 was successful in terms of promoting non-oil exports and discovering new markets. Traditional groups of products for Azerbaijan, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, processed foods, and beverages, as well as chemical and metal products, and articles of light and heavy industries, have huge export potential; for example, exports of fruits and vegetables in 2014 increased by over 16%, chemical products by 33%, plastic products by almost 29%. </p><h4><span></span>How important are foreign offices and partnerships to AZPROMO's strategy?</h4><p><span></span>In order to achieve our goals, we established a network of representative offices in foreign countries, such as Georgia, Austria, Germany, US, the UAE, and the UK. Our representatives have the spirit of the Azerbaijan office of AZPROMO. They are working hard to create a network between foreign and Azerbaijani companies that is undeniably important in business today. Representative offices are providing us with all the necessary new events and opportunities, which allows us to reach many countries with efficiency. For example, our US representatives actively participated in business events and exhibitions in Washington DC, Chicago, Las Vegas, and other cities during 2014. This shows the important role our representative offices play for us in accomplishing our company's goals. We have also a network of 71 partners, including investment and export promotion agencies, chambers of commerce, international organizations, and public institutions from 36 countries. In 2014, we signed 15 MoUs with institutions from different countries. We closely cooperate with investment promotion agencies through the World Association of Investment Promotion Agencies (WAIPA)—where we hold the Vice-Presidency—gathering together over 250 national and sub-national agencies from 162 different countries. In terms of the practical implications of these partnerships, these are important in promoting Azerbaijan's export and investment opportunities. We continuously share experience with our partners in trade and investment promotion, and exchange information on trade and investment. This is important for the understanding of our export and investment potential and the analysis of foreign markets, the organization of various important promotional events, the capacity to find new partners for Azerbaijani companies, to help them to enter foreign markets, and to address any issues. We actively disseminate information on Azerbaijani products to potential buyers and distributors through our partners' network and invite international companies to invest in the non-oil sector of our economy. </p><h4><span></span>AZPROMO has been involved in a number of forums and training events both in Azerbaijan and internationally in 2014. How have these events supported AZPROMO's current objectives?</h4><p><span></span>One of the many different mechanisms we employ to increase FDI inflow and stimulate export capacity is the organization of various events such as business forums, B2B meetings, round tables, and road shows, which offer a prominent platform for business to internationalize, promote investment and trade opportunities, establish new contacts, and cooperate with foreign partners. In 2014 alone, we organized 321 meetings and events in Azerbaijan and abroad. Our business forums with traditional trading partners have helped Azerbaijani companies to increase their presence in these markets. To help local producers explore new markets, AZPROMO organized business forums with such countries as France, Montenegro, Vietnam, Cambodia, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, Malaysia, Canada, the UK, Lithuania, Poland, and Hungary. In addition, our goods were presented at the international exhibitions in nine countries including Germany, the UK, US, and China. At the same time, AZPROMO pays a great deal of attention to education and training, organizing numerous workshops, and trainings on related topics throughout the country in the last year. All of this was supported by market research and free-of-charge services to local and international companies. As a matter of fact, we see excellent results reflected in the figures. Around $11 billion was invested in 2014 in the Azerbaijani economy from abroad. Our exports to new markets, such as Spain, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Afghanistan, Switzerland, Canada, Malaysia, Tunisia, Singapore, and many others increased significantly over 2014. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What benefits will the first European Games provide for Azerbaijan in both economic and social terms?</h4><p>The first European Games will bring new experiences, advanced technologies, know-how, and innovative ideas, as well as improved benchmarks for future development. The standards achieved will have to supersede previous ones to meet more sophisticated requirements in the future. To maintain sustainability, new investments will have to be allocated in partnership with the private sector. These projects will also give birth to new spin-offs in other sectors and create numerous jobs. The country will offer world-class venues and services to host international events. According to a recent study by a UK-based construction consultancy firm, projects with clearly defined objectives and performance requirements contribute to universal economic and social benefits.</p><h4>What have been some of the most important achievements for AIC in 2014? </h4><p><span></span>With the overall value of our projects currently standing at over $1.1 billion, the integration of new technologies, modernization, innovation, and competitiveness, as well as the development of the capital markets, are among AIC's priority objectives. Overall, 2014 has been particularly good for AIC. Baku Shipyard, a half billion-dollar project, jointly owned by SOCAR, AIC, and Keppel Offshore and Marine, has evolved into the largest and most advanced facility of its kind in the Caspian Sea Basin, with three multi-million-dollar contracts secured since its inauguration in 2013. Under these contracts, with a total value circa $450 million, the shipyard is undertaking the construction of two floating pontoons, a subsea construction vessel, and three 80-seat crew vessels. Another project is with Holcim (Azerbaijan), which produces high quality clinker and cement that is widely used in large-scale construction works and the implementation of energy projects. A standout investment outside of the non-oil industry we have made is with Saba Group. It is involved in all stages of food manufacturing and processing, from production of raw ingredients to the delivery of finished products. It is one of the major poultry products suppliers currently producing over 13,000 tons of poultry per year and 150 tons of dairy products on a daily basis. Well over 1,000 people work for Saba Group companies across the country. AIC's investment of approximately $15 million has helped the company to diversify its production, and expand into a new area of operations. Saba Group recently acquired 4,800 hectares of land, and launched Garabagh Wheat Ltd, the first privately owned pilot cereal crops company in the country. By using the most advanced PIVOT-irrigation system, it has reduced its water consumption and achieved successful harvesting of wheat and corn with average yields of 5.3-5.5 tons per hectare and over 10 tons per hectare, respectively.</p><h4>The majority of FDI is still focused on Azerbaijan's energy sector. Which areas of Azerbaijan's non-oil sector have the most investment potential in 2015? </h4><p>The project Azerbaijan 2020: Vision into the Future sets out some strategic targets including to double GDP per capita to $13,000 (in 2013 it was $7,912), and increase non-oil exports to $1,000 per capita (in 2013 the figure was $200) by 2020. The project also aims to achieve higher standards of living and lower poverty levels through government investment in education, healthcare and cultural, and social institutions. The growth rate of the non-oil sector was 7% in 2014 and made up 61% of GDP. It is also quickly gathering momentum in terms of attracting investment. We welcome international businesses and have established a liberal investment climate with few restrictions. Azerbaijan is a party to major international investment agreements and has signed 47 bilateral investment treaties and 44 double taxation treaties. Over $172 billion has been invested in Azerbaijan in the last 10 years, nearly $84 billion of which constitute FDI. The FDI share in the non-oil sector has exceeded $35 billion, with the bulk of overall FDI placed within the industry sector making up 56.2% ($4.133 billion), followed by construction and production of construction materials on 15.7% ($1.15 billion), services on 13.1% ($963 million), and transport on 9.7% ($716 million). AIC has prioritized areas that coincide with sectors targeted by the government. Non-oil industry, agriculture, tourism, logistics, and ICT are among the most promising sectors of the economy.</p><h4>In what ways has AIC contributed to the Year of Industry in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Since October 2014, AIC has organized and managed the operations of industrial estates, and designated industrial compounds where SMEs are provided with the necessary opportunities and infrastructure to produce goods and services. On December 15th, AIC signed an MoU with the US-based SouthWest NanoTechnologies, Inc. (SWeNT), to start a long-term cooperation in the mass production of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) in Azerbaijan. The project will be located at Sumgait Chemical Industrial Park and initial production scale is expected to be 1,000 tons per year of CNTs, starting in 2016. CNTs are advanced, stable, nanomaterials that can enable groundbreaking new applications in a range of materials and devices. We are also in talks over a pharmaceuticals production project, which will be a completely new industry for Azerbaijan.</p><h4>With the 2015-20 State Program on Industrial Development of the Azerbaijan Republic having now been endorsed by the President, what new opportunities are emerging? </h4><p>One of the priorities set in the State Program is the expansion of a competitive heavy industry utilizing domestic raw materials. In recent years, sufficient cement output has been achieved to cover domestic consumption using locally sourced raw materials. It is also necessary to allocate advanced-technology driven production, especially in the development of base materials in the metallurgy and petrochemical industries. Moreover, the development of metallurgy will improve the raw material supply to the newly established shipbuilding industry, improve competitiveness, and create a suitable environment for the development of the engineering industry. New production facilities in the chemical industry, metallurgy, machinery and equipment manufacturing, and alternative and renewable energy paraphernalia are now gaining momentum. The establishment of new high-tech facilities has also been prioritized with new opportunities for the expansion of electronic equipment manufacturing being carefully considered. High-tech industries require an extensive R&amp;D platform, and we are concentrating on a limited number of businesses specializing in this. The development of industrial demand is in a transition period from the import-substitution industrialization strategy to export promotion. The production supplying local demand is lacking the capacity to reduce the cost, and there is an unattainability of long-term high growth rates in the domestic demand. Industrial diversification requires the establishment of new alternative production capacities, alongside some conventional industries. The development of the necessary infrastructure facilities for supply and storage of agricultural products is seen as a potentially beneficial area for investments. Additionally, an increasing number of areas in the services sector are promising in terms of the availability of resources and infrastructure. Construction of a new international sea trade port is to become the largest seaport facility in the Caspian basin, and sets a potent showcase for further investments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2014, Synergy Group launched its restructuring process. Could you please explain the reason of this restructuring and its expected outcome? </h4><p><span></span>Synergy Group was established in 2010 and is one of fastest growing investment holding groups in Azerbaijan with a portfolio of 28 companies. Within a short period of time, we have provided employment to over 1,500 people, not to mention our suppliers and key stakeholders benefiting from cooperation with Synergy Group. Our portfolio mainly covers businesses such as construction and construction related-products and manufacturing, ICT, agriculture, and hospitality management. We actively encourage young and talented people to join our team, because we believe that our people are the core of our success. Therefore, all key top and mid-level managers are involved in the restructuring process. Furthermore, we have been closely collaborating with PwC, which has brought its international experts to assist our team. The purpose of restructuring is twofold. First, we are keen to finalize our long-term investment strategy. Second, we aim to improve further operational efficiency of our subsidiary companies. Such an approach comprises a few consistent steps that are of great importance in most restructuring cases. As a first step, the top management defined the goals and expectations of shareholders on the group's long-term development. We then carried out a thorough analysis of our portfolio businesses, including their key financial indicators, corporate governance system, organizational structure and further business development opportunities. The final step is the identification of the main investment opportunities and the development of investment strategy, which is underway. The stages of business diagnosis mentioned above may go in parallel and save time for shareholders and top management. We do hope that the successful completion of restructuring will pave the way for further growth of Synergy Group in terms of financial capital and revenues, which in turn means more employment opportunities for people and increased revenues for the state budget.   </p><h4>What are the key priorities of Synergy Group, and how will the new investment strategy influence Group's CSR policy?</h4><p><span></span>The constant improvement of our businesses' operational efficiency, quality of human resources and financial capital, as well as the search for additional investment opportunities in Azerbaijani economy are amongst our top priorities. Synergy Group remains committed to its current CSR policy aimed at supporting education and sport. It is committed to the “For a Sustainable Future" slogan. We believe that investment in education and sport is the best investment we can make for the future development of Azerbaijan. Since the establishment in 2010, our Group has developed a solid CSR policy and implemented various social projects in Azerbaijan and abroad. Education is one of the priorities of our CSR policy. By supporting Azerbaijan University, we contribute for the intellectual development of young people. Synergy Group is also a main sponsor of the popular TV Project “Parlag Zeka," which provides opportunities to talented young people to pursue their education abroad. We have also promoted sport activities by supporting the international cycling tournament Tour d'Azerbaijan since 2013. At the same time, Synergy Group is a general sponsor of the first professional cycling team Synergy Baku Cycling Project. Furthermore, in 2014 and 2015 Synergy Group organized an international chess tournament in Shamkir dedicated to the memory of national grand master Vugar Gashimov, which gathered together top grand masters, including current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. The work and success of Shamkir Chess 2015 was even larger. We have enlarged our audience on the European, Asian, and American continents; thus, brought Azerbaijan to the core attention of the world's chess community and provided further opportunities for the development of chess in our country. Our activities in social spheres are also highly assessed by our counterparts. Synergy Group has recently received AMCHAM CSR Excellence Award for its contribution to the development of regions in Azerbaijan.  </p><h4>The Year of Industry was in 2014, and industry plays a major role in Synergy Group's strategy. What are the major progress and achievements?</h4><p><span></span>HE Ilham Aliyev declared 2014 the Year of Industry. Therefore, in 2014, Synergy Group carried out further investments into this sector, especially the production of construction materials. Azerbaijan Fibro Cement (AFC) is a green field investment of Synergy Group. AFC will bring new European standards to the construction sector. Fiber cement is a robust, environmentally friendly material, which took its beginning in the banning of asbestos materials in Europe in 1980s. The project will produce fiber cement flat and corrugated sheets. Flat sheets have excellent technical properties. It is ideal to be used as façade cladding material, since fiber cement flat sheets are graded Class A in regard to fire, moisture, and frost resistance. Corrugated sheets, or roof sheets, are an ideal substitution to asbestos roofing panels. While, asbestos is proven to be carcinogenic, fiber cement roof panels are totally free from any harm, thanks to natural ingredients. AFC will be equipped with state-of-the-art technology and is unique. In early 2015, we made a decision to build the factory in Sumgait Chemical Industrial Park (SCIP). This is long-term strategic decision, which will lead AFC to produce competitive products and serve the region's markets as well. Here, we have to underline the government's accurate economical vision to support non-oil sector, because industrial zones such as Sumgait CIP is one of the most successful economical models in Azerbaijan. In addition, in 2014, Synergy Group launched the modernization of Zayam Technologies Park (ZTP), which is based in Shamkir and is already equipped with cutting-end technologies. The development plan of ZTP has been divided into three phases. The first phase has already been completed and it comprises manufacturing of modern greenhouse structures and systems. Our goal is to contribute to increasing the productiveness and profitability of greenhouses. The second phase is in construction and will be completed by the end of 2015. We will be able to produce soil tillage, seed drills, fertilizer spreaders, boilers, and high-pressure receiver tanks. ZTP is aiming to be a regional leader in design and manufacturing of agricultural equipment. The final phase is production of different types of heavy steel structures for civil and industrial projects, which we expect to finalize by the 1Q2016. Manufacturing capacity ZTP will be enough to provide high-quality products to Azerbaijani market, as well as export to the neighboring countries.</p><h4>Agriculture has exciting potential in the development of Azerbaijan's non-oil sector and it has been decided that 2015 will be the Year of Agriculture. What role will Synergy Group, with its companies Caspian Coast and Azagro, play in supporting this government initiative?</h4><p><span></span>In agro business, Azagro is cultivating the finest ranges of Dutch roses. Located in Shamkir city, Azagro greenhouse complex is the largest enterprise combining cutting edge technology in soil free conditions, fully automated, and run under computerized control. This technology and know-how enables us to cultivate fresh cut roses in all seasons. Currently, the portfolio is composed of 13 types of roses, in which 10 of them are widely distributed in the market and other three are in the testing phase. Distribution in the Azerbaijani market is carried out through the SBuket brand name. In 2010, we modernized the existing facilities of Caspian Coast Winery and Vineyards based in Siyazan. This technology enables the meeting of worldwide standards for assurance of high quality products. We started planting grapes in 2011 and assortments were selected based on the needs of the market and the local climate, indigenous and European technical grades. I am delighted to note that in 2013, we reaped the first harvest from our vineyards. Known for its finest and most authentic Azerbaijani wine brands, currently we produce more than 20 wine products. Furthermore, the previous year we were successful in launching three cognac varieties. We can proudly say that Synergy Group agro business products are recognized positively in Azerbaijan and in neighboring markets. </p><h4>Synergy Group is relatively new in Azerbaijan's business environment. What is your expectation from 2015, the fifth anniversary of the Group? </h4><p><span></span>Despite being a new investment holding, we have achieved positive business records. Currently, Synergy Group is composed of 28 companies operating in various sectors of the economy. While celebrating our fifth Anniversary, we aim to finalize many ongoing business projects, as well as look for new opportunities in channeling further investments. Our country is full of potential with business development, and we will be able to receive the fruits of our strategy. Thus, the current situation will enable us to bring more financial returns and support governmental programs for the diversification of economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AtaHolding has always had a specific focus on the development of sport. With the First European Games approaching, what preparations and developments have AtaHolding made for the event?</h4><p><span></span>This competition is in the spotlight of not only the continent but of the entire global community. Hosting such a memorable event will bring recognition to Azerbaijan and embed our capital city in many peoples' memories. Baku will always be remembered and associated with the European Games, just like Athens is associated with all Summer Olympics. In December 2012, the 41st General Assembly of the European Olympics Committee in Rome held a vote where 38 out of 48 participants voted for our country. This means that the majority of European countries have a strong belief in Azerbaijan and rely on us to deliver an outstanding performance. In relation to the European Games, a significant share of responsibility falls on AtaHolding, an institution that has always supported the development of sports, sponsoring international federations, and international competitions. Currently, AtaHolding is the main sponsor of the International Federation of Wrestling, and one of the sponsors for the International Hockey Federation. Distinguished athletes from our holding's sports club, AtaSport, will also join Baku 2015, and we hope that they will properly appreciate the attention afforded to them by the government and deliver outstanding performances. In addition to continuously supporting the competitions, we will always stand beside our athletes and provide any support for them to gain victories.</p><h4>Once the First European Games are finished, what are the long-term opportunities that AtaHolding can benefit from?</h4><p><span></span>The European Games will bring Azerbaijan global recognition, foster the development of tourism, and is an opportunity to demonstrate Azerbaijan's culture and history, as well as inform the global community about the Karabakh conflict. The long-term benefits of the event for our country will positively affect AtaHolding's activities as well. Every company operates in a certain environment, which can in turn be divided into an external and an internal environment. While the internal environment mainly depends on factors under the company's control, the external environment is different. The external environment is affected by a number of factors, which are beyond the control of even the strongest companies. Successful political measures implemented by our President Ilham Aliyev will have a positive long-term impact on every private entity's operations, including AtaHolding. When it comes to particular business achievements, we see this project as a major opportunity to expand the tourism capacity of Azerbaijan. We, in turn, are supporting the establishment of necessary infrastructure to reach this goal, and hope that the tourists who are expected to visit the country will benefit from our company's services.</p><h4>Shamkir Poultry represents AtaHolding's current interest in agriculture, a sector that is an increasingly important contributor to national GDP. What further opportunities will the national focus on agriculture provide for AtaHolding?</h4><p><span></span>The government's special focus on the development of the non-oil sector, in particular the agricultural sector, has resulted in rapid and intensive development. In addition, one of the factors supporting rapid development and growth of the sector is almost full tax exemption of the agrarian sector enterprises. It was announced that 2015 will be the Year of Agriculture, which will greatly benefit and trigger development in the non-oil sector. With the view of all the aforementioned factors, it is not hard to foresee significant successes and achievements in the agricultural sector in the near future. AtaHolding has a great responsibility in relation to the development of the agricultural sector. As an investment company, we are prepared to invest in segments of the economy to foster its growth. Looking at Shamkir Poultry in particular, the farm started operating in the early 1970s. In 2005, the plant was reconstructed, and at the time became one of the largest projects implemented in Azerbaijan. The plant specializes mainly in egg production and received a $5 million investment at the initial stage. In 2012, the plant received a second stage investment of around $11 million. As a result, the plant's production capacity increased by 6-7 times. Currently, Shamkir Poultry plant is providing around 10% of the country's egg production and almost fully meets egg demand of the west and northwest regions, where it is located.</p><h4>The Excelsior Hotel is AtaHolding's major investment in the five-star hotel industry. How would you assess the impact of increasing competition in the five-star sector?</h4><p><span></span>Excelsior Hotel Baku is one of the most admirable and attractive hotels of the capital, which has gained great affection by visitors to Baku. The hotel is providing various services, and high-level facilities to leave positive impressions and feelings in the memories of its guests and ensure that they return in the future. Growing demand for five-star hotels in Azerbaijan is an indicator of the potential for investment flow and tourism potential, which is a good sign for us. We are proud that Excelsior Hotel Baku was the first five-star hotel to open in Azerbaijan and has significantly contributed to the development of the hotel industry. The hotel's high-quality services demonstrate to the world that service standards in Azerbaijan are consistent with global standards. Azerbaijan is hosting a number of important international events, and many prominent global companies and businesspersons are coming to Azerbaijan to set up business here. I believe that growing competition in the hotel business will greatly benefit the Excelsior Hotel Baku. Such competition during the European Games is the prerequisite for all foreign visitors and guests to leave Azerbaijan with a feeling of satisfaction. This factor itself is a strong driver for future prosperity of tourism and a growing and positive reputation for our homeland in Europe.</p><h4>With such a wide range of investments, AtaHolding is represented in many fields of the economy. What will be the primary focus in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Our main priority is to contribute to Azerbaijan's reputation, development, and success in all areas. We will try our best to benefit from the Year of Agriculture to the most extent possible. In relation to our future priorities, we are looking into market growth tendencies and selecting economically more attractive areas. Currently, our objective is to maintain our leading position in the banking and insurance sectors. Our marketing strategy concentrates mainly on the financial sector, which is a rapidly growing area of the local economy. Our target is to develop our company further through products based on innovative technologies. All of our subsidiary entities apply corporate governance practices, advanced technologies, and modern quality standards. Overall, we are trying to use innovative technologies in all areas of the local market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what particular areas does the EBRD focus its attention in Azerbaijan? </h4><p><span></span>Outside the oil sector, the EBRD is the largest investor in the private sector in Azerbaijan. Since the opening of our office in Baku in 1992, we have invested a total of $2.4 billion into 155 projects covering various sectors of the economy, including natural resources, manufacturing, services, the financial sector, agriculture, and infrastructure. Following a decade of rapid economic growth, Azerbaijan has reached a critical stage in its development. Diversification of the economy is now crucial to ensure that Azerbaijan enters the next stage of development with a modern and vibrant private sector. The recent decrease in oil prices has only added urgency to this mission. The EBRD has a longstanding track record of supporting this diversification agenda. We do so through a strong focus on SME development by making direct investments in mid-sized companies or providing credit lines to small businesses via local banks. This creates sustainable employment and wealth. 2014 has been a very successful year for the EBRD in Azerbaijan—a record year in terms of number of projects with 21 in total, representing ‚¬240 million in investments, and all in the private sector.</p><h4>The EBRD has recently launched its Energocredit initiative in Azerbaijan. What are the primary objectives of this scheme?</h4><p><span></span>Energocredit was launched in Azerbaijan in November of last year. It is part of the Caucasus Energy Efficiency Program, a $125 million credit line to local partner banks to incentivize the efficient use of energy resources by SMEs, local businesses, and households. It aims to demonstrate the benefits of investing in energy efficiency for companies and households, in a very practical and tangible manner, and it provides financial means for the necessary investments. Already three local banks—DemirBank, Mu‚¬anbank, and AccessBank—have signed up to the program. AccessBank has used part of their loan to improve energy efficiency at their own head office building—a case of leading by example. DemirBank and Mu‚¬anbank will on-lend EBRD funds to local firms and retail clients to finance energy efficiency projects. Unibank is another bank that is considering joining the program in the near future. The program is also supported by a team of international consultants who provide support to local banks, firms, and households with a dedicated technical package. </p><h4>The EBRD has supported banks such as Access Bank in the past, and more recently DemirBank and Mugan Bank. Why is the EBRD's role in facilitating the development of the financial sector so important, and how can this foster the development of MSMEs?</h4><p><span></span>The EBRD intends to continue playing a critical role in supporting the commercial and private banking sector in Azerbaijan. A strong and stable banking sector is essential for the development of the rest of the economy and for a well-functioning business environment. That's why support for the financial sector translates into support for the whole economy. Nowhere is this truer than for SMEs as they are difficult for us to reach directly in large numbers. We work with banks because they have the infrastructure and the networks to serve their SME clients and assist them closely as they develop. SMEs are crucial to the diversification of Azerbaijan's economy. Around the world, and are a major engine of growth. Improving their access to finance is vital for their success and expansion. In Azerbaijan, we have been, and will continue to be, one of the main financiers of SMEs both directly and indirectly.</p><h4>One of the EBRD's focus areas is agribusiness, an area of Azerbaijan's economy that has considerable potential. What opportunities are there for the EBRD to contribute to Azerbaijan's agriculture industry?</h4><p><span></span>We invest in agribusiness because this contributes to food security, to regional development outside the large cities, and to upgrading the skills of farmers, all to the benefit of the national economy and local communities. It is also a major opportunity. Azerbaijan's agricultural sector has huge potential for further development, as current productivity remains comparatively low and further skills transfer is needed to upgrade farming techniques. A small number of enterprises, including our clients, have implemented international quality and hygiene standards. We need to build on that. Also, access to finance remains lower in rural than in urban areas. Our strategy is to take an integrated view of the agribusiness sector—from the field to the table. Small landholders can benefit from EBRD finance as much as big supermarkets can, whom we also encourage to invest in the local value chain. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As technology improves, there is a constant need to update safety systems. How important is innovation to the strategy of Safe Life?</h4><p><span></span>Safe Life has adopted an innovative and integrated approach to developing new solutions for services we provide. The security sector already makes an important contribution to the economy. Besides technological development, Safe Life also focuses on human factors, processes, and organizational and administrative issues. The company implements “turn key projects," provides electrical, mechanical, and automatized systems, and realizes the integration of these different systems in one complete operating system. For example, in our new project, the administrative building of Azersu ASC, we have optimized building performance and functionality, and made it possible to monitor and control through a single, manageable platform. We have integrated Access Control, FAS (Fire Alarm), CCTV, and facility management systems there.</p><h4>Safe Life offers a range of services in Azerbaijan. What are some of the company's competitive advantages?</h4><p><span></span>One of the main points of our success is that we use advanced technological and innovative solutions in our systems, such as building management systems, building and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), automation, and smart home systems. HVAC is the technology of indoor and vehicular environmental comfort. Building control technologies help to meet comfort and safety requirements, while the building management system is able to control ventilation, lighting, and power, fire, and security systems in one integrated management platform. The smart home system is the residential extension of building management systems. It is automation of the home, housework, and housekeeping activity.</p><h4>A number of international partners maintain ties with Safe Life. How would you describe these partnerships, and what is their impact on the company?</h4><p><span></span>Safe Life is working on a better future. Our company provides innovations that boost the sustainable competitive strength of sector. The professional team and strong international collaborations are driving force of our company. One of the achievements in 2014 is new partnership with Honeywell's Life Safety, Security and Automation branches. Honeywell is well-known global company, which brings world-class products and services to different sectors.</p><h4>What are some of the most exciting upcoming projects for Safe Life?</h4><p><span></span>Since 2007, Safe Life has executed a couple of projects in various fields, including the industrial sector. The major goal in these projects was to combine quality and professionalism. Our strong portfolio helps us to participate in projects that meet high international standards. Nowadays, Safe Life is contractor of such magnificent projects like Azersu Tower, National Health Centre, Narimanov Parking, Qarayev Parking, Tufandag Sport and Recreation Centre, and Haydar Mosque.</p><h4>The European Games are approaching and the safety of the participants, visitors, and locations is of primary importance. How has Safe Life contributed to the development of this international event? </h4><p><span></span>Organizing international events always takes priority in our foreign strategy. It offers a great opportunity for targeting our country and show the rapid development of country. We have developed security systems in Palace of Hand Games and European Games 2015 Organization Committee.</p><h4>What CSR programs have Safe Life implemented in 2014 and how successful have they been?</h4><p><span></span>For their own safety, consumers must understand certain norms and standards expected in an emergency. For 2015, Safe Life is planning social projects in this area. A good security awareness program should be taught to employees about corporate policies and procedures in any kind of emergency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>TuranBank updated its strategy for 2012-2015. Can you explain what these updates included?</h4><p><span></span>TuranBank has been in Azerbaijan for 22 years and, until 2007, the bank operated as a boutique bank serving a small number of businesses. The bank moved away from corporate clients toward the SME and retail sector by approving a strategy for 2008-2011. Together with the IFC and other institutional investors, we looked at our strengths and weaknesses and decided to further expand our focus and add micro business to our model in our 2012-2015 vision. In Azerbaijan, we have roughly 95,000 legal entities and roughly 500,000 people in Azerbaijan with the tax registry who are involved in entrepreneurship activity. We started piloting a new strategy branch by branch. A group loan product where, for example, five people collectively obtain a loan and pay it back together has been introduced. Also, we are looking into green business for an additional customer base, whereas the bank will be supporting projects that are eco-friendly, as well as those that are thinking of optimizing their operations from an energy and environmental impact prospective. Although Azerbaijan still imports foodstuff, we also export a large amount of foodstuff meaning that there is great capacity that we can take advantage in terms of potential markets for the local producers.</p><h4>What is the balance between your corporate and retail strategy?</h4><p><span></span>In 2012, the balance was roughly 52% corporate and 48% SME. Our goal is to be at 75% MSME by the end of 2015. Currently, we are at roughly 70% of our portfolio, because we still have companies that have been with us for 10 years, and we want to keep those relationships. The idea is that by growing, the exposure and number of corporates will be reduced, and we will be in line with our targets by the end of 2015.</p><h4>Looking at the European Games, what opportunities do you think there are for the development of the MSMEs, and what role can TuranBank play in that?</h4><p><span></span>The most important barrier for every economy is the learning cost associated with the development process. Learning and integrating better standards takes time, especially for SMEs. We work with many companies involved in catering, tourism, and transport, and previously their standards may have been different, but now they are changing, taking into account better practices. It benefits them to learn and understand the advantages. Sometimes our clients are a little skeptical, but eventually they understand that they need to be a part of this greater process. If our customers and our partners work with better standards, it is great for us. It means we speak the same language. Further down the line, it will create additional investment opportunities for everyone. Our stock market is in a rapid development phase, and we need companies to open up. In addition, we expect new revenue streams that will further support their growth. I believe The European Games will greatly assist with all this.</p><h4>What is the benefit of providing such a wide range of loan services?</h4><p><span></span>The needs of businesses vary. As a financial intermediary, we have to examine a project and give advice on what type of loan should be granted. TuranBank cooperates with a number of domestic and international financial institutions. Through these partnerships we get preferential loan facilities, which help us access lower-cost and longer-term finance. Local funds and savings are available on average for two-years, except for those that are financed through government funds and agencies. However, in certain areas, such as agriculture projects, five to seven year loans are needed. Even if they do not fall within the scope of local funds, we are able to provide the required financial facility for these businesses so that they can be repaid in time.</p><h4>What opportunities does TuranBank's presence in other regions of Azerbaijan bring?</h4><p><span></span>We pride ourselves on our substantial knowledge in terms of regions, as well as agriculture and related processing, even though gaining that experience took some time. In 2014, we opened two new branches, both in regions where there are many SMEs. Our access to finance should benefit the businesses and the regions. The major banks work with the corporates, and we work with MSMEs. We expect three additional branches in the regions in 2015. The one that we opened in September 2014 in Jalilabad is already paying benefits, and we hope to move to the Agcabadi region soon.</p><h4>What is the significance of the partnerships that TuranBank has with international institutions?</h4><p>In recent years, international cooperation has been a huge part of our operations. We cooperate with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Black Sea Trade and Development Bank (BSTDB), European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and many others. The most important part for me is what we learn from these institutions. For example, our employees have been to several regional banks in the US in recent past. They have seen the standards, and how the businesses operate, watching how loans are generated, and how saving products work. We have been part of a lot of technical assistance projects, and it has been helpful in transforming the bank to its current standards. Learning is a major part of our culture, and this cooperation has helped us tremendously.</p><h4>What are the most important steps that need to be taken to ensure that the financial sector continues to develop and mature?</h4><p><span></span>The overall banking system is stable as the central bank has a conservative countercyclical position. When it sees the sector booming it tries to cool it down. As a conservative banker, I agree with that. Increasingly, private credit bureaus are a necessity. Currently, we have only one, which is a structure within the Central Bank. We are one of 10 banks in Azerbaijan, together with IFC to create the first private credit bureau in the country, which should be in place by the end of 2015. Corporate governance standards are not compulsory, businesses are moving in that direction at a slower pace, and in order for the banking sector to move forward it should be incentivized. We lower our risk perception as an institution in lending process when we see the standards. Another part of this process is bringing additional capital into the country, which will also bring with it more expertise and transparency. An environment that attracts more companies to invest in Azerbaijan will help the banking sector to grow, as we will be dealing with institutions and companies that operate with better standards. The government is rapidly moving in the direction of an actively used electronic payment environment with approved strategy and banks are seeing results. There has been an increase in the number of ATMs, terminals, and overall non-cash transactions. With the collapse of the Soviet system, people lost their trust in the financial system. However, what the government achieved is impressive in terms of realities of today. Savings have gone up by almost 10% in 2014 in the sector. The government, through its monetary and fiscal mechanisms, has always supported private business. This has been very clear if you analyze how the Azerbaijani economy has transformed in recent years. TuranBank will always try to support this process and play its role as a financial institution. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess 2014 for the BSE?</h4><p><span></span>Overall, 2014, especially its second half, was a complicated period of time in the global and regional arena. Geopolitical and energy market volatility affected many regional economies and national currencies. The Azerbaijan capitals market and the economy overall continue to demonstrate stability and resistance to negative external factors. For the BSE, for example, it was an outstanding year. Total trading volumes exceeded AZN13 billion, which is a record figure since BSE's inception in 2000. Another highlight was the launch of new private market initiated product lines. It is worth remembering here that initially, BSE emerged during the privatization processes in the 1990s. A few joint-stock companies along with a brand new investor category sprang up in Azerbaijan as a result of two privatization programs adopted by the government at the time. Over the decade, the number of individual and corporate investors reached almost 100,000 and joint stock companies reached over 2,000. This eventually led to the inception of BSE. At the initial stage of its development—until about 2008—BSE was operating under the post-privatization framework. Government securities were responsible for almost 90% of all trading volumes. This period is now over. In 2014, the launch of new financial and capital market tools, such as classic securities, really stood out and marked the year. We also launched market makers supported corporate bonds trading and repo transactions with them, as well as started selling margin-based derivatives—currency and commodities derivatives. This resulted in record figures and BSE exceeded all the previous years' indicators. Despite the signs of a crisis in the global economy, we expect BSE to thrive in 2015.</p><h4><span></span>What are the reasons behind the significant increase in corporate securities?</h4><p><span></span>Over the past 18 months, the amount of corporate bonds in the local market has tripled. On the institutional side, the segment has become more complex as well. The legal and operational framework for both corporate repo and market makers' service was elaborated. Around 12 types of liabilities led to the development of the market makers' services, which, in turn, led to the liquidity of these tools and increased trade on the corporate securities side. The total volume of this trade has still not reached the level of government bonds; however, it is almost comparable now. Currently, Azerbaijani companies are mainly funded by their profits, the capital injections of their shareholders, and traditional bank loans tools. Still, capital markets are becoming more appealing to them. Awareness of new market instruments is rising, which is welcome news for us.</p><h4><span></span>The state program for the development of capital markets that was started in 2011 is going on to 2020. How successful has it been so far in streamlining capital markets?</h4><p><span></span>This program is quite elaborate, and comprises legal, administrative, and technological advancement of all the securities market institutions, and embraces an entire decade. To support the program, Azerbaijan signed a credit agreement for the capital market's modernization project with the World Bank. The agreement covers half of the 10-year state program and comprises such significant sub-projects as the legal framework consolidation and creating a capital market law to place the legislation in line with that of Europe. It also implies revitalization of the operational base of BSE and the NDC. We have just completed one of the tenders within the state program—a contract for purchase and installation of the unified eleactronic trading and post-trading securities market platform—and all the documents have already been signed. This ambitious project will be realized over 2015 with the Korean Stock Exchange. It will allow us to streamline transactions and will broaden the horizons for our brokers.</p><h4><span></span>What is the process required for foreign investors to work with BSE?</h4><p><span></span>There are no limits for foreign investors to participate in transactions at securities market of BSE in terms of taxes and regulations regarding non-residents' capitals registration and profits repatriation. The NDC is carrying out all of the associated duties regarding non-residents registration. In this sense, the process is as easy for a foreign as it is for domestic investors. It is enough to choose a broker and a bank to join the market. The preparation will take about five days for non-residents. After opening the relevant accounts at the depositary center, choosing a broker, and signing the contracts, a foreign investor can start trading at the securities market. The participation of foreign investors at the capital market is quite liberalized. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How important has the establishment of STP been for the modernization and development of Azerbaijan's industrial sector?</h4><p>The opening ceremony of STP took place in December 2009 and was commissioned by President HE Ilham Aliyev. The participation of our honorable President in this event was an indication of how important the role of STP would be in the development of our country's industrial sector. It was anticipated that the capital gained from the successful oil strategies of our country would be directed to the development of non-oil sector and industrialization of the country. The foundation of STP jumpstarted activities that created the opportunity to produce equipment for different uses in the country and various other industrial products.</p><h4>Can you tell us the significance of some of the recent developments that have been made, including the installed equipment for high-voltage cables?</h4><p><span></span>Our main production section is in cables and great priority is given to the development of this sector. In 2014, we began the production of high voltage electrical cables up to 500kV, optical cables, coaxial cables, telephone, and internet cables, and we increase the range of our products from year to year. These new high voltage cables are particularly important considering the high demand for this product in markets around the world, along with other types of cables.</p><h4>How do you determine which products and lines of production to focus on?</h4><p><span></span>We have a special group that carries out market research and assesses what the market needs, and how we can provide the products for which there is greatest demand. We then direct our production and research accordingly.</p><h4>Innovation is a key goal of STP. What new technologies have been launched in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>STP constantly gives priority to the implementation of new technologies in production. From the first day of our establishment, our primary goal has been the implementation of new technologies in production and offering new products to the market, and 2014 was no exception. Last year, STP started new lines for production up to 500kV cables, and became the first such product producer in the region. Alkopon production and reconstruction of the sandwich panel production line is a new achievement as well. All equipment used at our facilities is of a high standard and modern, using the top brands of European and American producers. We use the latest and newest technologies, because only with that can you produce the kinds of top technology products that we provide for the market. We have to be at the cutting edge at all times.</p><h4><br>How does STP manage its workforce to ensure that the best services are provided?</h4><p><span></span>We have always been more interested in quality rather than quantity. Our purpose is to transform STP into an innovative engineering center. A lot of work has been done in this direction. We are more interested in providing the younger generation with intellectual knowledge and experience. We want to recruit young, talented, and well-educated engineers who can lead STP and the country into the future. Most of our employees are recruited from universities, which also send a lot of students to STP for internships and experience. We have internships in all fields, allowing students to get hands-on, practical experience.</p><h4>What role can STP play in the preparations for major events like the upcoming 2015 European Games?</h4><p><span></span>STP has contributed significantly to preparations for the 2015 European Games. It has offered its services either by presenting its produced industrial products or by preparing, assembling, and installing metal constructions. STP has directly participated in construction works of several projects and the reconstruction of existing infrastructure. We can be involved in any and all upcoming big projects like this.</p><h4>STP works closely with the German company, Kaeser. How did that partnership come about and in what way has it benefited operations?</h4><p><span></span>STP has extensive experience in the operation of equipment offered by different local and foreign companies. We have our own criteria for quality assessment of such equipment. The best quality and cost of compressors that are offered by Kaeser gave us an opportunity to build a strong partnership with them.</p><h4>How important was the 2014 Year of Industry for STP?</h4><p><span></span>It was very important for STP and the country as a whole. The main problem for Azerbaijan leading up to 2014 concerned the standardization of industrial products. We have a huge industrial legacy from the Soviet times, so the big challenge is standardizing new foreign technologies and products with former Soviet ones at international standards. In 2014, a technical committee for the standardization of industrial products was created on the basis of STP in Azerbaijan, and we have since acquired more than 20 international standards on types of cables and polymeric pipes, which we have adopted as a national standard. In 2015, the committee is expected to adopt an additional 30 international standards, so we are on the right track.</p><h4>How far has Azerbaijan come in terms developing the non-oil sector, and what still needs to be done in to strengthen this?</h4><p><span></span>In order to achieve this goal of diversification and development of non-oil industries, creating technological parks like STP is crucial, because these parks are where industry and academia meet and converge, and where research, innovation, new ideas, and new practices and strategies can be discussed, developed, and applied. It is also where various institutions and businesses can pool their resources and join forces. At STP, we will continue to diversify our products and expand our lines of production for the non-oil sector of the economy.</p><h4>How has STP maintained its success despite the challenges of the global economy?</h4><p><span></span>A decrease in oil prices in world markets did not affect STP directly to a great extent. However, the decrease creates problems in the implementation of large projects in our country and thus it affects STP indirectly. In order to neutralize this effect, STP aims to take part in more projects and enlarge its client's portfolio and compensate by finding new markets.</p><h4>What are your targets and expectations for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>In general, our aims for 2015 include renewing our existing technological equipment, implementing new technologies, and increasing the diversification of our products. Most importantly, our biggest aim is to present STP to the world as a production company with high quality products. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Industrial parks play a significant role in the growth of non-oil sector of the country and the successful implementation of industrialization policy. What are your plans for the development of industrial parks?</h4><p><span></span>The main line of the socio-economic development strategy that has been successfully implemented by President HE Ilham Aliyev is economic diversification and non-oil sector growth. One of the important steps taken in this field is the building of modern industry and stimulating innovative production. Today, there are three industrial parks (Sumgait Chemical Industrial Park, Mingachevir Industrial Park, and Balakhani Industrial Park) and two high technology parks (Pirallahi High Technologies Park, Mingachevir High Technologies Park). SCIP is an administrative organization of two of these industrial parks. SCIP was established by Presidential Decree in December 2011 in order to successfully implement the strategy for economic diversification. The main purpose of SCIP's establishment is to ensure the sustainable development of the non-oil sector, to develop competitive industrial production based on innovative high technology, and support entrepreneurship in this area. In 2013, the foundation of SCIP was laid with the participation of the President. Taking into consideration the prospects and interests expressed to the industrial park the territory of the SCIP, which owned 167.76 ha in the initial stage was extended up to 295.62 ha. With 10,000 people expected to be employed, the industrial park is supposed to house 35-40 production parcels based there using innovative and up-to-date technology. Measures on organization, management, and promotion of SCIP, as well as the attraction of foreign investors are being taken. As a governing organ of SCIP, the Ministry of Economy and Industry contributes to the activities carried out in this field. It is commonly known that most (nearly 35-40%) of any investment into an industrial project is spent for the building of infrastructure network. SCIP will provide its residents with a technical infrastructure network in the latest style and based on the system of direct connection (plug &amp; play). Mingachevir Industrial Park was established by the Presidential Decree dated February, 2015 in Mingachevir city. The area of the Park is 14.8 ha. The main purpose of Mingachevir Industrial Park's establishment is to ensure the sustainable development of the non-oil sector, to develop competitive industrial production based on innovative high technology, development of the regions of Azerbaijan, and support entrepreneurship in this area.</p><h4>One of the main goals of SCIP is to support entrepreneurial activity in the field of innovation and technology. How does this demonstrate its value in practice and what benefits do you have as a result?</h4><p><span></span>The Steel Pipe Factory, Hydroengineering Equipment Factory, PE Products Factory, and Metal Construction Plant of Azertexnolayn are operating here. Between 2017 and 2018, SOCAR Polymer's polypropylene and high-density polyethylene factories will start operations. Another resident of SCIP, AzerFloat, will construct a Sheet Glass Making Plant on float technology in the industrial park. The design of the new entity, its provision with modern equipment, and advanced technologies in this field will be ensured by Germany's HORN Glass Industries AG, who have 125 years of experience in the field of glass melting technology. According to the MoU signed between SCIP and the US-company Southwest NanoTechnologies (SWeNT), the manufacturability of carbon nano-tubes will be investigated. All the above-mentioned projects will in turn provide conditions for the introduction of new and innovative technologies in Azerbaijan. Another facade and roof coating production line of Azerbaijan Fibro Cement, which is based on Austrian technology and meets modern requirements, will be commissioned on the site of SCIP.</p><h4>Certain success has been achieved in attracting investments to SCIP. What are your expectations for this area?</h4><p><span></span>Although only a short time has passed since the establishment of SCIP, there are now four residents engaged in production of pipes of various diameters and special-purpose polyethylene pipes of different diameters, hydraulic equipment, polypropylene (PP), high density polyethylene (HDPE), and the production of different types of glass plates. A number of well-known companies in the chemical industry are interested in investing in SCIP, which in turn lays the groundwork for the future development of the Park. More than 20 potential investment proposals have been received from Canada, Germany, Japan, France, Italy, and Turkey-based companies, and they have expressed their desire to become residents of SCIP. The projects mostly provide for packaging, construction, agricultural chemistry, pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, glass production, electronics, automobile, and intermediate chemical products, as well as the production of basic polymers.</p><h4>Many industrial parks offer discounts and bundled services. Does SCIP consider this kind of practice?</h4><p><span></span>SCIP offers the most attractive incentives portfolio in the region for investment projects. Thus, the residents of SCIP are exempt from property, land, and income taxes, while techniques, technological equipment and devices imported to the SCIP are exempt from VAT for the period of seven years. At the same time, a plot of land is leased for the long term in exchange for minimal payments. The expansion of incentives portfolio is under consideration. In addition, the industrial park's operator offers residents a wide range of services. All the services, including data collection, marketing research and analysis, responding to investors requests, the organization of various events, the acquisition of licenses and permits, and support for the selection of local partners and representatives, as well as consulting, training, and other services will be offered free of charge to SCIP residents. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How many types of glass are manufactured by Inter Glass, and what products are currently in the greatest demand?</h4><p><span></span>To date, Inter Glass has produced more than 80 types of glass products. Due to the expansion of the consumer market, we primarily plan to improve the quality and then broaden the assortment of our products. These products are primarily intended for canned food, cool drinks, alcoholic beverages, and juices as these enjoy the greatest demand. As the manufacturing sector has taken off, it is important that we continue to innovate, expand, and look for new products in order to keep our competitive edge not only in Azerbaijan, but also in the region.</p><h4>In 2014, you declared plans to double the volume of production. How far have you managed to move in this direction?</h4><p><span></span>Currently, intensive work is under way on the construction of a second production line. All processing equipment delivered from Europe is already on our premises. After construction is completed, we will embark on the installation of processing equipment. We plan to commission the second production line by the end of 2015. Considering that we are planning to increase the assortment of products that we produce, increasing the company's capacity is a logical step. We wish to keep moving our company forward and this is an important stage of our evolution.</p><h4>Expansion of production may imply an increase in the number of employees. How would you rate your current staff in terms of its qualification, education, and training?</h4><p><span></span>Indeed, the expansion of production capacity has paved the way for an increase in the number of employees, which has in turn paved the way for the greater diversity of our workforce. I consider the qualification of our personnel quite satisfactory now. High standards are a necessity in every element of Inter Glass's operations, and this applies to our employees as well. We ensure that our employees not only work efficiently and safely, but also that they develop their professionalism and their careers while working with Inter Glass.</p><h4>In terms of both production and geographical location, what is the potential for the expansion and development of your business?</h4><p><span></span>Our goal is to fully meet the needs of the country for quality glass containers. At present, the products of Inter Glass are sold on the local market to such companies as Gilan Holding, Azgranata, Tovuz-Baltiya, Aqroazerinvest, Aznar, MVF, Bilasuvar Agro, and Slavyanka. Azerbaijan is at an exciting stage in that many manufacturers in the industrial sector are meeting the demands of the local market. In the future, there is an exciting possibility that, due to our experience in this industry, we will be able to expand into new markets.</p><h4>What opportunities can the First European Games provide for Inter Glass?</h4><p><span></span>Everyone in Azerbaijan is excited about the First European Games, which is reflected throughout the country as the event approaches. For the business and industry community, it is an important event as it puts the whole country in the spotlight. Visitors will not only be looking to see how successful the event is, but also what other opportunities there are, and whether they should return again. It is up to us to ensure that those who come to Azerbaijan understand the potential for investment and the diversity of the people.</p><h4>How significant are Inter Glass's current partnerships with local and international corporations?</h4><p><span></span>We also export our products to such Georgian businesses as Borjomi, Zedazeni (sparkling cool drinks), and Sarajishvili (alcoholic beverages). Inter Glass is now a renowned organization in Azerbaijan, and we are proud to have entered the Georgian market. In the coming years, we will continue to cooperate both domestically and internationally, and ensure that our product and service is of the highest quality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact is the macroeconomic development in Azerbaijan having on the labor market and social protection of the population?</h4><p><span></span>Social prosperity has been at the heart of the policies of the National Leader Heydar Aliyev. Starting from 2003, the policy of rapid economic development based on powerful economic potential has been successfully carried out by President HE Ilham Aliyev. Most importantly, a social development strategy based on the principle of social equality and justice has been realized. Major economic successes were accompanied by significant progress in the social sphere. A total of 1.36 million jobs have been created, including 1 million permanent ones, since 2004. The level of unemployment has dropped to 4.9% as compared to 11.5% in Europe and 10% in EU countries. Minimum wage has increased by 11.6 times, while the average income increased by 5.5 times and the average pension by 9.4 times over the last 10 years, exceeding the rate of poverty by 1.7 times. Azerbaijan is one of 147 countries to have joined the UN Millennium Development Goals in 2000, whereby it assumed the commitment to reduce the level of poverty by half by 2015. Over the decade alone, the level of poverty has been reduced more than 10 fold, or three times below the global rate of poverty. According to the latest UN report, Azerbaijan is ranked 76th among 187 countries in terms of human development.<br></p><h4>What is the status of the targeted social assistance programs envisaged for different categories of the population?</h4><p><span></span>One direction of the social policy is to improve the livelihood of the underprivileged population and enhance state support for these people. Expenses on social protection and social security have been increased eight fold in the past 10 years. At the beginning of 2015, monthly and lump sum benefits have been appointed and paid to more than 451,000 people, which is 4.4% of the population. In addition, more than 51,000 people are provided with presidential allowances. More than 23% of the country's population is covered by the social security system. In the past decade, the amount of monthly social benefits has been increased by 2.6 times. Azerbaijan has adopted a set of flexible and effective measures to maintain macroeconomic stability and all social programs financed from the state budget have been continued and expanded. More than 10 presidential decrees and resolutions on social benefits for the most vulnerable population were signed in 2014. The average amount of monthly benefits for war veterans and persons of similar categories has been increased by around 50%, for veterans of World War II and by 81.8% and for Karabakh war victims. There has been a significant increase in the volume of social benefits paid to 80,000 people. The number of those receiving presidential pensions has increased by 50%. We have also started paying benefits to the mothers of five or more children, the tuition fees of handicapped Karabakh war veterans and families of victims in higher and specialized educational institutions. In 2014, we spent 20.8% more on monthly and lump-sum social benefits, pensions, and compensations.</p><p><span></span>Further evidence of the government's focus on the social sphere is the provision of war veterans and people of similar categories with free-of-charge cars in 2014. In particular, all war veterans and people of similar categories who were in the line for receiving a free car, a total of 1,453 people, received one last year. In addition, the Ministry provided 174 people handicapped in the war with apartments. Also, according to a presidential decree, on June 20th, 2014, all war veterans and war-victim families registered for an apartment as of January 1st, 2014 are to be provided with one in the 2014-18 period. Multi-story apartment buildings have been built for handicapped war veterans and war-victim families in four districts of Azerbaijan and a total of 353 private houses have been constructed in 52 districts. Of these, 1,031 will be provided to handicapped war veterans and war-victim families in 2015. In addition, we are currently constructing an apartment building with 132 apartments and social facilities such as a training center for the visually impaired, a specialized social rehabilitation center for underage children, and a social adaptation center for those released from penitentiary institutions.</p><h4><br>The labor and social security system is an area often subject to major change. What can you say about the key directions, objectives, and principles of these reforms?</h4><p><span></span>The main objective of this system is to expedite automation of all activity of the Ministry, apply modern management techniques, create a transparent system, and eventually put in place a system accessible to all categories of the population. We intend to provide all services electronically. The reform of the Electronic Information System of Labour Contracts and its commissioning on the e-government portal has paved the way for making employment relations more transparent using electronic media, and facilitating direct, flexible, and objective state control over the labor market. It will also play an important part in preventing unlawful labor relations, strengthen the labor rights of hired workers, increase state budget incomes and social insurance payments, and contribute to the formation of a comprehensive database of the labor market. People will be able to use individual electronic carriers and information kiosks at post offices to apply for targeted social assistance. The automation of this system will eliminate the need for direct contact between civil servants and citizens, and provide people with broad access to different types of social assistance. Most families receiving social benefits face difficulty in applying for more assistance if their family composition or income has changed. In order to combat this, a recent order signed by the President has prolonged the duration of targeted social assistance from one to two years. We have recently introduced a complete automation of the process to determine the degree of disability. We have started developing a database of medical and social examination and rehabilitation within the Ministry's centralized information system. This will enable a comfortable exchange of electronic information regarding disability examination among different agencies, which will contribute to greater transparency, minimize direct contact with civil servants, and help to eliminate unnecessary paperwork. The results will be accumulated in the system and be available to relevant state agencies upon request. </p><h4>What measures are being taken in the country to improve employment opportunities for young people and facilitate the access of persons with disabilities to the labor market?</h4><p><span></span>In 2014, a total of 62% of applicants, or 29,440 people applying to the Ministry for jobs, were provided with employment. At the same time, 3,786 people were sent into various training courses and 1,605 people engaged in paid public work. Young people constituted the majority of those provided with jobs. Azerbaijan is noted for a low level of unemployment among young people. The unemployment level among people of 15-29 years of age is 9.9% and among 15-24 years of age is 13.5%. This is lower in comparison with other countries. The UN ranks Azerbaijan among the top 10 countries globally for youth employment. As part of a project implemented together with the International Labor Organization, a group of young job seekers were provided with employment on the basis of subsidies. One of the main issues on our agenda is the provision of employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. In 2014 alone, our employment service provided a total of 1,036 people in need of social assistance with jobs. Of these, 249 were with disabilities. In the said period of time, 367 individuals with disabilities, including 60 visually impaired people, have been engaged in professional rehabilitation programs. The Ministry's Center for Vocation Rehabilitation of Young People with Limited Health Opportunities, commissioned in late 2013, has proved extremely helpful in addressing the problems of job-seekers with disabilities, developing a strong material, and technical capacity to provide young people with various qualifications. Further reforms in the spheres of labor and employment will continue to be carried out in the Republic of Azerbaijan in order to bring the social protection of the population in line with contemporary requirements. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerbaijan won the tender in 2012 to host the upcoming European Games. What are some of the advantages that promoted Azerbaijan as the best candidate?</h4><p>Baku and Azerbaijan made a compelling pledge to the EOC to host the inaugural European Games back in 2012. Azerbaijan's concept was innovative and offered an assurance that all infrastructure would be ready on time and delivered to the highest international standards, with strong legacy plans to elevate sport throughout Azerbaijan, the region, and the continent. The Baku 2015 European Games Operations Committee (BEGOC) is delivering on all these promises as they now move into the final testing and readiness phase of their preparations. </p><h4>Preparation for the Games have picked up with over 1,000 workers currently employed in anticipation of the event. How important have BECOG workers been in supporting the event?</h4><p>It has been very important. BEGOC has only had 30 months to deliver these Games. To stage an event such as Baku 2015—which is bigger in scale than the Olympic Winter Games—in such a tight timeframe has only been possible through the hard work and professionalism of BEGOC's staff. However, behind the excellent work of BEGOC is total government support. The country's senior figureheads, President HE Ilham Aliyev and the First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva, are both sports people through and through. The First Lady is the Chair of the Baku 2015 Organizing Committee and the President is also the Head of Azerbaijan's National Olympic Committee. Their support and passion for the European Games has been crucial. </p><h4>The Games are one of the most significant events in the recent history of Azerbaijan. With that in mind, what long-term possibilities do the Games provide?<br></h4><p>Azerbaijan is already starting to realize the long-term benefits of hosting the European Games. Since 2012, the city has secured other high-profile sports properties, such as an Formula One Grand Prix in 2016, the Islamic Solidarity Games in 2017, and matches at EURO 2020. Baku 2015 opened the window for the sports world into Azerbaijan, and the country has seized its opportunity. On a community level, there are also many long-term opportunities. After the Games, Baku will have 18 new or refurbished world-class venues at its disposal, and these will encourage one of the youngest populations in Europe to follow a sporting lifestyle. </p><h4>As these are the first European Games, what are some of the challenges you face in bringing it to fruition?</h4><p><span></span>When the EOC awarded Baku the right to host the inaugural European Games in 2012, there was no precedent or blueprint for BEGOC, or us, to follow. Obviously, there are other established continental multi-sport events, such as the Pan-American Games or the Asian Games, but what works in Asia or in the Americas will not necessarily fit in with Europe's sporting landscape. Hence, starting from scratch was a challenge, but we saw it more as a massive opportunity to be innovative and to fit the Games around Europe's specific needs. Innovation is evident in every part of our hosting concept. The sports program includes exciting disciplines like 3x3 basketball, karate, and beach soccer. There is also space for sports that are locally popular but not known widely across Europe, such as sambo. Further innovation comes from the fact that there are no para-sport divides at Baku 2015; for example, blind and visually impaired judo is a fully integrated medal event. Commercially, there will be in-stadia branding for Games partners and supporters, which, of course, is not done at an Olympic Games and allows sponsors of the event to enhance their commercial return. The innovation behind the European Games also helps us address another challenge making Europe aware and communicating about why these Games are a necessary introduction to the sports calendar. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013, you spoke of the economy's growth over the past 10 years, citing an impressive three-fold increase in GDP over this time. To what extent has 2014 continued this trend?</h4><p>Although 2014 was marked by a global economic and financial crisis and increased international risks, our country's primary objectives have been achieved. Azerbaijan has achieved an increase in GDP and continued to pursue the policy of economic diversification. In 2014, Azerbaijan's economy grew by about 3%, a significant increase given the current economic situation. In recent years, the government has taken serious steps to diversify the economy and develop the non-oil sector. In 2014, the non-oil sector saw 7% growth, and in the future, it will contribute even more to Azerbaijan's economic growth. The macroeconomic environment has remained stable. The inflation rate was as low as 1.4% against a 5% rise in the incomes of the population. $27 billion was invested in the country's economy, which has given positive momentum to the economy and the consumer market, and had a positive impact on the growth of income of enterprises and business entities. Notwithstanding the processes observed in the world markets at the end of 2014, the overall stability of the economy has had a positive impact on tax revenues, with tax revenues through the Ministry of Taxes having increased by 6.7% compared to the previous year, reaching AZN7.113 billion.</p><h4>Diversification lies at the heart of Azerbaijan's economic reforms. Can you explain how the Ministry for Taxes' work relates to this?</h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijan pursues the policy of building a diversified, efficient, and innovation-driven economy, as well as becoming a regional investment center. Our government is working actively to diversify the economy by implementing major regional infrastructure projects. There is a steadily growing business sector and an inflation regulating policy in the country, along with legislation that is favorable to foreign investors and their activities. The tax policy is widely used as a means of stimulating economic growth, which is particularly common in developing countries with a low tax burden. We call it an active fiscal policy, and our government puts a particular focus on this as part of economic regulation. We are trying to keep the tax burden at an attractive level, and there are only nine types of taxes in Azerbaijan. The rate of corporate tax is 20%, and VAT is 18%. These are lower than average European indicators. Our legislation also sets maximum limits of tax rates, does not discriminate between foreign and local investors, and supports the development of SMEs. Goals such as encouraging development of the non-oil sector and reducing dependence on oil revenues provide a basis for our long-term development. The non-oil sector will be a leading force of development over the coming years.</p><h4>Hand-in-hand with diversification comes competition. Your office has considerable ability to influence this in the emerging sectors of the economy. How are your policies encouraging competition in these nascent markets?</h4><p><span></span>Today, the tax system not only fulfills fiscal functions, but also serves the purpose of supporting economic development, attracting investment and new technology, and, in some cases, supporting the social sector. Azerbaijan extensively uses tax relief practices in important areas of development. Agriculture, one of the key sectors contributing to GDP, has long been practically exempt from taxes. Measures are being taken for the establishment of technology parks that will play an important role in forming new areas of the national economy and making them more competitive. In order to stimulate their development in the medium and long term, those operating in these parks have been exempted from taxes for seven years, while managing organizations and operators have been exempted indefinitely. Tax legislation also supports the bank and insurance sectors of the country as banks and other credit institutions enjoy tax benefits for the interest paid on deposits of individuals. Azerbaijan's effective fiscal policy supports the non-oil sector, particularly the development of SMEs. It is possible to register a company within a few minutes and start a business. According to the Doing Business Report of the World Bank, our country is among the top 12 countries of the world for business registration procedures.</p><h4>In the past year, the revenue from the State Oil Fund (SOFAZ) will have declined in line with the falling oil price worldwide. How has this affected the tax returns to the state budgets?</h4><p><span></span>The decline in oil prices has affected budget revenues to some extent.  However, the government is closely watching world markets and has different scenarios in mind to protect our economy. The government intends to take measures to diversify the economy, carry out institutional reforms and implement more effective methods of management, which will allow us to keep the budget deficit within the planned limits. The oil sector has a significant share in budget revenues, which, in recent years, has been declining both in GDP and budget allocation. The purpose is not to eliminate the oil and gas factor, as these sectors are the country's key industries, and there are plans to develop major gas production projects in the near future. Our goal is to create a broad, sustainable and steadily developing non-oil sector and our efforts, using oil revenues for the formation of the country's infrastructure, stem from these goals.</p><h4>E-Government is at the heart of the country's vision for developing an information society. How is the Ministry of Taxes adapting to this program, and with what goal in view?</h4><p><span></span>The tax service is the most active participant of the electronic government in the country. The Automated Tax Information System (AVIS) implemented in the Ministry of Taxes has created many technological advantages for us. With our staff consisting of a little more than 2,000 employees, we monitor the activities of more than 600,000 taxpayers and are able to offer them the most advanced services. The tax service was the first in Azerbaijan to start large-scale e-government building. Azerbaijan's tax service is the most electronically managed government agency with the widest introduction of modern information technologies. For the ratio of administrative costs to tax revenues, Azerbaijan is considered one of the countries with the most efficient tax administrations in Europe. Entrepreneurs in Azerbaijan can fulfill all of their obligations over the internet without visiting the tax authorities. With 60 modern services, Azerbaijan's tax service is the government agency offering the widest range of e-services in the country. Global trends and deepening international integration necessitate the establishment of a tax system based on knowledge management and constantly improved from a technological perspective. We intend to continue reforms aimed at expanding the use of modern information technologies, electronic audit and innovation-oriented electronic services in the tax system and establishing partnership relations between taxpayers and tax authorities in the near future.</p><h4>What are your projections for the coming months, and what will be the main challenges for the Ministry?</h4><p><span></span>Along with promoting the country as a sporting nation, Azerbaijan has hosted major events that are also a great support to the development of tourism. The first European Games create unparalleled opportunities for demonstrating the potential of Azerbaijan, and it will be a landmark event not only in Azerbaijani, but also in global Olympic history. On the other hand, the realization of Azerbaijan's tourism potential conforms to our policy of enhancing the capacity of the non-oil sector. Our country has great potential to meet a significant part of its budget by leveraging tourism potential. We are direct stakeholders in the realization of this potential, because tourism means additional income, new jobs, and economic activity. Such prestigious events bring dividends and benefits to the country. As for our expectations for 2015, the “Azerbaijan 2020: Vision of the Future" concept sets forth our medium-term goals. Our government aims to increase the volume of GDP per-capita more than twofold by 2020. The tax authorities also play an important role. The government has mobilized all possibilities to ensure the business environment is more attractive. The reforms in tax administration will as always serve to create the most favorable conditions for doing business in Azerbaijan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess preparations for the delivery of Azerbaijani gas through the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC) to Europe?</h4><p><span></span>The SGC Projects are of strategic importance to the whole country and are supported not only by Azerbaijan but also by the EU. As a shareholder and participating party, we continuously track and keep control over the preparatory works to ensure the timely and efficient realization of the SGC. We have strong support from the government. In addition, a special governmental commission represented by the relevant top government officials has been established by the President of Azerbaijan to secure a smooth and timely delivery of the SGC projects. These projects are successfully realized within the planned timeframe, and we are even ahead of schedule in some areas. We even completed seven production wells in preparation for first gas.  Preparatory and design works are almost completed, and the start of the construction process is not far off. The construction of South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) and Trans Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) commenced in 2015, and Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) will start in 2016. We assess the overall progress, which is circa 30%, positively, and have confidence that the projects and the whole SGC will be delivered on time. </p><h4>SOCAR has increased its share in the various pipelines of the Southern Gas Corridor. To what extent is SOCAR's investment strategy changing?</h4><p><span></span>SOCAR has increased its shares in Shah Deniz and SCP projects by 6.67% in 2014. SOCAR also has a 58% share in TANAP and a 20% share in TAP projects. This strategic approach reflects our vision on SGC as strategically important project not only for Azerbaijan, but also globally. Taking into account the importance of SGC for the sustainable development of the energy sector and capital-intensive nature of the Projects, the SGC CJSC was established. This was done to ensure that Azerbaijani shares in these projects are financed effectively and in time and in the integrated manner. The company is jointly owned by the Ministry of Economic development and SOCAR, with 51% and 49% shares, respectively. The government provides a major part of the financing. The very fact that the Azerbaijani side has increased its share in the projects underlines once more our confidence in future investment plans. </p><h4>In 2013, SOCAR, BP, and the State Migration Committee were involved in a forum to discuss the nationalization of Azerbaijan's energy sector. What steps have been taken so far to implement this?</h4><p>A structured approach toward development of local workforce and the further supply of professional skills are being delivered through provisions of developed policies and procedures within the Nationalization Strategy. Following the protocol, a new procedure has been agreed and established between the State Migration Service of the Azerbaijan Republic (SMS), Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population of the Republic of Azerbaijan (MLSP), SOCAR, and BP to regulate the endorsement and issuance of the work permits (WP) and temporary residential permits (TRP) for expatriate specialists involved in the oil and gas projects in the country. SOCAR Investments Division is vested with the authority to monitor and regulate the target manning levels of national employees pertaining to petroleum operations, and its compliance with local legislation, PSAs, and other contracts, in order to provide smooth replacement of foreign personnel with competent local professional staff. Until now, 80 companies operating in Azerbaijan's oil and gas industry have joined this process. In February 2014, SOCAR signed a MoU with the MLSP, which provides for, among others, placing unemployed local specialists in a job. As a part of the MoU, parties agreed to exchange information on the current and future demand for foreign workforce in the oil and gas sector.</p><h4>How have lower oil prices affected investment activity of the company?</h4><p><span></span>Negative dynamics on the global oil market has affected practically all the players in the market, and SOCAR is not an exception; however, we were prepared for this and moreover, we are seeing more and more opportunities to improve the effectiveness of our daily operations. None of the investment contracts that have been signed earlier will be cancelled or changed. We will not allow for any delays to take place in their implementation, and all the projects will be carried out as planned. In terms of future contracts, the continuously changing situation on the market is forcing us to reevaluate our plans. Still, as a company with clearly established goals, we are always careful to identify priority and non-priority projects. In other words, lower oil prices do not affect our ongoing projects, although we might re-consider some of our future ones.</p><h4>How would you assess the quality of the services market in Azerbaijan for engineering and maintenance?</h4><p><span></span>We have always had an industry that was practically self-sufficient and well respected. Our service companies, geologists, engineers were the first, in 1949, to establish offshore oil and gas production. They also made discoveries in Siberia and supplied oil equipment and machinery for the discoveries made. That was done with the strong participation of our specialized design institutions and our oil machinery plants here in Baku. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, some of the ties that were in existence were cut; however, we continued to develop our own industry. There were also areas where we were lacking some expertise, and were trying to attract such expertise from the outside. An example of this would be our deep-offshore structures production plant, which is a combination of a yard, a machinery plant, and the shipyard. It was the first of its kind in the Soviet Union. Now, it is an example of the cooperation between SOCAR and the companies that are working with it on turning it into the modern industrial complex. We are working in alliance with Boyuq Offshore for this particular industrial complex named Bos shelf. We have also signed a working alliance with a number of companies, including Italian Saipem, to develop different areas of services required by the industry. KBR and Foster Wheeler are other examples of such cooperation. KBR was present in Azerbaijan since the beginning of the modern development of our industry from 1994 to 1995. It has always worked in the area of design activities in close cooperation with our own design institutions. SOCAR has two design institutes: one for offshore and one for onshore activities. This cooperation was established long ago, and we are working together with our partners successfully. This recent execution of the joint activities is a logical continuation of our work.</p><h4>How is SOCAR involved in the First European Games?</h4><p><span></span>The European Games was another major chance for SOCAR to get involved in sport and promote itself in the international arena. SOCAR already has strong presence around the world, and we hope to expand even more. This sponsorship will provide us another boost and increase the awareness of SOCAR throughout the world. SOCAR is one of the largest, if not the largest, companies in Azerbaijan, employing around 60,000 people. Their health and social lives are one of our main our priorities and sports are considered as one of the important aspects of social development. We believe that these inaugural European games will not only create jobs but also will bring many benefits, not just in the short term, but also in the long term for the citizens of Azerbaijan, our 60,000 employees, and their families. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>The First European Games is a landmark occasion for Azerbaijan and it is anticipated to be the first of many major national events. How has AZAL prepared for the Games so far, and what strategies have been put in place to support the event?</h4><p><span></span>The first European Games is an outstanding event that Azerbaijan is rightly proud of. Thanks to the efforts of the country's leadership and personally President of the Republic Ilham Aliyev, today Azerbaijan has the capacity to conduct such global events at the highest level. This puts tremendous responsibility on AZAL, the official carrier of this important event. The first thing a passenger coming into the country sees is the airport. It is a gateway of the state and Heydar Aliyev International Airport is the main air harbor in Azerbaijan. </p><p><span></span>I am sure that the new terminal of the Baku airport, equipped with the most advanced air navigation facilities, contemporary design, and a host of amenities for passengers, will impress any visitor of the Games. As a matter of fact, the new terminal of the airport has recently received a high assessment in the SkyTrax international audit, the status of a four-star airport, which is on a par with such recognized international air hubs as London's Heathrow, Schiphol in Amsterdam, Beijing, Frankfurt, Abu Dhabi, Zurich, and other airports. However, we will not rest on our laurels and will do everything possible to obtain the highest status of a five-star airport, which has thus far been awarded to just five airports in the world. For visitors choosing the national carrier to come to our country, familiarization with the traditional Azerbaijani hospitality and culture begins well before landing in Baku. I am talking about the passengers who will use the services of AZAL. It operates flights to many countries participating in the Games: the UK, the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Turkey, and Russia, for example. In May 2015, we are opening flights to two new destinations: Berlin and Barcelona. Therefore, many athletes and guests of the Games will be able to take our flights—agreements have already been reached with the National Olympic Committees of France, Italy, and others on the transportation of national teams of these countries by AZAL. In addition, the number of flights to some European countries will be increased in the run-up to the First European Games.</p><h4><br>The new Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner Plane was added to AZAL's fleet, the first of its kind in CIS countries. How does a modernization of the air fleet support AZAL's overall objectives?</h4><p><span></span>It is a wonderful airplane, the pride of modern aviation, and we are extremely pleased that Azerbaijan was the first CIS country to take this type of aircraft into the fleet of the national carrier. The first Dreamliner acquired by the AZAL arrived in the capital of Azerbaijan on December 24th, 2014. In anticipation of this event, many local media published the characteristics of this aircraft. The range of 15,700km allows it to carry out long-haul flights lasting more than 15 hours. It has 210 passenger seats, including 18 business-class, 35 premium class, and 157 economy class seats. The aircraft is based on the most advanced achievements in the field of aircraft design and is noted for extensive use of composite materials, which makes it different from its predecessors by higher cost efficiency both in terms of ground handling and fuel consumption. The Boeing 787 has already been put into service and operates scheduled passenger flights to Istanbul and London. In the near future it will begin to carry out flights in Beijing. The appearance of this type of aircraft in the fleet of the national carrier of Azerbaijan represents yet another stage in the renewal of its aircraft which is carried out on behalf of and under the guidance of the President of Azerbaijan.</p><h4><span></span>AZAL has recently cooperated with Turkish Airlines. How significant is the airline's presence in the region as a result?</h4><p><span></span>The signing of a code-share agreement with the national carrier of fraternal Turkey is a landmark event in AZAL's commercial policy. The agreement has been a long time coming, and finally we have managed to find a format, which should be beneficial to all parties—airlines and passengers alike. The agreement covers all flights between Turkey and Azerbaijan carried out by Turkish Airlines and AZAL. This allows us tremendous flexibility in terms of schedules and connections when planning the itinerary for our passengers. For example, whereas earlier each airline could offer only four to five flights per day for traveling from Istanbul to Baku and back, now the number has reached a total of nine for each carrier.</p><p><span></span>We have significantly increased the capacity of connecting to destinations included on the route network of both airlines outside of Baku and Istanbul. We have enhanced the possibility of registering passengers and their baggage all the way to the final destination when implementing joint flights by Turkish Airlines and Azerbaijan Airlines. As a result of this agreement, AZAL has gained access to an extended network of routes within Turkey, which are popular in Azerbaijan. Turkish Airlines, in turn, now has the ability to use AZAL's extensive agent network of air traffic on the territory of Azerbaijan.</p><h4><br>What have been major impacts of first transatlantic flight from Baku to New York on the air travel industry in Azerbaijan and region? </h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijan is the only country in the region to operate direct and non-stop passenger flights to the US. This achievement is underpinned by the hard work of many services and departments of Azerbaijan's Civil Aviation, which was carried out over the past several years. An audit by the US Federal Aviation Administration awarded the Civil Aviation Administration of Azerbaijan the highest first category, giving it the right to carry out flights to the US. The first such flight was carried out on September 24th, 2014. </p><p>It was implemented by the comfortable Airbus A-340, which was specifically bought for this purpose. AZAL has connected the continents; thus, opening a new chapter in the history of civil aviation of Azerbaijan. Unfortunately, direct passenger traffic between Baku and New York is not sufficient to fill the free passenger capacity, although the opening of a direct flight does stimulate the emergence of a new segment for this market; however, New York flights are perfectly integrated into other AZAL destinations—Tehran, Tbilisi, Tel Aviv, and Aktau, and most of the passengers on the flight now are transfer ones. A special role in this is played by the new terminal of Heydar Aliyev International Airport, where transfer passengers are provided with a high level of comfort and service when changing flights. Thus, AZAL has made a confident step toward asserting Baku as an air transport hub of continental importance. Direct non-stop flights to New York are an important event in the modern history of AZAL and mark the transition to a new and qualitatively higher level of development.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the most important service that you provide?</h4><p><span></span>Since we are a logistics company, we provide all sorts of freight transportation services. When the company was launched, we provided airfreight services only. Today, we provide a full range of transportation services, including charter freight services, container freight services, railway freight services, and multimodal freight services. When we meet a potential customer, we offer tailor-made turnkey freight transportation solutions. It is economically practical for businesses to work with us. However, rail and road are the transportation modes that are most in demand. Road freight transportation services are a major contributor to our revenues, because there is a huge demand for fast delivery. The price also contributes to that; it is more economically practical to hire a truck to deliver goods as opposed to a jet. It makes sense to wait for five or six days rather than pay 10 times more and get your cargo the same day. </p><h4>What are your competitive advantages?</h4><p><span></span>There are many logistics companies in Baku. Everyone focuses on a particular segment of the market. Some companies focus on providing airfreight services, while others focus on road freight. There is no single company in the market apart from us that focuses equally on every segment. On top of that, we have a strong business culture and great talent. Human capital is the key to a company's success. Our employees' wages are well above the average and are among the highest in Azerbaijan.</p><h4><br>How would you describe your client portfolio?</h4><p><span></span>Approximately 40% of our clients are Azerbaijani businesses, which is a significant amount given the number of logistics companies in Azerbaijan. Our service portfolio is diversified as we cater for about 60% of exports and about 35% of imports by air, and 40%-45% of imports by land, which is 70%-75% of the American, European, and Turkish imports. Some of our customers are international furniture and electronics stores, and we also deliver food and beverages to the Four Seasons Hotel. There are only a few companies that cater for international logistics, because it requires a high level of expertise in customs clearance procedures. </p><h4>Baku is hosting the First European Games in 2015. How can your company contribute to, and benefit from, the event?</h4><p><span></span>Every major event carried out in Azerbaijan creates opportunities and encourages business development. There is a lot of equipment that needs to be brought into the country for the games, and we also import machinery for the industry. We work in partnership with the European Games Committee and have a subsidiary company that provides land freight services mainly within Azerbaijan. We have also partnered with major global companies, one of them being UTI.</p><h4><br>What further opportunities are there in the transport sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>I have run a comparative market analysis on Germany, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey. Logistics is a fast-moving industry and a great contributor to the economy. One of the most recent achievements has been the Kars-Tbilisi-Baku railway. It will allow for a reduction in costs, and will greatly boost the development of the transport sector. In addition, we have invested a huge amount of money in developing our warehouse facilities.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on government efforts to stimulate investment?</h4><p><span></span>The government has always encouraged the private sector to strengthen relations with developed economies. There are a number of incentives to draw international attention to Azerbaijan. One of them is the European Games in Baku. There are many things happening in the oil and gas sector. The leaders of the country adopted a balanced and sensible approach to developing the country's economy, and ensured every investor can have their projects realized. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the opportunities that the First European Games in 2015 have provided in promoting Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>For many years, it has been the European Olympic Committee's dream to arrange continental multi-sport Games for Europe. Although the Olympic movement has its roots Europe, a European level all-encompassing sporting event was not in place in the continent, unlike in Asia or other regions. To an extent, it was unfair. We are now just less than five months away from realizing this dream. On June 12, the Opening Ceremony of the European Games will take place in Baku, Azerbaijan, signaling the start of 17 days of competition between more than 6,000 athletes from all 50 EOC member countries. Sport has a unique role to promote peace, tolerance, and understanding by bringing people together across boundaries, cultures, and religions. Sport also stands for human values such as respect for your opponent, acceptance of binding rules, teamwork, and fairness, all of which are contained in the Charter of United Nations. UNESCO described sport and physical education as a “fundamental right for all." We believe that Baku Games 2015 will open a new page in Europe's sports history and will create new perspectives and opportunities for cooperation.</p><h4>It was announced in 2014 that the Seventh Global Forum of the UN Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC) will be held in 2016 in Baku. What is Azerbaijan's main objective in this forum?</h4><p><span></span>Over the past few years, the UNAOC has made a valuable contribution to the strengthening of dialogue among different civilizations. This is key for ensuring peace, sustainable development, building tolerance, and deepening mutual understanding. Azerbaijan has always fought against defamation of religions, and it is critical to stress the importance of religious and cultural tolerance. Azerbaijan enjoys membership of both the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and European institutions. Being a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society, Azerbaijan seeks to contribute to the dialogue of civilizations through important initiatives and activities serving a better understanding between different cultures and religions. Over the last few years, Azerbaijan has hosted numerous events, such as world forums on intercultural and humanitarian dialogue. The first European Games in 2015 and Islamic Solidarity Games in 2017 are also testimonies to this. Having the intention to further contribute to dialogue among civilizations, the government has offered to host the Seventh UNAOC Global Forum in Baku in 2016, and this offer was supported by UNAOC Group of Friends.</p><h4>What are the most notable partnerships and achievements made by the Ministry in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijan conducts a principled, consistent, and independent foreign policy. We have cooperated with the European and Euro-Atlantic institutions, strengthening economic and energy security, developing transport corridors, and promoting a pluralistic democracy. The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict remains a major challenge and undermines regional peace and security. At the meetings of the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2014, some positive indications were observed toward the settlement of conflict, at the initiatives of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi, US State Secretary John Kerry in Wales, and French President François Hollande in Paris. After the Paris meeting, François Hollande called on Armenia and Azerbaijan to begin working on a Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs made a statement in Basel calling for the beginning of negotiations on CPA as soon as possible. In the face of these positive steps, Armenia has resorted to provocations to undermine the negotiations. The July-August incidents and the large-scale military exercises in the occupied territories were signs of this. For the peaceful settlement of the conflict, the armed forces of Armenia must be withdrawn from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. To maintain positive relationships with our neighbors is our priority. Building on the successful bilateral cooperation model, Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey, Azerbaijan-Iran-Turkey, and Azerbaijan-Turkmenistan-Turkey, trilateral cooperation frameworks are being developed. European countries are our traditional partners and will remain so in the upcoming decade. The mobility of our citizens in a well-managed and secure environment is an important element of the Eastern Partnership, and, therefore, we signed mobility partnership, visa facilitation, and readmission agreements. Another development in our relations with the EU has been the signature of the protocol on Azerbaijan's participation in EU programs. This will enable Azerbaijan to have greater access to a range of EU programs. We look forward to increasing cooperation between Azerbaijani institutions and the relevant EU agencies. We are also actively involved in the UN, CoE, Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Non-Aligned Movement, and the OSCE. Azerbaijan took over the Chairmanship of the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers from Austria in May 2014. Azerbaijan has assumed its Chairmanship for the first time since its accession to the Council of Europe in 2001.</p><h4>How important is Azerbaijan's relationship with the UNDP?</h4><p><span></span>Strengthening cooperation with the UNDP is highly important, as it has been active in our country for more than 20 years. Initially, the UNDP activities in Azerbaijan were focused on the provision of early recovery program, especially to refugees and internally displaced persons affected by the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. Currently, the UNDP's role in Azerbaijan has shifted toward national objectives, such as the development of the non-oil sector, diversification of economy, and ensuring sustainable development. In close partnership with the government, the UNDP strives to strengthen the many aspects of Azerbaijan's economic, social, and cultural development. As an obvious example of excellent bilateral relationship, on October 1-4, 2014, Helen Clark, the UNDP Administrator, visited Azerbaijan to further expand ongoing cooperation in the fields of mutual interest and explore new possibilities for collaboration between Azerbaijan and the UNDP. During her visit, she held meetings with President Ilham Aliyev and several ministers. In these meetings, Clark welcomed policy choices that allowed the country to transform its natural resource wealth into human capital. She also attended the fourth annual Baku International Humanitarian Forum held in October 2014, and gave a lecture at ADA University. In order to further strengthen strategic cooperation, the UNDP and the government will continue to work together.</p><h4>Azerbaijan recently met with Georgia and Turkey in Kars to discuss regional cooperation. How important are these ties for Azerbaijan, both politically and economically?</h4><p>Kars was the Fourth Trilateral Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. To ensure the realization of such cooperation we adopted in the 2013 Batumi meeting, the Trilateral Sectoral Cooperation Action Plan for 2013-15, which includes detailed tasks and projects, was enacted. This cooperation serves our common purposes of strengthening stability in the region, increasing welfare of the three countries, and creating a more favorable environment for regional projects and investments. This cooperation is based on the strategic partnership, good neighborliness, mutual trust, as well as respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, and inviolability of internationally recognized borders. Such a format is important for holding consultations on issues that are of common interest and is also necessary for advancing cooperation. It is necessary to underline that the first trilateral summit of the Presidents of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey held on May 6th, 2014 in Tbilisi, confirmed the commitment to further advance this cooperation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>AzGroup has a range of businesses in many different sectors. How has it contributed to the preparations for the First European Games?</h4><p><span></span>The inaugural European Games in Baku is providing Azerbaijan with a perfect opportunity to showcase the wealth of potential that our Republic has. Azerbaijan has a great deal to offer and it is our job to ensure that the international community can appreciate the high level of development that the country has achieved. For AzGroup, it is an opportunity to demonstrate the range of areas that we now successfully cover. Currently, AzGroup has contributed in providing building materials and heavy machineries for the building of venues, stadiums, and the village for the athletes' accommodation. The AzFPCo, our dairy product factory, won the tender for supplying all dairy products to be consumed by the athletes, and will sell its products in all the venues throughout the Games. It is an excellent chance for us to promote our business and showcase the quality of our products to the large number of visitors that will be in Baku for the Games. </p><h4>In January, 2015 was announced as the Year of Agriculture. What does this government focus mean for AzGroup?</h4><p><span></span>The Year of Agriculture is crucial for the modernization and continuing development of a sector that has so much potential. It is not only a recognition of the possibilities in agriculture, but also a reminder of the natural resources that Azerbaijan can provide both to the internal and external market. We hope that many farms will be built and that the President's instructions will be carried out in terms of sector wide development and modernization. For AzGroup, our dairy factory has a great demand for fresh milk; therefore, there is excellent potential during the year to be successful from the point of view of agriculture. Considering that AzFPCo is also the sponsor for the first European Games, AzGroup can contribute a great deal to this government initiative.</p><h4>What role can AzGroup play in developing Azerbaijan's burgeoning export market in the non-oil sector?</h4><p><span></span>The non-oil sector is fundamental to the development of Azerbaijan's economy, and we are fully committed to supporting this. Azerbaijan is in a strong position to overcome the decreasing oil price by focusing on non-oil sector development and promoting a strong export market in sectors, such as agriculture and industry. AzGroup of Companies is now exporting dairy and wood products throughout the region as well as to Gulf state countries. Our products are highly valued in the global community, and it is likely that our export market will increase significantly in the coming years.</p><h4>Focusing now on Caspian Fish Company, plans to produce caviar and introduce more sturgeon into the Caspian Sea were mentioned in 2014. How are these objectives progressing?</h4><p><span></span>Caspian Fish Company Azerbaijan works in two directions: manufacturing of caviar and other fish products, and promoting reproduction and fish farming. The company is well on its way to advance the plan of restocking the Caspian Sea with sturgeon fingerlings. As the stock in the sea is on the verge of extinction, this is an important project both for Azerbaijan and for the region. If we can make a positive contribution to this, we can not only support environmental concerns in the Caspian, but also develop Azerbaijan's caviar market. One of the advantages of this product is that it is unique. Caviar is a famous delicacy, but Caspian Sea caviar is something that we are eager to produce on a large scale. The Caspian Sea historically has a lucrative fishing industry. However, over fishing caused a great many problems in the 20th Century, which harmed the ecosystem in the Caspian Sea. Caspian Fish Company has already made great progress in reinstating the Caspian Sea's fishing business according to international standards. In the coming years, we will continue our work in this direction, developing a sector of the economy that has great potential, while protecting the Caspian Sea and its inhabitants.</p><h4>At what stage are preparations for the opening of the ISUZU Plant?</h4><p><span></span>Our ISUZU plant is programmed to start assembly by the beginning of September 2015. We are hoping that our partnership with ISUZU will allow us to export ISUZU trucks to other CIS countries as our assembly capacity is well beyond the demand in Azerbaijan; our negotiations with ISUZU are promising. ISUZU is already renowned in Azerbaijan due to the high quality of modern buses that are used, meaning this is an important step for us. This is also an important step for Azerbaijan as it is advancing the automotive sector to a new level. AzGroup is innovative and our work with ISUZU should be able to boost nationwide development in this area.</p><h4>What new projects are being established under AzGroup in the coming years, and are there any new external markets that are being explored?</h4><p><span></span>Our AzEDU Company is investing more than $60 million into building a school for 2,500 students from kindergarten to university. The school's enrolment will begin September 2016. Education is an important investment for AzGroup due to the high percentage of youth in Azerbaijan currently. We are striving to cater for the future of our country by providing the best possible education, not only at university level but also at kindergarten and primary levels. There are many opportunities in Azerbaijan at the moment in a variety of sectors; however, it is fundamental for us to focus on education in order to support the development of youth.</p><h4>How would you assess the investment opportunities for foreign and domestic corporations to work with AzGroup and its subsidiary companies?</h4><p><span></span>We always welcome opportunities from any foreign or domestic investor to work alongside AzGroup of Companies. AzGroup consists of 24 different companies, and each one has its own unique product and service, providing any potential partner with excellent opportunities to cooperate in a lively and diverse business environment. With such a diverse portfolio of subsidiaries, we are able to cater to the needs of any investor, both domestic and international. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of Porsche's major sales activities in Azerbaijan in 2014, and what are your targets for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Overall, 2014 was extremely successful for Porsche Azerbaijan. We organized several launch events in order to showcase some new products, such as the new Cayenne and Macan. In addition, we are continuously organizing local and international driving events in order to maintain our relationships with Porsche drivers; for example, Porsche Road Show, which takes place almost every year. In the last year for the Road Show, we headed to one of the most beautiful cities of Azerbaijan, Shamakhi, with our clients. The aim of the event was to test some of the Porsche models and generally have a great time. Although 2014 was extremely successful for Porsche Center Baku, we are planning for an even higher sales volume for 2015. I would like to mention that the year 2015 is full of aims and objectives not only for Porsche, but for the whole of Azerbaijan. We are sure that Porsche Center Baku will present its development and improvement to all automobile fans. </p><h4><span></span>Porsche has introduced the Macan model as well as releasing several upgrades in 2014. How important have these been for sales in Azerbaijan over the last year? </h4><p><span></span>Porsche fans and customers always looked forward to any updates in the model range, because every time Porsche proves that excellence has no limits. It became obvious from our last presentations that Porsche is taking care of all its models. Regardless of size, speed, and design, they all truly remain a Porsche. New products, such as the Macan and the Cayenne S and Turbo, are overtaking competitive models by performance and design, and are helping to maintain high sales volumes. We are also expecting several improvements in our model range for 2015.</p><h4><span></span>Porsche increased global deliveries to customers from January to November 2014 to more than 169,000 vehicles. To what extent does this global growth apply to Porsche's success in Azerbaijan? </h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijan also provides significant support to Porsche's development in the region. One of the reasons for this is the fact that Baku is a modern and fashionable city, which motivates its citizens to drive such beautiful cars as Porsche. The development of the city's infrastructure has highly influenced our sales volume. </p><h4><span></span>How would you assess Porsche sales in Azerbaijan compared with the rest of the region?</h4><p><span></span>We were less known as Porsche Azerbaijan in the region when we were newly established. However, we managed to introduce the Porsche brand to citizens in the best way and rapidly increase our sales volume. Nowadays, Azerbaijan is one of the fastest developing markets for Porsche and one of the best for the region. I hope that this tendency will remain in an upward curve in the future.</p><h4><span></span>Porsche has already hosted prominent events, such as the City Challenge and the Baku World Challenge in Azerbaijan. Looking ahead to the First European Games in 2015 and the Formula One in 2016, what opportunities do such events provide for Porsche?</h4><p><span></span>As Porsche focuses on sport cars, participating in a range of Race competitions and winning several world awards, we are extremely happy to observe this growing attention to auto sport. Therefore, as Porsche has always supported sport events in Azerbaijan, we will do our best to support the upcoming European Games and Formula One.</p><h4><span></span>How would you assess the importance of events such as these in the development of Azerbaijan's non-oil sectors?</h4><p><span></span>In our opinion, the events taking place in Azerbaijan have a huge impact on the country's economic development and non-oil sectors in particular. All the novelties in Azerbaijan pave the way for country's worldwide recognition, which is the result of the ideal politics of our President HE Ilham Aliyev. We are sure that the President is doing his best for our country's development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The World Bank's 2014 report on Azerbaijan has welcomed new regulatory reforms. How would you assess the development of Azerbaijan's economy in 2014, and what has been the primary role of the Central Bank in supporting economic growth and initiating new reforms? </h4><p><span></span>Economic growth was 2.8% in 2014, primarily driven by the non-oil sector, which posted 7% growth. Overall, our national economy has grown about 28%, and the non-oil sector has grown 57% since the onset of the 2008 global economic and financial crisis. The economy is being successfully diversified. The non-oil sector accounted for over 63% of GDP in 2014. The targeted policies conducted in the framework of the declared Industrial Year made a positive contribution to high production in the processing industry in 2014. High economic growth of the non-oil sector resulted in over 100,000 new jobs, as well as over 82,000 permanent jobs. The Central Bank's conjuncture surveys suggest that the Consumer Confidence Index remained high. Investments to the country economy amounted to AZN17.6 billion with 66% contribution to the non-oil sector. Consumer spending rose 12% in 2014, and the size of commodities sold in the consumer market jumped 10%. The Central Bank survey among households also suggests that the Consumer Confidence Index remains high. The country's foreign position strengthens with sustainable economic growth. In 2014, the current account of the balance of payments of Azerbaijan had a significant surplus. The size of export prevails over that of import by 2.4 times. Foreign exchange reserves further increased 2% or AZN1.2 billion up to AZN51 billion in 2014, which constitutes about 70% of GDP. Our country has been in the top 20 in the world for several years in a row in terms of this indicator. Strategic foreign exchange reserves exceed the external debt by eight times; sufficient to cover three-year commodities and services import. Currently, the Azerbaijani economy accounts for 75% of the overall economy of the South Caucasus. World Bank estimations suggest that per capita GDP in Azerbaijan surpasses the global average indicator by 19% and the average indicator of middle-income countries by 77%. In 2014, the Central Bank targeted single-digit inflation and financial stability of the banking sector, and a higher role of banks in economic growth. Macroeconomic stability in the country is the key to tailoring high competitive ratings of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has been in top 10 in terms of macroeconomic stability for several years in a row. The exchange rate policy is targeting macroeconomic sustainability and competitiveness of the country in light of the situation with the balance of payments. Banks kept capitalizing, and the Central Bank exercised tighter supervision of lowly capitalized banks. The banks' aggregate capital has doubled from $2.7 billion up to $5.5 billion since the capitalization decision (August 2012). The size of capital of banks, owning 99% of sector's assets surpasses $63.7 million. The highly liquid banking sector meets its liabilities and executes settlements on an uninterrupted basis. The system's instant liquidity ratio prevails at more than twice the threshold. The qualitative indicators of banks assets are satisfactory. In 2014, the banking sector, which concentrates 90% of financial system assets accross the country, continued to deepen financially. The sector's assets rose 23.5% and reached 78.4% of GDP. Currently, the financial depth of the Azerbaijani banking sector corresponds to that of the countries with a medium-sized banking systems. Over the reporting year, the bank took a number of regulatory measures in light of the existing dynamics and potential risks in consumer loans. Accordingly, the growth rate of consumer loans YoY decreased 1.9 times to 21%, and dropped to 15%, if mortgage loans are skipped, while the absolute volume of car loans declined by 33%. The share of consumer loans in the lending portfolio in Azerbaijan lags behind the average indicator for EBRD countries. Around $123 million worth of mortgage loans were issued in 2014, as a result of which the lending portfolio of the Azerbaijan Mortgage Fund currently is $803 million, with mortgagors numbering 15,800. Assigned banks, insurance companies, appraisers, and the Mortgage Fund are integrated into the E-mortgage system now. The Central Bank did not overlook the development of e-services, which is critical in expanding access to financial services. Currently, 23 banks render internet banking and 15 banks offer mobile banking services. Confidence in the banking sector was much higher in 2014. Corporate deposits increased 36% to $10.6 billion, while deposits of the population rose 12.4% to $9.2 billion. Deposits of individuals in manat increased 14%. Deposits in regions jumped 13.5%. There are 473 depositors per 1,000 people in the country. Per capita deposits reached $970, and bank accounts of individuals number 6.4 million. Interest rates continued to drop, aided by additional actions by the Central Bank.</p><h4>HE President Aliyev announced that 2015 is to be the Year of Agriculture. What prospects does this sector hold and how can CBAR support it?</h4><p><span></span>More attention needs to be paid to the agricultural sector of the country this year in terms of goals of the Azerbaijan 2020: Vision into the Future development concept and in diversification of the non-oil sector. Agricultural reforms underway have paved the way for dynamic growth of the sector. The agriculture sector entered a new quality phase by determining strategic goals and institutional changes to the development of agriculture. Expansion of the financial sector and easier access to loans have played a crucial role in the growth of the agriculture. Bank loans to agriculture have increased 18 times over the past 10 years. NBCIs also actively support the sector through loans. The broader regional network of banks and NBCIs significantly enhanced access of agricultural businesses to financial services. Actions by the Central Bank to increase the role of the financial sector in economic diversification, as well as measures to stimulate business lending by credit institutions will further contribute to development of the agricultural sector. The CBAR will continue active cooperation with government and international financial-credit institutions on measures to expand lending to the agricultural sector.  </p><h4>What steps have been taken by the CBAR to strengthen the transparency of financial institutions in the country?</h4><p><span></span>The Bank has set a requirement on disclosure of actual annual interest rates for consumers of banking services for comparability purposes. The application of this instrument advocates more transparent banking services to customers and promotes healthier more competitive environments. A new methodological framework on responsible lending has been developed to strengthen the transparency in bank-customer relations, which aims at determining behavioral standards of banks, eliminating negative business practices, and increasing social responsibility of credit institutions. </p><h4>What is the potential for the development of Islamic Finance in Azerbaijan's financial sector?</h4><p><span></span>Islamic Finance has recently become more popular not only in Muslim nations, but also in western countries. However, some countries have not yet decided whether to apply Islamic finance. Thus, the implementation of Islamic banking in the traditional banking context requires a dedicated legal framework and regulatory environment. There are no unified regulatory principles for Islamic Finance in a global setting so far. In order to develop Islamic banking, a necessary regulatory base should support it and the regulative framework be adapted to the specifications of Islamic banking products. In terms of universal banking growth, Azerbaijan is also studying the relevant practice of advanced economies, and consulting with foreign experts and partners. The key goal here is to study application perspectives of Islamic banking, determine the demand for this segment, and measure its economic effectiveness.  </p><h4>What is your outlook for the opportunities provided by the First European Games in Baku?</h4><p><span></span>The inaugural European Games will attract the attention of world to Azerbaijan, once more manifesting this country's great role in advocating sports. The Games, as well as other sports events in Azerbaijan, will further boost the country's reputation and ensure a much faster attraction of foreign investment to the country's non-oil sector. Moreover, the visit of a large number of sportsmen, guests, and tourists to Azerbaijan, where supreme human values such as dialog among civilizations and multiculturalism are of utmost importance.Baku has become one of the most beautiful cities of Europe, manifesting cultural values of both East and West in its ancient and modern features. Participation in this spectacular sporting event will further stimulate the development of tourism. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Looking back on 2014, what were the most significant developments and changes for the Ministry of Energy?</h4><p>In the Black Sea region, Azerbaijan and Russia are the only two countries that do not depend on energy imports. We are net exporters, exporting around 35 million tons per year through our main export pipeline Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan, and a smaller pipeline, Baku-Novorossiysk. We export around 2 million tons of petroleum products and 9 bcm of gas. The country exchanges electric energy with Russia and sells electric power to Georgia. We also have the potential for the exchange of electric power with Iran. The main aspect of 2014 was the development and implementation of the Southern Gas Corridor and the construction of the Trans Anatolian pipeline (TANAP). On September 20, we held a ceremony for the foundation of the new corridor with the presence of all ministers, presidents, and government representatives involved in the project. This new gas pipeline is one of the key European projects of the 21st Century and will allow us to reach a greater European market. We have worked on the Southern Gas Corridor through four interconnected projects: TANAP, Shah Deniz II, the extension of the South Caucasus pipeline Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum, and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). The Shah Deniz pipeline is 25% complete. Our first gas delivery to Turkey is planned for 2019, with 6 bcm, and by 2020 we will start to supply Europe with 200 bcm. As of the beginning of 2015, 25% of complex technical works have been completed, which include the construction of buildings and two platforms connected by bridge, drilling of 26 sub sea wells and their connection to the platforms, pipelines, and their equipment. Occupying 3,800km, it is highly complex and one of our most unique projects undertaken thus far.</p><h4>There have been significant changes in foreign investment into Azerbaijan's energy sector, at Shah Deniz 2 for example. What impact does it have on the sector?</h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijan now has more internal investment as the country has become financially stable. The main share of foreign investments come from previous contracts. Now we are investing ourselves. The entire Southern Gas Pipeline project is close to $45 billion.  Shah Deniz 2 requires an investment of $25 billion, and Azerbaijan will contribute $2.5 billion, considering that 10% of capital investment is ours. In the TANAP, 58% belongs to the country, and in the TAP we have 20% of shares. As for Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli, we own 10% and have provided the $2 billion capital investment. Many power stations are being constructed in Azerbaijan. In the past six months, we managed to completely update energy production, abolish outdated power stations, and modernize them through our own investments. We are attracting the European Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, and Bank of Asia through the provision of certain benefits, in order to implement a range of upgrades. The government debt of Azerbaijan is minimal, around 7% of GDP, and our loans do not affect the financial position of the country. Foreign investments are useful as they not only put business in line with the global environment, but also demonstrate the extent of foreign interest.</p><h4><br>The global oil price has had some difficulties in the last 12 months. How has the Ministry of Energy combated it so far?</h4><p><strong></strong>Around 90% of Azerbaijan's cash flow depends on oil and gas production. However, we are able to provide for ourselves. We have the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ), created by Heydar Aliyev in 1999, in anticipation of any crisis. Oil is not just our treasure, but also the treasure of future generations. All profit from oil products extracted at fields holding foreign investments must go to SOFAZ, and the main cash flow from production sharing agreements (PSAs) with foreign companies accumulates there. Azerbaijan is interested in reasonable oil prices in the future and for many years we have been holding negotiations with OPEC countries. Many experts agree that a price just above $80 could have satisfied both exporters and consumers. Right now, the real price is $50-60, and we are not seeing the same profits as in 2014. This will diminish the volume of our currency, but will not damage us significantly. A brief period will not be too problematic, but if this situation upholds much longer we will have to take more decisive measures.</p><h4>How is the Ministry of Energy involved in Azerbaijan's main event for the year, the First European Games</h4><p><span></span>These games are important not just for Azerbaijan, but also for Europe. For Azerbaijan, it is important to receive guests and show how the country is developing. Each individual is dedicated to the Games, not only the ministries and government bodies involved. Our task is to guarantee power supply for the sporting events. For the Ministry of Energy, the Games is an opportunity to test our power-supply systems in extreme conditions and serious circumstances. It is a prestigious event to host.</p><h4>Looking ahead, what are your major objectives for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>We started a very important reconstruction program of the entire petrochemical industry that will extend to 2030. This work aims to change the structure of the industry and move petrochemical plants from Baku to other territories. We are thinking about environmental protection and the rational use of natural resources. If we compare the index of energy resource supply by country, Azerbaijan has a high position on a global scale. Productivity in Azerbaijan is higher than consumption. If the world has gas supply for 60 years, then Azerbaijan has 100 years; the same with oil. The existing infrastructure is constantly being upgraded, and we do not expect any problems. Even if oil and gas prices remain low for some time, projects in the energy sector will not slow down, and we are planning to maintain oil extraction at a stable level. As for gas, we will add new extraction fields and increase production, introduce new deposits, and continue with our investment strategy with foreign companies. It is still too early to talk about radical changes in structure, tactics or strategy, but we have a priority plan to focus on the implementation of the Southern Gas Corridor by 2020. We are optimistic about 2015. <span></span></p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Within the last year, we have observed some changes in the price of petrol. What strategy was developed by AzPetrol to cope with this instability?</h4><p>A change in the price of petrol should not affect the consumer market considerably, thanks to the creation of necessary conditions and the development of entrepreneurship in the private sector. Any step undertaken by the Azerbaijani government, including the determination of energy carriers, is based on careful analysis of the real market and the economic field. We hope that the possible change in the price of petrol will not affect the investment plans of AzPetrol too heavily. The influence of a decrease of fuel processing was not felt in the consumer market and has not caused troubles for the companies engaging in the wholesale and retail sale of fuel. A result of this economic policy is that our company has been enabled to conform to European standards and to supply our consumers with a high quality of petroleum fuel without the help of any intermediaries.</p><h4>The energy market in Azerbaijan is highly competitive. What strategy is developed by AzPetrol to have a leading role in the market?</h4><p><span></span>The aim of AzPetrol is to preserve its position in the private sector of Azerbaijan, to develop, and to contribute to the progress of the national economy. To this end, we have to widen the activity scope of the company, encompass our regions completely, create new job openings, secure the multi-branch strategy of the service fields, study innovative technologies and their application, train personnel with potential, as well as carry out other important matters. It is not easy to obtain the position that AzPetrol has and to preserve it for the long term in the Azerbaijani economic environment. Our main target is to produce a high-quality product and to secure consumer satisfaction. Our successes are stipulated and possible thanks to the fact that we have established a managerial system that rests upon the modern leading technologies of the world, high-quality services, and professional personnel. We are not the only competitor in this field, but we strive to be the best.</p><h4>Azerbaijan is looking towards the national target of 2020. What role will the energy market, and in particular Azpetrol, play in reaching this vision?</h4><p><span></span>Despite the steps undertaken to create and use alternative energy resources, it is no secret that oil and oil products will continue to be major energy sources over the long term. From this standpoint, all countries require reliable and sustainable energy sources. At the same time, merely possessing an energy resource is not sufficient, if one lacks the specific mechanisms and instruments to exploit that resource, enabling the energy resources to be marketable as a consumer product and making it accessible for the client is of great importance. The position of AzPetrol with the largest network of petrol stations in the republic has to be taken into account as one of the important economic subjects of the country.</p><h4>Energy consumption in Europe now far exceeds energy production. How important is Azerbaijan in supporting international energy demand?</h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijan is a leading state in the region and its international weight is considerable. The large-scale projects implemented in the Caucasus region would not be achievable without the participation of Azerbaijan. The important and convenient geopolitical position of Azerbaijan, with its rich oil beds, availability of leading enterprises for processing the oil products and infrastructures, are crucial for the country as an energy supplier. Thus, Azerbaijan will remain a stable pole for the world economy, given the global need for oil and oil products as core energy sources. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[added-volume]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the air transport industry developed in Kuwait over the past few years?</h4><p>The local air transport industry has grown significantly over the past few years. Since we adopted an open skies policy at Kuwait International Airport, we have seen a great increase in the volume of passenger aircraft and cargo traffic. In 2014, around 10.3 million passengers used Kuwait International Airport, an increase of 10% from 2013. We also had 85,000 aircraft using the airport, again a 9% increase over 2013. Revenues of the Kuwaiti air transport market reached around $1.9 billion last year. Most of that revenue was from direct ticket sales through travel agencies or through airline offices in Kuwait, not including tickets sold on the internet. We also saw a cargo increase of about 7% in 2014 compared to 2013, reaching 189 million kilograms of cargo. So we have seen large increases across the board. That has also brought challenges with it, because we now need to upgrade Kuwait International Airport so it can sustain these kinds of figures. Various expansion projects are underway for our airport facilities. One of the biggest projects involves a new passenger terminal, to be undertaken by the Ministry of Public Works. The project is still in the tendering process. Once completed, it will accommodate up to 25 million passengers in the first stage. We at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation are taking on another project that involves renewing the two existing runways and constructing a third, as well as a new air control tower. There will be new taxiways as well, and even a new cargo city at the airport. These are huge and highly anticipated projects.</p><h4>Where do you see room for improvement within Kuwait's civil aviation sector, and what are your priorities at the Directorate?</h4><p>We have to deal with this expected growth during the next 10 years in Kuwait. Air transport and air traffic is forecast to grow at least 6% per year. One of our priorities is to create a company that will be charged with the management and operation of Kuwait International Airport. The belief is that an independent company can act in a more flexible and commercial manner under the supervision of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.</p><div class="quote">“The private sector has ample opportunities to participate in these development projects."</div><h4>What opportunities do you see for further investment from the private sector to meet these growing demands?</h4><p>The private sector has ample opportunities to participate in these development projects, and also in offering services at Kuwait International Airport, such as handling and passenger services. The company we will create to manage Kuwait International Airport will be able to sign and make contracts and agreements with other airport operators and service providers, so they will have access to international expertise in terms of managing the airport.</p><h4>How do cooperation agreements like the open skies policy help contribute to Kuwait's economic growth and enhance cooperation in the region and internationally?</h4><p>The open skies policy is a base for us to expand our bilateral air transport relationships with other countries. We have witnessed an increase in the number of airlines serving our airport, around 45 international carriers in all. Also, Kuwait International Airport is linked to an expanded network of expanded networks, and that brings more choices for passengers to select suitable air transport carriers. It also brings reduced airfares due to increased competition in the market to the advantage of the passenger. We believe that when airlines increase their operations at any airport, it contributes to the national economy, as airlines pay charges and fees to the airport, they buy catering for flights, they buy fuel, and they pay for office rental and services at the airport.</p><h4>What message would you give the business community in terms of how the DGCA is supporting air traffic growth?</h4><p>We are supporting that growth, and we think there will be more opportunities for business investors to come here and utilize these opportunities in the construction and navigational equipment projects we have at hand, as well as services projects that we will also be offered at Kuwait International Airport.</p><h4>What are your main expectations as you look ahead to 2016?</h4><p>We understand the challenge of increased passenger volumes. Our airport has to be expanded and we have to be ready to face this growth and support it. In that respect, a support passenger terminal will be built with a completion date of 2016. The scheme will be tendered before the end of 2015. The support terminal should be constructed within a year. We hope this facility will accommodate any further growth in air transport.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what areas are Australia and Lebanon currently cooperating and what is your outlook for the future of the relations between the two countries?</h4><p>Australia has a warm relationship with Lebanon, based on strong ties between our two peoples. Lebanese migrants have enriched Australia's society with their enterprise, civic spirit, and vibrant culture. Today, Lebanon faces grave challenges, as it hosts an enormous population of refugees and is faced with rising extremism in the region. I welcome the generosity and fortitude demonstrated by the Lebanese people at this time. Australia stands by Lebanon and is a committed supporter of its sovereignty and prosperity. Countering the threat of terrorist groups such as ISIS is a priority for countries around the world, including both Australia and Lebanon. Our main areas of cooperation with Lebanon currently include defense, law enforcement, and counter-terrorism. Australia and Lebanon are both members of the international anti-Da'esh coalition. Australia offers a number of places on Australia-based joint training courses to selected members of the Lebanese Armed Forces. Australia has also participated in the UN Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) since 1956, in Israel, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. The Council of Australian-Arab Relations has supported cultural exchanges between Australia and Lebanon. In 2014 the Council supported the Adelaide Festival to feature the work of Beirut-based artists and filmmakers Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige. Our relationship with Lebanon is strong, but I believe there is scope to do more, including boosting trade and investment. A number of Australian companies are considering the potential of investing in Lebanon's oil and gas sector.</p><h4>What were the main highlights of your visit to Lebanon last year?</h4><p>I visited Lebanon as Australia's Foreign Minister in April 2014. During my visit, I had a highly productive discussion with HE Gebran Bassil, Lebanon's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Emigrants, on the strategic challenges we face in the Middle East. I highlighted Australia's strong and continuing support for Lebanon as it addresses the challenges caused by the continuing humanitarian crisis in Syria. The conflicts in the Middle East today are the worst we have seen in many years, and during my visit I had the opportunity to see firsthand the effect on Lebanon. I met with asylum seekers, UNHCR, and UNICEF representatives at a processing camp to discuss Australian support for those affected by the Syrian crisis. At the time, I also welcomed the formation of a Lebanese government, which was a crucial step for stability. Lebanon needs strong and united leadership and Australia encourages Lebanon's politicians to work together toward this end.</p><div class="quote">“Australia has a warm relationship with Lebanon, based on strong ties between our two peoples."</div><h4>What support has Australia provided to help combat the Syria crisis?</h4><p>The conflict in Syria is the biggest humanitarian, peace, and security crisis facing the world today. Syria urgently needs a political solution to the conflict that can end the violence. Australia will continue to urge all parties to agree on an inclusive process, as outlined in the Geneva Communiqué, which allows the Syrian people to determine their country's future. Australia's response to the Syria crisis is one of our largest to a humanitarian emergency. Since 2011, the Australian government has provided $155.8 million in humanitarian assistance to help vulnerable people in Syria and its neighboring countries. More than half has been allocated to the regional response to assist Syrian refugees and their host communities, including $30.6 million earmarked specifically for Lebanon. Our assistance has delivered food, water, shelter, protection, health services, and education to communities in need. Australia recently announced a further $20 million in humanitarian assistance at the third international pledging conference for Syria hosted by the United Nations and the Government of Kuwait. This includes support for the World Food Programme and the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria, as well as UNHCR and Australian non-government organizations in Lebanon.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What contributions has Iskandar Malaysia made to the development of Johor and Malaysia to date?</h4><p>Johor has always been a modern and bustling city of economic activities and trade. Throughout history, it has been a gateway to both international trade and cultural exchange, and at the forefront of Malaysia's social, political and economic development. Iskandar Malaysia is a continuation of Johor's history of being at the forefront of change. With the existing strategic location, talent pool, and economic potential, Iskandar Malaysia was developed to fully tap the potential of Southern Johor. The approaches adopted must be aimed at attracting more talent and investment into the region. This would generate a concentration of businesses and people, forming a network that facilitates the free flow of ideas, innovation, and creativity to drive Iskandar Malaysia's economy. The development of livable communities that attract people to “live, work, and play" is an important factor that will influence further investments into Iskandar Malaysia. With the rise of urban conurbations throughout the world, this competition for funds and talent is a competition between large metropolitan areas, anchored by a city where economic activities are focused. Examples include the Greater Tokyo area, the world's largest urban conurbation, and, closer to home, Greater Kuala Lumpur. At the end of 2025, when Iskandar Malaysia reaches maturity, it is expected to have a population of three million people, 1.46 million jobs, cumulative investments of RM383 billion over the 20 years, and a GDP of $93.3 billion. We are well on our way to achieving this. The people are already experiencing the positive changes, such as increases in quality of life, education options, employment opportunities, and better infrastructure.</p><h4>The Prime Minister recently approved the 2014-2025 Comprehensive Development Plan for Iskandar Malaysia. What are the main elements of this?</h4><p>When the Iskandar Malaysia's Comprehensive Development Plan 2006-2025 (CDP) was drawn up and published in 2006, it had taken into consideration the development needs then and also pre-empted future requirements and concerns that are expected to arise due to the rapid development taking place. It consists of three domains, namely sustainability in the economic, social, and environmental context. In the enhanced Comprehensive Development Plan 2014-2025 (CDPii), we ensure that Iskandar Malaysia continues to be developed as a holistic eco-system. Wealth generation, resource optimization and low carbon, and wealth sharing and inclusiveness are the three main elements in developing the region. Wealth generation ensures a continuous, stable, and resilient income generation through regional economic growth resulting from high-skilled employment, higher productivity, and value creation. Yet, as this takes place, we have to ensure that natural and man-made resources are protected through their optimal use and smart growth. Alongside that, and if not most importantly, the Rakyat must be given the opportunity to participate in the wealth generation, indirectly contributing to regional and individual wealth. In the CDPii, five big moves have been identified to lead Iskandar Malaysia toward becoming a sustainable metropolis of international standing and they are Inclusive Iskandar Malaysia, Greening Iskandar Malaysia, Destination Iskandar Malaysia, Port Iskandar Malaysia, and Iskandar Malaysia Urban Observatory. These moves take into consideration all the blueprint strategies, programs, and initiatives, including the voices of communities that were obtained through public engagements with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local communities, the government, and private agencies.</p><div class="quote">“Johor has always been a modern and bustling city of economic activities and trade."</div><h4>What role do public-private partnerships (PPPs) play in the development of Iskandar?</h4><p>PPP projects are encouraged in Iskandar Malaysia to further stimulate and encourage private sector investments in development projects. Iskandar Malaysia is still growing and further enhancement and upgrading of infrastructure and services are key priorities to sustain the region's growth trajectory. An important aspect of PPP projects is good planning as this ensures that there is value for money, risk is shared equitably between the government and private sectors, and problems in implementation and operations are avoided. Well-planned projects ensure success and smooth delivery by the private sector. The fundamental pre-requisite for any PPP partnership is the sustainability of the project and its impact on the growth of a country. Some examples of PPP models that can be used are user-pay models such as build-operate-transfer (BOT) and land swap arrangements that are fair and equitable. To expedite the implementation of PPP projects to meet the critical need for infrastructure development, the government needs to play a more proactive role in identifying bankable PPP projects and offering them out to the private sector. Based on international best practices, this can be done in a competitive environment to bring out the most value-for-money and innovative PPP proposal. To this effect, IRDA is currently working closely with several agencies such as the Public Private Partnership Unit (UKAS) under the Prime Minister's Department, the Johor Economic Planning Unit, and local authorities to identify and implement bankable PPP initiatives, with several projects already in the pipeline. PPP has proven to be a viable method for the government to deliver public infrastructure and services in Iskandar Malaysia. Therefore, we hope that more PPP projects can be conceptualized, planned, and implemented in Iskandar Malaysia to set new benchmarks and standards toward global recognition. IRDA welcomes from the private sector any new innovative proposals in PPP that are sustainable and provide win-win solutions.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Eko Atlantic is the continent's most significant development. What about it was attractive?</h4><p>We saw Eko Atlantic as an ambitious project and that, for us, marked it as a grand opportunity. At the site Eko Atlantic now occupies, formerly known as Bar Beach, there was significant erosion over the years that, as recently as 2005, threatened all of Victoria Island. Eko Atlantic resulted as a solution to protect the shoreline of Victoria Island and also to create a city that would be well-planned as well as developed in accordance with 21st century best practices. Speaking from the perspective of investment, this project is a critical part of the transformation of Lagos, Nigeria, and Africa at large. As a result, Eko Development Company saw this as the perfect location to deploy our project, aptly named Azuri Peninsula.</p><h4>Azuri Peninsula is positioned as a luxury, mixed-used residential development. It is intended to be an address with a specific layout that includes shops and community areas. What factors influenced your design?</h4><p>What differentiates one real estate project from another is its functionality. For us, real estate is not just brick and mortar; it involves lives, sustainability, and its impact on the environment. We wanted to create a marina development better than any other, hence our choice of land within Eko Atlantic. We have taken time to ensure that our development meets different benchmarks, which included studies of other marina and destination developments such as Dubai, Los Angeles, Qatar, and so on, and considered the adaptability of those developments to our climate and culture.</p><div class="quote">“What differentiates one real estate project from another is its functionality."</div><h4>How will the legal differences from the rest of Lagos State, such as a free trade zone (FTZ), benefit not only Azuri Peninsula, but also the rest of Eko Atlantic?</h4><p>The FTZ, which is a federal government initiative, will give confidence to investors who want to live or transact business within Eko Atlantic. As a free trade zone, we will benefit from tax exemptions for materials that come into Eko Atlantic. We must bear in mind the impacts of these exemptions to the cost of construction as well as the finished product. From the perspective of a developer, that will give us reassurances that our projects will be competitive. If you take into account the cost of land and construction, one would expect our pricing to be exorbitant, but I can say that today the cost of our finished project will be competitive with costs in Victoria Island and Ikoyi in Lagos. The second consideration is that since Eko Atlantic City is governed by South Energyx, a municipality in its own right, and is exempt from the familiar day-to-day bureaucracy of Lagos State, and has its own streamlined system. The timeline of projects are shortened with the stamp of approval from the government. Confidence is constantly being built, and there is a steady stream of work at Eko Atlantic on a daily basis. It is set to be the first in-mind interface of cross border transactions, and a transparent means of building foreign confidence in Nigeria. It will be a point of capital and intellectual inflow that is tailored to private sector needs and one that matches its pace.</p><h4>What stage is the Azuri Peninsula project currently at in terms of construction?</h4><p>We are currently engaged with the piling stages of the development, which we began in January of 2015. We have, however, completed piling works for the first tower (Orun), 236 of them to be precise, and are at about 90% along with the second tower (Oban), with just 20 more piles outstanding as at June 2, 2015. In terms of timeline, we are very much on schedule and have begun making off-plan sales. By the end of 1Q2016, we will have finished the podium of the development.</p><h4>After the election, what changes have you seen in regards to business and investment, and what has been the general effect on Eko Atlantic?</h4><p>Around the time of elections there was considerable anxiety as with any election in Africa because of the transition from the incumbent party to the opposition. Thankfully, the process has been a smooth and successful one. After the election, the stock exchange went through the roof, which was tagged the “Buhari Boost" and that has helped the economy by reinstating confidence in the market. The international community has seen that Nigeria is not as volatile as was painted or as predicated by many to be. In the years ahead, I foresee stability and a further boost of confidence in Nigerian economy, which will translate to increased FDI inflows.</p><h4>Would reform in the petroleum industry be a boon to Azuri Peninsula?</h4><p>Most government initiatives will have some sort of impact either directly or indirectly. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), when passed, will have a positive impact on the industry. Nigeria is an energy producing country. However, only 20 to 30% of our GDP is funded by oil. If oil prices go up, there will be more liquidity and access to cash. I do not see the PIB as the only government initiative that will be of importance to us. With the new government in place, I want to believe that there will be more prudence, more initiative toward economic development, and growth that will help deepen our capital and money markets and thus translate to better access to much-needed funding such as development grants, loans, and mortgages.</p><h4>How will developments with Eko Atlantic affect real estate in Lagos?</h4><p>Presently, various data shows that there is a deficit in residential and commercial buildings, which has resulted in the gap between supply and demand. When you do the math, and take into consideration the rapid growth of Lagos, oversupply will not be an issue but that of the ability to match quality developments with price to meet growing trends. This growth will continue as rural/urban migration continues and with increased influx of returnees from the diaspora. Many Nigerians in the diaspora want to return, but have questions about where they will live considering the lifestyle they have become accustomed to. It is worthy of note to mention that this gap is a great opportunity that Eko Atlantic City is designed to fill by ensuring that not only do they have planned districts but all developers produce quality products and ensure standards.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year to come?</h4><p>For the year to come, I expect more economic stability and confidence in the market. The delivery date for Azuri Peninsula Phase I is 2018. We are currently on the drawing board for Phase II with smaller-sized apartments to cater to our clients.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>With the European Games approaching in 2015, tourist numbers will increase significantly. What necessary steps have been taken to ensure that Azerbaijan's transport sector is prepared for the Games?</h4><p><span></span>Extensive activities carried out under the leadership of President of the Republic of Azerbaijan HE Ilham Aliyev have laid the groundwork for future achievements and progress in our country. As a result of the President's attention to the transport sector, Azerbaijan's transport system is modernizing. Economically, the sector is improving yearly, and we have seen enhancements in quality and efficiency. Sustainable development and economic growth in recent years have attracted international attention to our republic. It is beyond doubt that the decision to award the inaugural European Games to Azerbaijan is vivid evidence of strengthening international confidence as well. The key responsibilities of the Transport Ministry in relation to the First European Games will include the repair of infrastructure on all roads to be used in the Games, optimization of Baku's transport network, including the purchasing of additional taxis, establishment of a centralized public transport management system, as well as the continuation of our work to address issues of technical supply.</p><h4>How has Azerbaijan's transport industry evolved in terms of technological advances?</h4><p><span></span>The industry has established an intelligent transport management system that is available in only a handful of other countries. We have introduced a cash-free method of payment to public transport. In addition, we have renewed our bus fleet, imported taxis meeting modern standards, updated the railcar and locomotive depot, and a new railcar plant is under construction. Modern aircraft have also been purchased.</p><h4>What have been some of the major projects of 2014, and how would you evaluate their success? </h4><p><span></span>In 2014, work continued on road infrastructure projects reconstructing east to west, the replacement of energy and communication systems, and the establishment of the central management system. A total of 43.8km of roads have been rebuilt during this period, bringing the overall result to 361km thus far. In addition, 49 station buildings have been over-hauled, nine electric and diesel locomotives and 12,000 wagons have undergone various repairs, and we purchased new locomotive and railcars. In addition to the oil and gas pipelines, which represent tremendous importance for the region and Europe as a whole, construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway has progressed at a rapid pace. The new railway will pass through the South Caucasus, link the east with the west and become a new trading artery for Eurasia. The construction of a new 29km section on the Akhalkalaki-Turkish border section part of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway has been completed and is being prepared for commissioning. A test train has been run, and the project is scheduled for commissioning in 2015. In addition, a 2.3km section of the 4.4km tunnel is being built on the Turkish-Georgian border. Gigantic regional projects, such as the new seaport and the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway, have been implemented on the initiative and with the direct support of the head of state. These projects will significantly contribute to the development of Azerbaijan's transport sector, expand the country's transit potential, enhance transportation safety and bolster Azerbaijan's transport links with Eurasia. </p><h4>How has the logistics sector improved, and what can be further done to stimulate its development?</h4><p><span></span>In order to address the gradually increasing problem of traffic congestion in Baku, we have established the Intelligent Transport Management Center. The Center uses cutting-edge technologies to ensure effective regulation of city traffic and eliminate congestion on the roads. One of the main functions of the center is to manage the operation of buses. It applies a system of electronic navigation to monitor traffic and generate real-time information to identify the demand for transportation (at rush and non-rush hours). The Center has been instrumental in optimizing passenger transportation, and is helping to improve the environmental situation in Baku.</p><h4>How successfully has the Ministry of Transport collaborated with foreign transport organizations in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>A number of measures have been taken to accelerate the integration of Azerbaijan's transport system into the international transport network while also expanding the international collaboration of transport agencies. Sustainable technical andorganizational activities have been carried out to further improve the efficiency of the transport system. This has been possible thanks to the great creative work done by the National Leader HE Heydar Aliyev. Azerbaijan's authority and reputation is steadily growing. The public and political stability, as well as the economic reforms under way, are having a positive impact on our relations with foreign countries. By building its foreign policies on principles of equality and mutual interests, the Republic of Azerbaijan has asserted itself in the international community as an open and reliable partner. In order to expand our cooperation in the Eurasian region, we have continued collaboration with the UN European and AsiaCommissions, the European Commission, GUAM, CIS, OSCE, the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, the International Transportation Forum, the International Road Transport Union (IRU), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the Organization for Cooperation between Railways (OSJD).</p><h4><br>Which areas are the most important for the development of Azerbaijan's transport sector in 2015?</h4><p>We will continue our work on infrastructure building in 2015. The reconstruction of the Khojasan-Lokbatan highway was carried out, as well as new construction of roads and bridges and several repairs to existing highways. The ferry terminal of the new Baku International Sea Trade Port was commissioned in September 2014, and work related to commissioning the first phase of the port is now in full swing. We will work on large regional projects such as the new seaport and the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway. These projects will significantly contribute to the development of Azerbaijan's transport sector, expand the country's transit potential, enhance transportation safety, and bolster Azerbaijan's transport links with Eurasia. The transport sector is one of the most rapidly developing sectors of the Azerbaijani economy. Far-sighted policies and the support and determination of our National Leader HE Heydar Aliyev and incumbent President HE Ilham Aliyev have contributed to the transport sector's evolution as one of the most rapidly developing sectors of the Azerbaijani economy. We transport workers are grateful for these successes to the far-sighted policies, incredible talent and wisdom of our National Leader HE Heydar Aliyev and to the determination, intransigent will and broad outlook of the incumbent President HE Ilham Aliyev. We want to assure our government that we will continue doing everything in our power to fulfill the instructions and recommendations of the President. It is the responsibility of all transport workers to ensure timely and quality service, and help bring Azerbaijan's road transport infrastructure into line with international standards. Additionally, the Ministry is also working to contribute to the solution of social problems, improve the country's unified transport policy, conduct reforms, and expand cooperation with international organizations.</p>]]></richbody1content>

My visit to this great country is part of our regular exchanges at higher levels.</p><p>Azerbaijan achieved its independence in 1991 and Pakistan emerged on the world map in 1947; however, our links and relationship date back for centuries. Faith, culture, and common historical experiences bind us together.</p><p>Pakistan was among the first three countries that recognized the independence of Azerbaijan, and with the visit of the father of the nation of modern Azerbaijan, honorable former President Heydar Aliyev to Pakistan in 1996, we laid down the solid foundation of present day bilateral relations, which will continue to grow from strength to strength in the years ahead.</p><p>Pakistan and Azerbaijan also share common perceptions on many regional and global issues and support each other both at regional and international forums.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The first European Games provides a distinctive opportunity to develop national infrastructure. What investment opportunities have the Games provided so far?</h4><p><span></span>A well-developed national infrastructure has been one of the main priorities of the government recently. Funded mainly by SOFAZ, the entire infrastructure of Azerbaijan has been completely rebuilt. These, and many other significant achievements, have created favorable preconditions for holding the first European Games in Azerbaijan. The promotion of such a tournament is a significant event, serving the objectives of the long-term development of sport and proliferating the vigor of the country on the international scene. </p><h4>The global oil price has been substantially weakened in 2014. What strategies has SOFAZ employed to adapt to this?</h4><p><span></span>SOFAZ serves as a buffer between the volatility of energy prices and public finances. One of the three primary objectives of the fund is the preservation of macroeconomic stability. Due to significant reserves accumulated and a well-balanced economic policy, our public finances are well insulated even during difficult times such as the recent turmoil in the energy markets. Over the past 15 years, SOFAZ's investment strategy has been rapidly evolving, encompassing new asset classes to maximize our long-term risk adjusted returns, which is in line with the government's strategy for economic diversification.</p><h4>SOFAZ is heavily involved in projects such as the BTK Railway and the rehabilitation of the Samur-Absheron irrigation system. What are the objectives of supporting national infrastructure projects such as these?</h4><p><span></span>This is one of the main objectives of SOFAZ. Improvement of the road network is a priority for diversification of the economy. The new Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway line project will connect the Trans-European and Trans-Asian railway networks, enhancing the transit capacity of the region's countries, which will restore the historic silk road. This project is particularly important for accelerating the intra- and inter-regional integration processes. SOFAZ has allocated $540 million to finance the project. As the urgency for social and agriculture infrastructure has been increased, SOFAZ continues to finance the Samur-Absheron irrigation system reconstruction project. The project serves three main missions: energy security, as water from Samur-Absheron canal to Jeyranbatan Lake helps to save 167 million kV/hour in electricity consumption, between $13 million and $15 million annually; water security, as there will be uninterrupted water supply to 150,000 hectares of land and 31,000 hectares of newly irrigated lands in Absheron peninsula; and food security is maintained through the progressive development of agriculture and entrance to new markets, reducing dependence on agricultural imports.</p><h4>The state program on the education of Azerbaijan youth abroad in the years 2007-15 is one of the major projects funded by SOFAZ. Now that 2015 has arrived, how would you evaluate the project and what further opportunities are there?</h4><p><span></span>The strategy for “turning black gold into human capital" launched by President Ilham Aliyev is being successfully implemented. The program that you mentioned is one of these core initiatives aimed at improving the country's human capital development. It has given an opportunity to many talented students to study in the priority fields in the world's leading universities, and thus contribute expertise gained to the medium and long-term sustainable development goals. Since the outset of the state program, SOFAZ has allocated $116 million from 2008 to 2014, including $32 million in 2014.</p><h4>It was announced in June 2014 that there were plans to invest up to $1.8 billion in Chinese yuan. What are the reasons for this venture and at what stage is the project?</h4><p><span></span>Interest in the yuan is stipulated by growing investment opportunities in the financial markets of China. Investment flows into China have expanded significantly over the past decade. SOFAZ intends to become a stakeholder in this trend by actively evaluating investment opportunities for China's markets. Investments in the yuan would bring additional currency diversification to our asset holdings, yielding better risk-adjusted returns of the overall portfolio. SOFAZ explores long-term opportunities in China's financial markets. Therefore, starting initially with investments in Chinese government securities, we expect to widen our exposure to China in the future, staying within the guidelines of SOFAZ's long-term investment objective. The Chinese onshore market remains highly regulated for foreign institutions. Foreign investors must go through formal procedures in order to start investing. We already completed negotiations with People's Bank of China and consented to invest approximately $500 million in China's financial market. Currently, we are at the stage of signing the contract. </p><h4>SOFAZ has invested $500 million in Russian VTB Group in 2015. What does this suggest about Azerbaijan-Russian trade and business relations?</h4><p><span></span>When SOFAZ started to diversify its portfolio, its number one priorities were the well-known regions and those that had long established trade and business relations with Azerbaijan. The Russian ruble and Turkish lira were the first two emerging country currencies included in SOFAZ investment portfolio. Participation in Bank VTB's secondary public offering was a successful step resulting from such a diversification practice. VTB is the second largest bank by size of assets in Russia and SOFAZ has invested in it along with two other sovereign wealth funds—Qatar Investment Authority and Norges Bank. The bank has attained almost all of the targets set in its strategy from 2010—14 and the further development strategy will enable VTB to increase its activities in the region and further improve operational efficiency. Bank VTB has a wide set of branches across the CIS region which includes a branch in Azerbaijan that contributes to the development of the economy. We are positive on further developing our partnership with VTB Group and look forward to the continuation of fruitful cooperation.</p><h4>SOFAZ collaborates with several international institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank, IFC, and the US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). What have been some of recent developments of these collaborations?</h4><p><span></span>In 2006, SOFAZ joined World Bank's Reserves and Advisory Management initiative. This program entailed not only the management of a $100 million portfolio on behalf of SOFAZ but also opened up a new front for further cooperation as SOFAZ's employees started attending different seminars and events arranged by the World Bank through the RAMP Program. SOFAZ's cooperation with IMF began with the Fund's first Private Equity commitment made to African, Latin American, and Caribbean Fund managed by IFC Asset Management Company in 2010. Since that time, SOFAZ made two further commitments to IFC AMC Catalyst Fund and IFC AMC Global Infrastructure Fund. All three funds are performing in line with our expectations and the outlook on their future performance is positive. Furthermore, IFC Asset Management Company and SOFAZ are closely cooperating in other related fields such as sharing experience, discussing the market environment, and liaising on each other's industry network. Relations with USTDA began after the visits of delegations from the American Chamber of Commerce in 2002. SOFAZ has cooperated on many fronts with USTDA including in the area of the institutional capacity building. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What areas of Azerbaijan's economy have seen the most growth, and which sectors have the most potential in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>We have seen that the non-oil industries, specifically the construction and service sectors, have continued to support overall growth at a rate above 6% over 2014. Despite some restraint, they remain the main contributors to this relatively good performance and continue to benefit from heavy public capital spending, while the oil sector has disappointed, with growth below expectations on the back of falling crude production and exports. We see similar trends for 2015. The authorities perceive the agro-industry, IT, and tourism sectors as promising for increasing diversification and creating jobs.</p><h4><span></span>The IMF recently announced that investment in public infrastructure in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Caucasus is increasingly important. How would you assess Azerbaijan's current investment in public infrastructure?</h4><p>While recognizing that investment in public infrastructure is essential for growth, the IMF has stressed that its impact depends on the efficiency and choice of priorities in public investment. According to the recent IMF report, the Making the Most of Public Investment in MENA and CCA Oil-Exporting Countries, even after their high levels of investment spending over the past decade amid high oil prices, oil exporting countries still face infrastructure gaps. The study highlights that strong institutions and better management of projects are crucial to making the most of public investment. This entails greater scrutiny of public investment. During our visit to Azerbaijan in late October, we welcomed the ongoing public expenditure and financial accountability assessment (PEFA) update and commended the authorities on the improvements set out in the preliminary findings of this report. We think this update should pave the way for further improvements in the efficiency of public spending in the country.</p><h4>How would you assess national efforts to diversify, stimulate SME growth, and improve the business climate?<br></h4><p>The economy has not been diversified away from oil yet, and the main driver of growth is government spending, mostly financed by oil revenue. Although the share of the non-oil sector has increased lately, its growth, too, heavily depends on oil-sector growth and government expenditure. The government has done a sterling job of tackling corruption at the lower levels but will need to broaden coverage of higher levels. However, according to cross—country studies by the OECD and IFC on SMEs, SMEs contribute much less to growth in Azerbaijan than they do in other countries—their share in GDP remains in single digits, well below the average of more than 50% in a sample of advanced economies, and below the Asian average of 30—40%. SMEs in Azerbaijan continue to face high costs associated with entry and exit procedures, contract enforcement, government inspections, and property rights. Insufficient access to finance is also an issue; more than half of SMEs in Azerbaijan lack access to financing. The government is making efforts in this area. </p><h4>What reforms and changes are necessary to ensure a continuation of macro-economic development in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>Reducing fiscal vulnerabilities is key to fostering non-oil private sector activity; we welcomed last year's progress toward fiscal sustainability and have encouraged the authorities to continue reducing the non-oil fiscal deficit in the 2015 budget. The new oil price environment also heightens the need for reforms of the business environment and governance. The government's commitment to reaching a more sustainable fiscal position has heightened the importance of these reforms. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most prominent achievements for the Ministry over the past year?</h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijan has made considerable progress in improving its environment over 2014 with significant changes made in the fields of biodiversity protection and forest development, as well as considerable increases and improvements in greenery areas, drinking water, and other spheres. The indicators for the protection and restoration of forests are improving steadily. The areas covered by forest have been expanded by more than 1 million ha, an increase from 11.4% to 11.8% of the country area. For nine months, reforestation and sourcing activities were carried out in an area of 2,300ha in which 3.2 million trees were planted. Another main focus of our activity is the conservation of biological diversity. As a result of this, the total area of specially protected natural territories has increased twofold and reached 10.3%. We have focused on the establishment of infrastructure for the protected natural territories, and in a short period of time the infrastructure model of Shahdagh National Park was established, while ecotourism camps were created at the Shirvan and Hirkan National Parks. Also, the second edition of the Red Book was published in two volumes, a project carried out on the basis of data collected with the assistance of relevant experts. Looking ahead, the restoration of biological resources of the Caspian Sea is one of our priority activities. A special sturgeon bank was created too, consisting of more than 5,000 sturgeon species at the Khilly hatchery. In 2014, for the first time in Azerbaijan, fry grown from caviar were raised with surgery operations without affecting the mother fish. Significant attention has also been paid to water treatment. Our program on “Providing Population with Environmentally Clean Water" covered a large area within a short timeframe and had an effective result. The production of water treatment plants was established in Azerbaijan using a technological scheme fully adapted to local conditions. In 2014, modular type water treatment plants produced in Azerbaijan were installed in five villages. At present, the works on installation of water treatment units are underway in 44 settlements, allowing over 500,000 people to have access to high-quality drinking water. Over the past ten years, the revenues of the State Environmental Protection Fund multiplied by more than 14 due to the efficiency of environmental protection activities, with revenues reaching AZN3.23 million in 2013. This figure increased by AZN1.54 million in 2014.</p><h4>The IDEA Campaign was set up in 2013 to reintroduce gazelles to their once natural habitat in the Caucasus. How has this initiative developed so far?</h4><p><span></span>The Project on the “protection, reintroduction, and restoration of historical habitats of gazelles in the Territory of Azerbaijan Republic" was continued with the support of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation and the IDEA campaign in 2014. In recent years, according to the initiative of the IDEA Campaign, the project was expanded into the Caucasus region. Recently, 10 gazelles were reintroduced to Georgia with the participation of IDEA representatives as well as the Environment Ministers of Azerbaijan and Georgia. In August 2014, 10 more gazelles were released to the territories of Ajinohur-Samukh of Azerbaijan, and up to 150 gazelles have been reintroduced to their historical habitats within the framework of this project.</p><h4><br>There has been some concern over the potential for landslides in certain parts of Azerbaijan. What work has been carried out by the Ministry in 2014 to protect against natural disasters such as this?</h4><p><span></span>Some 221 landslide zones were registered in Azerbaijan, and relevant geological studies were carried out in 52 landslide areas where this activity has been noticed. Exogenous geological processes in Azerbaijan have been developed according to the degree of a hazard zoning map with a scale of 1:500,000. Also, 1: 5,000 scale maps of 14 dangerous landslide territories in the Absheron Peninsula were designed, and the design of 1:5,000 scale topographic maps of 38 active landslide areas in Azerbaijan (with the exception of the Absheron Peninsula) are at the stage of completion. Monthly bulletins on the current state of landslides are prepared and delivered to the relevant authorities. In addition to this, complex geological, engineering, topographic, and geophysical surveys were carried out on the shore of the Mingechevir reservoir and Zigh sliding area of Surakhani district.</p><h4>How does the Ministry work with government institutions in the region to ensure the protection of the regional environment including the Caspian Sea? </h4><p><span></span>Pentalateral intergovernmental agreements were signed within the framework of the Fourth Summit of the Heads of the Caspian littoral states. The list of agreements included cooperation in the field of Caspian Sea Hydrometeorology, the field of prevention and elimination of emergency situations in the Caspian Sea, as well as the rational use of aquatic biological resources of the Caspian Sea. Over the past decade, Azerbaijan has successfully cooperated with Caspian countries with a view to addressing trans-boundary environmental issues of the Caspian Sea. These activities are carried out within the framework of the implementation of the Tehran Convention and its Protocols. In the course of the fifth Conference of the Parties (COP5) to the Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea held in Turkmenistan in May 2014, the Protocol on Biodiversity was adopted by the contracting parties. The Protocol on Biodiversity will further contribute to the conservation and restoration of the unique Caspian habitats and flagship species, such as sturgeon and the Caspian seal. This is the third in a series of protocols. The first two were concluded and signed in 2011 and 2012, underlining the countries' commitment to cooperating and taking action against the environmental threats facing the Caspian Sea. The Aktau Protocol focused on regional cooperation in addressing oil spills, and the Moscow Protocol on the protection of the Caspian Sea against land-based sources of pollution. Azerbaijan has undertaken several activities in safeguarding environmental protection and ensuring a sustainable future for the Caspian Sea. Furthermore, at the COP5, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources also agreed to locate the Secretariat of the Convention under the administration of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in the territory of the Caspian littoral states on a four year rotation basis. Azerbaijan will be the first host country and the Secretariat will be based in Baku starting from 2015. In addition, it was decided that the next meeting of the sixth Conference of the Parties (COP6) Tehran Convention will be in conjunction with the inauguration of the Convention Secretariat and held in Baku in 2015.</p><h4>What sort of initiatives are being put in place to continue the planting of trees and develop Azerbaijan's natural landscape?</h4><p><span></span>The restoration of landscapes and greenery works are being continued to protect highways from wind and water erosion. Over the past five years, large-scale tree planting projects were implemented using modern methods. Baku and the Absheron peninsula are arid areas. We planted 4.42 million trees in 3,613 ha. More than 1.2 million olive seedlings were planted on an area of 2,100ha. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the most significant projects implemented by Tamiz Shahar in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>Tamiz Shahar has implemented the Balakhani Material Recovery Facility (BMRF) at Balakhani Industrial Park, which is aimed at recovering useful materials from household waste. It has an annual capacity of 200,000 tons of waste. We have been working to increase the amount of segregated raw materials, which is currently at 20%. After recyclable materials are segregated from the total mass, the remaining waste is transported for incineration at the Baku Waste-to-Energy Plant, which is considered to be the most contemporary and largest plant in the region and Eastern Europe. Incinerated waste releases energy that can meet the demand of 100,000 households. So far, 368 million KWh of electricity has been produced, 306 million KWh of which was transferred to the state electrical grid and the remaining electricity was used to meet the internal needs of the plant. Residual waste, which is eligible neither for sorting nor incineration, is sent to the new sanitary Balakhani Municipal Solid Waste Landfill. Prior to 2009, all waste was deposited at an uncontrolled dumpsite. The area was covered by a cloud of putrid smoke from burning waste. However, Tamiz Shahar started the proper placement of waste, and further leveled and landscaped the area. The result of these activities completely changed the look of the site. The proper placement of waste lowers ecological risks, and helps with the improvement of the environment. The multilevel and functional monitoring conducted on a regular basis in the area shows that the amount of waste in the soil and air corresponds to industry norms, and the amount of harmful particles in the water has been reduced significantly and this positive tendency seems to keep continuing. The final step has been taken for the operation of the Balakhani Municipal Solid Waste Landfill as a sanitary landfill in full compliance with European standards. The international open tender competition, which aims to rehabilitate Balakhani municipal waste disposal landfill, was held in the framework of part of a joint project with the Ministry of Economy and Industry and The World Bank, and was named Integrated Solid Waste Management. The contract was signed by the consortium of the winning countries, Turkey and Greece, and work, which has already begun, will be completed by the end of 2016. Tamiz Shahar also regularly holds coastal clean up activities twice a year. We cooperate with the Heydar Aliyev Foundation and IDEA Public Association and the campaign is held in two phases: before and after beach season.</p><h4><br>What progress has Tamiz Shahar made in the environmental rehabilitation of the Absheron lakes?</h4><p><span></span>Our first priority in this project is Boyukshor Lake. Cleaning activities started there in 2013. Boyukshor is the biggest lake and one of the most contaminated on the Absheron Peninsula. The first phase of rehabilitation is almost complete. To accelerate the project, the lake was divided into two parts and included the construction of a 1,570m dam on the foundation of the highway between Ziya Bunyadov Avenue and Balakhani highway. The second phase of the project will start after the First European Games and will cover the entire lake area and surrounding sites. Historically, Boyukshor has been critically contaminated by sewage water discharge from 76 sources, which we have now eliminated. The main contaminated area is near Balakhani. A 1,850m dam was built next to the Balakhani settlement in order to prevent oil waste pollution coming from the old Balakhani oil fields. Special equipment supplied from the Netherlands will clean the bottom of the lake at shallow levels and remove debris that has accumulated. Sediment winnowed by pipes is filled out into three temporary disposal areas located 5.2km far away. The cells of the disposal area are completely isolated from the environment and will be defused without any harm to the environment or public health. More than half of the total 2.8 million cubic meters of sludge has been removed. The implementation of this historic project will significantly reduce all pollution risks. The second lake at Zigh is in the design and engineering stage.</p><h4>What role will Tamiz Shahar play in preparations for the First European Games?</h4><p><span></span>Most events of the First European Games will take place in the Olympic Stadium Complex that has been constructed on the shore of Boyukshor. Tamiz Shahar is making Boyukshor a high priority among the nine lakes. Existing oil and gas pipelines have been moved to a new corridor and are covered with a protective coating. The walkways have been completely concreted, and a beautiful 1km promenade and fountains have been installed. The construction works of Boyukshor promenade has been completed. There are great opportunities for city residents and guests. The promenade adds more value to the beauty of Baku. The park, with a total planting area of 15ha, has been built in the southern shoreline near Ziya Bunyadov Avenue. People have a chance not only to spend their leisure time walking down the promenade, but also to sail on the lake on canoes with the help of pier stairs.</p><h4>What kind of ecological collaboration does Tamiz Shahar have with local organizations?</h4><p><span></span>We cooperate with the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, and IDEA Public Association. Tamiz Shahar has been implementing “Tamiz Gala" project since 2012 in order to create proper waste management and waste segregation systems in the Gala settlement. We have eliminated 52 illegal waste sites in Gala, and installed 149 waste collection yards, 630 containers, 45 trash bins in areas with large concentrations of people, and 200 containers within larger production areas. Every year since 2012, the “From Waste to Art" project has been held in the Gala Historical and Ethnographic Reserve, and the International Children's Conference with the slogan of “3R - Reuse, Reduce, Recycle" has been running for three years. Since 2010, environmental summer schools have been organized in the regions every year with the IDEA Public Association. We have extensive cooperation with universities, have arranged tours to the Material Recovery Facility and Waste to Energy Plant, and participated in paper-recycling and tree-planting campaigns with various organizations. Tamiz Shahar has established an exemplary management system in ASAN Service centers in which waste is collected and separated.</p><h4>What kind of partnership and investment opportunities are created through participation in events such as the economic forum in Brussels?</h4><p><span></span>Tamiz Shahar held an informative presentation about the rehabilitation of Absheron lakes that generated great interest in the process and the progress of environmental restoration in Boyukshor. Interested parties held private meetings with our representative, and cooperation possibilities were discussed. We are also interested in cooperation with consulting and contracting companies for potential partnership opportunities.</p><h4>What are Tamiz Shahar's major targets in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Our main targets are to develop further waste management systems in Baku and increase recycling. We will focus on enriching technical facilities and research. We want to ensure a better consumer culture, decrease wastefulness, and promote the proper use of collected waste and sustainable management. We will continue the rehabilitation of Absheron lakes as successfully as we started. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most significant opportunities that the first European Games have provided for the development of the economy?</h4><p>The Games have provided a vehicle for the sustainable development of the economy through becoming a foreign investor and a political, economic, and cultural center for the region. The decision to hold the first European Games in Azerbaijan in 2015 is a result of the political-economic stability and international reputation of the country, as well as Azerbaijan's experience of holding major events and competitions. This event will have a significant impact on the promotion of healthy lifestyles and sport, pave the way for employment growth and infrastructure development, while the increase in the number of visitors will stimulate the tourism and service sector. A positive image of the country will be highlighted, as well as an increase in investment in the long term, while opportunities to host other prestigious events in the future will be created. The athletes and guests who take part will get to know the country better and see the successful development model of Azerbaijan. </p><h4>What impact has the signing of the Contract of the Century at Shah Deniz had on Azerbaijan's economy in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>As President Ilham Aliyev stated, the Shah Deniz II project is one of the world's largest energy projects and one that is focused on energy security and diversification. It will lead to significant changes in the energy geography of Europe and Azerbaijan. According to preliminary calculations, Azerbaijan will receive approximately $200 billion from gas supply to Europe through the Shah Deniz gas-condensate field. These currency reserves will play an important role in ensuring a significant increase of domestic investments in the non-oil economy of Azerbaijan, which will stimulate development.</p><h4>Economic diversity has become a major priority for Azerbaijan. Which sectors have the most potential for this?</h4><p><span></span>Diversification and development of the non-oil sector is expected to reach the volume of $13,000 GDP per capita, with the volume of per capita non-oil exports around $1,000. The target is to keep the average pace of annual real growth of GDP in the non-oil sector at more than 7%. Industry has great potential in terms of economic diversification. Last year was the Year of Industry, and more than 230 industrial enterprises were created, while the production capacity of existing enterprises expanded. With the support of the government soft loan, over 30 industrial enterprises are being established or expanded. Along with food products, various construction materials, vehicles, computers, solar panels, electrical equipment, and furniture are being produced, and Azerbaijan is self-sufficient in many areas. Products of local industrial enterprises are exported to foreign markets and compete successfully. Under the national development concept, measures will be taken to establish industrial enterprises based on local raw materials at a qualitatively new level, develop various fields of industry, establish a technological chain of production, and expand the potential of exports. The use of innovative technologies in industrial enterprises that stimulate and develop the non-oil industry will be the main focus of the state investment policy. In addition, the development of the industry in other regions of the country is one of the main directions. The Azerbaijan Steel Production Complex will cover all stages from iron ore mining to steel production, and pave the way to meet the domestic demand for steel and iron products. Azerbaijan is already self-sufficient in a number of agricultural and food products, and the quality and range have expanded; 2015 is the Year of Agriculture. Strengthening the transit potential of the country is an important part of the diversification policy. The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway will increase Azerbaijan's role as a major transit hub. The International Sea Trade Port, which is in its second phase, will play an important role in the transport sector. The measures aimed at the improvement of the first telecommunications satellite services of Azerbaijan, launching satellites into low orbit, expansion of e-services and internet traffic, and the creation of a high-tech technology park ensure that ICT will be a priority of the economy in the coming years. The nature of Azerbaijan, its historical monuments, and a rich cuisine provide ample opportunities for the development of tourism. New manufacturing spheres are also now in operation with Gobustan Hybrid Power Plant consisting of modern solar, wind, and biogas stations, Surakhani Solar Power Plant, and a number of wind power plants put into operation.</p><h4><span></span>There has been major development in trade ties between Azerbaijan and a number of countries. How much of a role will trade play in supporting the national economy in Azerbaijan in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Over the past 10 years, Azerbaijan's foreign trade turnover increased by 400%, with exports increasing six fold, and non-oil exports doubling. Imports have also more than doubled. During this period, Azerbaijan has conducted trade operations with 150 countries, with the commodity structure of trade and the potential for exports enhanced. The commissioning of Alat International Sea Trade Port, the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway, the creation of agro parks and large farms, and the joining of high-tech parks to the production process will play an indispensable role in an increase of the volume of trade, the development of relations with partner countries, strengthening transit potential, and turning the country into a major logistics hub. In addition, the measures on financing the export-oriented production projects at the expense of preferential loans of state, the establishment of logistics centers and trading houses in foreign countries, and the realization of the targets to increase non-oil exports give grounds to say that trade will be expanded in 2015 as well.</p><h4>What are the necessary steps that need to be taken to ensure that Azerbaijan continues to strengthen its economic position?</h4><p><strong></strong>Measures will be continued to improve the business environment for the development of entrepreneurship in the country, attracting local and foreign investments, modern technologies, management experience, and the production of high quality and competitive products. In order to attract investments into economy, appropriate measures will be taken to create a more favorable environment for all investors. Further improvement of infrastructure in the country's regions, the expansion of IT usage, the establishment of business incubators, clusters, tourist and recreational zones, new regional development will be achieved. Over the coming years, special attention will be paid to the development of the processing industry, transport infrastructure, the transition to an information society in the ICT sector, as well as in the development of the space industry. By 2020, the target is for Azerbaijan to be among the “upper middle income" countries according to the World Bank classification of gross national income per capita, and to reach the highest position in the group of high human development countries according to the UN Development Program's human development classification. In the future, Azerbaijan will be a place with minimal unemployment, an enhanced human capital, a healthy environment and a wide range of opportunities for every citizen.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major areas of focus in 2014 for Cahan Holding? </h4><p><span></span>President Ilham Aliyev declared 2014 the Year of Industry, which became a crucial event for the whole country, and Cahan Holding in particular. For many years, the oil sector was the key industry for Azerbaijan, and remained the most profitable. The diversification of Azerbaijan's economy is a significant and important objective. Non-oil industries contribute over 60% to national GDP and are growing at an annual rate of 8%, which clearly indicates that their input into the overall growth of the economy is increasing. In line with these developments, we have put our maximum effort into finishing the new industrial complex in Nakhchivan. This complex will include four different production facilities, including tobacco materials, a tea factory, a PVC profile factory, and a metal construction factory. All four already exist, but are spread out across the city; we will place them all under one roof. We will also add high-end technological production lines, which will meet the highest standards for the next 20 years. </p><h4>It was mentioned that the Boulevard Project was an important scheme for 2014 and 2015. At what stage is this project currently? </h4><p><span></span>We are proud of our Boulevard Project. We already have already begun Phase I of construction. Since the grand opening, Nakchivan Boulevard has gained popularity among the people. Now, the people of Nakhchivan are able to spend their free time for leisure and shopping. We have attracted well-known regional clothing and public catering brands to this project, and now we can say that Nakhchivan overtakes cities of the mainland of Azerbaijan, such as Baku, Ganja, and Guba, for example. Within the next few years, we will implement Phase II, which includes upgrading neighboring territories and extending the existing promenade. </p><h4>What new areas of business is Cahan Holding pursuing, and what is the reason for these? </h4><p><span></span>We would like to continue developing the sectors we are already active. In 2015, we are going to finalize our industrial complex, and consolidate all production facilities we have right now. This complex will provide us with an opportunity to attract more ideas about how we can use it and create more work places. For example, together with our Italian partners, we are discussing the possibilities of installing a new production line for new generation heating panels, which we think have a great market in Azerbaijan and the near-by region. This relates to construction materials production, which we are already dealing with. We are always searching for new business projects and are open for discussion of any interesting proposals.</p><p><br><strong>What </strong><strong>opportunities can the upcoming first European Games provided for Cahan Holding, both during the event and in the aftermath?</strong></p><p>As a businessman dealing with partners from all around the world, I can say that today Azerbaijan is known much better than 10-15 years ago. The whole country, the government, and the President spent many years to achieve working this result. Now, we should show the world how stable the economy of Azerbaijan is, what our main objectives are and how we continue to develop in the long run. Many people who come to Azerbaijan for the first time are surprised to see such a vibrant country and such an advanced economy. Also, those people who have been to the country a while agree that Azerbaijan has moved forward significantly. By hosting such a major event as first European Games, we can introduce Azerbaijan to the world sports society, as we did for the music audience when we hosted Eurovision Song Contest in 2012. Cahan Holding owns Days Hotel, which is a four-star hotel. Together with Wyndham Hotel Group, we operate this beautiful property, and we are looking forward to hosting numerous guests of the first European Games at our hotel.</p><h4><br>Who are some of Cahan Holdings most prominent international partners?</h4><p><span></span>The philosophy of Cahan Holding stipulates that we must maintain friendly relationships with all of our partners. We always adhere to our slogan “Strength in Unity" and our partners accept this golden rule as well. Each of them endows in the common business and that helps all of us to achieve objectives and best possible results. It is always a pleasure when our partners appreciate us at our true value; for example, Red Bull nominated us for a special recognition award alongside other international representatives. In 2015, we will be celebrating our 20th Anniversary. We have been working with some of our partners for over a decade, and this means a great deal to us and our partners. We are proud to say that we have been working for many years with multinational companies such us JTI, Red Bull, GM, and others, and we are happy about the result of our work.</p><h4>What is the potential for new investors or partners to cooperate with Cahan Holding in the medium term? </h4><p><span></span>In January, 2015 was declared the Year of Agriculture by the President of the country. This gave us an extra boost and draws our attention to tobacco cultivation—a project we started a long time ago. This project has a great potential, especially in Nakhchivan, because it has sunnier and warmer days, and provides best conditions for growing tobacco. This could become a major incentive for our future business partners and investors. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the measures taken in the area of economic diversification in Azerbaijan, and do you believe that the results obtained attest to the existence of a liberal and competitive economic system in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>One of our priorities during the years of independence has been the creation of a liberal, powerful, competitive, and modern economic system. Thanks to the continuation of the economic transformation initiated by the National Leader Heydar Aliyev in 1993, the determination of the priority sectors of the economy and their subsequent development, attraction of investment, and implementation of targeted state programs, we have achieved our strategic objectives in the economy. The more than threefold economic growth experienced, the solution of the problem of unemployment and poverty, the establishment of completely new social and economic infrastructure, the continuous improvement of people's living standards, and other achievements are seen as revolutionary breakthroughs in any country. </p><p>According to the statistics for the last several years, the share of the non-oil sector in the GDP has continuously increased to reach 61% in 2014. This is evidence of economic diversification in Azerbaijan and the reducing dependence on oil. The world's leading economic and financial institutions also acknowledge Azerbaijan's achievements. According to the global competitiveness index of the World Economic Forum, Azerbaijan has advanced to 38th place among 144 countries, maintaining the lead among CIS countries for five consecutive years.</p><h4>You declared 2014 the Year of Industry. How would you assess the success of national efforts to bolster industrialization?</h4><p>Azerbaijan was faced with a deep social and economic recession during the early years of independence. All economic sectors, including its main locomotive the oil industry, were in decline. Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan and the resulting political crisis in the country could not but aggravate the economic situation. Despite this, after the return of National Leader Heydar Aliyev to power in Azerbaijan in 1993, the country embarked on a period of stabilization, started to revitalize its economy and managed to get rid of industrial backwardness.</p><p>In subsequent years, especially over the past 10 years, revenues fetched by the sale of Azerbaijan's oil and gas were channeled into the non-oil sector and industrial development by means of special targeted programs. This has resulted in an annual 10% growth of the non-oil economy. In general, these years have seen industrial production in Azerbaijan triple.</p><p>Due to the declaration of 2014 as the Year of Industry, the State Program on Industrial Development of the Republic of Azerbaijan covering 2015-20 has been adopted and measures have been taken to modernize the structure of the economy, enhance the export potential of the non-oil industry, expand competitive, knowledge-intensive, and innovative productions, as well as train qualified professionals in new manufacturing sectors.As part of the Year of Industry, around 200 enterprises, including more than 40 medium and large companies, have been created. The ICT sector is developing rapidly these days. There is a permanent focus on the development of this sector. The fact that 2013 was declared the Year of Information and Communication Technologies is clear evidence of that. It is no coincidence that on February 8, 2013, our country witnessed a historic event in the launch of Azerspace-1 into orbit. Thus, Azerbaijan has joined the club of space-faring nations. The handover of Azerbaijan's second satellite “Azersky" to Azerkosmos OJSC in December 2014 attests to the importance our country attaches to the development of knowledge-intensive sectors of the economy. </p><p>Our industrialization policy highlights the development of the national military and industrial complex as a priority area. Our armed forces already rely on domestic production for a number of arms and munitions. Our military products are displayed in international exhibitions. In fact, we have completed initial sales with the aim of exports. We commissioned the Baku Shipyard in 2013, as our country has already started the production of vessels for petroleum operations, tankers and cargo vessels. The Baku Shipyard is also capable of addressing the needs of other regional countries in this area.</p><p>By and large, we see non-oil sector development as an opportunity to address domestic needs and enhance our export potential. There is a great demand for Azerbaijani agricultural produce in our traditional markets. At the same time, we are exploring ways of accessing new markets. The same approach applies to the production of building materials. We have already fully provided the country's construction sector with cement. The largest cement plant commissioned in Azerbaijan in 2014 has completely eliminated our dependence on imports. At the same time, it has created export opportunities. We are also developing aluminum, steel, and metallurgy enterprises. The process of establishing industrial clusters will continue in the future too, because there are sufficient raw materials and the necessary industrial potential in Azerbaijan.</p><p>Measures continue to be taken to develop chemical, knitting, and metallurgy sectors in Sumgait, Mingachevir, and Ganja, respectively. These cities have amassed extensive experience in the said areas. Sumgait has become the second largest industrial center not only of Azerbaijan, but also of the entire South Caucasus. The establishment of new industrial centers in Azerbaijan is now in full swing. The potential, the material resources, the qualified professionals, and, most importantly, the political will required for the implementation of our plans are all available.</p><h4><br>What further steps have been taken to increase the ease of doing business and investing in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>More than $180 billion have been invested in the Azerbaijani economy over the past 11 years. This is the result of the stability and a normal business environment in the country. In 2014 alone, $27 billion was invested in the economy, including $11 billion of foreign investments. This attests to the fact that Azerbaijan remains an attractive country for foreign investors. The attraction of such a large volume of investments can be regarded as a major success for any country. </p><p>On March 3, 2014, an executive order on additional measures toward entrepreneurship development was signed with the aim of improving state regulation of business and creating a favorable business landscape in the country. We are taking consistent measures to further improve the business environment, create a sound competition, simplify the procedures for starting a business, enhance state support for private enterprise, modernize corporate governance, and protect investor interests.</p><p>It is no coincidence that our achievements in private enterprise development have drawn the attention of international economic and financial institutions. According to the World Bank's Doing Business 2015 Report, Azerbaijan is among the world's top 10 reformist countries. Azerbaijan is ranked in 10th in the world for ease of immovable property registration and 11th for starting a business.</p><p>The Economic Freedom Index-2014 report jointly prepared by the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal lists Azerbaijan in 81st place among 186 countries in terms of economic freedom. The macroeconomic stability, the sustainable development of the non-oil sector, the presence of a strong financial potential, a sound competition, and a favorable investment environment gives both foreign investors and local business people further confidence of the future.</p><h4>At the World Economic Forum in Davos, you and other world leaders discussed the New Global Context. You also addressed a session called a new global context on energy geopolitics. What does this new context imply for Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Starting from 2008, the World Economic Forum has mainly been discussing ways out of the economic and financial recession. This year's anniversary session of the Forum called New Global Context focused on development and stability, cooperation in eliminating crises and their implications, society and security, innovation, and other issues. The primary objective of such discussions and opinion exchanges against the backdrop of global political and economic cataclysms is to determine and promote a new model of coexistence that would pave the way for development, progress, and mutually beneficial cooperation. We are living in a region prone to tensions, conflict, threats, and terrorism; however, mutually beneficial cooperation is possible when the situation outside the country is more or less predictable. Therefore, the policies and the gigantic transnational projects Azerbaijan is implementing are aimed at creating a more predictable environment in the region and beyond. Azerbaijan plays an active part in the establishment of regional transport corridors and modern transport infrastructure. Both East-West and North-South transport corridors pass through Azerbaijan. As a result of the commissioning of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway in 2015, Azerbaijan will also become a country linking Europe with Asia. </p><p>The largest trade seaport in the Caspian basin is being built in Azerbaijan. Phase I of the new Baku International Trade Seaport, and the ferryboat terminal, were commissioned in Alat last year. We expect to fully launch the seaport in the next two years. The seaport will have a capacity to process 25 million tons of cargo and 1 million TEUs. This will significantly contribute to increasing the volume of cargo transportation in the Caspian. Special importance is attached to the development of air trans<span style="background-color: initial;">port. A new terminal building of Heydar Aliyev International Airport has been built and commissioned. A total of six airports have been built in the regions, including four international ones. This brings the total number of international airports in the country to five. Azerbaijan is on its way to becoming a regional hub both in terms of cargo and passenger transportation.</span></p><p>In addition to contributing to the prosperity of the Azerbaijani people, the energy projects being implemented under Azerbaijan's leadership also serve European energy security. The Southern Gas Corridor, which we are also working on, will play a crucial role in ensuring the energy security of Europe. As is evident, our transportation and energy projects play the role of a bridge between Europe and Asia, and contribute to the development of mutually beneficial cooperation against the backdrop of complex geopolitical processes. Azerbaijan is also heavily involved in the fight against global threats, including terrorism. We are a member of the International Anti-Terror Coalition. One of the two issues Azerbaijan tabled during its chairmanship in the UN Security Council was the fight against terrorism. After all, Azerbaijan has been faced with various manifestations of terrorism itself. More than 30 acts of terror have been committed against Azerbaijan by Armenia at different times, killing more than 2,000 of our people.</p><p>Azerbaijan aspires to resolve the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh and other similar conflicts in accordance with international law. We have been subjected to Armenian aggression for more than 20 years. Unfortunately, the double standards existing in the world and an equal treatment of the aggressor and the victim do not facilitate conflict settlement. All conflicts in post-Soviet republics, and indeed elsewhere in the world, should be approached from the same angle because if one conflict remains unresolved, this sets a precedent for other conflicts. As was mentioned at the Forum, we are at a crossroads in 2015; there is a road leading to discrimination, fundamentalism, hatred, and mutual accusations, but there is also a road to solidarity and cooperation. Azerbaijan's model of development, cooperation, and integration can lay the groundwork for the predictability of political and economic processes and protection of common interests.</p><h4><br>The first gas supplies from the Caspian Sea to Europe via the Southern Gas Corridor are due to begin in 2019. In light of this, how do you see Azerbaijan's role in the future of global energy security?</h4><p>When the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline was put into operation in 2006, we took an important step in contributing to the energy security of Europe. The oil from Azerbaijan currently accounts for 30-40% of the energy balance of some European countries. The projects Azerbaijan has initiated over many years have also contributed to the realization of the Southern Gas Corridor. Azerbaijan has been working hard for 20 years to deliver its energy resources to world markets. We have a diversified transportation infrastructure. The Southern Gas Corridor is currently the largest infrastructure project in Europe, while Azerbaijan is the only new source of energy for Europe for the time being. This project consists of several components. The development of the Shah Deniz II gas field, the expansion of the South Caucasus Pipeline linking Azerbaijan with Georgia, the Trans-Anadolu Pipeline (TANAP), and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) are all constituent parts of the Southern Gas Corridor. Azerbaijan has proven gas reserves of 2.6 trillion cubic meters, while the volume of predicted reserves is twice as high. Our diversified infrastructure allows us the opportunity to increase our gas exports in any direction. Work is currently under way on the construction of the Southern Gas Corridor in all directions. The groundbreaking ceremony of the Southern Gas Corridor was held in Baku on September 20, 2014. This date is very symbolic because the Contract of the Century, which transformed the energy map of the region, and was also signed 20 years ago on this date. A meeting of the Advisory Council of countries represented in the Southern Gas Corridor was held in Baku in February 2014. It was an important step in coordinating future work. The groundbreaking ceremony of the TANAP pipeline held in Kars, Turkey, on March 17th, 2015, which was attended by the presidents of Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Georgia, as well as representatives of the EU and the US, is also of tremendous importance to the implementation of the Southern Gas Corridor. <br>In addition to giving a second wind to Azerbaijan's oil strategy, Shah Deniz II and the Southern Gas Corridor projects will also redraw the world's energy map and create a new panorama in the area of European energy security. After all, the Southern Gas Corridor will lay the foundation for a new cooperation format in Eurasia. Initially, we created a trilateral cooperation format, the format of strategic energy, transportation, political, and economic partnership involving Turkey, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. It is now asserting itself as a tangible regional factor. The recent joining of this format by Greece, Albania, and Italy will further reinforce it. At the same time, Bulgaria, which is involved in the Nabucco project, is also taking part in our project now. Romania and Hungary are considering this option as well. We would like to deliver Azerbaijan gas to other Balkan countries as well. We believe that we can cooperate with these countries both as consumers and transit states. Therefore, the countries joining the new cooperation format are also becoming natural allies; thus, contributing to the emergence of a serious alliance in Eurasia. This will have tremendous implications both politically and economically. This having been said, we can state that the Southern Gas Corridor is not just an energy project or a pipeline; it is a serious political initiative.</p><h4>Azerbaijan will host first European Games in June 2015. What unique attributes does Baku bring to the table as the inaugural host city, and what impact will the Games have on Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The fact that we will host the first European Games is a manifestation of the great confidence placed in us, but it also puts tremendous responsibility on our shoulders. We also see the Games as evidence of great international interest in Azerbaijan. Our dynamic development over the past 10 years, our achievements is all spheres of public life, and the independent policies we pursue in the international arena have enhanced our authority on a global scale. At the same time, as a result of the immense construction and landscaping work we have carried out, Baku has turned into one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I am sure that Baku will impress its visitors and athletes during the Games. Azerbaijan is also an active member of the international Olympic movement. Our athletes are winning a growing number of international tournaments each year. Most of Azerbaijan's districts now have Olympic centers meeting the most stringent requirements. Other sports facilities have also been built throughout the country. This is another factor contributing to the popularization of sport in Azerbaijan. </p><p>Azerbaijan has gained extensive experience in playing host to numerous international and regional sporting events. Baku has successfully hosted a number of high profile political, economic, humanitarian, sporting, and other international events. The first European Games to be held in Baku from June 12th to 28th will bring together more than 6,000 athletes from 49 countries who will compete in 20 sports. We intend to conduct the Games at the level of Summer Olympic Games. A strong international team comprising representatives of more than 40 countries has been established with support from the International Olympic Committee, and preparations for the Games are already in the final stages. Extensive work has been carried out to create a modern sporting infrastructure. The construction of most of the future venues of the Games have either already been completed or is nearing completion. In total, the Games will be conducted in 21 sports facilities in Baku. In addition to the 68,000-seat Baku Olympic Stadium, which will host the opening ceremony of the Games, an Olympic village of 7,300 people is being prepared for the Games. The transport infrastructure of the capital city has been overhauled, security measures taken, and serious attention paid to welcoming, accommodation, and training of visiting athletes. </p><p>In 2016, Azerbaijan will play host to the World Chess Olympiad. Also, the Formula One Grand Prix will be held in Baku for the first time in the history of this region. In 2017, Baku will host the Islamic Solidarity Games. <br>The fact that both European Games and Islamic Solidarity Games will be held in one and the same country and city in a matter of two years is of a huge symbolic nature. Azerbaijan is a multi-confessional and multicultural country where representatives of all religions live in peace and prosperity like one family. Azerbaijan is making a contribution to the very relevant dialogue between civilizations. I also believe that the Games will also be of great help in promoting the Azerbaijan brand from the standpoint of its multiculturalism traditions and tourism opportunities. In other words, we have powerful potential and sophisticated sports infrastructure. We have amassed extensive experience in conducting major events; therefore, I am absolutely sure that we will conduct the Games at the highest level. Baku-2015 will open a new interesting page in the history of sport. The Baku Games will also set the standard for subsequent European Games, to be held every four years. <br></p><h4>Azerbaijan's growing prominence on the world's stage has been marked by the country's active foreign policy. What would you consider to be the milestones of Azerbaijan's foreign policy in 2014, and what are the priority areas for 2015?</h4><p>Last year was quite successful for Azerbaijan from the standpoint of its foreign political priorities. Our country has significantly reinforced its international standing and expanded its relations with the organizations we are a member of, as well as with many countries around the World. In the six months of our presidency in the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, Azerbaijan identified the fight against corruption, democracy, human rights, security, and the inter-religious dialogue as its top priorities and put forward number of effective initiatives. </p><p>The ASAN xidmet service centers serves as an excellent example of Azerbaijan's institutional reform in the fight against corruption. Currently, ASAN xidmet centers provide 30 legal and 32 various functional services. Since being launched on December 29th, 2012, ASAN xidmet centers have provided services to more than 4.12 million people. There is a great international interest in ASAN xidmet, which is an Azerbaijani brand name. It is no coincidence that a number of senior government officials from different countries familiarized themselves with the activities of ASAN xidmet centers while visiting Azerbaijan.</p><p>The appointment of a rapporteur on the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh to facilitate communication of objective information about Azerbaijan to the world is one of our greatest achievements in the period of our presidency in this prestigious organization. The session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly held in Baku in June 2014 adopted a declaration reaffirming the principles of inviolability of borders and territorial integrity. By pursuing a completely independent policy, Azerbaijan has earned itself great authority worldwide. In 2012, Azerbaijan was one of the 10 countries invited to the G20 summit in Mexico, being the only country in the CIS to do so. In 2011-12, with the support of 155 countries Azerbaijan was elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and presided over this supreme body for two months. Azerbaijan has been invited to attend the G20 summit in Turkey in 2015 as well.</p><p>Azerbaijan's foreign policy is conducted on the basis of a clear-cut strategy. In the years ahead, we are determined to continue pursuing our foreign political course, secure the sovereign rights of the Republic of Azerbaijan, protect our national interests, facilitate the development of bilateral and multilateral relations with other countries, resolve the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh in accordance with international law and on the basis of the country's territorial integrity, continue the implementation of gigantic transnational energy projects that represent tremendous importance for the region and Europe, and pay attention to other significant issues.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What particularly important projects has the Ministry of Emergency Situations worked on over the last year?</h4><p><span></span>Overall, 2014 was a successful year, especially in regard to two projects that were implemented. As part of the EU's twinning program launched in January 2013, the State Agency for the Regulation of Nuclear and Radiological Activity successfully completed the Strengthening and Development of Radiation Safety Infrastructure in the Republic of Azerbaijan project together with the Radiation Protection Center and the Project Management Agency of Lithuania. The objective is to develop a radiation safety culture, as well as develop infrastructure and support services. The project covers tightening control over the impact of ionizing radiation and aims to prepare Azerbaijan for radiological emergency situations. A draft national plan on radiation safety has been prepared, the national laws analyzed and aligned with modern requirements, and state supervision reinforced. The national system of measurement standards were developed in line with European and international standards, the system of preparedness for nuclear and radiological emergencies enhanced, radiation safety laboratories established, and training facilities were established. Representatives of the State Agency for the Regulation of Nuclear and Radiological Activity and of the Radiation Protection Center of Lithuania have exchanged visits to familiarize themselves with their respective systems of nuclear and radiological control. The draft law on radiation and nuclear safety and the related presidential decree are in line with European guidelines and the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In addition, emergency response measures and a simulation of the explosion of a dirty bomb at an airport counter training have been organized. Work has started on supporting the transition of the State Agency for Monitoring Safety in Construction to European standards. The objective is to adopt best practices, improve construction safety and quality, and assist the State Agency for Monitoring Safety in Construction. Implemented in conjunction with the German Institute of Construction Technologies (DIBt) and Latvian experts, this project consists of three components and 20 activity directions. A group of foreign experts came to Azerbaijan to analyze national construction laws and exchange views on a variety of issues. Agency staff have familiarized themselves with the standardization systems of Germany, including testing building materials and construction technologies. European experts have extensively analyzed the needs of the national construction legislation while Latvian specialists have made presentations on the country's experience in the transition from Soviet to European construction systems. As a result, a set of recommendations was prepared regarding the adoption of European construction standards. This twinning program is designed for 18 months and will last until the end of 2015. Since it is the first such project related to the country's construction sector, it looks promising.</p><h4>What measures is the Ministry of Emergency Situations taking to address the threat of natural disasters in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is located in an area prone to various natural disasters, including mudslides and floods, which the Ministry of Emergency Situations is taking different measures to prevent. The Ministry cooperates with Deltares and Royal Haskoning from the Netherlands to evaluate the reliability of protection dams in the lower reaches of the Kura and Araz rivers, and identifying high-risk riverbed zones. The operating schedule of the Mingachevir Reservoir has been aligned with watercourses in the lower reaches of the river. We have finished evaluating the morphology of the Kura river mouth and banks, identified places of initial dredging activities, and started hands-on work. Bathymetry and dredging work is currently under way in Salyan and Neftchala Districts. We are working at around 30 locations using specialized research vessels and suction dredgers in addition to a quayside berth that has been established to enable mooring of said vessels. In order to improve the efficient response to river floods, timely acquisition of information on water levels and flow, and the existing hydrometric network, 12 Diver and Baro automatic groundwater data loggers have been installed along the Kura, Araz, Tartar, and Garasu rivers. A short-term action plan has been prepared to prevent the Kura and Araz rivers from bursting their banks. In order to improve the environmental situation of lakes and bodies of water on the Absheron Peninsula and control water levels and water flows, work has been carried out to determine the geological, hydrogeological, hydrological, morphometric, and hydrographic characteristics of lakes and artificial bodies of water on the peninsula. We have worked to conduct reclamation of artificial lakes clean and preserve natural lakes, establish a distance warning system in flood-risk zones, and prepare comprehensive preventive activities. The Ministry has engaged specialists of Deltares and Royal Haskoning and established a working group to prepare a plan of preemptive action.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the crisis management situation in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>Crisis management is critical and the main objectives are to conduct emergency rescues, manage resources and facilities, and analyze information effectively. Due to the fact that the concept of crisis management is relatively new to Azerbaijan, a Crisis Management Center has been operating since the Ministry was established, and we have benefited from experienced countries to create a model suitable for the local environment. When inaugurating a new office building of the Ministry in 2008, President HE Ilham Aliyev reviewed the Crisis Management Center and praised the center's innovations in the area of prevention and rapid response to emergency situations. Such an evaluation represents a good series of guidelines for our future activities. The Command Room of the Crisis Management Center is operational at every hour of the day and responds to any situation in Azerbaijan. The Crisis Management Room manages large-scale crises in cooperation with local authorities. Operating in four shifts on a round-the-clock basis, the Center follows the action plan on the prevention and elimination of the consequences of emergency situations agreed between the Ministry of Emergency Situations, other bodies of executive authority and local governments. In accordance with a Presidential decree, the “112" hotline was created and a rapid reaction force of the Crisis Management Center put in place. “112" has become a lifeline for people seeking help in difficult situations, receiving an average of 10,000-15,000 calls a day in Azerbaijan. Currently, the Center maintains wire and radio communication with the Ministry, back-up satellite communication with emergency rescue teams, a video conferencing system, a system of navigation, various electronic facilities based on the geographic data system, a mobile communication public warning system, computer software to automate daily operation of various departments of the Ministry, video surveillance cameras, and management systems in densely populated and strategically important areas. The Crisis Management Center cooperates with similar centers of other countries and international organizations to facilitate a regular exchange of opinions. </p><h4>What is the role of the Ministry in the preparations for the first European Games? </h4><p><span></span>The prospect of the first European Games in Baku fills every Azerbaijani with great pride. Our most important objective is to ensure the security of all sportsmen and visitors during the Games, and the Ministry is taking a series of measures to ensure this. Serious attention is being paid to fire and construction safety standards during the construction of all facilities and all facilities are subject to rigorous control and testing, with immediate measures being taken to eliminate any shortcomings. Relevant departments prepare emergency evacuation plans in the areas of radiation and chemical safety and conduct various trainings on the application of such plans. To enable a prompt response to potential emergency situations, attention is being paid to the layout of emergency rescue resources. We intend to set up a command center to control all of the Ministry's resources and facilities from a single point. In an effort to establish close cooperation with the Organizing Committee of the 2015 Baku Games, a workgroup comprised of representatives of various departments of the Ministry has been set up and a permanent mediator appointed. I am confident that the safety of people during the Baku 2015 European Games will be provided at the highest possible level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>At the moment, what are the most important projects that Yeni Hayat is working on in Azerbaijan? </h4><p><span></span>Yeni Hayat Group is one of the leading companies in Azerbaijan's construction market from the standpoint of quality, location, design, and complexity. All of our projects are equally important to us. Yeni Hayat has built some of the architectural and construction gems of Baku, such as the Yeni Hayat Residence, Yeni Hayat Plaza, and the Azure Complex, which comprises the Azure Residence, Azure Business Center, and MegaFun entertainment center. In terms of our current projects, we have four underway: Park Azure, Grand Hayat, Hayat Palace, and Hayat Towers. The construction of the Park Azure residential complex is expected to be completed toward the end of 2015, just in time for Yeni Hayat's anniversary on December 20th. One of our most ambitious projects, namely the Hayat Palace, will be ready for delivery to our clients by December 20th, 2016. Furthermore, the Grand Hayat complex, which will host 1,900 residential units, that should be completed by December 20th, 2017. We have also the inauguration of the Hayat Towers project planned in 2015, which will consist of more than 3,000 residential units. </p><h4>How did Yeni Hayat's customer satisfaction strategy develop over 2014? </h4><p><span></span>Yeni Hayat started operating in 2002, and since the first day, our guiding principle has been customer satisfaction. Today, Yeni Hayat provides a wide range of services, operating in both real estate and construction, as well as in the services sector. Our residential complexes, shopping and entertainment centers fully comply with the wishes and needs of customers in terms of their excellent price-quality ratio. Among our achievements in 2014, I would like to highlight the inception of new Hayat Management Company within the Yeni Hayat Group of Companies. This company will pr<span style="background-color: initial;">vide different services to our residents. We apply our “7 S" standards in all our construction projects, which cover the provision of all services to building residents. Among them, we should mention the kindergarten, sports and fitness center, supermarket, and 24-hours security system.</span></p><h4>At the moment, how would you assess the demand for Yeni Hayat's projects? </h4><p><span></span>I can say with confidence that today, Yeni Hayat is a well-recognized brand in Azerbajian's real estate market, which is famous for its quality and high customer satisfaction. When people speak about Yeni Hayat, reliability and comfort instantly come to mind. We are collaborating with Hill International now, a company that manages the ongoing construction processes and controls the quality of concrete mix. Due to our focus on quality, Yeni Hayat is very popular today in the construction field.  </p><h4>Baku may become a hub for both tourism and business in the coming years. What are the benefits and challenges of the new era for Baku? </h4><p><span></span>I would say that not only Baku, but also our whole country has changed in a very short period, and today Baku is a center for numerous international events and sports. There are no drawbacks, because everything that is currently happening in Azerbaijan benefits the economy. We like to think that we are a part of that, and that we are contributing to this overall success. All of this is happening thanks to the leader of Azerbaijan, President Ilham Aliyev. We are enjoying being a part of this progress and contributing to the overall success of our country. </p><h4>Yeni Hayat for many years has supported sport in Azerbaijan. In what way is Yeni Hayat involved in the European Games? </h4><p><span></span>Yeni Hayat is committed to promoting sport as well as supporting the Games. Such large-scale international events are important for Azerbaijan because they provide a boost for the economy. I want to emphasize that it is our duty as an Azerbaijani company to contribute to the development of our country in any field. Our interest in and support for the European Games team stems from our confidence in our athletes. We believe that our sportsmen will successfully represent our country and raise our national profile. We as Yeni Hayat Group feel proud of our athletes, and are always ready to support the national team. </p><h4>In what way does Yeni Hayat collaborate with other corporations?</h4><p>We attach great importance to our partners. We have strong relationships with our international and local partners, and we are always open to new partnerships. I can say with confidence that our partners provide us with high-quality materials and services, which meet international standards. We have also built mutually beneficial partnerships with several banks, such as the International Bank of Azerbaijan, Xalq Bank, Standard Bank, and Bank Technique.</p><h4>What are your current expectations and objectives for 2015? </h4><p><span></span>As previously mentioned, our major objective is to provide high-quality services to our clients, and to appeal to our potential clients. We also have to successfully complete the construction of our ongoing projects, and realize further ambitious and unique projects in future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Last year was a year of diversification for CI Banco. What steps did you take in that regard?</h4><p>It was a year of acquiring non-foreign exchange (FX) businesses. In April 2014, we bought Bank of New York Mellon, merging the companies. Bank of New York Mellon is mainly engaged in the fiduciary trust business. This move represented an effort by the shareholders to become a bank. In 2008, we received authorization to operate as a fully licensed bank and have worked toward that ever since. We do not want to merely be an FX house operating under a banking license. To date, we have been participating in almost all banking operations, with the exception of real estate mortgages. We have launched diverse products and channels, and created a powerful internet banking system. In addition to developing our mobile banking offering, we have over 200 ATMs, 186 branches, and a variety of products. CI Banco undertook to become the first Green Bank in Mexico, which is not a business strategy, but more of a philosophy, as sustainability does not run contrary to profitability. Put another way, we must be profitable and then become green or sustainable.</p><h4>What does being a green bank mean?</h4><p>According to this philosophy, we take care of the environment. This does not mean that we only attend to “green" customers, or that we only provide “green" products, because at this point it is not feasible to focus exclusively on such areas. Instead, we are trying to provide services for customers keen on sustainability. For instance if you are trying to finance a green car that produces less than 80 units per kilometer of CO2, you will receive a better rate from us. That is our green philosophy. We have developed many products, but our revenue is still derived primarily through FX and derivatives. Over the past five years we have balanced our mixture at 40% banking and banking products and 60% FX.</p><h4>Having diversified your product mix and offered different products for various industries, in what areas do you anticipate expansion?</h4><p>The trust factor is important, and we have created a unique product among Mexican banks. CI Banco is financing solar panels for housing, which is important and challenging because we must teach our customers about renewable energy.</p><h4>One of the stated goals of the finance reform was to increase the loan portfolio in Mexico. Have you observed any developments on that front?</h4><p>The main goal of the reforms was to increase the provision of cheaper banking loans. On the other hand, there is also a problem with the requirements for the net equity ratio. Let us suppose we must have at least a 12% net equity ratio, while on the other hand the loan reserves have been increased, whereby we have tougher rules for such reserves. According those rules, it is hard to increase them. The other variable is that the reserves are no longer tax deductible.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Mexican economy for 2015?</h4><p>Certain key analysts have decreased their GDP growth projections. I foresee a figure of less than 3%. Analysts were especially influenced by the fact that this is an election year. All the reforms were approved and will start this year. The collapse of oil prices came out of nowhere, and there was a subsequent drop in public expenses. Thus I do not foresee growth of over 2.8%. Many of our customers are suffering because of this downturn, whereby these conditions are something we watch closely.</p><div class="quote">“The trust factor is important, and we have created a unique product among Mexican banks."</div><h4>What are your expectations for CI Banco for the year ahead?</h4><p>I expect the upcoming year to be defined by consolidation, as we will have to consolidate investments that we made over the past six years. In other words, we will not increase our branch network significantly. We have already invested millions of pesos in creating the bank's infrastructure and so for this year we have adopted a more conservative stance in investing and spending to consolidate all business lines and the branch network we have developed. That is why we decided to control and reduce expenses this year. That being said, we are increasing our sources of income, which will enable us to enjoy a profitable year.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you think the 2015 European Games will add to the continent's sporting landscape, and what does this event signal about the future of global sports? </h4><p>There were many people, including myself, who at the onset felt that Europe already had a lot of continental championships. Why overcrowd the calendar with another major international sports event? However, after rethinking and talking among ourselves in the Olympic world, I believe the European Games are on par with the general tradition and trend that every continent should have a regional games or a continental games. There are, of course, other types of multi-sports events, but it is fair that Europe has their own continental games. The only worry that we have to address is, of course, managing athletes in different sports who already have busy seasons, with other world championships and regional games elsewhere. You just have to ensure that they know this and can adjust their season accordingly. Still, the European Games reflect a great opportunity for different countries around Europe to host events that are more manageable than Olympic Games. The choice of Azerbaijan is very interesting in that I know this country wants to host many international events, and I think that it is great exposure for them and probably a stepping stone to other major events. </p><h4>What does Baku bring to the table as the inaugural host city?<br></h4><p>I hope that they do not place the bar too high that others will not be able to follow, because I get the feeling that they want to make their mark and do great things. Azerbaijan has developed incredibly over the past few years, and one unique thing is that they are on the frontier of Europe and Asia and, therefore, are a great link to other parts of the world. The Caucasus region is also historically within the Silk Road and represents a great tradition of exchange and meeting of people from different horizons all around the world. It is a unique culture, and a fortuitous set of circumstances has brought people here. If that can be reflected in the Games, it will be a great success. International sports have a great ability to unite people anyway; however, if it can also be in this kind of atmosphere, then the discovery of a unique culture makes the experience that much more pleasurable and interesting.</p><h4>Where do you see opportunities for increased cooperation between Monaco and Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>We are talking about cultural events and exchanges related to the Games, such as a small exhibition on my family and my parents that will open in time for the Games. I think it would be interesting at some point to see if the equivalent of our Chamber of Commerce in Monaco, which is the Chamber of Economic Development can coordinate to meet some business leaders from Azerbaijan. I believe that would be very productive and I think they could find great synergies for cooperation in different areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerbaijan is currently the second biggest oil exporter to the Czech Republic. How important is this relationship at the moment?</h4><p>The fact that oil from Azerbaijan covers around one-quarter of the Czech annual consumption makes it a strategic partner that contributes significantly to the diversification of our energy resources. Our partnership with Azerbaijan, however, goes well beyond a simple case of oil supplies. This is only one part of intensive business-to-business and government-to-government contacts in many fields including trade and investment. </p><h4>Trade turnover between the Czech Republic and Azerbaijan increased significantly from 2013 to 2014. What were the reasons for the increase, and what is your outlook for 2015?</h4><p>Both sides are benefiting from a great combination of traditional Czech know-how and expertise in industry, transportation, and power generation, and of the astonishing Azerbaijani modernization effort. I expect a continuation of the positive trend and steady growth of the trade turnover.</p><p><strong>In what areas is there the most potential for the Czech Republic and Azerbaijan to increase mutual cooperation?</strong></p><p><span></span>I am glad that Azerbaijan is expanding its economic activities in the Czech Republic. We welcome Azerbaijani investment in our country and hope that there is even more to come. As for the Czech Republic, I hope that we will further increase not only the volume of exports, but also the direct involvement and investment of Czech companies in Azerbaijan. More specifically, I am convinced that we should focus mainly on the energy and infrastructure sectors.</p><h4>As steps are made toward the development of the Southern Gas Corridor, what role do you expect Azerbaijan to play in supplying Europe's growing energy demand? </h4><p>We consider Azerbaijan a strategic supplier of energy not only to the Czech Republic, but also to the EU as a whole. Therefore, we hope that the new infrastructure will be operational as soon as possible. The Southern Gas Corridor is de facto the only project under construction that would bring new substantial energy sources to the EU.</p><h4><br>The European Games in Baku is the first event of its kind in Europe. How important is this event for the development of Azerbaijan on the international stage?</h4><p>When it comes to the European Games in Baku, my personal priority is the highest possible number of medals for the Czech athletes. On a more serious note, such an event is generally a great opportunity to present a country and its capabilities to the international public. So I wish all the best not only to the Czech athletes, but also to the organizers! <br></p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Pro Ecuador's plan for the year ahead?</h4><p>Beyond Pro Ecuador's policy of strengthening its current work in goods exports promotion, our strategic plan in 2015 has two main lines of attention; attracting investment and exporting services. The first area focuses on attracting investment into the main productive sector, including the forestry sector. We have already developed several activities to attract investment such as business symposiums and roundtables. There are other sectors besides forestry on which we focus our efforts, such as metalworking, software, and ICT. Our efforts go into building bridges between foreign and local companies, for which our 30 branch offices in 25 different countries are essential. Once we achieve that, our work also includes monitoring the materialization of those potential investments. In order to foster a friendly business environment in the country, our work, following government policy, is centered on promoting the benefits of Ecuador in terms of facilities and infrastructure, as well as showcasing its international recognitions as an investment recipient. The government has invested significantly in infrastructure, fiber optics, and related services, which has lifted Ecuador to the next level.</p><h4>Which were the greatest investments in Ecuador in 2014?</h4><p>Last year, around of $31 million in greenfield investment was brought into the country. In the same context, there is $283 million of investment that should materialize this year in the wake of the last year's labors. These investments have all been a direct result of Pro Ecuador's work in sectors such as agribusiness, auto parts, and plastics, among others.</p><div class="quote">“We need to change the mindset of many companies and make them realize what is needed in order to grow."</div><h4>What needs to be done to further promote exports among Ecuadorian companies and change the investment culture?</h4><p>We need to change the mindset of many companies and make them realize what is needed in order to grow. One of the required steps is precisely to invest. There are plenty of opportunities abroad for Ecuadorian companies, which aren't fully developed at the time. But, if they receive the correct support, they'll turn into an engine to change the course of Ecuadorian commerce. Boosting Ecuadorian exports of products and services with technology and added value will also help to diversify the economy, generating further employment. In this regard, the main results of successful business opportunities have been seen through B2B events. Over the last year, we also channel great attention into services exports. We have high hopes in the education sector, for example. Education is one of the sectors set to drive the change in the production matrix. To this end, the government has taken important steps such as creating the City of Knowledge to encourage the role of education and science in the national economy. Another winner is health and medical service; Ecuadorian doctors have an excellent reputation and international patients are aware of the relatively low costs of medical services in Ecuador.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of the Ecuadorian economy in three to five years?</h4><p>Our main challenges concern investment, without which we will struggle to establish a knowledge-based economy. Competitiveness is another main challenge facing the country. Finally, we face the challenge of ensuring sufficient qualified human resources; the government has already taken key steps in this context with scholarship programs and attracting pre-retirement academic experts to teach at Ecuadorian universities. However, we cannot rest on our laurels. In terms of the development of lined up investments, I am optimistic, while the roundtables we have organized have yielded positive results, as has public sector investment in areas such as infrastructure. This allows me to believe that we are about to harvest what was previously sown.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the Bank's performance throughout the period of the 2012-14 strategy?</h4><p><span></span>A key element of the new strategy we adopted at the end of 2014 is to further increase our presence in business and commercial banking, build our SME portfolio, and enhance our understanding of the microfinance market. Although microfinance is not in our agenda as a business model, we have spent time and resources to understand micro-lenders' strategies and the way they operate. Thus in 2013, we have established a fund to render technical assistance to microfinance institutions to have more solid grounds for lending to those organizations and actively working with them in the money market. Over the same period, in 2013 we began expanding overseas with the opening of our Georgian operations. We continued expanding further in the region, and, at the end of 2014, the Turkish banking sector regulator granted PASHA Bank permission to acquire the controlling stake of TAIB Bank from Aksoy Holding of Turkey. We will start business operations there in 2015 and we are very excited about the prospects the Turkish market holds for us. During the strategic period we pioneered in many aspects, such as developing various innovative programs, introducing a microfinance technical assistance fund, and adopting a new approach to SME lending, corporate banking, and project finance. We have a strong presence as market makers in securities market.  </p><p><span></span>There were many changes in the banking sector over the course of 2014. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan has resolved to tighten control over the pace of growth of the retail market, because debt on the one hand improves lifestyles, but it can also create over-indebtedness, which is not always sustainable. Growth of retail banks has generally been slow, but in 2014, retail banks started growing at a rate of around 20-25%. As a result, there is a potential need to grow in the retail sector and to lend to SMEs and corporates. There have been signs that the level of competition between the banks that lend to the retail sector is starting to change. Competition is good, and we have always been supporting this.</p><h4>What is PASHA Bank doing to develop its online and technological offerings?</h4><p><span></span>Key developments in this area for PASHA Bank over the past year include internet banking, which is something we have been actively promoting. In 2014, we saw the biggest increase in new internet banking customers since we started operations in 2007. There are a number of other technology projects we are working on right now such as new client communication channels, contactless payments with MasterCard and Visa, as well as mobile wallet solutions. Our operations have always been focused on corporates, SMEs, and investment banking, and we support our clients with the best possible solutions, even if some of these may traditionally be more relevant for retail banks.</p><h4>To what extent does online development help to grow the client base?</h4><p><span></span>Online banking services are still new, and we sometimes face some hesitation from clients because change is not always welcome. We are working to educate people about the benefits of our online services, which is important. However, I think the key reason behind our success is our ability to meet customer requirements. This is where we want to develop our strengths, to be a significant and useful partner for our clients. Our online solutions support our appeal to clients and we will constantly continue to improve our customer service, as there is no limit in service excellence.</p><h4>PASHA Bank Georgia won the Caspian Business Award in 2014 and the Turkish market is opening up for you. What does this say about PASHA Bank's expansion in the region?</h4><p><span></span>We observe intensive business interactions between Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Georgia, and trade has been increasing recently. This is a major focus for us, as we will be financing trade between the three markets. We want to be a local bank in both Georgia and Turkey. That is our approach, and we adopt international best practice wherever we operate. However, we have to keep strengthening ourselves locally in order to look outside. We are actively promoting ourselves as a gateway to the region maintaining good relationship with financial institutions and investors in Europe, North America, Asia, and MENA countries, and we will continue our efforts in this direction.</p><h4><br>PASHA Bank recently held a forum in Sheki on agriculture. How does PASHA Bank help to facilitate the development of this sector?</h4><p><span></span>Agriculture contributes 5% to Azerbaijan's GDP and up to 40% of the population is employed in this sector. This is a major gap, which is high on the government's agenda. Azerbaijan is an agricultural country and has been one of the major suppliers to the neighboring Russian market. PASHA Bank has financed many factories where agricultural products are processed and exported. Our role is not only to finance large projects, but also to finance mid-sized projects and corporate entities with smaller processing lines. We know the potential of the agricultural and agribusiness sector of Azerbaijan and where the opportunities and challenges lie. The government recognizes these challenges and opportunities and demonstrated its attention and support: thus it has withdrawn all taxes in agricultural sector until 2019. There are, of course, some risks such as issues of underdeveloped agro insurance products and services. However, waiting for these issues to be resolved would mean losing a lot of time. PASHA Bank has a dedicated project team working solely on agro-finance, and we have people advising us on this using lessons learnt both in Azerbaijan and other parts of the world. </p><h4>PASHA Bank underwrote local bonds for Embawood in 2014. How significant do you think this is in the evolution of Azerbaijan's capital markets?</h4><p><span></span>Embawood's bond issue is the latest in a series of corporate bond issues that PASHA Bank has underwritten. This is another step in the right direction. We started underwriting bonds for telecom and financial services companies, not only for our own benefit, but also to support our clients' institutional investors and as of today we have managed to issue 21 corporate bond issue and total volume is AZN228 million. We are interested in more players coming to the market since this will really support the development of Azerbaijan's capital markets and we are therefore best placed to help Azerbaijani companies to raise capital on the domestic capital markets. Successful placements are important for building confidence in the domestic capital markets. Helping to develop Azerbaijan's capital markets is one of PASHA Bank's key aims, since this will not only help to bolster investment banking activities in the country, but it will also support Azerbaijan's economy as a whole. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>TBY talks to Juan Manuel Santos, President of Colombia, on boosting ties across Latin America and making Colombia a top place to do business.</p>
<h4>During the Summit of the Americas 2015, you raised several notions of pan-American policymaking on behalf of Colombia based on respect and education. What is your vision for creating greater harmony and equality on the continent through education?</h4>
<p>I believe there is a greater conscience throughout the hemisphere of the crucial role that education must play in the development of our nations. It is a common understanding that without education we cannot prosper or have more equal societies; this leads to constructive conversations about common purposes that put some of the old debates behind us. In Latin America specifically we simply haven’t done enough to harness the talents of our citizens and we must cooperate amongst ourselves and with others in order to leap forward. The world isn’t waiting for us to catch up. This spirit was certainly reflected in the most recent Summit. Colombia proposed the creation of an Inter-American Education System that can support governments in formulating policies that will significantly improve the quality of education and increase investments in knowledge, science, and technology. Our proposal was well received at the summit to the extent that the OAS, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the Latin American Development Bank (CAF) all signed a letter of intent, in which they agreed to promptly put in motion the actions needed to move forward on this initiative.</p>
<h4>One of your re-election pledges was to lead the way to accession of the OECD. In what policy areas will convergence with the requirements prove the most challenging, and how do you intend to overcome these challenges?</h4>
<p>Colombia has made significant progress across all the policy areas in the accession process and we are optimistic that we will be ready by the end of this year. Obviously there are some policy reforms that tend to be more difficult to carry out than others such as taxes and health because they may require new legislation or broader consensus. Our government has taken on the task of communicating and engaging with all sectors of society and with the Colombian people to explain the long-term benefits of adopting best practices recommended by the OECD. We have found that these efforts have been successful in galvanizing support for most reforms that we believe will make our country more modern, transparent, and innovative.</p><div class="quote">“This administration has focused on Colombia’s regions since our first day in office.“</div>
<h4>One of your domestic strategies for reducing regional discrepancies in productivity, representation, and equality is represented by the President in the Regions initiative. What are the main pillars of this strategy?</h4>
<p>This administration has focused on Colombia’s regions since our first day in office. We set about working on reducing poverty, improving education, building new houses, and providing basic services like water and energy to people in areas that had been neglected for decades. But we also understood that Colombia’s regions have enormous economic potential that must be unleashed over the long term. So we have also focused on creating the right conditions for sustainable development and prosperity, for instance by building next-generation highways, bridges, airports, and ports, and connecting every municipality to broadband internet. Through the President in the Regions program I am able to closely follow up on hundreds of different initiatives and be accountable to the Colombian people.</p>
<h4>You have recently estimated the cost of the peace process at COP54 billion over the next 10 years. Which stages and mechanisms of the peace process are most challenging for the state to address, for financial reasons and required structural adjustments in the economy?</h4>
<p>There are many challenges that will need to be addressed the day after a peace agreement is signed. Many of those will take years to resolve, but one particular area will require extraordinary efforts, including the sustainable development of our rural areas and the investments required to create a world-class agro-industrial sector; these are inexorably linked. The conflict has negatively impacted our ability to do both and the social and economic opportunity costs have been staggering. In addition, these are very complex issues that must be dealt with in sensible and smart ways. But on the upside, according to the FAO, Colombia is one of only eight countries in the world that can significantly increase its food production. Most foreigners don’t realize how vast Colombia is territorially; larger than Spain and France put together, so both the challenge and the opportunity are great. We have already begun putting the structures and resources into place that will put us on the right path. We are confident that, in 10 years, Colombia’s economy will be structurally more diversified, not just in terms of agricultural production, but also in high-value exports based on science, technology, and innovation.</p>
<h4>Taxes generated from impuesto patrimonio will reach approximately COP8-10 billion annually. How will this tax be distributed and how do you perceive this will impact international investment dynamics in the country?</h4>
<p>Last August in my inauguration speech, I put forth three strategic priorities for Colombia over the next decade; a country at peace, with equity, and the most educated nation in Latin America. My job in these four years is to put Colombia on an irreversible path toward these objectives. Our investments in the National Development Plan reflect those priorities. We cannot be a country at peace if there is inequality. Long-term inequality can only be eradicated through education. And a highly educated nation is much less prone to resort to violence in a globalized world. This is a virtuous cycle that will make Colombia an even more attractive place for international investors. If we are already one of the best managed economies in the world and foreign investment is pouring in by the billions without having ended the conflict, one can only imagine what is possible in the Colombia that we want to be by the year 2025.</p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Continental Tires arrived in Mexico about 20 years ago. How has your business evolved since then?</h4><p>Continental arrived in the country through the purchase of Euzkadi and General Tire in North America from Carlos Slim, the richest man in Mexico, and second richest in the world today. Euzkadi was once a family company enjoying a strong relationship with dealers at the time, as was the case for General Tire. When Continental took over the businesses, dealers were not too happy because we are a German company and they tended to assume that a major and difficult shift was underway for them. And yet we managed over this time period to demonstrate our ability to our dealers and to date the success of Continental Tires in Mexico is also the success of the dealers. We are a large family, proud of our distribution network. We were established in 1994 at the time the NAFTA agreement was signed. Continental was aware of the opportunity that the country represented and immediately grasped the urgency of a presence in Mexico. When we came we had three plants, one in Mexico City, another one in San Luis Potosí­ and another one in El Salto, in the state of Jalisco. Today we only have one plant, located in San Luis Potosi, a state in the Bají­o region where many car manufacturers have established assembly plants.</p><h4>You mentioned your highly successful dealer network. What are its main characteristics?</h4><p>The tire market normally consists of mono-brands. For instance in Spain, there are manly three brands: Pirelli, Michelin, and Firestone; Michelin holds nearly 50% of the market. Argentina is a similar market, but Mexico is now the most open in the world and characterized by tough competition, especially from tires produced in Asia.</p><div class="quote">“With regards to passenger vehicles and light trucks, the key challenge we face is from cheap tires."</div><h4>How are imports of Asian tires impacting the domestic market?</h4><p>It is tough to compete against the Chinese-made tires. The Mexican tire sector in radial truck tires grows by 19% annually and is largely driven by the Chinese effect. When you sell Chinese tires, the quality is not as good, but the replacement is quick. For this reason, the market has grown significantly. In a good case with quality tires, you can retread a couple of times, rather like resoling your shoes. The cost per kilometer of cheap tires is higher than with ours, and cheap tires cannot be retreaded. Yet the Chinese government is extending considerable support to 100% Chinese companies. It provides support for land, buildings, taxes, exports, and workforce. Rival prices are 50% below ours, which is seriously denting the market.</p><h4>About 3 million cars were manufactured in Mexico last year. How has Continental Tires contributed to this success?</h4><p>Our share of the replacement market for SUVs is at around 9%, having fallen by 35%, although many companies have entered the market in addition to Chinese products, making for a particularly tough environment. The Mexican market sees annual sales of 1.1 million cars, and we hold around a 12-13% market share of these units; we have contracts with Audi, Mercedes, General Motors, Ford, Seat, and Nissan.</p><h4>What is Mexico's importance in Continental's global portfolio?</h4><p>With regards to passenger vehicles and light trucks, the key challenge we face is from cheap tires. Yet our products result in a substantial 26m difference in braking distance on a wet surface. We achieve about a 4 to 8m difference with other premium products. Our tests hold the record in this respect. Moreover, we have the best rolling resistance against our competitors for truck tires. Earlier in the year we concluded a test with a company located near Guadalajara that is registering a 12% saving on fuel, which is the kind of message we are trying to get across to our dealers and consumers. Continental Tires offer the best technology in the world for brakes and rolling resistance. We operate a plant with 1,100 employees, which makes us the smallest entity, although the figure can rise given demand for additional production.</p><h4>How have you performed in 2015 so far and what are your expectations for the remainder of the year?</h4><p>The passenger and light truck market will grow by around 6% for the year, but we target 10% growth. Continental is currently changing its focus in Mexico. We are now pushing and training our dealers to sell our premium tires. We aim for 10% annual growth until 2018, inclusive.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Guardian positioned in the national media landscape?</h4><p>The Guardian was set up in 1983 and is generally regarded in the country as the flagship newspaper. It was conceived as an intellectual title, geared at the social elite, academia, and the educated classes; as such it is not a mass-circulation title. Thanks to patronage from advertisers, and sales revenues, we have the solid capitalization required in order to be competitive. This affords us a comprehensive and independent publishing remit, and our journalistic integrity and strong editorial underpin our status as an impartial and influential newspaper.</p><h4>How have you structured your coverage of the recent elections in Nigeria?</h4><p>Covering Nigeria is complex. Generally, in the West, newspapers are free to endorse a diversity of candidates. We are not quite free to do so here because of the complex national diversity. According to stereotyping by some western media outlets, we have a Muslim north and a Christian south, but this evaluation is untrue. For instance, the Islamic population in Lagos is remarkable. The outgoing governor is a Muslim, and yet his wife is a Christian, which is common. In the southwest, the influence of Islam is significant, determining the local cultural landscape. And yet, the southwest is also divided between Muslims and Christians. In Nigeria, newspapers have to balance the fundamental objective and policy of the newspaper with the complexity that shapes the diversity I mentioned. In that same vein, if a presidential candidate emerges from the south, newspapers based elsewhere should deliver balanced coverage.</p><div class="quote">“The advent of social media and citizen journalism means quick fixes."</div><h4>How do you plan to adapt to online media?</h4><p>We have no choice but to adapt. The advent of social media and citizen journalism means quick fixes. This in turn has compelled the industry to look inward and adapt to technology that can make people pay attention to digital editions of newspapers. We could emulate the transition of the New York Times, for example, which went to the UK, headhunted, and hired the former BBC Director General as its new chief executive. It found in him the ability and the skill to get people to migrate to the digital platforms and read digital editions of the New York Times. We have studied its model and we know that this is the way to go. If you go to our website, we have just overhauled it to ensure that we migrate our readers to our new digital platforms. Even if the revenue is lower than for hard copies, the pace of internet penetration leaves us with no other option. At The Guardian, we are working at full speed to migrate readers and generate revenue online.</p><h4>What are the key policy issues when it comes to business for the new government?</h4><p>One of the most important policy issues for businesses is to integrate Nigeria into the emerging market in Africa. South Africa is the only African member of the BRICS countries and is a large emerging market. We know that in the new world, the business model of governance is important. That is the kind of agenda that we would like to set. Big government and bloated expenditure are no longer viable models, and government is about people, and this must be reflected in government models for sustainable growth capable, too, of reducing poverty. We have to establish a policy, even in the newspaper, to ensure that we emphasize reporting on the business aspects of politics. People depend on The Guardian for intelligence on governance issues.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the country in the year ahead?</h4><p>Our expectation is for a tangible change, the very platform on which the new government ran. Now we expect to see changes in orientation and thinking, where people gain confidence in government through transparency, controlled spending, and prudent governance. At the same time, people cannot expect all solutions to be fielded by the government alone. We now need to invest in quality education, which is the greatest tool of national or global competitiveness. Nigeria used to be part of the best university system in the world, but over the years the quality has declined, and research orientation is severely lacking. Quality is the benchmark of desired change. The government should pay attention to reforming the curriculum, teacher training, and research funding to set the national destiny on a solid course. Without quality education, you cannot develop a skilled civil service or bureaucracy capable of driving the change that the people need.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you brief us on the jewelry and gemstone markets in Latin America?</h4><p>Let us first define Latin America from the perspective of the Panama Diamond Exchange. We are talking about a market that covers an area from Mexico in the north, encompassing the Caribbean Basin and traversing all of Central America and South America. It stretches over a vast area, including 20 countries and many islands, with widely divergent population groups. Latin America is a region rich in precious minerals and metals, and a result has a history of jewelry production stretching back literally thousands of years. But despite that, it is today considered one of the most under-developed jewelry markets on the face of the earth. More than two years ago we conducted a survey and discovered that the annual demand for jewelry and gemstones in Latin America hovered above the $8 billion mark. But with 8% of the world population, Latin America consumes less than 5% of the fine jewelry produced. On the one hand that indicates that it is performing way below its real potential, but on the other hand it show that there is room for tremendous growth. This is particularly the case where diamond-set jewelry is concerned, because there the region's market share is even lower. What is lacking in Latin America, when compared to other parts of the world, is a well-organized business infrastructure, which is exactly what we are creating in Panama with the World Jewelry Hub, which will be the first trading center in the region dedicated to the professional gemstone and jewelry trade. The Panama Diamond Exchange, the only recognized diamond bourse in the region, will be its anchor organization.</p><h4>What factors made Panama the prime location in Latin America to establish Panama Diamond Exchange?</h4><p>A variety of important factors provide Panama with a clear strategic advantage. Geographically it is located at the virtual midpoint of the Americas, and this factor is complemented by the presence of Panama's national carrier, Copa Airlines, which is the most connected airline in Latin America, and by Panama City's Tocumen International Airport, which is the most connected airport in the region. It can honestly be claimed that, in Latin America, all roads lead to Panama City. Panama is also home to one of region's most stable and prosperous economies, and it one that flourished, despite the fact that the population is relatively small. Its economic strength has been built on its status as both a regional and international logistics and financial service center, with the largest concentration of banks in all of Central and South America. Panama also has a dollarized economy, which is particularly important in the diamond and gemstone business, itself conducted internationally in US dollars. Panama's government has traditionally been business friendly, and from this perspective we have received strong support for our venture over the years. This was underscored by the government's declaring the area of the World Jewelry Hub a Free Zone, with no customs or duties on goods traded within its confines, and no tax on the profits of companies registered on its premises. And meanwhile, the attendance in person of the official grand opening ceremony in April by President Juan Carlos Varela further emphasized its significance.</p><div class="quote">“A variety of important factors provide Panama with a clear strategic advantage."</div><h4>Panama has the second largest free trade zone (FTZ) in the world: the Colón Free Trade Zone. Why have you decided not to build Panama Diamond Exchange there?</h4><p>The economic environment in Colón is excellent, but it is a Free Zone designed to cater to merchandise coming through the canal on ships. This is not relevant to the diamond sector. Diamonds enter the country by air, meaning that a diamond exchange and jewelry-trading center would better be served by being in close proximity to an international airport. The World Jewelry Hub is situated just minutes away from Tocumen International Airport in the Santa Maria Business District, which is fast becoming Panama City's most exclusive business address. The diamond trade also requires extremely tight security, with careful control over people and merchandise entering and exiting the complex. Furthermore, lighting and trading conditions need to be optimal. The World Jewelry Hub, home to the Panama Diamond Exchange, is being built to the very highest standards, and when complete will almost certainly be the most luxurious and exclusive facility of its type in the world. Importantly, with the area of the World Jewelry Hub also having been declared a Free Zone, the gem and jewelry-trading complex today enjoys that same benefits and advantages as exist in Colón.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the synergy that you will create between the World Jewelry Hub and the Diamond Exchange?</h4><p>The World Jewelry Hub is being created as a specialized trading center, where members of the jewelry and gemstone sectors from across Latin America and the world can gather and do business. By bringing together a critical mass of companies and dealers in one secure facility, it is possible to provide a selection and range of merchandise that is considerably larger and more varied than any one of them would be able to find anywhere else in Latin America. This would preclude the need to travel beyond the region, and also would engender the type of competition that ensures fair market prices at all times. The Panama Diamond Exchange is the anchor organization of the World Jewelry Hub, and in that respect provides a structured trading environment for diamond and gemstone dealers, be they Panama Diamond Exchange members or affiliates, or members of other diamond exchanges from around the world that are associated with the World Federation of Diamond Bourses. It is important to remember that, internationally, diamond-set items constitute about 50% of all fine jewelry sold, and that in excess of 90% of those diamonds are handled by WFDB-bourse members. This means that anyone using the World Jewelry Hub and Panama Diamond Exchange would effectively have access to most of the polished diamonds on the world market at any particular point in time.</p><h4>What are your main priorities before the end of this year?</h4><p>We are following a strict schedule. The Phase I building of the World Jewelry Hub, providing a headquarters for the trading floor and administrative offices of the Panama Diamond Exchange until the Phase II building is ready, was completed at the end of 2014. The building includes additional office space for up to 60 companies, and all the offices and showrooms were rented before construction had ended. Occupation of the Phase I offices began at the start of this year, and most were active by the time that we had the official opening of the facility in April, in the presence of President Juan Carlos Varela, as well as other senior government ministers and leaders of the international gemstone and jewelry trade in April. The event was highlighted by the first Latin American Diamond and Jewelry Week, with buyers flying in from 16 Latin American countries, and suppliers from nine international centers. The Phase I building is now fully operational, and at the Panama Diamond Exchange we are working to ensure optimal trading conditions in the new facility. At the same, PDE is conducting a membership drive. Construction of the Phase II building of the World Jewelry Hub will begin during the third quarter of this year, and is scheduled for completion by the end of 2017. From a design perspective, the iconic office tower will introduce a new level of luxury and design to the industry, not only in Latin America, but internationally as well. Office space in the facility is available for purchase, and the pre-sales campaign is about to begin, with an official sales campaign starting within the coming few months.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has Xerox played in Peru's development over the past 50 years?</h4><p>Xerox has been in business for 109 years, and has been present in Peru since 1965, making this year our 50th anniversary. Over the past 50 years much has happened in this market. I can say that, along with IBM, we are the only technology company to have been here this long. During this time we have delivered technology and services, while evolving as a company in light of sector developments. Xerox, by delivering equipment and technology, has rendered companies more profitable, allowing them to concentrate on their core businesses. This results in cost savings, greater efficiency, and better results. We are also aware of the environment because much of our technology meshes with environmentally friendly technology. For example, we are the only company to offer environmentally friendly inks. We are also active in the digital segment and outsource printing and other processes, which we call process outsourcing. Our company is also a leader in document management.</p><h4>What is the international significance of Peru for Xerox?</h4><p>Xerox Peru is one of the most important markets for Xerox Corporation. Peru reports to a larger region known as Xerox LA, which encompasses Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru. We have been growing and seeing positive results from the outset in the local market, and the dependability of the country is reflected in our regional strategy. Over the past 10-15 years, the economy in Peru has been especially strong. It has posted some of the best growth performances worldwide. Peru has a scale and dimension that allows us to balance the business. Not only does Xerox operate in the printing side of the business here, but also in business process outsourcing (BPO). Xerox has contact centers where such services underpin our robust product portfolio.</p><div class="quote">“Xerox Peru is one of the most important markets for Xerox Corporation."</div><h4>How is Xerox handling the transition from a paper to a digital-based economy?</h4><p>We are proud of Xerox's past technological contributions, which are reflected in its brand recognition. Technological innovation is in the company's DNA, and today we are transforming into a document management company that manages flow as a service-oriented business. Of course as long as there is printing, we will remain active in that business, but for the future, the company is working to develop a service space. In 2010Xerox bought ACS, a company entirely dedicated to business process and IT outsourcing. We have since transformed the company to offer a broader portfolio of technology and services. There are few brands that can boast the association of product and name that we enjoy. Today we are transforming, and the challenge is to keep the company moving forwards and transforming as a service provider.</p><h4>What is the balance today between Xerography and services?</h4><p>At Xerox Peru, almost one-third of the organization is focused on the services area. The remainder is active in the technology side of the business. If we look at the business as a whole it might be even more than one-third when you factor in the ACS business and contact centers, possibly up to 50%. The business is concentrated on developing this services component, which has a long-term potential. I come from the PC industry, which is a cogent example of evolution over the years, especially from the hardware side. It is essentially a crystal ball that helps to understand the future of the industry. It is hard to predict the future in our industry. For Xerox our business is profitable in all the segments, we are growing, and we have a clear strategy to develop.</p><h4>How important is your work with Lima's transport system and what role does technology play in this?</h4><p>We have a business group in charge of transportation. In the case of Peru, we have local infrastructure that handles ticketing, manages transportation cards, and tracks overall usage of the system. Many countries are using management to improve their transportation systems. At Xerox we have projects going forward to improve transportation systems. Xerox has many verticals such as a strong position in the mining sector and the financial sector, and we are also well established in the HR area.</p><h4>Xerox recently introduced new digital printers to the Peruvian market. How are you expecting this to affect growth and development?</h4><p>Xerox has a diverse portfolio of printers in different formats such as A3, A4, and multifunctional units. This is an important space for us because it is where we expect future growth, and we need to be the leader in the most valuable space in the market. We offer equipment for pretty much every setting. This is not just a matter of projects, but also encompasses software integrations and solutions services in conjunction. In the digital area we have a business group for graphic communications. The demand for color and digital printing is increasing both in the business and home sector. The demand from our corporate customers for digital is rapidly increasing in particular. We have a strong portfolio that leads worldwide, which is targeted for companies. With those products, you get into the digital business and with the software you are more efficient and this is an attractive market in Peru because the industry was dependent on offset printers. With the new technology, it is possible to print smaller quantities. Our solutions provide the space for these businesses to be productive.</p><h4>What makes Peru an attractive address to do business?</h4><p>Peru still has a good growth rate. The country is not in crisis, despite economic deceleration. Peru is recognized as a great place to do business and has a good financial rating. The economy is stable in a way that few other countries are right now.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>The government announced that 2015 would be the Year of Agriculture in Azerbaijan. How important is Shamkir as an agricultural center in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>Our government has an official program for the development and growth of all regions in Azerbaijan, and Shamkir is part of this program. Shamkir is one of the top regions for agricultural production because it is exceptionally fertile. The climate is ideal for different kinds of fruit and vegetables, and half of the 3,000 ha of agriculturally fertile land in Azerbaijan is located in Shamkir. We supply 50% of the vegetables sold in Azerbaijani markets. We export fruit and vegetables as well, mainly to Russia, where our produce is highly valued. About 10% of the Azerbaijani population is involved in the agricultural sector.</p><h4>Over the past two years, there have been some major projects initiated in Shamkir, such as the Agro Park. How important are these recent projects for Shamkir's development?<br></h4><p>The Agro Park is one of our major investments. The whole process is taken care of at the Agro Park, from production to storage to delivery, and it serves as a training and educational center as well. Based on targets the President has set for the project, we are working to ensure that Agro Park is socially beneficial, will help businesses develop commercially, and will develop in the future. If Agro Park is successful, it can become a pilot project upon which other Agro Parks can be planned and built in other regions. The water reservoir project is one of the largest projects ever initiated in Azerbaijan. It is a $1 billion project, and would actually be better considered as the second stage of a major development project throughout the region. Without the water reservoir, the Agro Park would not have been possible. The reservoir will irrigate an area of 30,000ha, and another 70,000ha area will also be open to professional and systematic watering, whereas before it was only managed and done seasonally. For all these projects, we have done our research and learned from the experience of various European countries that have undertaken projects similar to ours. We have consulted the experts and directors of those large projects, which has helped us to plan and implement these major plans in Shamkir. </p><h4>How can Shamkir support and develop SMEs in the future?</h4><p>At the moment, the government provides long-term credit to develop agriculture using non-banking credit institutions. All people who want to develop businesses create and distribute their business plans to the Ministry of Economy and Industry. When business plans arrive to the central ministry building, a foundation approves them and then long-term credit is offered. This process moves from preparing the business plan to then presenting it to the main ministerial building in Baku. All of this process can be practical and quickly implemented if the plan is profitable, if the result can be taken, and it is a good idea. There is no rejection, and it will not be blocked in any way if it is profitable. We are making the process faster and removing any delays. The main aim is to develop the smallest part of business because the government is already engaged with the largest. In order that there are no breaks in the chains, we are developing autonomous authorities. It is a great pleasure for me to be involved in this segment. In 2015, we are on track to start some larger projects with the assistance of the government.</p><p><strong></strong>Our region is ideal for tourism because we can offer many natural riches and resources. We have a wonderful climate and beautiful mountains and valleys. We have various plans and programs to attract more tourists, especially from Europe. We are especially interested in developing eco-tourism. There is a lot of potential for increasing tourism in Shamkir, and it is an important sector in our economy.</p><h4>There are some major events about to be held in Azerbaijan, such as the European Games, the Formula One race, the Islamic Solidarity Games, and others. How will these events affect and benefit Shamkir?<br></h4><p>There is no doubt that these events will be a major contribution to the country, and the Shamkir region wants to be involved however we can. In 2014, we were involved in a number of large successful events, such as the Shamkir Chess Championships, which will be held again this year, as well as the 2014 Lithuanian-Azerbaijani Business Forum. Our region was also included in the international Tour De Azerbaijan cycling event. We want to hold more international forums, meetings, and conferences in Shamkir. The central government sees the importance of our region and is actively trying to include Shamkir in many major projects and events.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the development of Shamkir in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Agriculture is the priority. In 2014, we implemented a new management system that gave more power to the local political structures and provinces. The local authorities can now undertake their own projects and manage them with a certain degree of autonomy. This devolution of political management was modeled after European practices, with the aim of supporting entrepreneurship, innovation, and development on a local level. This has translated into many profitable and useful agricultural projects in the region and has had direct impacts on the well-being of the country. Local producers can pool their resources, cooperate more effectively, and increase synergy between producers and markets. Other major projects at local municipal levels involve the breeding of livestock, such as sheep and deer. We have used our own rich livestock resources, in addition to animals brought in from different regions, such as deer from the Altay region of Russia. All production in all sectors is abiding by the highest international standards and is in accordance with professional management systems. The Shamkir region is a focal point for the central government now because if we are successful, there will be a push for similar successes to be achieved in other regions of Azerbaijan. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the impact of the Kuwait Fund's investments and projects internationally?</h4><p>We target not just specific sectors, but rather the desired projects of different countries. Depending on the country we are investing in, we might have certain overall sector preferences that stand out such as social, education, or basic natural resources, like water. If those sectors are within the preferred project rubric, they receive additional lending attention. The respective national priority is the primary consideration, as well as the economic benefit of the specific developments in that country. Recent projects have ranged from schools to electricity and drinking water for cities like Havana, Cuba. And besides Cuba, we have supported numerous projects in Uzbekistan, China, Egypt, and Lebanon; the number had totaled 13 by March 2015, which is typically a busy month for us.</p><h4>On which criteria do you base the disbursement of project grants?</h4><p>Normally when we receive a request, we consider it based on available infrastructure taking into account the project status when we analyze the technical information. We receive initial board approval in conjunction with studies provided, and following an appraisal we are then able to issue a grant. The process varies depending on the project, and countries do not always deliver fully prepared studies. Most projects require a complete financing plan, and most countries are still in the midst of this process when they first present to us.</p><div class="quote">“Our involvement locally is mainly through institutions we have in Kuwait."</div><h4>How is the Kuwait Fund involved locally?</h4><p>Our involvement locally is mainly through institutions we have in Kuwait. We are giving 25% of our yearly net profit to the housing authorities and have created a program to train newly graduated engineers to help keep them working in the country.</p><h4>What role does Kuwaiti aid play in the region in terms of promoting stabilization in other economies?</h4><p>Kuwait is always keen to assist other countries in achieving environmental stability. When Kuwait gained independence, it wanted to promote aid, which is still a fairly new idea in the world. Aid was a part of our makeup in the early 1950's with the establishment of the Gulf Authority, which built schools and hospitals in gulf countries, in such places as Dubai, Sharjah, Yemen, and Oman, as well as establishing hospitals and housing projects in Africa. That authority worked on grants, and the Kuwait Fund was established in parallel fashion for lending to mega projects. The concept of aid took root well before our own development. Kuwait has continued to be a stabilizing country for the international community, and the UN recently recognized its aid program for Yemen and the Syrian situation.</p><h4>To what extent does the Kuwait Fund work with its counterparts in the region?</h4><p>Most of our regional partnerships have been established since the 1970s, when Arab collaboration began in earnest. We enjoy close cooperation with virtually all parties in the region. In terms of directorship, we meet every three years at which point we discuss related issues and the status of programs undertaken together.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges the Kuwait Fund faces in financing aid and development projects?</h4><p>Normally in any project, the key challenge lies in procurement. And because regulations may differ, we need to prepare for any potential outcomes. Agreeing on specific procurement can be a challenge at times, but it is our necessary priority to agree on financing plans. At the moment we are collaboratively working on what we call parallel financing, in which we work with different partners on the varying aspects of financing one project. Some of the projects have specific regulations and are required to have local financiers or contractors.</p><h4>What are the Fund's priorities when it comes to aid allocation?</h4><p>At this moment, we do not have a specific formula for allocation as much as an occasional commitment to a specific disaster or situation. In general, our allocations are mandated in Arab countries; Arab countries must account for no less than 50% of our commitment. We work to fulfill that as well as allocate funds for other countries, dividing contracts based on need.</p><h4>Have any projects been especially successful?</h4><p>We like to consider every project a success story, though the rate of success is always evidenced by seeing firsthand the before and after. This is of course very difficult with some 800 projects. I, however, have seen many projects from start to finish, and it is always rewarding. We were especially encouraged by an irrigation project funded in China due to the people's tremendous reaction upon its completion. Our tendency is to fund large projects with overall economic impact rather than a focus on an individual group. There is still nothing more rewarding than, for example, seeing a hydroelectric dam provide much needed water to a community of people.</p><h4>How can the Kuwait Fund's success continue in the future?</h4><p>The framework has been established such that the Kuwait Fund can exist long into the future. Over the years we have faced many obstacles. Through organizing a way to get things done even when circumstances were less than ideal, we have been able to weather difficult times. We moved through a period in the mid 1980s when the price of oil fell, during which time we were heavily dependent on the government. Since then our cash flow has been steady, and we are often called on for services because we have the funds to allocate.</p><h4>How important is it for others to see Kuwait Fund as a partner in development?</h4><p>At this very point, that is exactly what we were created for: to be a development aid for institutions. Certainly we should be perceived as a partner in development. We are working in 104 countries around the world and cooperating with even more.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Kuwait Fund in 2016?</h4><p>We are working on plans for a specific program, and given that there are currently no obstacles, we hope to make progress on that. By 2016 we hope that conflict in Yemen will have come to an end. We have certain programs currently under consideration on behalf of the government whereby we could help fulfill a number of Yemen's governmental obligations.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[On The Road Again]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[on-the-road-again]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What priorities have been set for the NRFA for the next three to four years?</h4><p>The main task of the NRFA is management of the road fund. Over the coming few years we will work toward our vision of creating a sustainable road fund. Our key thematic areas are resource mobilization and fiduciary management, while ascertaining value for money. We source funds for the sector from our corporate partners in the form of loans and grants, and from the government through fuel levy and tolls, our corporate partners, and through grants. Once these funds are accessed, we manage them prudently through accountability measures, transparency, and economic utilization. There is huge demand for roads, the key to economic development. However, there is a gap between demand and supply. At NRFA, we are devising creative means of securing funds. Looking ahead, we envision a strengthened road fund based on the user-pay principle.</p><h4>How will the Link Zambia 8000 project improve the efficiency of the road transport sector?</h4><p>Link Zambia 8000 is one of several projects in the road sector. There is also Pave Zambia 2000, which will develop 2,000km of roads, the L-400, designed to enhance connectivity in the capital city, Lusaka, and other ongoing projects linking Botswana and other areas. Zambia has eight neighbors. In the past, this was seen as a disadvantage, but we are changing that mindset. We are strategically located, and should be land-linked as opposed to landlocked. Link Zambia 8000 will operate like a river basin with tributaries and will enhance trade and reduce transaction costs. Nearly every industry can benefit from roads, especially agriculture and mining. These sectors drive the economy and are dependent on the efficiency of the transport system. Also, we can improve the living standards of people in rural areas by increasing access to diverse amenities.</p><div class="quote">“Any industry, including the road construction industry, needs currency predictability."</div><h4>How do you expect the conditions of the 67,000km Zambian road network to evolve?</h4><p>In general, our paved roads are relative to feeder roads and are generally in good condition. An integral aspect of good road condition is the development of a comprehensive maintenance system, which has since been developed and will be fully supported by NRFA. A stitch-in-time saves nine. Thus, the importance of maintenance cannot be over-emphasized.</p><h4>What role can PPPs play in developing Zambia's transportation infrastructure?</h4><p>There are several forms of PPPs being used in this country; Mongo-Kalabo, L-400, Mansa-Luwingu, and Mbala-Nakonde were all funded by some form of PPP. We are, however, not utilizing PPPs to our full potential. We need to do more to entice private companies to partner with the government to fund roads in the form of PPPs.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the Kazungula bridge project?</h4><p>If you visit Kazungula today, you will observe a long queue of trucks on both the Botswanan and Zambian side that can occasionally stretch for kilometers. The bridge will reduce the time of border crossings thereby cutting costs for transporters. The bridge provides a strategic link on the North-South Corridor, which, once completed, will enhance trade.</p><h4>To what extent does the fluctuation of the kwacha impact road construction?</h4><p>Any industry, including the road construction industry, needs currency predictability. Stability in the exchange rate is thus the preferred norm by contractors. The Bank of Zambia endeavors to ensure such stability.</p><h4>What are the main achievements of the NRFA?</h4><p>The audited accounts have been unqualified since inception in 2006. We have successfully coordinated the budgeting process through the road sector annual work plans, the basis for financing the sector. We have also had successful technical audits, conducted investigations and field visits, and enhanced our internal controls. Additionally, we have created a strong corporate governance system through our code of ethics and we have a strong Integrity Committee, which recently won a Commitment Award from the Anti-Corruption Commission. We have facilitated capacity building of local contractors through support to the National Council for Construction. We have also initiated the Construction Finance Initiative, which is designed to enhance access to financial instruments such as bid bonds, payment guarantees, and performance guarantees by local contractors. More local contractors on board means increased competition and lower unit costs and  can thus do more for the same amount of funding. Looking ahead, we want to broaden our revenue streams, increase fiduciary oversight on road finances, and enhance technical audits and value for money, thus, our vision: A Sustainable Road Fund.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>BAU was ranked 35th among the top 50 universities in the Arab World, in the QS University Rankings for 2014. To what do you attribute this position?</h4><p>During the past few years, the university has undertaken ambitious development of the academic curricula and the laboratories of various faculties. In the process, BAU has attained a number of international accreditations by prominent institutions of a number of academic programs. Currently, we are in the process of attaining further accreditations. We have also taken steps toward the recruitment of academic staff-members from various fields of specialization and different nationalities, while maintaining our ability to recruit non-Lebanese students and encouraging scientific research. These steps will help in improving the BAU's ranking. Being included in a list of rankings is desirable, however, the problem is that there are various classifications that are issued without reliance on well-documented information by an informed source. This entails that universities attain higher or lower rankings along this continuum. We have, therefore, established direct contact with classifying institutions, who take our comments into consideration, since we deem our University to be worthy of a higher ranking.</p><h4>What role does the research and development play at BAU and what are the most significant ongoing research projects?</h4><p>A main item on our 2013-18 five-year strategy is to support scientific research. We rely upon this objective to encourage researchers and offer up-to-date studies and research. The most important thing for us is not to limit ourselves to a purely research-oriented process, but instead to direct researchers toward studies that are relevant to the concerns of society. Accordingly, we have created a wide network of contacts with the civil society, as well as local institutions and ministries, and we have signed diverse MoUs with them. In addition, I have appointed a Dean of Postgraduate Studies and Research, whose main responsibility is the implementation of this strategy. Today we have 10 faculties and over 35 programs, highly qualified academics, and well-equipped laboratories. The spectrum of research may be varied and relevant to the needs of the community. Ultimately, we are a university, and our principle responsibility is to serve the community, not only at the educational level, but in every other aspect as well. For instance, the Beqaa Valley is an agricultural area in need of development where we established the Research Center for Environment and Development, which has already launched ambitious research projects and courses and is interacting with local communities there. We will offer financial funding, the necessary laboratories, and any other support the study may require.</p><div class="quote">“Our goal is simple: to secure better education for the largest possible student body."</div><h4>How would you describe BAU's relations with the Lebanese business community?</h4><p>Our ties with businessmen are solid; they have offered great training and internship opportunities to our students at their establishments. The university is for them a trustworthy source of human resources, due to the high academic level and efficiency of our graduates. One example was a generous donation to the Petroleum Engineering program at BAU from an international oil company, consisting of software used by different petroleum companies. We launched this program two years ago, and it has greatly developed our students' abilities, and improved their chances on the job-market of this emerging sector in Lebanon. Another example of collaboration can be seen in the pharmaceutical laboratories at BAU, which have been certified by pharmaceutical companies as adequate to perform tests on drugs.</p><h4>What is the significance of having notable alumni, such as HE Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani, in terms of building trust and gaining recognition?</h4><p>The graduates of BAU, ever since its establishment, have managed to assume leading positions in the Arab world. There are tens, indeed hundreds, of successful personalities in different countries, such as Sheikh Abdullah. This proves that the role of BAU is significant in terms of securing influential academic staff members, in developing students' personalities, and encouraging students to take the initiative in the communities they belong to. The aim is to be able to effect positive change in all positions they occupy. The achievements of our graduates, who number over 100,000 have been making a difference in development, science, administration, and politics, in particular in the Levant.</p><h4>Lebanon's status as the educational capital of the Middle East is being challenged by ambitious projects in the Gulf region. What steps should be taken for Lebanon to retain this well-earned title?</h4><p>As the President of BAU, my chest swells when I see any form of progress achieved by an Arab university. Our aim was never to achieve profit, for we are a non-profit institution. The mission of BAU, and the objective for its establishment, is to qualify future generations. As for competitiveness, we will continue to exert our best, for we have an advanced educational system in Lebanon. Some 22.5% of our students are non-Lebanese, mostly of Arab and Gulf nationalities. We continue to consider Beirut the center of tertiary education, and though we may not be wealthy, we have the will, the ability, and the efficiency to continuously develop ourselves and compete not only with universities in the Gulf area, but internationally, too. We have attained international accreditation by institutions that have accredited others worldwide. I believe that other universities in Lebanon are well reputed, and it is this that maintains Beirut as the capital of education. Personally, I hope that every Arab city can become a pioneering capital of higher education, as this is the mission we all seek to fulfill as academics, and as BAU in particular, and it is what will shape our respective countries' fortunes.</p><h4>What are Beirut Arab University's long-term objectives?</h4><p>Our goal is simple: to secure better education for the largest possible student body. BAU is a non-commercial institution, and has no stocks or investors. It is an institution affiliated with a charity, and the revenues of the university are channeled toward its development. We also managed to expand our presence in Lebanese territories; thus, we opened a branch in the north of Lebanon, which is considered among the poorer parts of the country in need of development. We thus offer education and serve the community in scientific research for a larger section of society. The University also functions as a consultant in a variety of engineering projects. Our strategic plan for the upcoming five years highlights restructuring the governance system strategy, supporting research and student services, deepening public engagement, enhancing international relations, and diversifying financial resources.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[quantum-leap]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the current state of Sharjah's economy, and what strategies have been implemented by the Department to boost economic development?</h4><p>The economy is going through one of its best periods of growth, as reflected by a record GDP growth rate of over 8% in 2014, and a growth in gross fixed capital formation of 6.4% in 2013. On top of that, Sharjah has enjoyed a limited inflation rate of about 4%. Also, it has witnessed high and direct operational spending on labor, which hit a growth rate of 6.5% and consequently achieved significant growth rates in a number of sectors, such as construction, wholesale, and retail, where workers compensation rates rose to 9.4% and 6.4%, respectively. The Department's annual business indicators reflect Sharjah's fortuitous economic status, where the new licenses that SEDD issued in 2014 increased by 6.3%, and license renewals grew by 6.4% compared to 2013. Furthermore, the number of new enterprises that were established increased by 5% due to the fact that more industries began to conduct business in Sharjah throughout 2014. Additionally, commercial enterprises grew by 7.9%. SEDD looks at local indicators as well as the growth of licenses through an integrated perspective that enables sustainable development in economic, social, and environmental terms. Also, it always works on developing economic performance by improving its services, encouraging investment, and applying initiatives to save investors' time and reduce their costs in accordance with World Bank determinants for conducting business. Furthermore, SEDD is concerned with social issues through raising the number of local businesses, releasing the “Eitimad" license, which enables locals to conduct their business from home, in addition to supporting national and youth enterprises. SEDD is also committed to applying requirements for the environmental compatibility of Sharjah's enterprises, and achieving a green economy in the context of attaining sustainable development in the Emirate.</p><h4>SEDD has joined forces with Shurooq and the Sharjah Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) in promoting Sharjah's economy. How would you assess this increasingly holistic institutional approach to growing Sharjah's economy?</h4><p>SEDD believes that Sharjah's economic performance and vision to attain economic development require expending efforts across a number of sectors in order to attain a standardized methodology that affects the main sectors positively. As a result, SEDD realizes the importance of collaborating with all economic development partners in the Emirate, not just with SCCI and Shurooq, but also with the consumer, producer, financial institutions, and government agencies, which play crucial roles in the economic development of Sharjah at local and federal levels. Lately, SEDD has turned its focus on creating a partnership with Shurooq and SCCI by attending several joint meetings and promoting investment in Sharjah. It has also linked its working environment with the investment view of Shurooq and the tools that SCCI holds to communicate with businesses. As such, SEDD completes the economic management triangle at the governmental level and promotes Shurooq's vision of investment, supporting SCCI's process in linking products and services with the requirements of the market.</p><div class="quote">“The economy is going through one of its best periods of growth."</div><h4>What factors make Sharjah an attractive destination for investment, and in which particular sectors of the economy do you see the most significant investment opportunities?</h4><p>Sharjah enjoys competitive features not only at the local, but also at the regional level. The most important aspect of Sharjah is that it has been a family business incubator since the 1970s, which helped in making it an ideal environment for establishing business and enterprises. Sharjah also has a comprehensive educational system that compliments the economic structure, where it used to boast the largest port in the Gulf in Khor Fakkan Port, and the first airport in the region. Sharjah has witnessed significant developments resulting from economic initiatives and projects launched due to the directives of HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah. The most promising sectors of Sharjah's economy are utilities, hospitality, transport and logistics, real estate and construction, business services, financial enterprises, and government services, as these have reached major growth in 2013. Such growth in some sectors is a direct result of increased government spending, such as the utilities sector, where rates increased from 1% in 2012 to 12.5% in 2013. The hospitality sector recorded 3% growth in 2012 and 9.4% in 2013, while the government services sector attained a growth rate of 2% in 2012 and 11.2% in 2013. Such quantum leaps in these sectors drive the need for additional unconventional local and international investment, such as through PPPs between Sharjah's government and the private sectors.</p><h4>It is estimated that Sharjah will continue to post strong GDP growth in the years to come. What is your medium- to long-term outlook for the local economy, and what are your particular expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>Sharjah has achieved a compound GDP growth rate of 11% over the past 10 years. Such a thing proves that Sharjah's economy is sustainable and hasn't been exposed to structural imbalances, even after the economic crisis of 2008. On the contrary, Sharjah reached a GDP growth rate of 4.2% in 2009, and went on to post 8.5% GDP growth in 2014. Based on these growth rates, we expect that the GDP will reach around AED90 billion ($24.5 billion) in 2015. The Emirate's economy is moving at a steady pace not only in terms of high GDP growth, but also through growth across the specific economic sectors. Based on our economic and political analyses, we believe that Sharjah will continue to achieve high growth in the years to come.</p><h4>What goals have you set for the Department for the next five years?</h4><p>Over the past two years, SEDD has paid great attention to organizing infrastructure, developing organizational performance, building capacity, improving investor relations, facilitating its services in Sharjah and surrounding regions, rehabilitating national cadres, and achieving transparency. The Department has implemented an organizational strategy to enable it to guide the economic development in Sharjah. To strengthen this strategy, HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, has called for the establishment of a Commercial Department and an Industrial Affairs Department at SEDD to focus on the qualitative growth in the main sectors of the emirate. Also, SEDD has concentrated on implementing a sectorial economic vision that focuses on horizontal geographical development, supporting local businesses, employing local employees from educational institutions, boosting local trading and industrial sectors—especially the wholesale and retail sectors—increasing customer satisfaction by increasing efficiency and saving costs, and developing laws and working conditions in the Emirate. Our aim is to improve the ways of doing business in Sharjah, as well as to monitor and control our markets, to ultimately encourage investment and spending in order to obtain economic growth.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Strong Fiber Diet]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[strong-fiber-diet]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about Phase3, its background, and the ways in which you differ from other network providers?</h4><p>Our story started in 2003 when we identified a gap in the telecoms sector and capitalized on it such that we were able to build our business to the level it has reached today. A number of major telecoms operators saw the need to invest in Nigeria as the country was on the cusp of exponential growth. We also saw a gap in transmitting voice and data due to lack of proper telecoms infrastructure. Phase3 immediately took advantage of this paucity, obtaining an exclusive right that affords us vast coverage within the country. We built a fiber-optic system to serve the telcos that require enhanced telecommunications services, and for over 11 years most said telcos have relied on us for such service requirements. Currently, Phase3 runs an over 7,000 kilometer fiber-optic network connecting major cities in Nigeria. We have also expanded beyond our borders to the republics of Togo and Benin, where we enjoy exclusive rights. The advantage of our connectivity is that it crisscrosses the aforementioned nations. This is one of our competitive advantages, as we do not experience the sort of vandalism that underground fiber is susceptible to. In retrospect, our lines are not vulnerable to road construction; our infrastructure is reliable, quick to deploy, and grows between five to 10km per day. These are major benefits for our growing client base in terms of capacity, service availability, and speed of deployment. In this regard, the Phase3 story is very interesting for African businesses.</p><h4>How has the government, through the National Communications Commission (NCC), created an enabling environment?</h4><p>The state ensures that indigenous companies are given an opportunity for growth. We have an opportunity to be licensed, to receive support, and to build our infrastructure. The NCC has done exceedingly well in that regard. It is probably at the forefront in Africa on effective regulation of the industry. The regulator's primary goal is to encourage rapid developments in telecommunications within the country, as well as investments, and operators to offer affordable, yet innovative products and services, as well as solutions. It functions also to ensure that jobs are created, as the telecoms sector remains a consistently successful component of the Nigerian economy. It is certainly a pillar that other businesses and organizations rely upon to operate.</p><div class="quote">“With broadband penetration currently at just around 6.8%, we are looking for ways to grow this to 40%."</div><h4>What makes the Open Access Network unique and how do you create awareness amongst multinationals and SMEs?</h4><p>Open Access Network has enabled us to distinguish ourselves with reliability, neutrality, and affordability. Every business, large or small, has come to realize the importance of these factors. We remain neutral so that anyone who requires local or international connectivity can rely upon us to provide these services impartially. That is where the Open Access Network comes in. Service-level agreements (SLAs) are signed and availability is ensured to meet the customer's needs and requirements. Over the years we have built a brand and name for ourselves, while contributing significantly to economic development. Moreover, Phase3 has built infrastructure in rural parts of the country to reach unserved communities and ensure regional development. Customers do not need to invest in new infrastructure as they can lease from us. We operate our services in tandem with the developed world and benchmark on standard global practices. And in all we do there is the awareness of not just providing service, but of helping to grow and sustain our broader economy.</p><h4>What major challenges do you face in today's telecoms sector?</h4><p>The sector still requires investment; however, this challenge provides huge opportunities for investors. With broadband penetration currently at just around 6.8%, we are looking for ways to grow this to 40%, an opportunity that is being leveraged by Phase3. We want to link every nation with a single network and will achieve this faster with more investment in the sector.</p><h4>What is the rationale behind the MoU that Phase3 signed with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)?</h4><p>ECOWAS's MoU with Phase3 concerns the implementation what they regard as an Intelcom II project—building a single telecom network infrastructure that crisscrosses the 14 ECOWAS states. This project has adopted a steady, rather than rapid pace, as huge projects such as this take time. However, there is no doubt that within the extended period we have given ourselves, we will achieve the objective of a fully connected West Africa. We have received enormous support from ECOWAS. For instance, if we decide to work with the government of Ghana, ECOWAS will give insight on areas that must be considered by providing information on the overall goal of the region. They will also ensure that all regulatory aspects are dealt with. Ours has been a successful relationship over the past few years. Going beyond ECOWAS, we want to work with similar bodies in Central and North Africa. Connecting Africa remains the goal, which cannot be achieved without collaboration and partnership. We are leveraging the West African power infrastructure to achieve our goals. Our solution is better than digging up the roads and trying to lay fiber optics in these countries.</p><h4>What could you say about the recent deal to bring fiber-optic cable to the Republic of Niger, and which other countries do you foresee expanding to?</h4><p>The Republic of Niger-Nigeria fiber-optic cable project is premised upon the deployment of aerial fiber infrastructure from Kano in Nigeria to Gazaoua in the Republic of Niger. The country, being a landlocked area, saw that Nigeria's fiber links met the formulated Niger-Nigeria Joint Commission's goals of broader economic integration. Niger is a landlocked country with no access to submarine cables and its broadband penetration is probably the lowest in Africa, if not in the world. Aerial fiber was therefore, key to the success of the deal because of its apparent advantages. The project has commenced with a planned deployment of a 228km fiber link to the Niger border. We consider the deal a pivotal factor in improving bilateral relations. It is wonderful to see the social and economic development of West Africa through the growing connectivity in the region. Beyond Niger we will be looking at other countries in need of data, such as the Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone. Thus, expanding infrastructure to as many countries as we can, such that every nation in West Africa is connected, is our main goal.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

Then they look at which location is most suitable. There is a slight difference between the Greater Kuala Lumpur proposition and the Malaysian proposition. We are positioning Greater Kuala Lumpur as the location for multinationals to set up regional headquarters, whether they are engaged in business services, engineering, finance, retail, supply chain, or healthcare. Greater Kuala Lumpur offers the total package of cost competitiveness and a thriving business ecosystem, in addition to having a broader talent pool. We are also English speaking, multicultural, and have access to the region. The broader business opportunities in Asia are accessible as the city is centrally located, and the government is making it easier to do business with business-friendly policies and a competitive tax regime. The cost on its own is not good enough—it is the combination of both cost and a strong business ecosystem that provides an overall package for investors. Greater Kuala Lumpur offers a single location that we like to call an optimal venue for multinationals' regional headquarters.</p><h4>How does InvestKL work with other government agencies to attract foreign investments here?</h4><p>We work very well with other government agencies. Malaysia is divided up into different development corridors; the Northern Corridor, the East Coast Corridor, Iskandar, and then the corridors in Sabah and Sarawak. So if a company is manufacturing in Penang, for example, the actual manufacturing will be in the free trade zone in Penang, but the headquarters can be located in Greater Kuala Lumpur. We are not competing; we are complimenting each other. All of the regional headquarters should be located in Greater Kuala Lumpur because this is the heart of Asia for business operations and naturally where the companies' intellectual property and key decision makers will reside. Greater Kuala Lumpur is the location for centralising operations for these organizations, and ultimately when we engage with a multinational contact we will do it here.</p><div class="quote">“The Principle Hub Initiative is an initiative designed to make Greater Kuala Lumpur even more attractive to foreign investors."</div><h4>How will the infrastructure projects underway increase the attractiveness of KL both as a place to do business and to live?</h4><p>There are two parts to that answer; first of all, you have to look at what business opportunities these projects present. Many engineering companies appreciate what our government is doing and the business opportunities available to them. When companies know about the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) project and high-speed rail project and are keen to become involved, they will set up their regional headquarters here. The same company that worked on Dubai's Burj Khalifa has its regional headquarters here. From a quality of life standpoint, the biggest green project we have right now is the MRT project. Greater Kuala Lumpur is going to grow from 6.5 to 10 million; therefore, without the infrastructure it will get very congested, and we will not be able to complete our vision of making Greater Kuala Lumpur into a modern and world-class city. This has become extremely important. Besides transportation, the revitalising of the Klang Valley river project will also help to enhance the quality of life and provide additional avenue for business opportunities. When all of these infrastructure projects are completed, Greater Kuala Lumpur will truly be a well-connected city with great quality of life, which makes it easy to do business.</p><h4>What are the elements of the recently announced Principle Hub Initiative and how does this complement the work of InvestKL?</h4><p>The Principle Hub Initiative is a game-changing initiative designed to make Greater Kuala Lumpur even more attractive to foreign investors. The Principle Hub is considered the control tower, where multinational companies set up strategic regional bases to conduct and manage their regional and global operations across several countries more effectively and efficiently. This initiative provides investors with attractive incentives to establish Principal Hub in Greater Kuala Lumpur for the region to streamline operations and better optimise resources, capabilities and cost. At InvestKL we can help investors to align the incentives with the investments commitment. It is designed to attract even more substance from the multinationals coming into Greater Kuala Lumpur and further enhance our position as a regional headquarters especially with Malaysia taking the ASEAN chair in 2015.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the challenges facing gas pipeline construction in the South?</h4><p>We started working on this project back in 2009 alongside an international partner, but over the years purchased the concession from them. This is a project with an estimated cost of $5 billion, and we have been extremely focused on success over the past few years. Those last few years have been dedicated to completing research studies, acquiring licenses, looking for funding, and starting construction works. We hope to complete financing negotiations with a consortium of 15 banks. The project, awarded by tender at the end of July 2014, constitutes the construction and subsequent operation and maintenance of more than a 600-mile-long gas pipeline, which stretches from the jungle area to the Peruvian coastline, and involves the reinforcing of the current natural gas and liquids transportation system, impacting directly on the development of the regions of Cusco, Arequipa, Moquegua, Puno, Apurí­mac, and Tacna. The 34-year concession represents the greatest investment in infrastructure in the history of the country. This way, the development of the project was launched, and was long awaited by the population of the southern macro region, especially Cusco. It will generate around 7,000 direct jobs at the construction stage, allowing for the highly anticipated industrialization of the South. The pipeline also boosts the regional economy and promotes decentralization of the Peruvian economy away from Lima. The gas pipeline will unlock many other energy projects in several regions, boosting industrialization. The South has specialized in the energy industry, whereas the North has a stronger focus in the agribusiness sector. Peru has yet to further consolidate itself as key energy player in the Andean region, but this project will allow it to export energy regionally. The Peruvian government works on regional energy integration in Peru and that should boost the role of Peru in the Andean region. There have been several meetings between Ministries to consolidate such regional projects, and Peru has a lot to say thanks to its energy potential, especially in terms of hydro energy.</p><h4>In Peru, an obstacle to large projects is acquiring a social license from communities and avoiding conflict. Odebrecht has had remarkably limited social conflict throughout its history in Peru. How do you manifest social responsibility?</h4><p>We always have a close relationship with the communities in which we operate and w make sure they understand that they are a priority for us. Additionally, we have several specific programs to achieve integration and collaboration with and in the community. For example, we offer local training opportunities so that the local populace can participate in our projects. This helps considerably in fostering a close relationship between company and community. It also enhances the role of local people as taxpayers, which contributes to the regional development of infrastructure and services. Over the past few years, Peru has achieved much in terms of regional security, political stability, and flexibility, and we would like to think we, too, have contributed to these achievements through our close ties with regional communities.</p><div class="quote">“The public sector has become much more efficient and flexible since we began our first projects here within the PPP framework."</div><h4>How would you assess the development of PPPs in Peru?</h4><p>Odebrecht Latinvest is a pioneer of PPPs in Peru. The public sector has become much more efficient and flexible since we began our first projects here within the PPP framework. These structures are rather like marriages, being long term in nature. There has also been a notable improvement and development in the funding of PPP structured projects, especially with local and regional authorities, whose power to finance is lower than that of the central government. On top of that, Peru has improved its reputation and attractiveness in the eyes of foreign investors by refining its PPP structure and opening its economy to international investment.</p><h4>What is Odebrecht's growth strategy in Peru moving forward?</h4><p>Over the next six months our priority is the gas pipeline. However, we have several ongoing projects in the country besides that one, and there are many other interesting projects on the horizon, like the Metro, for example. At the moment, we have 14 ongoing projects here between concessions, public and private works, and so on, and expect to reach as many as 20 projects over the next couple of years. Our priority is to participate in projects central to national development.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the key developments of the past year that have increased the attractiveness of Dubai as an investment destination?</h4><p>Dubai launched a number of initiatives in 2014 as part of its continuing campaign to enhance the attractiveness of the Emirate as a competitive hub and destination in which people from all over the world could live and do business. While many of these initiatives formed part of an ongoing infrastructure expansion, many others were aimed at integrating progressive and sustainable policies in line with international best practices and the country's general emphasis on innovation. From an FDI perspective, there were four particular initiatives that stood out. The first was the launch of a new innovation program by TECOM, with an overall investment of $1.23 billion. The fund is planned to support the Dubai Internet City and the newly-launched Dubai Design District (D3). Dubai Internet City's innovation hub will provide 1.6 million sqf of dedicated space to around 15,000 creative workers, while the Dubai Design District will provide an inspiring and dynamic destination of over 1 million sqf for emerging designers and artists, thereby attracting designers and entrepreneurs to set up in Dubai as a gateway to the region. Second, the launch of the MENA's first Google for Entrepreneurs Tech Hub at AstroLabs Dubai, is intended welcome tech entrepreneurs from across the globe seeking to access high-growth emerging markets. The hub is meant to boost innovation and entrepreneurship in Dubai in the IT sector. Third, the Smart City initiative, aimed at transforming Dubai into one of the smartest cities in the world, one in which end-users will have access to innovative services. The initiative will allow 24/7 access to government services remotely, which in turn will improve ease of doing business in the city. Fourth, the Dubai 2021 plan, with focus on the human aspect of Dubai's growth. The plan will help position the Emirate as a preferred investment destination with a substantial human capital capable of leading Dubai into the future. In addition to these new initiatives, significant milestones have been achieved toward improving cooperation between the public and private sectors, in order to enhance Dubai's appeal as a business hub. The doubling of the capacity of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park to 200 MW, combined with the commissioning of the Dubai Tram project, were milestones in Dubai's ongoing efforts to improve energy security and infrastructure. The year has also allowed the real estate sector to stabilize after improved regulations addressed investor concerns and financial markets bounced back, indicating maturity and an improved confidence in Dubai's business environment.</p><h4>How do you expect the establishment of the Al Etihad Credit Bureau to impact investment within Dubai?</h4><p>Collecting credit data about individuals and companies is vital for improving transparency, as well as helping lending institutions make informed decisions and encouraging them to finance bigger projects and individuals. This will result in further stimulation to the economy. The credit bureau will also allow the monitoring and regulation of lending practices, which will help organize and add stability to the financial sector.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai Internet City's innovation hub will provide 1.6 million sqf of dedicated space to around 15,000 creative workers."</div><h4>It was recently announced that Dubai is to build a $1 billion financial zone in the heart of downtown. What does this say about the Emirate's commitment to providing the facilities and infrastructure necessary to become a leading global financial hub?</h4><p>The joint venture between Dubai's sovereign wealth fund (the Investment Corporation of Dubai), and the Canadian Asset manager Brookfield is a vote of confidence in the stability of the sector, and anticipates future financial growth. The new development will provide world-class operating space for multinational companies that want to capitalize on the anticipated growth prospects associated with Expo 2020.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>TBY talks to Héctor Cuellar Sosa, General Director of Válvulas Worcester de México, on company growth and why its valves have become so successful.</p>
<h4>Could you outline the development of the company?</h4>
<p>Ours has been a family-owned business since 1963. My father established the company in Mexico City and, ever since, we have been established here in three manufacturing locations. Company growth has been in evidence on an annual basis. Our operations started out almost exclusively in Mexico, but over the years we looked to the export markets. Originally, it was Central and South America. Our operations in Central America are limited. One of the major players is Costa Rica, where there is a solid installed base for our products. Then, we have a presence with warehouses and inventory in Argentina and Brazil through sister companies. From those two countries, we supply the internal needs of these markets and export to Colombia, Peru, and somewhat to Bolivia, Uruguay, and Paraguay. The three manufacturing facilities in Mexico City produce diverse products for wide shipment. We have established our own foundries and forging plants, and while we import raw input, we employ local laborers and purchase all our equipment in Mexico. Válvulas Worcester de México has also been exporting to Asia for around a decade. We have representation in Thailand and have realized sales to the Chinese market for the past three years. My father is the president and founder of the Chinese-Mexican Chamber. We sell in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, and the latest market we have been trying to crack is China. We target the specialty sector because China already has many bulk manufacturers. We do special applications, such as cryogenic values, which are very low temperatures, and also nuclear applications. In Europe business has been slow, and our sales offices in the Netherlands is currently in standby mode to see how conditions develop. We are seeing good signs from the Spanish economy, while the Italians are also doing well, and the Germans remain strong. Hopefully, over the coming years we can resume our European operations.</p>
<h4>How much of your production do you export?</h4>
<p>Only 25% of our established base here is geared at export markets. Fortunately, we retain a solid market share in Mexico of 60-65%.</p><div class="quote">“There is increased potential for multinational companies to establish operations in Mexico.“</div>
<h4>What opportunities will reforms bring to the Mexican economy, and particularly to your company?</h4>
<p>There is increased potential for multinational companies to establish operations in Mexico. We are now in round zero of the energy reforms, and there are about 20 companies playing an important role. I hope that the government establishes a well-established base that renders the Mexican market attractive for companies looking to invest. Of course, the Secretary of the Economy has to play a key role with regards to the Mexican content. I was told that there would be a content requirement for international companies coming into Mexico of 25-30%. That Mexican content is divided into four sectors: manual labor, machinery, raw materials, and value-added products. Válvulas Worcester and other well-established Mexican companies stand to benefit the most. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the joint ventures that we will be able to realize with companies coming here.</p>
<h4>How are you positioning yourself as a key partner in the country?</h4>
<p>First of all, we have been here for 51 years. Válvulas Worcester de México has an excellent network of 45 distributors throughout the Mexican Republic. Over 51 years millions of our valves have been installed. Companies coming to Mexico know that they can rely a local partner with extensive manufacturing facilities, and a good workforce with knowledge and experience. We have engaged in a wide range of industries ranging from oil and gas, to chemicals, petrochemicals, pulp and paper, and food and beverages, among others. Companies coming here can comfortably depend on our knowhow.</p>
<h4>Could you tell us about your plans for expansion?</h4>
<p>We are set for expansion, but mainly in terms of our product range, by adding automation, special valves, metal to metal, and products required by Mexico’s future oil and gas industry.</p>
<h4>What are your expectations for 2015?</h4>
<p>We expect to post YoY growth of between 12 and 15%. Experience leaves us confident that the third year of an administration sees investment. Moreover, this is an election year, and hence one of new budgets and financial allocations. We are therefore optimistic that 2015 will be dynamic. Of course, if everything goes through well and we see key players establishing themselves here, multinational companies will need to hire many people. Meanwhile, certain states such as Veracruz, Tamaulipas, and Nuevo León will see further grow than others.</p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about the history of Tetra Pak in Colombia and its process of setting up affiliates and partners?</h4><p>Tetra Pak has been present Colombia for 22 years. We entered the market because it represented the largest dairy opportunity in the region, since both milk production and consumption are huge. Having arrived, we immediately struck up alliances with strategic partners such as Colanta, Alpina , Alqueria, and Coca Cola. Postobon, for instance, has always been a significant partner of ours. From the outset, Colombia was identified as Tetra Pak's main focus in the region. And back in 2008, the Colombia operation took over responsibilities from Venezuela. Colombian operations have also overseen the Ecuadorian market from the outset. Therefore, the countries that constitute what we call North Andina—Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador—are all managed from Bogotá. In 2010 we decided to integrate two additional countries, namely Peru and Bolivia, which until then had been operating independently. We integrated them into North Andina and created Tetra Pak Andina. Tetra Pak not only provides the packages, but also the machines and equipment underpinning the process. We offer a diversity of supplies depending on what customers require. In this sense, the range of technical services we deliver is vast. It is impossible to have experts for all types of machine in every country of operation. However, by combining five countries, it is possible to share them throughout the region within the same company. This is a prime example of how to maximize resources, time, and efficiency through integration. For us the main focus of merging five countries is to provide better customer services.</p><h4>Could you tell us about growth over the past year and, moving forward, what segments you are planning to focus on?</h4><p>Our main segments in Colombia are dairy, juice, beverages, and alcohol. In dairy we combine regular and flavored milk. The second category is juice, nectar, and still drinks. This includes whole tins, 100% juice drinks, and related refreshments. The entire tin, what we call the beverage category, is the main one for us in Colombia. Over the past couple of years it has been growing quite aggressively, last year growing commercially by around 16%. For 2015 our forecast is for growth of 15% and we expect to maintain this rate through 2017. Moreover, growth is coming from all categories. Last year, the beverages category saw the highest growth level, and this year we expect dairy and beverages to remain the key categories. The alcohol category is also experiencing growth, albeit at a slower pace.</p><div class="quote">“Last year, the beverages category saw the highest growth level."</div><h4>How did you succeed in increasing the recyclable packaging you use, and with which partners did you work?</h4><p>The environment is one of our core focuses at Tetra Pak Global, and while our concerns are not confined to environmental issues, we may frame related efforts in the general context of social responsibility. Tetra Pak does not directly recycle its packages, but we have the know-how, which we share with companies interested in working with us. We are investing in machinery to support these companies in implementing recycling concepts adopted from Tetra Pak. What we want is for 100% of our packages to be recycled. But to start that, we need to promote certain alliances, which we have done with various entrepreneurs and companies in the business.</p><h4>What are your near-term investment targets?</h4><p>We will continue investing in capital equipment, but will also continue to invest in the environmental dimension of our operations. In terms of the plants themselves, this might become a focus for the future, although to realize this we first need to reach critical mass, and so it is rather difficult to put a date on such projects.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the government working to achieve energy efficiency in Panama?</h4><p>We have been experiencing truly outstanding improvement in the energy sector, which has translated into more demanding growth. Our key objective is to make sure that we have sufficient energy, such that the energy sector does not become a stumbling block for growth. We want a supply scheme that would provide the most economical solution, as well as energy security through a diversity of sources. We are concerned about the sustainability of the sector, and are looking closely at the possibilities presented by renewables. Our short-term goals are related to renewability, while our long-term objectives lean toward the sustainability and affordability of energy supply. The government's participation in the electricity sector is mostly as a regulator, and operator of transmission companies and systems. In that regard, it is establishing strategic partnerships with several companies using mixed capital sources. However, most companies are privately owned, and we intend for the electricity sector to remain that way.</p><h4>What are the main factors and indicators of growth in the sector?</h4><p>From an electricity standpoint, we have clear indicators related to energy consumption and daily maximum demand, both of which are rising. We have seen sustained annual demand growth over the past five or six years of over 5% on average, which foretells the arrival of significant further investment. And meanwhile, all indicators point to firm growth, which is no surprise given the strong economic performance Panama is currently displaying.</p><div class="quote">“Developments are mostly observed in the private sector."</div><h4>Can you elaborate on the main projects attracting government investment?</h4><p>Developments are mostly observed in the private sector. We indicate how much power is required, and then organize tenders to award concessions to power companies, which then build the necessary facilities. Currently, we have a short-term tender to ensure sufficient power as we experienced shortages two years ago. We have received two bids each for 350 MW of capacity. We will collect as many offers as possible and award up to 350 MW to a combination of potential investors. That should come between the spring of 2018 and 2020 and suffice to underpin electricity sector growth. There are plans in place to undertake sequential lines, and our distribution is carried out according to a planned schedule.</p><h4>The country heavily relies on hydropower. Which other alternatives is the government considering?</h4><p>In the past we have placed much emphasis on hydropower as an economically viable alternative, as it is a clean and well-proven solution. Last year close to 60% of our electricity generation came from this source, although we have been seriously considering alternative options. Hydropower projects are rapidly diminishing as many have already been completed, but there will be a large number of smaller hydro projects coming online to support economic growth. This will become less important over time. Our reliance on rain is affected by seasonal variation, but we are able to plan in anticipation of this. In the renewables field we have been looking at wind, and a privately developed 280 MW wind power plant has been set up in the midlands. This will be the largest of its type in Central America. We also have an active group of people working on solar energy, which previously had been prohibitively expensive to develop. In Panama we have chosen to neglect solar energy development and let other countries such as Spain and Germany pursue it. New technology is expensive, and we lack the ability and experience to work on solar energy. There is, however, a high level of interest in developing it here. And it is becoming more economical, with differences even in comparison with last year. We are hoping to integrate different energy sources in a combined grid. For a time we thought the solution was to move toward natural gas, but ultimately we found ourselves in a situation where the price of oil dropped, rendering it more competitive. We anticipate some good offers in oil and gas depending on prices and escalation trends.</p><h4>What has to be done to transform Panama into a leading energy sector player?</h4><p>LNG pricing in different regions varies considerably. There is currently no cost-effective means of transporting LNG from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The largest consumers of LNG, such as Japan, obtain it from the Atlantic, where prices are more favorable. Meanwhile, we expect the expansion of the Panama Canal to have a major factor in making LNG an obtainable commodity. At the moment this is problematic because of long-term contracts and point-to-point deliveries. There is, then, not really a fluid commodity market in place for LNG today, although strong potential exists to develop one. We have hopes of Panama becoming a center for storage solutions. In the long term, ships will be using LNG for propulsion, which will make the LNG business more flexible. The government is actively assessing the situation and its alternatives, and the moment it is deemed favorable we will make our move. What we do not want to do is enter the business ourselves; we simply want to ensure that it is being done properly.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance of the electricity connection agreement signed by President Varela and President Santos of Colombia?</h4><p>Central American nations as a whole are smaller than Colombia, and it has taken us a long time to work out a deal. We developed a strong framework agreement to establish connectivity between the two states, in which we perceive strong potential. The facilities and institutions are there, but it is difficult to get underway due to certain environmental considerations. This will require time more than anything else. We have long since formulated the economic dimension of the agreement, and know the potential and future scenario. The political will is there, project feasibility has been established, and I know progress will be environmentally acceptable.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the University of Malaya?</h4><p>The University was established in Singapore in 1949 with the merger of the King Edward VII College of Medicine, which was established in 1905, and Raffles College, which was founded in 1928. Therefore, the university is technically 110 years old. In 1959, there were two campuses, one in Malaysia and one in Singapore, and in 1960 the campus in Kuala Lumpur became the University of Malaya, while the campus in Singapore became the National University of Singapore. Currently, we have almost 25,000 students with a ratio of 1:1 in terms of undergraduates to postgraduates. Our vision is that, by the year 2020, as a research-focused university, we will have two postgraduates for every undergraduate. Our niche courses are Engineering and Information Technology, and we are also well established in Medicine, the Life Sciences, Islamic Studies, and Social Science.</p><h4>In which areas is research currently focused and what are some of its practical applications?</h4><p>There is a considerable body of research being undertaken. We have a research grant of around $590 million from the government of Malaysia for five years, from 2011 to 2015, specifically for high-impact research. This grant has enabled us to establish high-impact research laboratories with excellent facilities and equipment. As a result, we have succeeded in having with us three Nobel laureates as well as Malaysian scientists who returned from overseas to work on high-impact research projects with our researchers. Our research is currently focused on both the sciences and the social sciences. For example, at the Faculty of Medicine, research has led to the implementation of a better and more effective treatment protocol for children with leukemia, which has led to an increase in survival rates. Similarly in breast cancer research, survival rates of women have improved because of the work undertaken. Meanwhile, in the engineering faculty, we have a bio-medical engineering group that is researching to produce better prosthetics for amputees. And in Islamic Studies, we have established a Quranic Center and at the Faculty of Accountancy and Business Administration, Islamic Finance and Banking is one of our leading courses. Emphasis is also given to cross-disciplinary research. For example, the Academy of Islamic studies conducts research together with the Institute of Biological Sciences on natural products and also works with our engineers, the Islamic Center for Halal Food Groups, and the Medical Center. Then we have the UM Living Lab, which conducts research on biodiversity, sustainability, and waste management. Research activities by the UM Living Lab have also led to initiatives such as the installation of solar and wind powered lighting in the surrounding areas of the UM lake.</p><div class="quote">“The University of Malaya is the oldest in Malaysia, is well respected, and is ranked first among the finest local universities."</div><h4>How is the university working to improve its place in international rankings?</h4><p>We are currently ranked at 151 in the QS world ranking and aim for further improvement. The University of Malaya is the oldest in Malaysia, is well respected, and is ranked first among the finest local universities. In 2014, we published almost 4,000 research papers and, as a research university, we receive research funds from the government of Malaysia, for which we are very grateful. On top of that, the government has awarded us $590 million over five years for high-impact research. Thus, since 2007, we have managed to sustain our excellent track record of achievement and have established partnerships worldwide, notably with Nobel Laureates. We have managed to secure four such individuals to assist us in bringing fresh ideas to our research initiatives. The other 19 public universities in this country are like our brothers and sisters, and we assist one another wherever possible. Meanwhile, we are fortunate to be the only public university located in Malaysia's capital city.</p><h4>What can be done to prevent a brain drain in Malaysia?</h4><p>I had the opportunity of being involved in the Malaysian Brain Gain programs. The first such program was a failure because, while many people wanted to return, Malaysia lacked the necessary infrastructure to make it a viable option. In the second program, we improved and learned from our mistakes. The University of Malaya plays an important role in bringing in a good number of people and convincing them to stay. That is why our infrastructure has tremendously improved in terms of facilities and research equipment. For instance, we have established research facilities equivalent to a Nobel Laureate laboratory. We have to do this because, if researchers lack quality facilities, they will naturally look elsewhere. Money is also a consideration for them and so we allow them to create spinoff companies. This means that although the patent belongs to the University, the establishment of a spinoff company allows them to commercialize the product from the research, where 70% of the profits go to the researcher and his or her team and 30% to the university. In this manner, we will be able to retain top researchers in the long run.</p><h4>What are some of the programs in place to encourage entrepreneurship?</h4><p>Entrepreneurship is not confined to students, but also involves the researchers and fellow staff. We have a new policy whereby PhD students, upon completion of their research, can return as lecturers or researchers. However, before that  they have to adapt and observe the management process at the Vice-Chancellor and Deputy Vice-Chancellor's offices, as well as learn the skills of managing their research projects. Of course, in engineering, for example, there are numerous products, which are of a high quality and have commercialization potential. In fact, we have our own commercial arm to oversee this, as well an innovation hub. In this manner, we are able to encourage entrepreneurship. With the help of the government, we seek to convert our commercial innovation hub to a Malaysian innovation hub. Then, hopefully before the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) is declared in December 2015, this hub will have become the ASEAN Innovation Hub, to be shared with ASEAN countries for the commercialization of research projects in the region.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Environmental degradation has emerged as one of the key challenges facing Lebanon's socio-economic development, costing the country $908.8 million each year. What initiatives aimed at improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of solid waste management is the Ministry of Environment currently undertaking?</h4><p>The Ministry of Environment is involved in two initiatives. The SWAM project, financed by the EU and managed by the Office of the Minister of State for Administrative Reform (OMSAR), consists of building and operating, sorting and composting plants and sanitary landfills in Lebanon. This project will lead to the closure of several open dumps and will stop open burning activities. The second initiative is the national strategy for solid waste management issued by the Ministry of Environment and approved by the Council of Ministers in January 2015, which is now in the bidding process and should be implemented starting end of July 2015.</p><h4>How does the Ministry of Environment promote recycling and re-usage of materials among the Lebanese population?</h4><p>The Ministry of Environment promotes recycling through supporting awareness campaigns by participating in workshops, conducting lectures, and approving plans and programs for NGOs and municipalities related to sorting at source.</p><div class="quote">“In 2009, the government of Lebanon committed to achieving 12% renewable energy in its energy mix by 2020."</div><h4>Over the past decade, forest fires have been increasingly frequent on Mount Lebanon, causing considerable environmental damage and influencing the economy of the affected areas. What steps are being taken to reduce their incidence?</h4><p>The Ministry of Environment, in collaboration with AFDC, a national NGO, and the concerned ministries, in 2009 developed “the National Strategy for Forest Fires Management In Lebanon," subsequently approved by the Council of Ministers. The strategy covers five axes, including research and analysis, forest fire prevention, forest fire eruption preparedness, combatting forest fires, and rehabilitation. The five axes are the responsibilities and prerogatives of numerous ministries and institutions. The readiness and combatting of forest fires falls mainly within the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (Civil Defense) and the Ministry of Agriculture (Forest guards). The Ministry of Environment is more directly involved in research and analysis and rehabilitation. Regarding these two actions, the Ministry prepares annual reports on wildfire occurrence and the extent of burned areas in Lebanon with the use of data provided on the fire ID cards completed by Internal Security Forces (ISF) and forwarded to the Ministry of Environment. These reports are produced through collaborative work between the Ministry of Environment and the Institute of the Environment, University of Balamand (IOE-UOB). Regarding rehabilitation, the Ministry of Environment has executed a national reforestation program aimed at the rehabilitation and restoration of degraded forest areas in all Lebanese regions. Since the problem of forest fires needs collaboration and coordination between many ministries and institutions, the Ministry of Environment, in collaboration with the FAO and AFDC and the concerned ministries, has developed a draft national law on forest fire management, and has submitted it to the Council of Ministers. The draft law proposes the establishment of a National Higher Council on Forest Fires Management that includes representatives from all concerned ministries and institutions. The draft law also sets measures to enhance the capacity of the Directorate General of Civil Defense, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Municipalities, and also set specific measures for forest fire prevention, data collection, research and analysis, risk mitigation, limitation of forest spread, rehabilitation, violations and sanctions, and awareness and capacity building.</p><h4>The proportion of forested land in Lebanon was 10% in 2014, a major reduction on 30% 40 years ago. What is the importance of afforestation and reforestation projects in the drive to create a green Lebanon?</h4><p>Due to the rapid growth of Lebanon's population; that coupled with the development of agriculture and urban construction, as well as improper forest management, the degradation of forest resources in Lebanon has been accelerating. As a result of this degradation, environmental problems including soil erosion and loss of biodiversity are being experienced, while natural hazards occur with increasing frequency. In 2001, the Lebanese government increased its focus on forest conservation and restoration of degraded forest ecosystems. A series of measures has been put in place through the National reforestation strategy applied by Ministry of Environment. Afforestation causes fundamental changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, including changes in shading, the microclimate, production, nutrient cycling, and the water balance, all of which may affect local and national biodiversity. On the other hand, afforestation and reforestation projects are among a suite of approaches possible to address the challenge of climate change and the inclusion of land use change, and forestry in international agreements are also seen as a means of encouraging climate friendly land use, particularly in developing states like Lebanon. Moreover, the Ministry of the Environment has noted the positive effects of afforestation programs on water yield within local ecosystem processes. Therefore, previously planted areas have addressed deforestation and water yield.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the transformation of the energy sector in Lebanon and what are your prospects for the future of clean technologies and renewable energy production in the drive for economic growth?</h4><p>In 2009, the government of Lebanon committed to achieving 12% renewable energy in its energy mix by 2020. Lebanon demonstrates a high-capacity potential, exceeding our electricity demand for years to come through the deployment of three renewable energy technologies: hydropower, wind power, and solar power. We would also like to implement another renewable energy target—specifically 20%—by 2030. We also know that renewable energy investments incur high costs for government. In Lebanon, however, it is expected that producing electricity from renewable energy sources will be less costly than from conventional thermal power plants. Moreover, we might look at de-risking these renewable energy investments to allow even further market penetration of clean technologies. Looking at conventional energy, the future prospect of natural gas extraction in Lebanon plays an important role in energy security and economic growth. Moreover, the removal of fossil fuel subsidies through a gradual phase-out will inevitably alter the national fiscal deficit; for example, if the phasing out had occurred in 2013, it would have reduced the fiscal deficit from 9.4% of GDP to 3.8%, which is substantial as these funds could have been invested in sustainable public transportation, healthcare and education, benefiting the lowest income categories, for example. If renewable energy sources are incorporated into Lebanon's energy mix within the scope of Lebanon's environmental pledge, and Lebanon becomes independent in terms of conventional sources of energy by extracting natural gas, and if a fossil fuel subsidy phase out is considered, the overall cost to the economy will be reduced. This would consequently boost growth in terms of employment, sustainability, and overall economic health as government funds are reshuffled and reprioritized. That is the essence of the low-emission economy we are aiming towards.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Port of Barbados has an agreement with MIT in Panama, and Barbados and Panama are  also in talks for air agreements. How would you evaluate economic relations between both nations and where do you see the potential for further growth?</h4><p>Panama and Barbados have enjoyed long relations. Between 1904 and 1914 alone it is estimated that about 60,000 Barbadians came to Panama, most of them destined for work on the Panama Canal, with many more having previously come to help the French with their Canal project in the 1880s. Since then, the relationship has been close. So-called “Panama money," as it is known in Barbados, contributed much to the development of the country's wealth in the form of the remittances of Barbadian guest workers. We are currently trying to deepen that relationship. In 2010, we signed a double taxation agreement to bolster Barbados' vibrant international business and finance sector, viewing Panama as an important partner in this. We are now trying to get our air services relationship solidified. I am meeting with the head of Copa Airlines in this context, as there are currently no flights into Barbados from Panama. They have direct flights to many of our neighboring countries; therefore, we hope to elicit some positive responses from them during this meeting and eventually establish improved connections so that Barbadians can easily travel to Panama. We also want the large diaspora that we have here in Panama to be able to travel more easily to Barbados, so that, for example, they can attend the Diaspora Conference that takes place every two years in Barbados. There is a call for still more deepening, and more specifically we hope to develop commercial activity between the two countries. As far as I am concerned, the future looks bright and we know what we have to do to strengthen the relationship. We are going to be doing that with all the vigor required.</p><h4>What are Barbados' priorities in the region?</h4><p>We have an economy that is driven by tourism, which is our primary sector, followed by international business and financial services. In both of these areas we think we can benefit from a closer relationship with Central and South America. As of now, most of our business in those two areas comes from the North Atlantic and then from other parts of the Caribbean. We have not been able to penetrate the Central and South American market as we had wished thus far. We are committed to ensuring that this state of affairs changes, and hope that legislation newly put in place to better accommodate people interested in investing financial services will work. On the whole, we hope that once we establish the air links, more Latin Americans will come to Barbados. Of course, traditionally there has been a language barrier; however, an airline from Brazil now flies to Barbados, and if we can get Copa into Barbados, it would provide access to South America. We want to leverage our competence in the English language and strong educational infrastructure to attract Latin Americans interested in honing their English language skills. Barbadians are also interested in improving their Spanish language skills, meaning this could be an ideal exchange. Therefore, this can be a win-win situation between the Caribbean and Latin America, and between Barbados and Latin America we are striving to bring this about.</p><div class="quote">“Between 1904 and 1914 alone it is estimated that about 60,000 Barbadians came to Panama."</div><h4>The VII Summit of the Americas took place in Panama this April. What would you say is its significance in the dialog between the Americas?</h4><p>This has been dominated by the fact that it is the first Summit in many years to involve the entire family of nations in this hemisphere, as Cuba has agreed to join us, too. It demonstrates the successful beginning of normalization between Cuba and the US. Barbados is very pleased about this of course, because we were one of the four nations in 1973 that took the bold step to decide that Cuba's regional isolation must come to an end. This is when we established diplomatic relations with Cuba along with Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Jamaica. We have continued to fight for Cuba's integration into the hemisphere as a legitimate member of the community, so one can imagine our contentment over the course of this Summit. We think that the interactions between the leader of Cuba and the US represent a great leap forward.</p><h4>Where do you see the future of relations between Barbados and Panama?</h4><p>I believe that the language barrier has separated us from one another. As such language barriers are broken down, all of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean will come together. We are all working toward that, and Barbados is not going to be left out. We are seeing a deepening of the cultural relationship between Barbados and Panama. Recently, I heard from Barbadians living here about how ingrained Barbadian habits and mores are in certain parts of Panama, including culinary habits. They are all present here, meaning there is hope for expanded cultural exchanges and for citizens of the two countries to get to know one another better. There is hope for a deepening of our economic relationship through tourism and international business and financial services. In addition, on a political level, we have a strong diplomatic relationship, and I believe that it is only a matter of time until Barbados establishes an Embassy in Panama and vice versa.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is Peru a strong market for BASF?</h4><p>We have been in Peru for 59 years and it is an economy with strong growth opportunities. We are involved in pigments, homecare, cosmetics, mining, water treatment, construction, automotive coatings, and agrochemicals. Yet our main business is agricultural and construction chemicals, which generates the bulk of our sales. We have two companies in Peru. One is BASF Peruana, which is a subsidiary of BASF Germany, while the other is BASF Construction Chemicals, which is a joint venture with local investors.</p><h4>This year has seen a slowdown for the Peruvian economy. How has this affected your business in Peru, particularly the fall in commodity prices?</h4><p>Mineral and commodity prices have been falling internationally, and internally, national elections and corruption issues have played a part in the slowdown. Yet we are highly optimistic about 2015. Sales are growing in our main businesses, and in 2016, especially in mining, but in the economy in general, there will likely be a rise in consumption. BASF expects to grow by about two percentage points above Peruvian GDP growth forecasts for next year, putting the figure at around 8%.</p><div class="quote">“Peru is a healthy and growing economy in South America, and we have a lot of opportunities here."</div><h4>Agribusiness is a new sector in Peru, and the government plans to diversify into niche products like avocado, cacao, and coffee. What products do you supply to the agricultural sector, and what do you expect to see in terms of growth there in 2015 and the coming years?</h4><p>We provide agrochemicals, including fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides, as well as biological products, but not fertilizers. Today, the agro-export business isn't more than 30% to 35% of the agrochemicals market, but is set to become the most important business within the next two or three years due to new irrigation plans in Arequipa, Lambayeque, and Jequetepeque. We work closely with traditional crops as well, as they account for a significant part of the economy and a large part of the work force. So the traditional sector is very important for us. We work to efficiently and effectively transmit innovations in the production of traditional crops, and we work closely with the government and agro-export companies to promote the traditional crops, which mainly are potato, quinoa, rice, and corn. What we can offer are the agrochemicals that can defend and protect these crops and keep yields high. For example, there's been a major blight in the coffee crop, and we are working with the Ministry of Agriculture to provide the fungicides to combat it.</p><h4>How does Peru figure in BASF's regional Latin American strategy?</h4><p>Peru is a healthy and growing economy in South America, and we have a lot of opportunities here. The social structure is changing in Peru. As the economy and society develop and as living standards rise, people spend more on detergents, for example, and we can provide the right chemicals to make detergents more efficient, clean, and green. There are in fact numerous opportunities in homecare. On the construction front, major infrastructure projects are ongoing for roads and transport, seaports and airports, logistics, energy, which also spell opportunities. In mining, Peru has the advantage of lower production costs, with a much lower break-even point. I think investments will resume next year, and once those projects are in full production within a few years, there will be much business there, too. So overall, Peru is an important market for us in the region.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2015 and what projects will you be undertaking next year?</h4><p>This year we want to concentrate on our distribution channels, focus on developing new generation talent, and to work more closely with growers. We'll probably grow by around 10% in agrochemical products next year. We will also be launching three or four innovative products this year in the Peruvian market, most being fungicides and herbicides. In homecare, we're introducing new technology, which is an innovative new way to reduce energy costs, and will also innovate in the cosmetics segment. As a company we lead by example, encouraging countries and companies to reduce pollutants and contaminants, and to reduce energy and water use as far as possible. Let me also add that this year we celebrate BASF's 150th anniversary worldwide with the new slogan, “We create chemistry." So these are exciting times for BASF, and 2015 will be an important year in Peru and the world over for us.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies has the Sharjah Airport Authority implemented to foster the exponential growth in passenger numbers and cargo tonnage over the past decade, and how would you describe future growth plans?</h4><p>Growth has several causes that are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. First, the attractiveness of Sharjah as a business and tourist destination, coupled with the economic growth of the UAE, is a key element that has contributed to the airport's growth. The Emirate is strategically located and is one of the safest destinations for business and leisure travellers alike. Secondly, efficient procedures and excellent services have boosted its attractiveness. Thirdly, new routes and the increased frequencies of existing carriers have been instrumental in driving growth. Air Arabia, in particular, has provided a key stimulus by offering low-cost travel, which has increased demand. As a result, Air Arabia has increased its operations and flights. Indeed, we expect the growth of passenger numbers and cargo volumes to continue over the coming years. Sharjah Airport Authority has also selected the engineering, construction, and projects management company Bechtel to design a new master plan for airport. The company will conduct short-term and long-term analyses of the airport's future needs. Further studies for large-scale expansion projects are currently ongoing and are expected to be announced shortly to maximize land use at the airport, and come up with new facilities for both passengers and cargo services. Running parallel to the exponential growth of Sharjah Airport we are meeting the demand of airport users by increasing existing capacity in various areas, including check-in counters and additional boarding gates, and by expanding human resources, and utilizing the latest innovative technologies and equipment to enhance the passenger experience. Furthermore, HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohamad Al Qassimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, launched the new, $136 million runway at Sharjah International Airport in October 2014, which has increased our capacity significantly.</p><h4>How would you describe the strategic advantages of Sharjah International Airport, versus other airports in the region?</h4><p>There are many competitive advantages at Sharjah International Airport. Some are related to its strategic geographic location, while others are the result of operational aspects, such as a direct approach for flights and short taxiing distances, which reflects in less fuel burn on the ground and less holding to land. Other advantages are more commercial, resulting from our competitive rates in various airport services. Sharjah Airport International Free Zone's proximity to the airport, Sharjah's two seaports, ongoing projects to develop the airport infrastructure, the free trade atmosphere with the open sky policy, in addition to easy and transparent cargo procedures also contribute positively toward Sharjah Airport's competitiveness. Having said that, I am an advocate of cooperation between the UAE's airports, rather than competition. We should be complementing other airports, as each boasts advantages that make it a more viable choice for a particular passenger. Our airport is more convenient for short-haul passengers because of our emphasis on faster processes. We are capitalizing on this, and try to not exceed the 20-minute gap between the check-in counter and aircraft boarding. The increasing number of passengers, however, is requiring Sharjah Airport to be more efficient, so working smarter, not harder and ensuring that the aircraft to curb time for our passengers is kept to the minimum and the envy of many airports internationally.</p><div class="quote">“Growth has several causes that are intertwined and mutually reinforcing."</div><h4>How do you assess the future of the aviation sector in the UAE, and what does this mean for your organization?</h4><p>Within five years, the UAE will undergo a huge development to cope the UAE's vision for 2021, and will host major events like Expo 2020, which need a lot of investments and planning. The aviation sector is one of these sectors that will expand to meet the high demand, and all national and foreign carriers especially have plans to expand. As one of the most important sectors in terms of contribution to GDP, we should be prepared for the increase of passengers and cargo. We expect growth to continue, as demand is high. Once development is completed, we should be looking to attract long-haul airlines to the airport, as this is an area where we see growing demand. I assume that one day we will start operating long-haul flights, but only when we are either ready to handle more flights in peak hours, or when long-haul airlines bbecome willing to operate in off-peak hours.</p><h4>What are your organization's expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>We expect to continue our normal annual growth as forecast. This will entail an increase compared to 2014, when our passenger numbers were boosted by 700,000 passengers that we temporarily took over from Dubai International Airport due to ongoing construction there. We may not retain all of those passengers this year, whilst some have recognized the attractiveness and convenience of a less-congested airport, yet one that boasts comprehensive facilities and modern amenities, and our own growth should see us reach the target 9.5 million.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Norway and Abu Dhabi are both in a transitional state, diversifying their economies away from dependence on oil revenues. What similarities exist between the two regions with regards to this shift?</h4><p>Norway and Abu Dhabi are both small countries, but large energy producers. Although the petroleum sector contributes significantly to the national economies, both countries also have a strong focus on renewable energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS). This is particularly evident when it comes to R&amp;D in renewable energy sources. Norway has, together with Iceland, the largest share of renewable energy production—and consumption—in Europe. Nearly all of the electricity in Norway comes from hydropower. Norway and the UAE, with Abu Dhabi in the forefront, are both committed to reducing CO2 in order to mitigate climate change. The two countries collaborate in the major global processes to achieve this goal. It is also important to mention that just as there is no set expiry date for the oil age, there is no definite date for the realization of a society completely built upon renewable energy. The world needs more energy, and in every scenario, oil and gas will remain a crucial part of the energy mix for decades to come. When it comes to the government revenues from the petroleum sector, the largest part of the government revenues are saved in the Government Pension Fund Global. This Fund has been established in order to secure a sustainable management of oil and gas wealth, which gains both present and future generations. This secures the Norwegian economy from being dependent on petroleum revenues.</p><h4>Statoil, Norway's state oil company, is one of the top international oil companies bidding in Abu Dhabi's main onshore oil concessions, as the historic 75-year operations agreement expired in January 2014. What is Statoil's main value-added as a partner in operating the UAE's biggest onshore oilfields?</h4><p>Statoil is the largest operator on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and has over 40 years of experience in developing cutting-edge technology in producing both oil and gas. I believe that Statoil can add value to particularly three areas that are of importance to Abu Dhabi; increased oil recovery, gas production, and CCS. Increased oil recovery is important because it both represents enormous value and also ensures that natural resources not are being wasted. Statoil is already a world leader in increased oil recovery with an average recovery rate of 50%. Thus, they can contribute with important technology and experience. When it comes to gas, Norway sees an increased demand and production of this less emission-intensive fossil fuel. Statoil plays an important part in this development and is now the second largest supplier of gas to Europe. Abu Dhabi has a shortage of this energy source and I believe Statoil's knowledge of developing sustainable gas value chains will be a useful contribution. Finally, when it comes to CCS, Norway and Statoil are front-runners internationally. For example, the world's most advanced test centre for carbon capture, the CO2 Technology Centre Mongstad, is located in Norway with Statoil as the largest private partner. Statoil started with carbon capture and storage from the Sleipner gas field in 1996. Since then they have added three more successful CCS projects, two on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and one in the desert of Algeria.</p><div class="quote">“In the European context, a low-hanging fruit for CO2-reduction is replacing coal with gas in power generation."</div><h4>Abu Dhabi plans to spend over $60 billion in the next decade to expand its oil and gas industry and is looking to increase its sustainable oil production capacity from 2.8 million to 3.5 million barrels per day by 2017. What opportunities do you see for further collaboration and between Norway and Abu Dhabi in light of these aims?</h4><p>As mentioned, the Norwegian petroleum industry has developed world-class technology and expertise. Increased oil recovery is one area that will be crucial in order for Abu Dhabi to reach its ambitious goals. Both Statoil and the world leading Norwegian supply industry can contribute with technology and expertise in this development. I would also like to mention that due to a strong CO2 taxation regime on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, the Norwegian industry has had a strong economical incentive to research and develop more environmentally friendly technology. This has led to operators and suppliers on the Norwegian Continental Shelf being world leading when it comes to producing oil and gas in a sustainable manner. I believe this fits with Abu Dhabi's role both as a large energy producer and ambitions to mitigate climate change.</p><h4>How do you view the role of Norway and Abu Dhabi in leading the transition toward clean energy technology and a more sustainable energy future for the decades to come?</h4><p>The contribution of small countries like Norway and Abu Dhabi is mainly in the areas of research and technology development, in addition to promoting international cooperation. Both countries are undertaking focused efforts into this contribution and it is particularly evident when it comes to renewable energy and CCS. In this context, I would like to mention Abu Dhabi's Masdar city as an ambitious initiative in the pursuit of developing sustainable cities. The fact that IRENA—the International Renewable Energy Agency—has its headquarters in Abu Dhabi is further proof of the ambitious renewable energy policies. Norway is the sixth largest hydropower producer in the world and the largest in Europe. Our hydropower development for more than 100 years has since long put us in a unique situation, and today approximately 65% of our total energy use is covered by renewable energy. Norway has even greater ambitions in this regard, and the Government Agency Enova is an important instrument in the government's efforts toward more the climate-friendly use and production of energy. Areas of priority for Enova are renewable heating, energy efficiency, energy recovery, and industrial conversion to the use of renewable energy. Another important area is development and demonstration activities of renewable energy technologies. Abu Dhabi and Norway have made a strong commitment to the development of cost-efficient technology for CCS. CCS is regarded as one of the main tools for combating climate change. The need for CCS is well documented, and I am pleased to note that the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is clear on its importance. Indeed, the IPCC emphasizes in its fifth assessment report that the costs of reaching the two-degree target will likely more than double without CCS-technology. Thus, contributing to the technological development and cost reduction of carbon capture and storage is a central climate mitigation technology where smaller countries like Abu Dhabi and Norway can make a global impact. The Norwegian government presented a new strategy for CCS in its budget proposal for 2015. The strategy for our work on CCS includes a wide range of activities, including research, development, and demonstration, as well as efforts to promote CCS internationally. CCS is the only way some industries will be able to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I am very glad that the world's first iron and steel project to apply CCS at large scale is under construction in Abu Dhabi, namely the Abu Dhabi CCS Project. In the European context, a low-hanging fruit for CO2-reduction is replacing coal with gas in power generation. Here Norway, and Statoil, plays an important part in providing gas to the European market.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the Zambian market for Samsung's overall strategy in Africa and worldwide?</h4><p>Samsung began its operations in Zambia in October 2010. Due to our positive performance, Zambia became a regional hub effective as of April 2014. As a branch, we oversee operations in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Malawi. This alone indicates the significance of the Zambian market for the company. Samsung is increasingly looking to empower regional offices with support provided from the African Regional Head Quarters based in South Africa.</p><h4>After five years in Zambia, how would you describe the evolution of its ICT market?</h4><p>It is showing positive growth, driven mainly by the two key factors of government commitment to the growth of ICTs as well as consumer driven demand growth.</p><div class="quote">“If the Zambian market continues to grow as it has been, we expect to enter the second quarter on positive growth across all sectors."</div><h4>What key priorities has Samsung established for Zambia for the next three to four years?</h4><p>Our priority is to address consumer needs and wants and to ensure that our consumers have access to the products available on the market. The recent launch of the Galaxy S6 demonstrates the importance of the Zambian market globally; we were one of the first in the world to launch Galaxy S6. Our second priority is to be a partner in the development of the country at large. We want to be relevant to the country's economic growth by contributing to national development, employment, expansion of our retail networks, and adding to the tax base of the country. We have a very strong corporate citizenship program and are already working with governments in the four countries we oversee mainly in the area of education and youth empowerment.</p><h4>In terms of technology adoption, how would you characterize the Zambian market and its ability to adopt new technologies?</h4><p>In Zambia we have three highly competitive mobile operators with consumers purchasing three or four phones to try out every offer available. At Samsung we find out how our products operate over various networks so we can identify with user experience. We are moving at a rapid pace, and adopting services as quickly as other operators worldwide. Zambians are particularly open to new technologies and keeping up with latest trends. It is apparent that Zambians are trying to stay up-to-date by acquiring the latest technologies, from mobile phones to cars and TVs. The mobile network and smartphone capabilities are reaching almost every corner of the country, and at least one mobile operator has launched 4G services. We are happy to observe that even in the remotest corners of Zambia, one can find at least a 3G signal.</p><h4>How is Samsung increasing access to technology and information in remote and rural areas of the country?</h4><p>The key to increasing access to information is making technological products affordable; the infrastructure for accessibility is already in place. We are finding partners in the government and stakeholders to take developments to rural areas and to ensure that our devices are affordable. Samsung is working to make devices with relevant content and high accessibility so naturally the next stage will be to deal with the interface. Most users wanting access to a mobile phone need some level of literacy, so we are making sure that the interface is equally accessible to people with higher or lower literacy levels. The interface should also deal with hearing and vision impairment. The challenge for developers and content managers is to produce content that is relevant to our customers, at a grassroots level and in the local language.</p><h4>What are some of the trends likely to happen in 2016 in mobile technologies?</h4><p>The key driver of mobile trends is usage. Everything around mobile technologies is centered on how we use data. Broadband internet on the phone is the biggest driver of trends, and social networking has become the most popular way to communicate on mobile phones. Voice, and even video calls, are coming in through social networking. For mobile communication operators the biggest revenue driver is voice calls and the challenge now is competing with applications, such as Whatsapp, that allow you to make voice calls. Along with SMS, we are seeing a reduction in people making traditional voice calls, and mobile operators will now have to think of ways to generate more revenue on data usage.</p><h4>What are Samsung's development plans for the near future in Zambia?</h4><h4>At the moment it is important for us to maintain our focus on retail expansion. We currently have four brand stores and want to make sure that wherever one is in the country, Samsung is easy to find. We now have a nationwide presence as our partners are investing in retail.</h4><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We simply expect to see more growth in terms of our market development. While the start of the year was challenging for Zambian business, if the Zambian market continues to grow as it has been, we expect to enter the second quarter on positive growth across all sectors. And with the growth of the sectors themselves, we will see growth in provisional services, such as sales.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In April, Xerox showcased systems and business solutions to create efficient business management. What new services and products is the company presenting to the market?</h4><p>At the beginning of the year we launched a system for our service providers to manage their machines and provide technical customer service online. For our channel partners, at the end of last year we launched what we call the Xerox Partner Print Service. We are expanding that through our channels so they can provide the same level of service that we provide directly, meaning that instead of the customer having the Xerox channel, they will use Xerox infrastructure to provide the service. Through this system, when the customer has a problem, they call a 1800 number, which puts them through to a Xerox Center, whereupon we provide customer support. With that, we guarantee that the service level is the same as if they had hired Xerox directly. There are two things happening in 2Q2015; one concerns how we can help to change the culture toward printing less through introducing the print awareness game, which has an icon of a flower that loses petals whenever you print. The idea is that you cannot allow the flower to die, and you can compete with people who have the same profile as you. We are also focused on enabling printing wirelessly from mobile devices and tablets. Our other main project is called digital alternatives. One of the big issues for customers is incompatibility when sharing documents between PCs and Macs or other devices. With digital alternatives, people are able to share a document in Word and make comments regardless of whether they are viewing it on a PC, tablet, or an iPad. We are also educating customers on content management. Many people believe that once they purchase software they have a solution, but I believe that you have to have a strategy as well. So in June we are bringing in experts from abroad to educate consumers on content management strategies and how to use that strategy to achieve corporate goals.</p><h4>Ecuadorian companies now have to adapt their processes to the new electronic invoicing system, which has opened a new market of consulting and system provision in the country. What opportunities does Xerox see in this market?</h4><p>We already use electronic invoicing, so of course we are aligned to that. Yet while many customers are shifting toward this practice, providers are not taking advantage of using this electronic invoice for broader communication with the customer. This is a powerful tool that beyond simply delivering data enables such activities as cross selling. Regarding communication, the level of internet usage in Ecuador is at around 56%, which presents the potential for the communication of all branding and so forth online, where our customers can be supported in the delivery of personalized communication through all channels, enabling 100% effective communication with the target audience.</p><h4>What is your medium-term outlook for Xerox within the industry?</h4><p>Xerox has transformed itself over the past few years, and if you look at the results of the first quarter, 56% of revenues derive from services and 44% from technology. On the service-side we have Xerox healthcare systems, Xerox transportation, and Xerox government, which confirms our evolution into diverse areas of the market.</p><div class="quote">“The transition from a technology into a service company cannot happen overnight."</div><h4>What are the main challenges that Xerox Ecuador stands to face?</h4><p>The transition from a technology into a service company cannot happen overnight. We need to put in place the entire infrastructure. We know that each country has its owns laws with regard to sending images and information abroad and that means that the infrastructure needs to be aligned with the legal requirements of the country—implementing this will be the challenge. We have wonderful healthcare systems in the West that have yet to be seen in Ecuador. And as for the changes required in order to reverse that situation, I believe that this is the greatest question that Xerox Ecuador must address.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pushing-ahead]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Formerly a division of Kodak, Carestream became independent in 2007. What has been its contribution to the healthcare sector in Mexico since then?</h4><p>Carestream was founded almost eight years ago, with the vision of leveraging innovation to provide better patient healthcare. That is ultimately the goal of our company, even though we have 100 years of experience, history, and legacy from Kodak. Our recent years have been devoted to innovation through both healthcare and how we do business. In a highly customer-centric company supported by programs, we work toward innovating our processes, products, and solutions.</p><h4>You were appointed Director of Latin America in 2010. How have your operations evolved since then?</h4><p>Over the past four years, as director, I have gone back to the basics. Latin America is often times perceived by global corporations as a homogeneous country, or a package deal. Based on previous experience, I have tried to establish a closer relationship with our customers and our different markets. Instead of operating four clusters in the region, we decided to operate seven in key countries. We decided on the seven countries based on the cost benefit perspective, because you cannot operate in every market. Therefore, today we operate in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Puerto Rico. This was a change because, in previous years, we had found ourselves at a remove from some of our customers in various countries with a smaller population, while leading in markets like Peru. Now, instead of operating in a cluster with Argentina, we have an individual presence there, which expedites decision-making. The most important consideration was to get closer to our customers and best meet their needs.</p><div class="quote">“The public sector has the most potential because our company is geared toward providing better healthcare to populations."</div><h4>What are some of the specifications and advantages of Carestream's innovations such as the DRX Revolution and Cardio PACS?</h4><p>Mobile x-ray, and other types of x-rays, have been on the market for many years, but lacked the functionality that users needed. Carestream reinvented the mobile x-ray such that it delivered all the features of a fixed version, but in mobile form. The analog portable x-ray machines are particularly simple, and there was a need for more advanced x-ray imaging. Today with digitalization you can upload and ensure that images are not mixed-up. There are many routine x-ray images that are rotated through rooms, but every time a picture is taken the film had to be taken into the x-ray area. Our product has reinvented the identification of x-rays, enhancing convenience, and image quality. We eliminate confusion by using barcodes specific to the image being taken.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in healthcare solutions in Mexico, and what are the particularities of the Mexican market?</h4><p>We use an imaging and software system that helps our customers manage their images. We have another product used as a radiology information solution. Our particularity as a company is that we first listen to the customer's needs and never provide a solution without consulting the customer first. Our systems are tailor made because there are many alternatives both in terms of technology and workload. When a customer adapts this solution they have a chance to reduce their workload. By digitizing just one part of the procedure, efficiency is greatly increased. We become partners with our customers and cooperatively introduce significant changes to their processes and changes. Workflow is something we work a lot on with our customers. Mexico is rather far ahead of the competition in Latin America, although Chile has also been pushing ahead of its regional counterparts. Mexico does not have the market risk that some other countries might have, and the majority of solutions are tailor made in-house. The advantage of our company is that our products can be tailor made for each solution.</p><h4>Carestream has clients from both the private and public sectors in Mexico. Which segments have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>In the majority of countries, the public sector has the most potential because our company is geared toward providing better healthcare to populations. Over recent years countries have been working to increase healthcare coverage and access to healthcare. Based on that the public sector seems to have the highest income potential. There are many alternatives that are joint alternatives to private funding for public institutions. There has to be a balance between both sectors, and we look for opportunities that will allow for that. Given the solutions we offer, and the opportunities that are presented to us, our growth stands to continue. We have many solutions, and especially DRX, which is used for making and converting an analog room into a digital one. We anticipate double-digit growth as a result of this, and in order to provide those solutions to customers we have to eliminate film. We are here to help our customers transition to a filmless solution, even if they have doubts about its possibility. Last year we grew by helping our customers transition through correct timing. Our government is increasing coverage with x-rays, which spells greater opportunity for us as more people are being treated. The number of x-rays being used has increasing because more of the population has access to treatment.</p><h4>What level of growth have you seen over the past year?</h4><p>We have experienced growth in the film, equipment, and software business, our three medical lines. We offer the same solutions for dental that we have for medical. Carestream serves a key market for the dental industry. We provide film and equipment solutions, and will be introducing new technology such as 3D facial reconstruction. The dental industry here does not utilize our software system as much because it tends to be smaller and more local, and does not require the level of technology that we can provide. Carestream is also involved in construction, as well as oil and gas through its non-destructive testing business. In some construction, there is the need to validate the strength of a special component that can only be evaluated through an x-ray intake. They will print the film and make sure that there is no crack or fracture. We make the film here, but it is a slow business that is evolving.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Fransabank ranks first in Lebanon in terms of its branch network. What strategies have allowed you to gain the leading position in such an intensely competitive market?</h4><p>Fransabank Group's expansion strategy is focused on consolidating and streamlining activities and subsequently growing its local and overseas entities. On the local level the bank is developing and increasing its organic growth by expanding its business activities and increasing its presence across the Lebanese territories. The bank's expansion strategy also includes pursuing and achieving selective acquisitions. In this context, the bank has already achieved many acquisitions, including Banque Tohmé, Universal Bank, United Bank of Saudi and Lebanon, Banque de la Békaa, BLC Bank, and Lati Bank. The latest was our seventh acquisition, Ahli International Bank, with nine new branches. Currently, Fransabank Group ranks first in terms of local branch network with 124 branches strategically spread nationwide to further enrich its role in the Lebanese economy.</p><h4>Fransabank has a strong presence not only in Lebanon, but also in other counties. How do you assess overseas markets' performance?</h4><p>Our international expansion strategy is to expand to selective, regional, or international markets, which are growing and with high promising potential. This strategy has resulted in Fransabank's presence in 10 countries in addition to Lebanon: France, Algeria, Syria, Sudan, Belarus, Cyprus, Cuba, the UAE (Abu Dhabi), and Iraq, and considering the regional and international establishment of Fransabank's presence in Africa. The bank is satisfied with a contribution of expansion to the bottom line, despite the impact of the unprecedented geopolitical events in some of the Arab countries. We expect the significance of this contribution to further grow in the medium term.</p><div class="quote">“Fransabank Group's expansion strategy is focused on consolidating and streamlining activities."</div><h4>Fransabank recently launched the China Desk. What is the significance of this step?</h4><p>Fransabank Group, having noted well China's expansion, extensive investments, and first-ranking trade ties to most of the markets where Fransabank is present, and building on our historic ties to China spanning over 60 years, we have pioneered a China Desk at Fransabank, employing Chinese citizens. The China Desk serves our local clients dealing with China and the Chinese entities, companies, and banks dealing in our markets of operation.</p><h4>How has Fransabank's product portfolio evolved over the past years, and what are your future targets?</h4><p>Fransabank's portfolio provides a broad range and a vast, targeted, well-diversified basket of retail, commercial, corporate, investment, and international banking services to local, regional, and international clients. The Bank offers a wide variety of retail products as personal loans, car loans, housing loans, eco-friendly loans, eco-home loans, along with a broad range of plastic cards, bancassurance products, as well as e-services like mobile payment (SIMBA), a call center, internet banking (i-bank), and an SMS service. In terms of corporate and international banking services, Fransabank provides international trade finance services (L/Cs and L/Gs) through its extensive network of worldwide prime correspondents, benefiting from large credit lines to cater for its clients' needs. Fransabank also benefits from long-term credit lines from financial institutions such as the IFC 10-year $40 million Sustainable Energy Finance Credit Line, and the EIB12-year ‚¬45 million Credit Line; these allow us to support Lebanese SMEs and corporates operating in the productive sectors of the economy. Fransabank also offers, to its overseas clientele, a large variety of services, and its subsidiaries abroad are in France, Algeria, Iraq, Cyprus, to name a few. Fransabank launched the first China Union Pay card in Lebanon, which is the only card accepted by 2 million merchants in China, and also in over 150 countries worldwide in partnership with over 300 international institutions.</p><h4>What role does technology play at Fransabank and what innovative solutions have recently been implemented?</h4><p>At Fransabank, technology plays a central and key role that enables and drives business in order to meet its customers' needs and expectations. In this context, Fransabank is among the earliest implementers in Lebanon of complete internet banking solutions and evolving mobile payment solutions. Fransabank is still one of the market leaders in the plastic cards industry and has recently launched an advanced back office platform that will enable Fransabank to better develop its services and increase its security and availability. We are in full compliance with Central Bank regulations and international related laws and best practices. To this end, we have invested in technology and implemented solutions for FATCA and AML from the international market leaders. Fransabank has already taken major strides in migrating its entire operating technology to a new system and is continuously evolving its IT infrastructure and banking technology solutions to further enhance and secure its business services and processes according to pertinent international norms and standards.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for Lebanon's banking sector, as well as your assessment of Beirut's potential to regain the role of a major banking center in the region?</h4><p>Despite the geo-political circumstances in the region, the Lebanese banking sector has succeeded in building its multi-dimensional strengths, financials, IT infrastructure, operating banking expertise, high liquidity, strong solvency, trust of its clients and business partners, rigorous risk management, and corporate governance practices. All of this would make the sector ready to support Beirut's overall credentials, and to fully restore its glitter to recapture a leading financial and business role in the region and the world.</p><h4>What are Fransabank's expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The results of the first two months of 2015 have encouraged the international financial institutions to forecast the growth of Lebanon at 2.5% in 2015. We also believe that with the initiatives of HE Dr. Riad Salameh, Lebanon might achieve an expected real growth rate of between 2% and 2.5%, based on respective World Bank and IMF estimates. In addition to that, should current dialogue between the various political parties lead to the election of a new president for Lebanon, we would be able to achieve higher single-digit percentages, which are highly likely to reflect positively on its public finances, economic activities, and social and living situations.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the company you founded in Medellí­n in the 1990s go on to join forces with Manpower?</h4><p>We started the company as a partnership of the founders named UNOA. Our goal was to become the best temporary services company in the world. The most important condition for us was that employees and clients felt it was the best possible environment in which to be. As the Colombian market shifted toward globalization, we felt a need to open our company to a new business model. After a business trip to Brazil, I was approached by Manpower managers from different countries who liked our company model. They proposed the purchase of the company entirely and I sold my stake as partner, but remained as General Manager of Manpower Colombia.</p><h4>What added value does your company provide to the temporary services industry in the Colombian market?</h4><p>We are set to conduct a study, because it is a difficult variable to assess. When we evaluate the competencies of an individual to determine if they fit the required profile, we guarantee better results, and higher levels of productivity, efficiency, and stability if we select the adequate candidate. The individual's vocation will determine the success they accomplish.</p><div class="quote">“In general terms, the greatest demand is for companies that provide services."</div><h4>Taking into consideration the amount of multinational companies that have entered the market in Colombia, how are you covering their employment needs and what are their main requirements?</h4><p>In general terms, the greatest demand is for companies that provide services. Technicians, engineers, finance professionals, and commercial and sales staff see the highest demand in the current market. Regarding specific competences, bilingualism is highly valued, as Colombian economic endeavors in general have entered global markets. There is a global necessity for skilled human capital, and it is becoming more evident as time passes and people are choosing to have children later in life. It will be a challenge to maintain a functional workforce. There is a shortage of skilled labor, Japan being the number one country facing this difficulty, while Colombia occupies ninth place in this ranking.</p><h4>How is Manpower partnering with educational institutions to reduce the scarcity of skilled human capital?</h4><p>We have conducted research on this matter in Colombia and have divulged the results to companies, allowing them to better grasp the importance of diversity to partly solve this issue and participate in inter institutional networks devoted to it. Nonetheless, a long-term program needs to be established by the government to create groups composed of government, companies, and educational institutions, to create comprehensive solutions that confront this shortage of human capital, and define what profiles Colombia requires according to the national development plan. This prospective evaluation has to be defined to guide the coming generations when they decide their career paths at an early age. Unfortunately, educational institutions create programs according to their demand in terms of revenue, and not in terms of the requirements of the job market of the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>TBY talks to Ricardo Quiroga, General Manager of Correos del Ecuador E.P., on the turnaround of the firm, Ecuador’s transport infrastructure, and the outlook for the logistics sector.</p>
<h4>How has Correos del Ecuador developed over the decades?</h4>
<p>Correos del Ecuador had virtually ceased to exist by the end of 2006; we had no turnover and its services were poor. At that time, the company was set to be sold for $16,000. However, we reversed the entire situation, going on to generate income of $42 million in 2013. At the beginning of 2007 Licentiate Roberto Cavanna took over and has been the main driver of our success since then. He managed to earn the trust of all Ecuadorians through a highly secure postal system and nationwide service, which has become one of the best postal services in the entire region. We also have, for example, a CCTV network at all branches and a control center equipped with the latest technology, as well as three software programs to track parcels and packages. We are the most secure Ecuadorian logistics company, and are able to detect narcotics parcels. Last year, Correos del Ecuador faced a tough challenge due to the fact that postal services are in decline by 25% globally—we saw an 8% turnover decrease worldwide in 2014; that influenced us to shift our global strategy, which had essentially been based on public service bills and e-services—electronic messaging and e-commerce. Today, we have a strong focus on packaging and logistics.</p>
<h4>What have been the company’s main projects and objectives over the past two years?</h4>
<p>I took over in October 2014, since when my main objective has been to implement initiatives to decelerate the global decay of postal services and recover from that 25% decrease in turnover. However, this is a challenge. For example, we started providing new logistics services to our customers. We currently perform the distribution of all books and school uniforms for Ecuadorian public schools, which consists of almost 16,000 schools, amounting to 32,000 tons of books. For this service we have two logistics centers in Quito and Guayaquil, which together exceed an area of 10,000sqm. We have plans to open a new warehouse in Manabí­. Another of our upcoming projects concerns the distribution of induction cookers, with some half a million units in the initial stage. Among our main competitive advantages are logistics capacity, human resources, and synchronization, which put us at an advantage compared to others participating in tenders. Over the past few months, we have also boosted investment in new technologies thanks to new logistics services. These new technologies have enabled us to optimize our logistics network and capabilities across the country, since we develop in-house software and management capabilities. We have also invested in our fleet. In 2015, we expect to generate more income from the logistics segment ($40 million) than in postal services ($26 million).</p><div class="quote">“My main objective has been to implement initiatives to decelerate the global decay of postal services.“</div>
<h4>How would you assess Ecuador’s transport infrastructure today?</h4>
<p>It has its pluses and minuses. For example, we have an excellent road infrastructure, although we still cannot reach the entire country. The road system currently reaches 85% of Ecuador’s population. There are problems inherent in the logistics market, and a rather small transport offering. For example, it is difficult for me to find trucks to provide full service to our clients. I believe that this tendency is now changing, but most logistics companies are obliged to have their own fleet, with all the costs this implies. I also hope that the number of warehouses and their availability increases in the near future.</p>
<h4>What is the balance between public and private companies in your customers’ portfolio?</h4>
<p>We currently have more than 80% of our capabilities booked within the public sector; however, we are set to implement an aggressive strategy to target the private sector starting from 2016. I think we have much to contribute to in this segment, and as long as we devise a comprehensive offering, no other company will be able to meet our offer and services. We also have international expansion plans in the near future.</p>
<h4>What is your outlook for the logistics sector for the coming years?</h4>
<p>It is extremely hard to make a forecast of how business will develop in two or three years’ time. We rather lag behind neighboring countries. At the same time, we face many interesting opportunities ahead of us. For example, one of my main immediate intentions is to start airfreight services to the Galápagos. Nevertheless, another problem facing the logistics sector is limited storage capability and air and road transport offering. I also want to launch maritime transport between the islands. These developments are driven by the productive sector’s national growth, which has expanded notably over the past couple of years and is set to take a massive step forward shortly; the logistics industry is set to increase its capabilities to meet the demands of Ecuadorian industry, the needs of the public, and private efforts to diversify the production matrix. I also think that within five years we will see a notable rise in outsourcing services in the logistics industry.</p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the challenges in creating Hong Leong Islamic Bank?</h4><p>For any Islamic bank that is a subsidiary, the major challenge is managing a business that is fundamentally different to what you have been trained for. If you look at most banks that have a conventional parent, a number of the services, such as risk management and credit approvals, are centralized. From that perspective, risk and credit have always been skewed toward a conventional way of thinking, which requires a real paradigm shift in getting people to adopt a different point of view and believe that it will work. We managed to cross that in many ways when the question was asked about who would buy these Islamic banking products when conventional services were already being provided. We took the view 30 years ago, as a country, that we were going to introduce Islamic banking through windows, unlike in Qatar where Islamic banks are stand-alone in nature. As we grew stronger the government required us to corporatize and become a formal entity. Now, we have our own capital, and have to consider our own individual return on equity. We spent the first five years discovering the lay of the land, and managed to convince Hong Leong that Islamic finance was not exclusively the preserve of Muslims. In my opinion, most Muslims in Malaysia do not necessarily subscribe to Islamic finance because of faith; hence, we had to convince them that our services were compatible and competitive with conventional banking. We had to strive toward delivering a fundamentally different, yet still price competitive and comparable product. Along the way, the government had helped us to facilitate our business. It introduced tax laws and incentives to neutralize the system and kick-start business. We are one of the few Chinese Malaysian-owned Islamic finance banks where 50% of customers are non-Muslims; this clearly illustrates that the service is meant for everyone.</p><h4>In 2014, you won an award for Best Sukuk Deal 2014. What was innovative about its structure?</h4><p>We won a prestigious award in Washington for a sukuk, which was a cross-border transaction. We wanted to encourage foreigners to come and tap into Malaysia. Often, the structures are non-asset related. What we implemented was an ijarah structure, which is a leasing structure of an asset in Saudi Arabia. It was a complex document because we made the offer here in ringgit, and then would exchange it back into the riyal. People have done that before; the ringgit sukuk is, of course, sharia compliant, but the cross-currency swap, or the derivatives thereafter, is always conventional. What was different and innovative about what we did was that everything, from the primary issuance to the cross-currency swap from the ringgit to the dollar and then the reverse, was 100% sharia compliant covering several jurisdictions. Therefore, the innovation came from cross-border documentation or securitization of an asset somewhere else, into an offering into another capital market, and into a cross-currency swap, which was also Islamic.</p><div class="quote">“We won a prestigious award in Washington for a sukuk, which was a cross-border transaction."</div><h4>Is internationalization something that Malaysia can focus on?</h4><p>For Islamic finance to work anywhere else, the laws of those countries must change to enable Islamic banking. This alone is not enough, as you can see from the UK example; you also need central bank intervention on liquidity management. In Malaysia, we have a mechanism called the Islamic Interbank Money Market (IIMM), which does not exist anywhere else. IIMMs have to exist in order for Islamic banking to function properly, which is why we have been able to flourish in Malaysia. Indeed, the one distinguishing and defining moment for the market in Malaysia was the setting up of the IIMM.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The coming year will not be so easy; the country is going through an economic slowdown. We have new taxes, such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Inflation is up, meaning people do not spend as much and deposit rates are high; therefore, people will hold onto their money. These are factors that generally make for a quieter year. Because of that, the entire market is under margin pressure, while the money supply shrinks. In addition, Basel III is also being introduced this year, making for a busy period. The coming year, overall then, will be a challenge for us. Several new sharia-compliant items, such as the IFSA, have required us to change our business model. The ringgit is also weakening, which is another factor pointing to a difficult year. It is important now not to lose money, but to remain prudent as longevity is the key. We have been through crisis before, and we still anticipate further opportunities.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Energia has finalized plans to build a 30,000 bpd refinery with a group of partners. Can you tell us how the project has progressed, and at what stage you are today?</h4><p>We have reviewed our strategies and are now working towards a 5,000 bpd modular plan scalable to 30,000 bpd in the future. Our first move was to acquire 20 ha of land, and we are already working with the government to carry out the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), as well as closing our discussions on financing and partnerships. We have completed a conceptual design and are set to discuss the details of the plant with the constructors. We have designed the project to incorporate offices and support buildings, and most importantly the entire plant is modular and designed to grow as revenues enable additional capacity. Once we begin generation, investor interest will rise. Currently, we are single handedly financing the project in Nigeria. Eventually we expect the private sector in conjunction with its public counterpart to process most of our crude for domestic requirements. That spares us foreign exchange issues arising from importing. Investors will recognize that Nigeria is actually moving quickly to break ground for new refineries. Barring the unforeseen, this time next year we should be talking about foundations in the fields. In addition to ensuring consistent production, which has been plagued through frequent pipeline vandalism, the refinery plant will also be recovering more of our production. There are many losses along the way that are unaccounted for, and we still pay tariffs on the losses. A refinery allows us to significantly cut losses. With the new government, we foresee many new opportunities and a concomitant increase in investor interest.</p><h4>You signed a 12" pipeline joint venture agreement that you hoped would increase the amount of exported crude and curb theft. How is that progressing?</h4><p>We have since completed the project with our partner and it has since been in operation since November 2014. This has no doubt helped in the total volume injection, but it is not a solution to vandalism, being exposed to the same environment. There have already been attempts made on the new line. We are hoping the new government can address this over the coming years. If we share our crude through the refinery, we will reduce our losses.</p><div class="quote">“By this time next year, we will be open to considerable divestment."</div><h4>In the larger spectrum of indigenous companies operating in Nigeria, what developments have there been over the past year, and what is the true impact of your efforts?</h4><p>Since the marginal field auctions took place in 2003, room has opened up for Nigerians to participate. Previously, we had all been staff or managers at the IOCs, apart from one or two independents. It was the domain of Shell, Chevron, and the like, while today many more Nigerians have become involved. Then the divestments came in on top of the marginal fields, and together those factors have increased the production volume of the Nigerian independents. Shell has almost given up its onshore assets and I believe it wants to focus on gas and the larger deep, offshore prospective asset. For Energia, we have been able to create a strong presence. We are emotionally, mentally, and technically ready to play on the next level.</p><h4>How has the goal of 15,000 bpd set last year progressed, and how has the decline in oil prices affected your targets and the price of assets?</h4><p>The game has changed considerably, and we have ceased drilling as the margin between the costs of operation and the crude price became too wide. The industry is not yet properly indexed, so when the price of crude drops, it is not immediately reflected in the service cost. Contracts change over time. We chose to meet with our partners and to maintain production at 9,000 bpd. Hopefully, drilling will start later this year. Someone has to close the spigots at OPEC because members are already suffering. Pressure on Saudi Arabia is growing. Energia has stopped drilling, although it is more accurate to say that we have stopped exploring, because we drill to maintain production. We now have to drill better, cheaper, faster, and more efficiently such that our costs reflect prevailing low prices. In an environment of low prices one has to focus on efficiency. The industry doesn't slow down when prices are low. At $50 per barrel, we still drill. Energia is on the progressive side, and we cannot wait endlessly for crude prices to reach $100 per barrel before we resume drilling; we shall pick up the rig once we see a fairly stable price, even at $50 per barrel.</p><h4>The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) is awaiting government approval. What are your projections for political change?</h4><p>Time is limited, and the Goodluck administration wanted to sign the PIB before it left, but the transition is already happening. There are changes taking place at the Ministry of Petroleum and also in the Senate, and there are also numerous distractions at the governmental and senate level.</p><h4>What are your general expectations for the energy sector next year?</h4><p>In Nigeria, we will be busy. By this time next year, we will be open to considerable divestment. The marginal field round, which was suspended, will be back on the table. There will probably be a new minister with new ideas, who might want to restructure the industry. If they sign the PIB before they leave there will be a lot of restructuring. We will be busy in aggressively participating to be part of the block put on sale to Chevron and Shell because we are ready to move to the next level. We will be busy with the foundation work of our refinery, drilling and increasing production with our current assets. There will be a lot of restructuring in the country. The election has given us a good rating internationally, and today Nigeria is a democratic society and a credible country. Energia is ready to take advantage of the opportunities set to materialize over the coming year.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the first licensed insurance company, how would you characterize Tawuniya's role in developing the sector?</h4><p>Tawuniya has played a tremendous role working in line with the regulators, as well as developing Saudi nationals into a professional caliber in the field. Being the first licensed company, coming even before the establishment of the Royal decree, we worked closely with the regulators, such as the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), to help support it and develop regulations for the insurance industry. We are establishing ourselves as a leader in all directions. Therefore, in terms of being a service provider, and in terms of being the best provider of all classes, we are promoting on the insurance side, and also championing our staff and the industry as a whole, encouraging the broader develop of high standards and high-caliber talent in the insurance business.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the current regulatory framework?</h4><p>Considering the time spent by the regulators to date, I consider it a true success story, and we are seeing continuous improvements in the regulatory framework within the country, which we are proud to be part of. However, in any new industry, we face many challenges, and it will take some time for the regulations to take hold. There are many compliance issues from most insurance companies, because it is a new issue for all players. Being a leader, you also want to lead in terms of compliance, which means developing yourself early on to be best prepared to meet any future requirements.</p><h4>How do you see the challenge of poor awareness or perception of insurance being addressed over time?</h4><p>I believe that awareness is growing at a rapid rate at the moment, and we have started to see people increase their insurance policies, be they compulsory or otherwise. People have become more aware of the advantages of insurance, having originally viewed it as a burden, rather than a benefit.</p><h4>Tawuniya has a special role in developing local Saudi professionals in the insurance sector. How would you characterize the current level of local human capital in this sector and the steps you are taking as a company to raise this level?</h4><p>We invest considerably in our people, because we are strong believer in human capital being the backbone of the company, and, therefore, we are busy providing the best quality on-the-job training for staff. One of our national obligations is to employ more locals in the industry, and we currently have more than a 77% Saudiization among our staff. The difficulty for all companies lies in the lack of experts in Saudi insurance, where thus far the only way to overcome it is to employ expatriates and have them train locals and encourage people to take on additional training as they go, in order to reach the requisite skill level. This is not easy, and will require a couple of years to achieve; however, we are proud to say that most of our current management team are Saudis, which is a pioneering development in our sector, being a national company. Moreover, we also have many projects in terms of career paths, succession plans, and training programs for staff in order to reach the required high level of expertise.</p><h4>With 35 companies in a young but competitive insurance sector, what is your outlook regarding mergers and acquisitions?</h4><p>There should be added value for any mergers and acquisitions, especially if this option is the only way to continue operating in the insurance sector. But we have not seen that at all yet, because I think the enablers are not yet present. And so if you ask, for example, companies to acquire other enterprises, it is not clear whether this would add value, or become a burden. I think it is also complicated when it comes to mergers, for example, in terms of how to value companies, how to merge, and who to merge with. Consolidation is not a preference at this time for insurance companies because they tend to assume that they can do better alone by increasing their capital. But going forward I expect the picture to change; either it will become a better market for everyone or else regulation could in part provide the solution. In addition, encouraging business plans for failing companies is a milestone, and perhaps with time the environment will change. The other problem is that without mergers and acquisitions in the market, we observe the continuance angle, and I consider the sector too saturated for the currently available volume of business in the Saudi market.</p><div class="quote">“I believe that awareness is growing at a rapid rate at the moment.</div><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-real-mexican-venture]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Navistar has been present in Mexico for over 80 years. What factors have led to it success?</h4><p>For over 80 years, the brand has been present in Mexico, selling technology to companies operating directly in Mexico. In 1996, we returned to the country and established ourselves again, ultimately opening an assembly plant in 1998 in Escobedo, Nuevo León. More than 40% of the total vehicle parts in Mexico use our technology. The factors leading to our success stem mainly from the investments of more than $400 million we have made in Mexico over the past 18 years. Our most important investment has been in local talent. I am proud to say that we have almost 4,000 employees in Mexico, all Mexicans, which is rare for a transnational company.</p><h4>How did 2014 close for Navistar?</h4><p>It was a particularly a complicated year. The Mexican market contracted by 14%. Navistar did well despite this, declining only 1%. Our market share grew by 26%, 3.5pp more than expected. At our Escobedo Plant we produced 60,000 units in 2014, making it a record year.</p><div class="quote">“Most of the gain is organic, but Navistar plans to introduce new trucks to segments of the market."</div><h4>Does the gaining of market share occur organically?</h4><p>Most of the gain is organic, but Navistar plans to introduce new trucks to segments of the market, which will give us an edge over the competition. Our company has also developed the biggest and best equipped training center in the country, where we have materials, tools, and truck driving simulators to train customers, drivers, technicians, and our dealers' sales force. We also plan to train close to 4,000 people during 2015 and will be opening our second training center this year. We have also built an extensive dealer network of close to 85 points across the country.</p><h4>To what degree has innovation been a key factor in your success?</h4><p>Innovation is a key driver for our company. If you consider heavy vehicles, performance and fuel consumption are extremely important, especially in a country where prices continuously increase. Comfort for the driver and innovative truck design have drawn people to the market. Being ahead of our competition is vital, and Navistar provides more than great trucks. We have one of the largest portfolio of products and services, and supply our customers with a complete solution in everything truck or bus related, from financial solutions tailor made for trucks, buses, parts and services, and even access to a specialized insurance broker.</p><h4>What role have Navistar's financial services played over the years in boosting market performance?</h4><p>The financial side of the company plays a significant role. Last year, 50% of our trucks sales were realized through our financial company, and we aim to aggressively surpass that figure by 10%. The financial company has a good understanding of the different needs of each market segment, and we are working constantly to create tailor made solutions. Two years ago we created Navistar Leasing, and last year we sold over 1,000 trucks under this type of financing. This is just one example of how Navistar innovation encourages the market.</p><h4>What advantages has Navistar found in bringing its manufacturing to Mexico?</h4><p>One of the most obvious advantages is the highly knowledgeable and specialized Mexican work force. The logistical cost factor is also crucial. Monterrey is a strategic location for exports to the US and Canada, because of its proximity to the border, and the government in Monterrey helped us greatly in establishing our plant. We are also close to Tampico from where we export trucks to Latin America and Africa. Almost half of the trucks produced worldwide were produced at our Mexican plant. Last year as a company we had sales exceeding $12 billion, with $3.5 billion of sales being made in Mexico.</p><h4>What opportunities will be presented through selling Navistar buses and trucks to public institutions?</h4><p>The average age of buses in use in Mexico is around 20 years, so new buses and general innovation in vehicles is something we have been waiting for years. Old trucks and buses are more expensive to maintain, they consume more diesel, and they negatively affect the health of drivers and community through pollutants. It is important that we do something as a country to address this problem, and indeed some cities have started the initiative. Our company will use the opportunity to provide products to meet this need, especially in high-volume areas like Mexico City. As an example, there are municipalities that need garbage trucks, and we are working with various regional governments, states, and NAFTA. It is also important for us to develop the credit conditions enabling truck purchases.</p><h4>What are you expectations for 2015?</h4><p>In the local market, we can expect growth of around 10%. It is going to be a difficult first half of the year for the sector due to the current exchange rate and upcoming elections, although I expect a recovery in the second half of the year. Specifically for Navistar, we have a highly aggressive plan to increase our market share and expand our customer base. Our projection is to grow by a few more percentage points by the end of the year.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the importance for the country of the Summit of the Americas and what are the main achievements that highlight the importance of this event from the economic side?</h4><p>The Summit of the Americas was an overwhelming success. All countries were invited and, in particular, there was a dialogue between the US and Cuba. The summit was an important step toward real dialog between the parties represented. On the economic front, the summit was a showcase for Panama, and it showed that Panama is a vibrant democracy, where all sectors of the economy are able to express their points of view and their potential. The different summits, the CEOs summit, the entrepreneurs' summit, the summit of the universities, and the youth summit were successful as well. The groups were able to reach consensus on several topics of critical importance to the region. We were able to show different American leaders what we have completed in the last few years, what opportunities Panama presents, and, most importantly, what we have accomplished. In the short term, the summit generated $80 million in economic activities. And while the short-term impact of the event is important, I would rather focus on the government's ability to demonstrate the results of our national development. During the summit, Panama attracted some of the most important CEOs and entrepreneurs in the region.</p><h4>What specific segments of the national economy are particularly appealing for international investors?</h4><p>Panama is blessed with an unrivalled geographical position, the logistics sector remains a pillar for the economy, and the airport has been developed by Copa. These are related to that sector and its attractiveness. Secondly, Panama is becoming a financial hub for the region and, over the next decade, we will become an energy hub, too. The new set of locks for the Panama Canal will allow the transit of bigger ships, especially energy ships. The next development is to create an energy hub here.</p><h4>You recently led a delegation to Japan. What did you achieve during the visit and what is the importance of establishing synergies with the Asian markets?</h4><p>The local authorities have shown a remarkable interest in the energy reserves in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. The Japanese are looking to LNG supplies to fulfill their energy demands. We expect this market to grow in the next five years. Panama is a hub for Asian investments in the region. Tokyo in particular wants to move the discussion forward for financing line three of the Panama Metro. On that front we were successful. I met with four different ministries in Tokyo, where we agreed on a timetable to complete the financing. In terms of synergies between Panama and Asia, Panama is the gateway for a lot of Asian products. Many Asian multinationals have their headquarters here. Panama will continue to support that in the coming years and now we are expanding the canal, and with it the possibility of becoming an energy hub.</p><h4>How are you working to get the country removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list?</h4><p>Our strategy is simple. Panama agreed to develop a plan with FATF. Last year in June that strategy was clarified and we are following that plan. The last step of the plan is the adoption of new legislation, during the last reunion with GAFI, Panama achieved an important milestone in the legislative field. The National Assembly approved several laws that will help Panama to be removed from the grey list.</p><div class="quote">“The local authorities have shown a remarkable interest in the energy reserves in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico."</div><h4>Can you share your priorities and targets set for 2015?</h4><p>As far as GAFI is concerned, our priority is to implement the new laws and to execute all the regulations for each of the industries. We have to support all the supervisors that will be in charge of monitoring all these entities. We want Panama's economy to grow, maintaining a stable and balanced growth in all the segments of the national economy, benefitting the citizens of Panama—especially the most vulnerable—promoting social and legislative equality. The execution of The Strategic Plan for 2015-2019, characterized by significant public investment, focuses on developing the social component of the country and on enhancing the basic infrastructures, and will help us to reach our targets.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you describe the various stages and levels of development?</h4><p>Our project, the Advanced Technology Industrial Park and Airport Project (ITEP), was planned in 1987 by the government and the initial phase of land acquisition took 10 years. Next, there were three phases that included an airport, a city hospital to cater to health tourism, and a high-tech campus. Sabiha Gökçen International Airport was completed in 10 years including the connecting highways. After 2005, Turkish Airlines, Pegasus, and other local airlines started coming here. In 2010, Teknopark Istanbul was incorporated. Seven kilometers of underground gallery systems carrying energy, water, and internet utility lines throughout the campus have been installed. There are six R&amp;D buildings currently allocated for the use of our R&amp;D tenant companies. Since the parcelization and infrastructure are completed, investors are willing to locate their centers of excellence at our campus. We plan to grow over the next few years from hundreds of R&amp;D companies to thousands. The total budget of ongoing projects is estimated at $500-600 million, and will hopefully double over the coming few years.</p><h4>Do you tend to strike a balance between international and domestic investors?</h4><p>Our strategic aim is to host both global or local R&amp;D companies and to become a “glocal" center of innovation. We have a well-balanced office park consisting of global companies such as GE, Siemens, and SAP, and many local ones. These are the main companies that are globally present, and they focus on aerospace, energy, and automation, which are our main areas. We can attract global names, but in terms of company count there will be more locals than globals, which is a natural occurrence.</p><div class="quote">“Our strategic aim is to host both global or local R&amp;D companies and to become a “glocal" center of innovation."</div><h4>What skill sets and success indicators do you look for in selecting people for this opportunity?</h4><p>Right now we are more focused on people with PhDs and field experts. The average age at our incubation center is relatively higher. We also prioritize people with projects that have already been awarded funds and grants by public or private institutions.</p><h4>What partnerships do you have abroad with other science and technology parks (STP) in order to develop a shared expertise?</h4><p>Technological peering and cooperation are vital in our sector. We sign MoUs with the most prestigious STPs in the world to increase our international visibility. We try to base the relations on market potential and know-how exchange. We want both givers and takers, who understand our position on growth and the direction we are headed in today.</p><h4>How can the technology park help Turkey to become a center for excellence and regional hub?</h4><p>In order to achieve this goal, we have established a cluster focused on defense and aviation. Turkish Airlines is relocating its MRO Center from Atatürk International Airport to Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, and hopefully we will have the design and modification clusters here, too. On the other hand, we provide business matchmaking days to attract businesses from the defense and aviation sectors. There is a ranking in Turkey today among STPs called an Impact Evaluation Index, and we intend to top it over the coming years given our rapid growth.</p><h4>What differentiates Teknopark Istanbul from other international technology parks?</h4><p>Our focus areas are the key differentiators. Most technology parks abroad are 70% ICT focused. However, our ratios are 70% industrial companies in aerospace, defense, biotechnology, and marine technology, and 30% ICT. We believe that these value-added sectors have a huge impact on decreasing our dependency rate on imports.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Banking the Unbanked]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[banking-the-unbanked]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges that Zanaco is facing at the moment?</h4><p>Last year was a difficult environment as a result of two things. We had some internal issues regarding a systems upgrade in January 2014, and the market experienced some trauma surrounding liquidity issues that stemmed from the Central Bank's desire to control inflation and the exchange rate. The Central Bank changed its statutory reserves, which consequently dried up liquidity in the market; the current year is reflecting this. Additionally, now in 2015, the Central Bank has just announced an increase in the reserve rate from 14-18%, which will impact liquidity significantly. When that money is withdrawn from the economy as it moves from the banking sector to the Central Bank, it will directly impact the ability of banks to lend to customers. The government is tackling infrastructure in its policy initiatives, such as example roads. The situation today revolves around resolving the mining tax issue, which is a position that needs a solution.</p><h4>How has the mining tax increase from 6 to 20% impacted the banking and finance markets?</h4><p>The tax increase is putting additional costs on the mining industry, and at the moment companies are faced with two issues. One is that global demand for copper and the price for copper is down, and now with the tax regime change producers are getting hit twice. International companies run their businesses in a way that takes into account global factors, and that is not always linked to the development of a specific country. They have shareholders and must make a return on their investment. Zanaco, however, is a Zambian bank, and our roots are here. We have to live, work, and survive commercially in this environment.</p><div class="quote">“Ours is a highly competitive market but with high concentration."</div><h4>How would you describe your current market within Zambia's concentrated banking system?</h4><p>Ours is a highly competitive market but with high concentration because, effectively, there are four or five banks that control 60% of the market. In a way we are overbanked in terms of the number of players, which makes it a challenge to be profitable and sustainable. The distinction in the Zambian banking market is that there is a large number of unbanked potential customers. We are trying to grow the sector by reaching out to the unbanked. We are focused on important segments such as agricultural and SMEs as well as retail, corporate, and the government sectors. It's about being focused on what you do, and doing it well.</p><h4>How are you proceeding in terms of expansion?</h4><p>Our distribution footprint has grown, and with third party distribution we now have over 250 agents. In addition, we open one or two new branches each year. We will continue to invest in branches. However, our vision and mission is to reach out to the unbanked. People living in rural areas may need to use the telephone to bank as opposed to going to a branch, effectively at their convenience both as to time and place.</p><h4>How would you describe Zambia's mobile banking adoption rate?</h4><p>The penetration of phones is increasing everyday, and it amazes me how much more access even very remote areas have. The one thing most people strive to have is a phone, and the price of the technology is decreasing. The most basic banking processes can run even on the cheapest of phones. As we reach out to the more remote areas, we need to provide the fundamentals and security to people to encourage them to bank in their own environment.</p><h4>What are Zanaco's programs in terms of financial literacy?</h4><p>We start by teaching financial literacy basics in schools because if we start with the younger generation we can develop better customers for the future. We work with businesses, SMEs, and farmers to help them budget, plan, and control their finances better. Providing financial literacy is a commitment at the heart of our organization. We have a long-term responsibility to the community to contribute to a better society and the broader Zambian economy that this activity supports.</p><h4>How does Zanaco facilitate credit to SMEs?</h4><p>Entrepreneurs are still struggling to find finances, and this is where we as bank and a sector need to do more. Since entrepreneurs do not have many assets or collateral, providing credit is an investment in the person and their activities, and how successful you think they will be moving forward. Now though, we are seeing more and more businesses that started from nothing but have gained a solid base and even international reputations.</p><h4>How would you describe the business environment, and how does Zanaco make Zambia a more attractive investment destination?</h4><p>Investors are looking at the stability of a country as well as commercial opportunity before investing. It is important for investors to find a safe environment for workers, in which government policies are clear and processes are supportive for investments. Providing an enabling environment is something that Zambia does very well; this country provides opportunities for successful business ventures. The role of a bank like Zanaco is to lend capital and support people investing in Zambia. We can help provide successful outcomes because we have been here for a long time, we know how the marketplace works, and we have an extensive network to share; we can help in providing the financial assistance to help build a successful outcome.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We anticipate this being a challenging year with many of last year's characteristics present at the macro level. Profitability will be challenging in the short term, but in the long term we see a more solid picture emerging. Meanwhile, 2016 will be an election year for Zambia, and therefore may be a bit of a wild card with its own set of circumstances. However, over the next three to five years we have a positive outlook.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the latest developments concerning privatization in Lebanon, and what initiatives are the Higher Council for Privatization (HCP) currently working on?</h4><p>The only sector that could benefit from privatization in Lebanon today is, in my judgment, the telecoms sector. Unfortunately, there has not been much progress on that front to-date. The current Minister of Telecommunications has expressed willingness to apply the Telecoms Law and so create an integrated operator, to be called Liban Telecom. We are now waiting for that process to start. On the public-private partnerships (PPPs) front, we are still awaiting the enactment of legislation and have issued a book of guidelines for the tendering of PPP projects in Lebanon. And even though we currently lack PPP legislation that mandates international best practice, there is ongoing PPP activity. Parliament passed legislation in 2014 to allow the Council of Ministers to license PPP power plants, usually referred to as Independent Power Producers (IPPs). We are waiting for the Ministry of Energy to take the necessary steps to launch that process.</p><h4>What is the importance of PPPs for the sustainable development of Lebanon's economy?</h4><p>The importance of PPPs for the economy is tremendous. I personally think that it is the only thing that will make a difference in improving our economy at this point. We are in desperate need of infrastructure and PPPs are exactly designed to finance infrastructure. We need roads, bridges, towers, and telecoms infrastructure. Our needs span a wide spectrum ranging from power plants and dams, to prisons and public transport. We now have bank assets in Lebanon of about $190 billion, of which about $160 billion are deposits. This is a huge volume for a country the size of Lebanon, where GDP is at $47 billion. As a result, banks are particularly interested in funding PPP projects; they view such schemes as an alternative to simply continuing to finance the Government on an unsecured, non-recourse basis. Certain Lebanese entrepreneurs have been highly active for the past 15 years creating and undertaking PPP projects in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, and various regions in Africa. We have the need, we have the financing, and we have the entrepreneurs to do it. There are also now 1.5 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon. This situation has led the lowest cost of manual labor in relative terms in the history of Lebanon. We should take advantage of that fact. It creates a win-win situation, where they help us build our infrastructure and we organize their presence in the country. Furthermore, today our economy is based on enterprises that are often family owned, and individual enterprises do not create employment. In order to create jobs in large numbers, you need large projects like infrastructure development. These projects will not only be employing manual laborers but also local architects, engineers, managers, accountants, lawyers, IT people, and admin people. Creating jobs is the priority for our economy, not only to create better living standards, but also to stem the tide of emigration. Through emigration we lose our best and brightest, which has been happening for the past 30 years.</p><div class="quote">“The importance of PPPs for the economy is tremendous."</div><h4>Are public authorities doing enough in terms of improving the framework for investors and promoting the country?</h4><p>Public authorities need to primarily focus on job creation, which has not been the case as they have been sidetracked in other directions. One of the most important factors in job creation, besides stability and economic growth, is having an investor-friendly environment. In Lebanon, we still have work to do in this regard and the public authorities definitely need to give it more attention.  Red tape and complicated and unnecessary procedures are among the elements that still hinder simple matters such as the creation of new companies and the dissolution of old ones. A series of reforms has been identified, which requires legislative amendment and these are being submitted for parliamentary treatment.</p><h4>To what extent do you agree with the privatization of sectors such as energy?</h4><p>Given that I am responsible for privatization, people expect me to say that everything should be privatized. But in fact, I'm clear when I say that privatization is not the right tool for all contexts. I believe that in certain areas, namely the telecoms sector, it is the right tool. However, we should turn to PPPs for electricity and other sectors. The privatization of the telecoms sector and the adoption of the PPP approach in other sectors can help foster the creation of true capital markets in Lebanon, promoting an easier flow of capital among private sector players.</p><h4>What is your mid-term outlook for Lebanon's economy?</h4><p>I think that if the politicians make progress with PPPs, we have a very bright future. If we do not, I am afraid that the economy will continue to suffer. The war in Syria is set to continue for years to come, and our involvement in it has already reached a worrisome degree. However, despite that, our economy has been doing well, in relative terms, because of the private sector and because civil society organizations have been providing services where our government has been largely absent. The armed forces have been doing a good job of maintaining peace, security, and stability. What we need is for the government to pay closer attention to socio-economic matters. If it does that, Lebanon's economy will do very well, I am sure.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The year 2014 was marked by several challenges and opportunities. How is the Ministry responding to the new conditions in Peru and what opportunities do you identify?</h4><p>The government is actively responding to the economic slowdown, not only in terms of industrial activity, but also to economic activity in general. We are implementing a series of measures that will drive economic growth in 2015. Our goal is to return to a growth rate close to 5% in 2015 and 7% thereafter. In July we launched the National Productive Diversification Plan (PNDP). So far, Peru's growth has been driven mainly by the mining sector. However, we have other potential sectors such as agricultural exports, which are highly competitive and are growing at an annual rate of 18% to 20%. We need to ensure we have more of these engines to drive growth. Fundamentally, our diversification strategy needs to stimulate other sectors. In that sense, we have begun work on technical committees with representatives of private associations to collect proposals on public assets; for example, considering the legal barriers that are hampering certain sectors, and what kind of infrastructure industry requires to maximize its competitiveness. The priority is not to improve profitability. We are not here to grant subsidies or tax exemptions, but to ensure that we are maximizing the productive potential of the country.</p><h4>What are some of the tools and initiatives implemented to improve productivity?</h4><p>On one hand, we have a group of formal, modern, and highly productive enterprises, and on the other, a larger group of SMEs that are characterized by informality and low productivity. We look forward to working with both because we need to increase the average productivity of the entire economy. In order to achieve this we have created the Centers for Technological Innovation (CITE), which aim to support technology transfer to SMEs. Currently, Peru has five centers; however, our goal is to have at least 30 in 2015 and 47 in 2016. This model has already yielded results, but we are extending it to make it viable on a macroeconomic scale. For high-productivity sectors, we have included a number of funds to promote innovation. Companies in Peru spend very little on R&amp;D and we are trying to reverse that. We are also working to streamline bureaucracy, adn consequently the cost of doing business in Peru.</p><div class="quote">“The government is actively responding to the economic slowdown."</div><h4>Could you tell us about the importance of the availability and expansion of credit to SMEs from the perspective of the Ministry?</h4><p>Clearly, the economy as a whole has high liquidity, adn yet the cost of funding for some SMEs is very high. We are addressing this situation on at least two fronts: in July, Congress approved the law enabling us to improve the financial market for SMEs through factoring. We need to ensure that when an SME sells to a large company, you can use your bill at a bank or similar institution for liquidity at a lower rate. What we are doing is to ensure that, in accordance with the law, it is clear and established that the invoice can be used as a guarantee statement. This bill is now an asset that can be sold on the market and obviously is negotiable. This will significantly reduce the cost of working capital for SMEs that provide goods or services to larger companies. We are also working to improve the environment for both small and large companies keen to be linked to microenterprises. We have implemented a number of changes to reduce these costs through market mechanisms.</p><h4>How has growth in infrastructure investment helped to increase economic growth?</h4><p>Peru has a huge gap in infrastructure. We have been spending about 6% of GDP on public infrastructure, and this will continue. Additionally, in 2015, due to lower growth, the government is increasing public spending even further, to the tune of 2.5% of GDP. This will generate increased demand for the industrial sector, service sector and SMEs. If a government institution requires something that local industry can provide, it should do so. What is more important is that better infrastructure and business conditions further reduce business costs and make the country more competitive. The goal here is to level the playing field and make it easier for the private sector to operate. This is not about granting subsidies or raising tariffs, which the government does not support.</p><h4>The fisheries sector has experienced a costly slowdown this year due to weather conditions. What is your outlook for the industry?</h4><p>Peru has been highly sensitive on the subject of fish stock and we have preventive standards such as fishing limits in place. In Peru, there is a high dependence on one particular type of fish; anchovies, and a single product; fishmeal. First of all, we need to encourage aquaculture, since currently only 1% of Peruvian production belongs to this segment compared to almost 50% in the rest of the world. In other words, there is high potential in this sector. We know that fish stocks in the oceans are not growing and there is a limited amount that can be drawn if we maintain sustainable levels. Therefore, further growth needs to come from aquaculture.</p><h4>What is the Ministry doing to stimualte this sector?</h4><p>We have established a technical committee to find innovative ways of working with the private sector. Our efforts include establishing an innovation center for aquaculture. Besides the anchovy, Peru has other options that can increase fishing and tuna fishing significantly. It is vital that we look beyond the anchovy, as this year has shown how dangerous it is to rely on a single product. However, such a process will take some time.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaysia and the Netherlands have a history of strong bilateral relations. How have these evolved in recent years, and what makes Malaysia an important political, economic and security partner for the Netherlands today?</h4><p>The relationship between the Netherlands and Malaysia goes back a long way. In 1957, the Netherlands was one of the first countries to establish relations with Malaysia following its independence, and we have enjoyed excellent ties ever since. Trade and investment relations have developed particularly well over the past few decades as our economies have grown. The Netherlands is Malaysia's second export destination, and is currently the second trade and investment partner in South East Asia. Despite the geographical distance between us, Malaysia and the Netherlands have various similarities. Both countries are multicultural and multi-religious, and, despite being relatively small, are among the world's leading trading nations. I am pleased that our shared interests have allowed for the flourishing of our bilateral relationship in recent years. Since the MH17 tragedy, we have grown closer as grieving nations. During my visit in November 2014 and during my recent meeting with Najib Razak at the Bo'ao Forum in China, I underlined our strong bilateral ties, our long-term economic and trade relations and the importance of our cooperation in the aftermath of the MH17 tragedy.</p><h4>There is a strong Dutch business community in Malaysia, with many Dutch multinational companies having set up regional offices here. What are the advantages of Malaysia as a destination for Dutch investors?</h4><p>Quite a number of Dutch multinational companies have located their regional offices in Malaysia because of its excellent business climate. More than 200 Dutch small- and medium-sized enterprises are also active in the country. I believe that Malaysia's ambition to transform into an innovation-based economy and the identification of several National Key Economic Areas make Malaysia a “Hub into Asia" for key Dutch sectors such as chemicals, energy, logistics, agriculture and food, and horticulture. During my visit to Kuala Lumpur in November 2014, I had a fruitful meeting with members of the Malaysia Dutch Business Council, who are active in promoting trade and investments between Malaysia and The Netherlands. When I asked them what was needed to improve the business climate in Malaysia even further, the MDBC had to point out that Malaysia already outperforms the Netherlands on the World Bank Doing Business Indicators. Malaysia was ranked sixth in 2014 and provides the facilities that Dutch companies need to deliver high-quality goods and services. Furthermore, the workforce is educated and multilingual and the country has well developed infrastructure, including excellent roads and a strategically located, well-connected airport and harbors. Business costs, such as rent, salaries, and corporation tax, are relatively low. Since the ASEAN economies are generally doing very well, Malaysia is also an attractive base for Dutch companies' operations in the region. Another important pull factor is Malaysia's central location within six to eight hours' flying time of key regional financial service hubs like Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai, Dubai, and Sydney. Finally, Malaysia offers several effective incentive programs to attract foreign investors.</p><div class="quote">“Quite a number of Dutch multinational companies have located their regional offices in Malaysia."</div><h4>Negotiations are currently underway for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Malaysia and the EU. How soon do you think an FTA could be finalized and how would this reinforce Malaysia's position as the Netherlands' main ASEAN trading partner?</h4><h4>Malaysia is the EU's second largest trading partner in ASEAN, and the second country with which the EU opened negotiations on an FTA. Progress has been made since negotiations resumed in 2014; however, there is still some ground to be covered. I am confident that we will reach an agreement that is satisfactory to all parties involved. The FTA will create opportunities for economic growth, both in Malaysia and the Netherlands in sectors such as agriculture, services and investment. Malaysia is also the Netherlands' second largest trading partner in ASEAN. An FTA would further reinforce our already strong ties.</h4><h4>You and Prime Minister Dato' Sri Mohd Najib Tun Razak recently attended the 10th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit. How will closer integration between ASEAN nations, brought about by the ASEAN Community, impact EU-Asia relations?</h4><p>The Netherlands attaches great importance to cooperation with ASEAN and its member states. ASEAN is increasingly regarded as a counterpart of the EU in Asia. We therefore welcome initiatives aimed at further regional integration, such as the establishment of an ASEAN Economic Community. Regional security is another important area in which we wish to learn from ASEAN's experiences and offer our assistance. As Asia becomes increasingly economically interdependent, it is in our shared interest for Asia's political integration, and its regional security architecture to match the pace of these developments.</p><h4>What do you envisage for the future of bilateral relations between Malaysia and the Netherlands?</h4><p>I hope that our economic, political and personal relations continue to grow closer. We have shown that we can endure challenges and become stronger, as we did in the aftermath of the MH17 tragedy. I also see many economic opportunities, for instance in the agriculture, gas, petroleum, water and waste management and service sectors, to name but a few. We also cherish our political dialogue. Dutch-Malaysian exchange programs for students and professors and other forms of educational cooperation will help foster a closer understanding between the people of our countries. I feel senang that we are looking to a bright future for Dutch-Malaysian relations.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>TBY talks to Elisa de Lewis, General Director of Clí­nica Hospital San Fernando, on meeting international standards, health education, and medical tourism.</p>
<h4>What have the hospital’s major milestones been over the last few years?</h4>
<p>Clí­nica Hospital San Fernando was founded in 1949 by my grandfather Dr. Jaime de la Guardia. He was a surgeon who graduated in the US and he wanted to establish a hospital to treat private patients, and physicians to have the right to do so without restrictions. At that time, there was just one hospital in Panama and it was a closed one, meaning not all physicians could hospitalize patients. Dr. de la Guardia united businessmen, physicians, and family together that believed in him and the project, and they started construction in 1947. He started out with around 30 physicians with a few specialties. The hospital opened with just 30 beds and at a cost of $5 per room. I started my career in the hospital in 1976 as an Assistant to the General Director, and throughout the years I have seen an improvement in medical technology, human resources, and IT, but especially the quality of care. We have more than 600 physicians in three office buildings around the hospital. Since 2011, we have been accredited by Joint Commission International (JCI), and our physicians have to fulfil all of JCI’s requirements.</p>
<h4>Hospital San Fernando is one of the two Panamanian hospitals that have joined the JCI accreditation system. What is the importance of this recognition?</h4>
<p>The JCI requires us to comply with certain security and quality control standards, which it measures using a system of indicators. The most important factors are quality and the security of the patient. For example, you have to identify the patient and match them up with their proposed surgical procedure. It is basically an ISO system for hospitals. We have our reaccreditation due in 2014; it takes place every three years. We decided to get accredited five years ago, and it took us two years to ensure that we were able to comply with all the requirements. You have to fulfil all the requirements to a level of 90%-100%. There are 144 standards that you have to comply with in total, which is not an easy task. Everyone from our Board of Directors, to all of the hospital’s collaborators and employees has to be on board. In 2014, the hospital has to comply with the Fifth Edition, meaning there are more challenges to meet. We were the first ones to gain this recognition locally. Panama has started working on its own accreditation system; however, it is still just on paper. Nothing has been done about it yet.</p><div class="quote">“Panama has started working on its own accreditation system.“</div>
<h4>What role does Hospital San Fernando play in health education?</h4>
<p>That is part of our accreditation; we have to comply with patient education requirements. Our values lie with our collaborators, families, and patients. One of the actions we take for the prevention of disease and illness is the vaccination of our employees and their families. We recently completed a campaign with patients’ families promoting the importance of good hand-washing practices. Part of our corporate social responsibility work has a green theme, especially regarding recycling and eliminating levels of mercury. There is also a new Panamanian law regarding  security risks for employees, and in terms of compliance, hospitals and clinics are inspected more than any other work place.</p>
<h4>What is the importance of medical tourism for the hospital?</h4>
<p>For private hospitals, it hasn’t been substantially important, basically because of the lack of personnel and the demand from Panamanians and foreign residents. However, we have been looking into medical tourism, since it can be beneficial, despite being a risky business. Generally, people that go abroad for treatment are those without insurance, and are looking for a cheaper health option. Medical tourism is predominantly in the areas of plastic surgery and odontology, with perhaps also a few orthopedic procedures. Panama has all the qualifications for becoming a potential destination for medical tourism; however, this has to be combined with the right laws.</p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Ahli Bank's performance over the past year?</h4><p>Last year Alhi Bank saw consistent growth. We remain the fastest growing bank, increasing our loans by 26% and our bottom line just below 10%. We currently have the lowest cost-income ratio in our cohort. We have the lowest ratio of non-performing loans as well, at 1%. Our target return on equity is above 13% and we were able to maintain this very well. Last year we launched “Al-Hilal" Islamic banking, which has seen good growth and acceptance by corporate and retail customers. We also launched a dedicated SME unit to meet the regulatory guideline to allocate 5% of our loan base to this sector. All in all we have been greatly pleased by the bank's progress.</p><h4>Ahli Bank entered into a MoU in order to provide banking services in Duqm. What are the expected outcomes?</h4><p>Many banks have signed similar MoUs. Basically, the LMU provides assurance that we will be one of the panel banks to be approached by companies investing in Duqm. Despite the oil price decline, the government is committed to the development, and we expect to see billions of dollars in investments.</p><div class="quote">“Ahli United Bank is a strategic partner with headquarters in Bahrain. "</div><h4>What other projects are you financing of significance to this?</h4><p>Ahli United Bank is a strategic partner with headquarters in Bahrain. We work with it on transactions and cross-border financings. This is a partnership that extends our underwriting capacity significantly. Recently, for example, we were mandated to finance the Orpic Muscat to Sohar pipeline project, which is around $250 million in financing. This deal has concluded, and we are currently working on a number of other projects.</p><h4>Are there other major initiatives on which Ahli Bank is focused?</h4><p>Some people say branch banking is a bit of a sunset industry. I do not particular think it is, but as we move forward we are investing in different channels like mobile and internet banking. We have developed business-to-business e-banking solutions. We are prioritizing digital solutions in addition to selective additional branch openings. When we launched Islamic banking, we opened six branches on the same day because we were not able to simultaneously launch internet banking. This is now about to be launched. We recently opened six customer service kiosks in shopping malls, which are open 10am to 10pm, with cash deposit/withdrawal machines. With most banks embracing the digital transformation, it is a very broad category, and our challenge will be to differentiate Ahli from other banks in terms of products and pricing. We are focusing on our turnaround times, complaint management handling, and customer service.</p><h4>How are you able to attract new customers, foreign or domestic?</h4><p>Increasingly remote (or digital cellular) banking is important because most people have access to mobile phones. We can integrate a full banking model in this manner, to reach customers throughout Oman. I would observe that we attract many new customers through word of mouth. For example, although we have not yet advertised Islamic mortgage pricing, we are struggling to keep up with demand. In terms of new companies coming into Oman, we benefit from our partnership with Ahli United Bank in making introductions through its regional offices in other countries. In particular we are serving incoming investment from Egypt and Kuwait, both directly and through the free zones.</p><h4>How would you describe the health of the banking sector today?</h4><p>I have actually worked in five GCC countries, all but Qatar. My observation is that in Oman the banking sector is in good shape. Despite the economic crash, there have been no bank failures here because banks are well regulated and well capitalized. They are consistently profitable and prudently managed. Within the region they have the lowest non-performing loans ratio of about 2%, and among the highest capital adequacy ratios.</p><h4>Will this confidence in banking fuel more investments throughout the country?</h4><p>I have no doubt about that because the capital investment project plan is significant, and we are seeing foreign direct investment coming in. When the oil price fell suddenly in December of last year, Oman was one of the countries described as being overly dependent on oil. The local stock market declined substantially, and many foreign investors withdrew money at that time. But interestingly, Oman was able to recover quickly because local investors saw value and put money into the stock market, which rebounded quickly. This shows us that investors have confidence in the securities market and those firms listed on it.</p><h4>How will this confidence be maintained in the coming years?</h4><p>Despite the sudden drop in oil prices, the government actually increased its budgeted expenditure by 4% in 2015. It listed expected sources of revenue and showed allocated expenses, so it was clear that the program of government-led investment would continue. The budget at that time was based on an average price of $75. Though this may or may not be the case this year, it is clear that the government has adequate resources from various areas, to bridge the budget deficit forecast. We are seeing the economy diversifying, and there are great opportunities beyond oil and gas</p><h4>What are some of the serious challenges facing the banking sector?</h4><p>The biggest challenge might prove to be the liquidity in the banking sector and the market. In the GCC, in respect of their banking sectors, governments tend to be the biggest depositors, borrowers, and owners, whereby banking and government are comparatively more inter-dependent. My concern is replacing any withdrawal of government-linked deposits, and how this potential scenario might reflect to banks' capacity to lend. There is no indication that such withdrawals will occur, but it is important for banks to diversify their deposits and have standby lines of credit from foreign banks. We are also expecting the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates later in 2015, which should renew borrowers' appetite for interest rate hedging.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>Ahli Bank expects similar progress to last year. We expect to see credit growth and increased profitability. I am optimistic it will be another strong year for the bank.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the profile of business women in Turkey changed since KAGIDER's foundation in 2002?</h4><p>It has changed for the good, particularly when considering public advocacy; for example, when we travel to towns and cities around the country to explain the idea of entrepreneurship. The word itself is difficult enough to say in both English and Turkish, but sometimes explaining what it means can be almost as difficult. The notion of female entrepreneurship especially is something that is often discouraged. And this is a global phenomenon, not just the local culture. For example, if a working man comes home complaining about having a bad day, his family would generally encourage him, saying that the bad times will pass. Yet if a woman comes home with the same complaints, instead of being encouraged to keep going, she will most probably be advised to quit and not get preoccupied. This is a common situation for women everywhere, not just in Turkey. Women face negative reinforcement and men face positive reinforcement about the bare fact of working. These prejudices tend to be widespread, making it is easier for women to give up. This is exactly why we want to encourage women and train and change perceptions about female entrepreneurship in the country. Entrepreneurship is a concept that people sometimes have difficulty grasping. Even though everybody understands that empowering women is positive, most of the time they do not quite grasp what a woman entrepreneur is. Is it an industrialist or a shop owner? However, the notion of entrepreneurship in general and female entrepreneurs has become quite popular and been a better understood concept over the past 12 years. If you follow the press you will see that each year they are covering more and more entrepreneurship stories and success stories about women entrepreneurs. It is talked about in the media, and it is more on the agenda, with more young women being aspired to become entrepreneurs. On the other hand, unfortunately, not all of them will be successful. At KAGIDER our role is to support women entrepreneurs on their road to success.</p><h4>With whom does KAGIDER partner in trying to fulfill that role?</h4><p>Receiving the special consultative status of United Nations ECOSOC in 2010 we have become an accredited Turkish NGO specialized in gender issues and thus we have the opportunity to organize events at the UN. Since then, each year at the UN CSW meetings we organize a panel to present the activities that we have undertaken to empower women in Turkey. For example, this year in line with CSW's main theme of “Women and the Economy," we have presented our “Woman Entrepreneur of the Year" contest, held in collaboration with Garanti Bank and The Economist. It is an honor for us to say that those selected as Turkey's best female entrepreneurs are also invited to participate in global competitions. This is just one of many such projects that we run. When we have ideas for different projects, we approach the relevant private and/or public sector players to partner with us; for example, we have a project that we carry out in cooperation with the Turkish Ministry for Family and Social Policies and Intel; it is an ideation and innovation camp that we organize in different cities around Turkey, where we train young men and women in finding solutions to the problem of gender inequality in different contexts. It is a think-tank that encourages thinking about women's issues to find solutions that will empower them in their region and, so far, we have taken the project to six cities and, each time, it has been a great success.</p><h4>Female entrepreneurship and employment are remarkably low in Turkey, but at the same time there is a fairly high ratio of female executives in Turkey relative to the rest of the OECD region. How do you reconcile those apparently contradictory facts?</h4><p>It is a highly correlated issue. The higher the education a woman receives, the better and higher performance she will demonstrate. In other words, highly educated women outperform OECD standards in top management, middle management, and so forth. This is a fact because we have very good schools producing top-level graduates. I applaud both the men and women CEOs that Turkey has succeeded to export globally. But if we look at the overall education standards for women and men we cannot say they are exposed to top quality education. Out of the entire population, some 72% of the male population are either employed or looking for a job, while only 31% of women are doing either. There is serious gap between men and women. Everything is linked, and so initially you need to provide opportunities not only for learning, but also good quality education and then the opportunities for employment. I connect the lower level of employment of women directly to the lack of educational opportunities for them, which is a pipeline issue that we need to enhance. When they have the opportunity to have good education they outperform. When they have little or no education they fall behind.</p><h4>What can local companies do to address that issue?</h4><p>First of all, companies can employ more women. The population is divided 50-50, and the exposure of women to primary education is on average equal to that of men. That figure declines slightly for secondary education, but when it comes to higher education, most of the women who graduate are likely to get a job. So you have to support women all throughout the pipeline. When they graduate, we have yet another project called Young Leaders of the Future, which aims to prepare young women for professional life. Companies scale candidates according to their correct fit in terms of the jobs available based on education, language ability, and so forth. In some companies being a woman is also a plus, to encourage companywide executives to employ more women. Such mechanisms are useful for increasing the level of participation among women in the workforce, but not many jobs can be assessed in such simple terms, because it comes down to the right person for the job. For example, there are still many sectors and jobs that are male dominated, for example production. Women on the other hand would generally fill the role of a PR manager in a company. Of course, there are no rules that would suggest that these roles could not be reversed, and there are very successful examples, but there are still certain jobs that are attached to gender in our minds. Our job is to break through these preconceived notions and provide equal opportunities to men and women in all areas and sectors.</p><div class="quote">“The population is divided 50-50, and the exposure of women to primary education is on average equal to that of men."</div><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lundin Gold recently purchased the Fruta del Norte project from Kinross for $240 million in cash and stock. Why did Kinross pull out from this project and why is Lundin Gold ready to take on the challenge?</h4><p>Kinross made the decision in 2013 to discontinue the development of the project after two years of negotiations with the government of Ecuador and following the failure to reach agreement on fiscal and developmental terms. Over the next 18 months it tried to reach a resolution. In May of 2014, we began to evaluate the opportunity and moved quickly to close the transaction in December 2014. I have been involved with the Lundin Family for 20 years, and it is a great opportunity for me. The Lundin family has invested $100 million of its personal money into the project and will continue to invest as needed. In 2014 the Ecuadorian government began to become more focused on developing mining as a facet of its economy. The fall in oil prices has created even more of a focus on mining and how this economy needs to diversify.</p><h4>Ecuador has not always been too open to mining investment. How confident do you feel about the improvement in the Ecuadorian mining fiscal and regulatory environment?</h4><p>We feel rather confident, but as I have told our investors, this is not a smooth journey. There will be times when we advise investors to fasten their seat belts. However, our approach is slightly different, as most of our management team is in-country and we are committed to Ecuador, working with its government and people of Ecuador, in realizing the project at hand. We have Latin American advisors, primarily from Chile, who are convinced that this is the optimum time for the project.</p><div class="quote">“We feel rather confident, but as I have told our investors, this is not a smooth journey."</div><h4>Fruta del Norte is unquestionably one of the world's best as-yet undeveloped gold deposits. What are your expectations from this project and what profit do you foresee?</h4><p>Profit is contingent upon the gold price. Many people ask me what my expectations are for the gold price, and my answer in short is that it does not concern me. This is one of the best-undeveloped gold reserves in the world and also among the highest-grade sites. We will be profitable at gold prices that might put many other companies out of business, and the government will still be generating returns. We have 18 months since the date that we signed to submit what is called a phase change application to go to exploitation. Therefore, we have multiple engineering efforts currently underway, and other than certain unique specialty areas being done in Canada, all other efforts are being expended in Latin America. Our goal, once we have the feasibility study done and phase changes, is to move straight into construction, and hopefully by 1Q2019 we expect to pour the first gold bar.</p><h4>Does Lundin Gold intend to develop any other projects in the country?</h4><p>We find ourselves in solid position, in that we can hopefully set the standards for responsible mining in Ecuador. We see this not only as an opportunity for Lundin Gold, but also for some of our sister companies such NGEx Resources Inc., a company with exploration projects in Argentina and Chile. It is more focused on base metals, such as copper, and so we see opportunities not only for Lundin Gold, but also for other entities within the group. This is Lundin Gold's first project, and a fantastic one to build the company on. Lundin Gold will be the family's new gold vehicle, and so we will be seeking other opportunities once we get Fruta del Norte up and running.</p><h4>What is the objective of Lundin Gold for 2015?</h4><p>Actually 2016 is a key year for us, because by June 2016 we are obliged to have submitted our exploitation phase transition documentation, whereby 2015 will require tremendous efforts. We have technological activities on site and will involve significant engineering; working with the government on moving forward with agreements, and starting to work with various financial institutions to ensure that related financing is in place when the time comes to construct the facility. In short, perhaps we might say that 2015 will be a year of major progress, rather than milestones.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the stock market's activity in 2014?</h4><p>The year 2014 witnessed a general increase in the trading movement on the BSE. In the year's 245 trading sessions 96.8 million shares were traded for $661.4 million, compared to 51.4 million shares valued at $375.2 million for the year 2013. This represents an increase of 88% and 76%, respectively, on the volume and value of shares traded. Total listed capitalization increased by 6.4% at the end of the year to reach $11.2 billion against $10.5 billion at the end of 2013. Finally, the value of secondary public offering in 2014 increased by more than 35% to reach $521 million against $385 million in 2013.</p><h4>In March 2014, the BSE signed an agreement with Euronext for the implementation of a new trading application platform. What is the importance of this new system and how does it contribute to enhancing the credibility of the local financial market?</h4><p>From a technical perspective, the BSE has always been well structured and our technical infrastructure is being constantly up-dated to match the highest international standards. Currently, the BSE is using the NSC-UNIX trading system, which is developed and used by Euronext. In addition, we adopted an online trading system and developed an up to date website to provide our investors an easy use search engine for market data and listed companies' information. Recently, we signed an agreement with EURONEXT to set up an advanced, state-of-the-art, electronic trading system in the coming two years that will improve the technical performance of the market and support the expected growth in equity listing and the entry into new asset classes in the Lebanese markets.</p><div class="quote">“From a technical perspective, the BSE has always been well structured."</div><h4>What steps are being taken to promote the financial markets in Lebanon and attract more institutional investors to the BSE?</h4><p>In an effort to foster the development of the financial markets in Lebanon, the Lebanese Parliament endorsed law #161/2011 in August 2011; I participated in different panel discussions of the law in the parliament, and suggested many amendments to it. The law has been drafted according to recognized international standards, and aims to develop sound and transparent financial markets in Lebanon. It is expected to boost the activity of the Lebanese financial markets, increase its transparency, its liquidity, as well as its efficiency. The new law governs all operations related to the issuing, purchase, sale, or promotion of financial instruments that are directly offered to public subscription and that are listed or traded on the stock exchanges. The market authority will be entrusted to issue rules in relation to the operation of financial markets, to regulate the IPO process and the listing of financial products, as well as to look into ownership issues where listed companies are involved. Moreover, it has power to award licenses and authorizations, particularly to financial rating agencies, collective investment schemes, financial intermediation companies, stock exchanges, and companies that offer consultancy and other services relating to financial products to the general public. It monitors financial markets, conducts investigations, issues sanctions, and prompts criminal proceedings where necessary. It also identifies the publications, disclosures, and information to be provided by the listed companies to the investors. In addition, the new law provides for the establishment of the Financial Market Court to which the Chairman and members must devote their time. Finally, the new Financial Market Law takes into consideration the privatization of the BSE by turning it into a Lebanese joint stock company in the first stage, to be established in Beirut and dominated “Beirut Stock Exchange SAL," and in a later stage assigning its shares to third parties from the private sector, through a public or private offering, pursuant to a decision of the Council of Ministers.</p><h4>Most Lebanese businesses, industries, and services are family owned. How does the BSE work to educate entrepreneurs on the importance of disclosing their activities and raising capital through the stock exchange?</h4><p>Lebanese businesses, both in the commercial and service sectors, are, in the vast majority, small family-owned firms that prefer to finance their activities through bank credit in order to keep control over their companies. However, the BSE Committee is trying to correct the current situation by giving increasing attention to educational and promotional programs that aim to attract and convince medium-sized Lebanese companies to list their shares on the BSE and to increase their capital through the broadening of the shareholder base, by highlighting the importance and advantages of financing through the stock exchange.</p><h4>What other challenges are facing Lebanon's capital markets?</h4><p>The Lebanese market is struggling with high political insecurity caused by the war in Syria, and the failure to elect a new president. As long as these issues are not resolved, Lebanon's service and touristic oriented economy will grow weakly. In fact, these issues resulted in significantly decreasing foreign direct investments and tourism, declining economic growth during the past three years to the 1-2% range after successive years of 8% average growth. These problems have deterred foreigner investors from entering the market for the first time and already existing investors from increasing their portfolio. However, even in the normal period, stock market activity is hindered by competition with banks and the lack of market culture in Lebanon.</p><h4>What is your mid-term outlook for the BSE?</h4><p>We are highly confident that the creation of the new financial market authority will give national and foreign investors a clear message that Lebanon has now the proper legislation to control and regulate its financial market. We are sure that the law enforcement will progressively contribute to the development of a successful domestic and regional exchange and render the BSE one of the most important regional exchanges for issuers to raise capital on and for investors to trade a diversified range of financial instruments.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways will Scotiabank's acquisition of Citibank's retail and commercial banking operations in Peru impact local operations?</h4><p>Scotiabank's first stage of activity in Peru was as a shareholder of a small bank. However, as the bank grew it developed a new strategy of maintaining a balance between the sustainable growth of our business operations, and the acquisition of complementary lines of business that can benefit the company. In fact, Scotiabank in Peru was born out of the merger of two banking institutions, and we subsequently acquired a third company, which we transformed into a financial institution focused on credit lines to small companies and low- and middle-income consumers. Later we expanded operations into wealth management by purchasing a private pension fund administrator. Lately, we have incorporated the consumer portfolio of Citibank, because we believed it complemented our existing portfolio and put us in a strong position to develop a platform of premium banking in Peru. In our long-term vision, it provides us a solid growth expectation in the country, which has had a stable growth rate for the past decade, and invested regularly in the country. We see plenty of opportunities in the lending segment, as well as in savings. One of our key goals is to convert companies in these two segments into long-term clients.</p><h4>What market segments offer the greatest expansion potential for your institution?</h4><p>Scotiabank has had a strong focus on developing activities in Latin America and Asia since the late 1990s. In this region, the company aimed at increasing market share and operations in the key countries of the region; the first large investment was in Mexico, followed by Central America and the Caribbean region, and also South America. Peru, Chile, and Colombia were the main focus markets, and the company now has a focus on growing alongside the Pacific Alliance. We see huge potential in Peru, a country with an impressive growth rate over the past decade. The performance of the country has exceeded the regional average, and the market offers many competitive advantages. There is, for example, the potential for 15 million saving accounts.</p><div class="quote">“Market formality is a key element in this particular segment of the market."</div><h4>What measures are needed to include more Peruvians in the private pension system?</h4><p>The private pension market in Peru is a rather small one. Recent reforms have ensured that the system will be able to offer better returns in terms of capitalization of savings, as well as better services. The size of the private fund administrators is now reasonable as compared to the market, which helps to offer better services to a more mature market. The system offers a very good option to secure workers once they have ended their working life. Peru has true potential in the capital markets that, supported by the internal savings market, could contribute to the development of key projects. At the moment, the country is engaged in around $20 billion worth of infrastructure projects. Looking to the future, there is the potential for some $60 billion thanks to the equilibrium that growth, capitalization, and savings bring to the country.</p><h4>Could you further explain your strategy in the micro finance market?</h4><p>Market formality is a key element in this particular segment of the market, especially in the commercial and industrial sectors. It is difficult to measure informality. However, we should tackle informality in the labor market first, as this is one of the key issues in all economies. Micro credits offer future opportunities to micro businesses, and we believe that as long as we support them in the first stages, we will have developed a highly loyal client for the institution. Therefore, we prioritize accompanying these micro businesses as they undertake a variety of first steps and services. I think that the more clients we incorporate into the formal credit market, the more we will contribute to reducing informality.</p><h4>Do you foresee currency pressures jeopardizing Scotiabank's earnings for 2015? How could these pressures affect your activity?</h4><p>The Central Bank of Peru has taken positive steps over the past few years, anticipating key situations and effects from international markets. These decisions have reduced volatility and kept inflation at the lowest levels for the past century. We have also achieved high levels of stability in the finance market. The dollarization of the country has strongly decreased as the growth of Peru is more solid and stable, and this is well recognized by Peruvians. For example, between 2003 and 2005, 70% of the credit of the finance sector was in dollars. Today, the figure is just 40%. Around 3% to 5% of that figure comes from foreign exchange, which is denominated in dollars, and a large percentage of that 40% derives from automotive credits. Therefore, the direct impact on people is very low. We are rapidly advancing toward being an economy based only in soles. The foreign exchange impact on Peruvian businesses is rather low; therefore, so too, is its impact on our activities. Peru and the sol have all the qualities to become one of the lowest devaluation currencies in the entire region, and well below the average. On top of that, the measures of the Central Bank help to control volatility, while the positive economic trends in key sectors such as mining, agriculture and fishery give rise to positive sentiment.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What differentiates DIRECTV from other operators in Ecuador?</h4><p>We are a peer television operator focused exclusively on our TV business. Other operators usually have paid TV, fixed lines, and internet components. They have three businesses they can bundle. We have one business, and therefore have to be good at technology, service, and content.</p><h4>How does Ecuadorian television compare to other countries in the region?</h4><p>The most notable difference between Ecuador and other countries in Latin America when we arrived in 2008 was that penetration was in the low teens; today, it is at 26 to 27%. Several markets in Latin America have penetration rates in excess of 50%, with Argentina at around 70%. Ecuador's low penetration in itself is one of the key factors underpinning future growth potential. If you have a market with low penetration there is local cable network with limited coverage. When we entered the market national coverage and satellite service enabled us to offer our service nationwide, which enabled rapid growth. We followed this up with our prepaid service to homes, thereby delivering connection to those households who would not have afforded a postpaid TV service. We focus on content, which makes us a good option, even if not the cheapest in the market.</p><div class="quote">“The market has been reactivated and competition is tougher, which is entirely characteristic of a market seeing rapid growth."</div><h4>Does DIRECTV have plans to expand into broadband internet?</h4><p>We have done so in other countries, such as Colombia, Argentina, and Venezuela. We are examining options in Ecuador, but currently there is no available spectrum. It would have to be a wireless solution because then we could provide better coverage for remoter customers. It makes sense if you are delivering content via streaming to have an alternative option for your customers.</p><h4>DIRECTV has recently signed an agreement with Spanish company Atresmedia to add the Atres Series TV channel to its operations. Are you currently looking for similar agreements?</h4><p>Atresmedia has been examining the possibility for distribution and content. Ultimately, we both achieved what we set out to do. We have signed similar agreements with HOLA TV, SUNDANCE channel, and with other channels interested in penetrating the Latin American market, and which required the right distribution. Partnering with DIRECTV provides an excellent regional footprint, and we have achieved the same arrangement in 2015 with the Formula 1 Channel. We are always looking for content, which ultimately is one of the few differentiators beyond service and technology and, at the end of the day, precisely what customers pay for.</p><h4>Apart from content what innovations have you implemented this past year?</h4><p>We have focused on delivering content beyond the home, enabling the streaming of our and our providers' content. We have original content focused on delivering sports on our own channels. In 2015 we are also heavily focused on the DIRECTV Play App as in 2014. We have also had considerable success with the World Cup app, through which our subscribers could watch games, access statistics, and view replays. Many providers have their own platform, and ours enables us to combine, such that the customer can access all content on just one app. This is a simple way to deliver all content on computer, smartphone, or tablet. Last year, we changed the interface of our setup boxes, rendering it simpler, more user-friendly, and with all content delivered in HD.</p><h4>What are DIRECTV's prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>We need to maintain our focus on content, which can only be achieved through agreements with programmers, and again, by providing the customer with different means of watching it. We have to strengthen what we have been doing in the past, especially in streaming and out-of-home experience. We forecast double-digit growth, again despite an ever more difficult market.</p><h4>What is your short-term outlook for the market?</h4><p>The market has been reactivated and competition is tougher, which is entirely characteristic of a market seeing rapid growth. We are one of five satellite operators today, which means that other competitors have the same nationwide coverage. We have faced some economic difficulties, but have adapted, and our service provides a good family option for entertainment. We have adapted our offer and opened greater options for our prepaid customers, who are demanding more, such as additional receivers for their homes for a second or third television.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you identify as the key factors that make Malaysia an attractive destination for foreign investors?</h4><p>Firstly let us consider the ease of doing business in Malaysia. The infrastructure is well developed. We started with the manufacturing sector about 40-50 years ago, and over the years we have invested a lot in physical infrastructure such as ports, roads, and telecommunications because connectivity is very important. You need to have all this in place so that the companies that manufacture goods will have easy access to the markets from Malaysia. Number two is education in Malaysia. English is taught from standard one, so communication for international companies doing business in Malaysia is very easy. You will not find any difficulty travelling anywhere in the country; people will understand you. Another is political stability—our government is a parliamentary democracy. The rule of law is based on British common law, so that is another great advantage. That is the base upon which this country is founded. The government has introduced many initiatives, such as the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) and Government Transformation Programme (GTP). Even the collaboration between the government and the private sector makes the ease of business meaningful. The private sector and government work together and analyze what helps businesses to grow. Those are a few areas we can highlight. Of course, the location is also vital. The strategy in this region, with Malaysia chairing ASEAN 2015, is to move us to the next level. Within ASEAN, we are already a free trade area. Malaysia has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with many countries. The framework is already in place. Market access from Malaysia is easy with all this in place.</p><h4>To what do you attribute Malaysia's continued success?</h4><p>We want to continue to grow by strengthening the business environment, and improving the atmosphere for business. We are introducing new policies and fine-tuning old policies so that things will get better. Moving forward, to be competitive, we feel that we have to move up the value chain. Malaysia started as an agriculture-based economy, but over the years we have become more knowledge based with more R&amp;D activities in the manufacturing sector. Any economy can not be too dependent on manufacturing or one specific area, so we have also been mandated to promote the services sector as well which, among other sectors, includes healthcare, tourism, ICT, and many more.</p><div class="quote">“Over the years, we have been doing business with many countries."</div><h4>What are you doing to boost domestic investments?</h4><p>Domestic and foreign investments co-exist. We are giving equal emphasis to both of them because we want to strengthen the eco-system, not only the supply chain but also the infrastructure, rules and regulations, trade agreements, investment agreements, and so forth. A strong supply chain is also important as you need to have strong domestic supporting industries for foreign investment to come. If they want to make goods, Malaysia has many supporting industries that can help them manufacture.</p><h4>How will increased integration between ASEAN nations make Malaysia and the region more attractive for investors?</h4><p>Over the years, we have been doing business with many countries. We have about 8,000 multinational or foreign companies doing business in Malaysia. We cannot be alone. That's why we need each other in ASEAN. Moving forward, I think Malaysia and the rest of ASEAN need to invest in each other to increase trade and linkages. The ecosystem is within Malaysia, but you can extend it to ASEAN to make it more vibrant and access more opportunities. If investors are already in Malaysia, they can invest in ASEAN, and vice versa. We have a lot of intra-ASEAN activities, so it will be more exciting. Each country has its own competitive advantage. I believe ASEAN has its own competitive advantages as well. Businessmen will look for opportunities everywhere. If there is competition, that is good, but Malaysia has its own strengths and there are a lot of opportunities behind that strength.</p><h4>Can you give us examples of some public—private partnerships (PPPs) here?</h4><p>Many years ago, Malaysia introduced a privatized infrastructure projects. For example, look at our highways. You can see how Malaysia has transformed. Our government provided the facilitation and the private sector played its role by investing in and operating the highways. Now people can travel and businesses can send goods all over the country. It's the same with other infrastructure like ports and so on. It has transformed Malaysia tremendously. We are on the right track.</p><h4>In terms of the Domestic Investment Strategic Fund, what has been achieved so far?</h4><p>We are doing well in that area. It is designed to encourage Malaysian companies to acquire new technology and venture into R&amp;D, acquiring new skills for their operations and providing capacity building. We started this a few years ago and we are seeing some results in their abilities to service multinationals. Once you have the capacity and know-how to bring your advantages to the next few levels, then you will attract interest from multinationals.</p><h4>What are MIDA's priorities between now and 2020?</h4><p>We will continue what we are doing, but perhaps encouraging more R&amp;D activities. Our priorities will be looking at getting more quality investments to come to Malaysia, meaning those investments with knowledge, technology, and R&amp;D components. Of course, we also emphasize the services sector. There is a lot of room for growth there because manufacturing is already quite developed in Malaysia, so you need a strong services sector to support that. There are many opportunities in ASEAN that many companies can tap into, leveraging on Malaysia because the cost of doing business here is much more competitive compared to Singapore, and the ease of doing business is good.</p><h4>What is your vision for post 2020?</h4><p>The long-term plan is still there. Beyond 2020 in general, Malaysia wants to be a developed country and we want to encourage inclusive economic development within the country, expanding activities to all regions as well as increasing our per capita income to a higher level. That will be the direction we move in. We have the 11th Malaysia Plan, an aerospace plan, a shipbuilding plan, and many others. This will keep us on track so that we can move to the next level.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mexico has a skilled workforce. To what degree has that been a factor in Bombardier's success story in Mexico?</h4><p>Our workforce in Mexico has proven to be extremely effective and efficient, and we have the best welders in the world. They are trained at our welding school in our Bombardier Transportation site in Sahagún City, where we can weld any type of metal, which is extremely important in the heavy transportation industry. The young people training and working at our Bombardier Aerospace site in Querétaro are around 25-26 years old and are highly committed. They are embracing the craftsmanship that making plane parts requires. We are amongst the most competitive anywhere in the world. In both cases, we have been through the process of training human resources. This has attracted other companies, not only in the aerospace industry, but also in the rail transport sector.</p><h4>In 2014, Bombardier made some readjustments, and has created a new aero structure line and engineering division in Querétaro. What can you tell us about these plans?</h4><p>We formerly had two large divisions: Bombardier Transportation with headquarters in Berlin, and Bombardier Aerospace with headquarters in Montreal. The latter was split into three businesses, one of them being Bombardier Aerostrucures and Engineering Services, which will take residence at the Querétaro plant. The new division will generate fresh business opportunities and revenues, while continuing to contribute to the success of Bombardier in current production and development programs. This transformation brings competitiveness to our manufacturing strategy, whereby Mexico becomes a key location. We have to be extremely aggressive in order to sell our capabilities inside of our house and to bring new work packages for us and other companies. We are receiving the support of the Mexican government to further develop this.</p><h4>What role will you play in the plan to renew trains in Mexico City?</h4><p>In the rail sector, Bombardier is well positioned to meet the needs of all types of projects, as we are the only rail manufacturer in Mexico to operate an advanced facility with both integrated engineering and manufacturing capabilities. Bombardier also builds signalling systems. We have participated in some of the early stages of the infrastructure plan, and are following it closely. The Querétaro-Mexico City high-speed train has been suspended indefinitely and the Transpeninsular, another train earmarked for construction, has been cancelled. This does not leave a wide margin for the federal and national infrastructure plan. With the current financial climate, we have to see what the government decides. On the other hand, Mexico City's metro has officially announced the renewal of certain lines, such as Line 1. We are already working hard on it in order to present the best product. About 70% of the rolling stock in Mexico City is a Bombardier product. We want to keep our presence in our natural market and are working on an interesting offer in light of the competition.</p><h4>Since 1992 Bombardier Transportation has invested around $200 million in Mexico. What are some of your recent investments?</h4><p>Every year, we invest according to the work packages that we can bring to Mexico. Last year, we decided on a capex investment of about $2 million in our Sahagún City facilities. We invest between $2-10 million annually in the renovation of our site, particularly in technology, and especially laser machines and state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment. This means that we have the best capabilities in the sector here in Mexico in terms of aluminium, stainless steel, black steel, gluing, and welding.</p><div class="quote">“In the rail sector, Bombardier is well positioned to meet the needs of all types of projects."</div><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>TBY talks to Michelle Bachelet, President of Chile, on regional relations and ties with Colombia.</p>
<h4>What is Chile’s position on the convergence of Mercosur and the Pacific Alliance (PA) trading communities? What are the next practical steps for maximizing the process?</h4>
<p>In the process of regional integration in Latin America, Chile has emphasized "convergence in diversity." Today’s world is more complex, and cooperation and integration are unavoidable if progress is to result by successfully addressing the challenges of the global economy. Therefore, Chile will encourage the exchange of ideas between the PA and Mercosur. A specific step in this proposal of convergence was the realization of the “Dialogue on Regional Integration: Pacific Alliance and Mercosur“ seminar, held in Santiago in November 2014. The next step was to prepare a plan of action for the PA and Mercosur around a common agenda.</p>
<h4>What is Chile’s comparative regional advantage in its relations with the PA?</h4>
<p>The PA represents an opportunity to enhance the exchange and economic development of the countries located along the Pacific. In that space, our contribution is manifold. Chile has an extensive network of trade partners, having generated 24 agreements covering 63 markets. This network is enhanced by the PA and in turn serves to boost member countries. The globalization of the Chilean economy is undoubtedly attractive to our partners. For example, accumulation of origin in the Pacific Alliance will allow Chile to facilitate linkages and productive diversity, improving the position of our region in global value chains. In addition, Chile is an active participant in organizations such as the OECD, where it is recognized for working on good practices and international standards for public policies, and APEC, a regional technical cooperation platform with more than a three-decade relationship with Pacific Rim economies.</p><div class="quote">“The bilateral relations between Chile and Colombia have reached extraordinary levels.“</div>
<h4>What are the main pillars of trade between Chile and Colombia, and in what are areas of industry and trade is Chile is looking to develop further with Colombia in the coming years?</h4>
<p>The bilateral relations between Chile and Colombia have reached extraordinary levels, especially in the economic and commercial fields. To achieve this, the free trade agreement (FTA) signed in 2009 has contributed decisively. This agreement broadened and deepened the subjects of exchange between both countries. Every year, the number of Chilean goods and services exported to Colombia is increasing, as well as the number of companies involved in these operations. And this, incidentally, has allowed a reduction in the traditional deficit in the trade balance we have with that country. We see many areas with a great potential for growth in Colombia, which are interesting to Chile, such as the services sector, including information technology and software, or sectors of the mining and hydrocarbons, infrastructure, and biofuels.</p>
<h4>What diplomatic and economic assistance is Chile offering to Colombia toward the peace process?</h4>
<p>Chile has a tradition of contributing to regional peace, which has motivated us to be a companion country in the Colombian peace process. We have appointed a representative and a deputy representative who have actively participated in this cause. We also want to contribute, together with regional countries, in post-conflict era, especially given our experience in transitional justice; that is to say, the set of policies that were taken after the military regime as reparation for the victims of human rights violations.</p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What procedures are CMC's specialties?</h4><p>CMC is an ultra-modern medical institution affiliated with Johns Hopkins International, fully equipped with the most advanced technology, which is why it has been recognized as one of the top hospitals in the Middle East. CMC was selected from among hospitals across the globe as one of the 30 most technologically advanced hospitals in the world. The services at CMC have been designed around the needs of patients to enhance the quality of care and speed up diagnosis and treatment. We provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient medical services. We are a one-stop care destination—all procedures available at CMC.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of CMC Management's plan to develop an extension to CMC's main building?</h4><p>The expansion is expected to launch at the end of 2016. There will be an increase in the number of beds, operating rooms, outpatient clinics, and an OPD building with 35 new multi-specialty clinics. Moreover, a full-service oncology center with radiotherapy will provide multidisciplinary and comprehensive care to patients, both local and international. A hemodialysis unit will cater to the needs of patients suffering from kidney failure. Also, a floor will be dedicated to a psychiatric ward especially built and furnished to suit patients' needs.</p><div class="quote">“CMC is an ultra-modern medical institution affiliated with Johns Hopkins International."</div><h4>How does the Da Vinci surgical system allow surgeons to better conduct operations, and what is the importance of being the only hospital in the region with this technology?</h4><p>The introduction of robotic surgery at CMC is a landmark in the history of medicine in Lebanon and the region. This new technology positions our hospital at the forefront of cutting-edge procedures, and shows our willingness to make the investment to ensure our patients receive top-notch services. This innovative technology allows us to perform more complex procedures with a minimally invasive approach than surgeons were able to prior to this era. This unique medical technology replaces the traditional approaches to treating diseases. Robotic surgery has now changed patient care and established itself as one of the most important and promising breakthroughs in medical innovation. The advantages of this procedure include less pain, improved cosmesis, less blood loss, and a shorter hospital stay.</p><h4>How would you assess Lebanon's potential to become a medical hub in the region?</h4><p>Lebanon as a country is a sought-after touristic destination in itself. Medically speaking, Lebanon provides patients with the most advanced medical treatments and technology. In addition, Lebanese doctors come with exceptional education and degrees from the US and Europe, becoming leading doctors in Lebanon and some even on an international level. For instance, here at CMC, we get patients from all surrounding Arab countries. Even the Lebanese who live abroad in Middle East, Europe, and Africa chose to come back to Lebanon for medical attention, which speaks volumes on its own. Moreover, Lebanon has accredited hospitals; in fact, CMC just received its third consecutive JCI accreditation and the surveyors were so impressed with the level of care that they asked our permission to use our best practice guidelines as recommendations for other hospitals that they visit. At CMC we offer international standards of care and the latest developments in healthcare at a good price. A multilingual staff is available to coordinate all aspects of a patient's stay. Moreover, with our Johns Hopkins affiliation, patients have the option to seek Medical Second Opinion with Johns Hopkins doctors.</p><h4>What other strategies and initiatives are being implemented to promote Lebanon as a medical destination?</h4><p>CMC attends and participates in the largest international conferences and exhibitions in order to promote CMC and Lebanon. For instance, we participate annually in the Arab Health Exhibition, IMTEC, Med Health, Hospital Build, Iraq Medicare, Medica, World Health Medical Tourism, Global Healthcare Conference, Hospital Design and Infrastructure, and many more. Regarding private-public collaborations, we participate yearly in the Arabian Travel Market in collaboration with the Lebanese Ministry of Tourism. In addition, we hold events at CMC mainly in coordination with Johns Hopkins International and we have also worked with educational institutions. These events include a cardiology symposium, women's health symposium, anesthesia workshop, robotic surgery symposium, Orthopedic Video Conference with JHI, and cancer care forum, while in May we will be hosting the first Spine Summit.</p><h4>What are CMC's regional ambitions?</h4><p>Operating within a globalized world and with new healthcare trends continuously emerging, Clemenceau Medicine International (CMI), responsible for the advancement and spread of the Clemenceau Medicine's mission of patient care regionally and internationally, recognizes the importance of adopting and implementing the latest developments in the dynamic healthcare markets of the MENA region. With CMC's years of operating experience and affiliation with world-renowned institutions, Johns Hopkins Medicine International and JCI's consecutive accreditations, CMI's technical expertise and know-how ensure the development of modern institutions in accordance with the highest international quality standards. Being part of the Clemenceau Medicine Network warrants all members of the network to benefit from the skills and technical expertise of qualified physicians, nurses, and administrative staff, which in turn enables knowledge transfer and continuous communication and information sharing facilitated by advanced technological platforms. The CMI team consists of professionals with many years of experience in all aspects of healthcare whose main target is to plan, design, build, equip, and operate the most state-of-the-art healthcare institutions in the region. The Clemenceau Medicine concept revolves around the provision of a “continuum of care," starting with early diagnosis and ending with home care, to regional and international patients. The projects under construction abroad are a 200-bed medical center in Amman, Jordan in Al Abdali district, and a 200-bed medical center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Other projects are in the planning process for Cairo, the UAE, and Tunisia.</p><h4>How do you envision CMC advancing in the long term, and what are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>CMC will continue to expand by building a network of CMC-affiliated hospitals in the region. In addition, CMC will keep advancing its healthcare services to assure that our patients receive the most up-to-date medical procedures and services. Specifically speaking, in 2016 we will be busy with the official opening of the CMC extension and the medical centers in Jordan and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Cano Jiménez is composed of three companies: CANO JIMENEZ ESTUDIOS, OCEISA, and PROMOBILY. What market conditions led to the creation of each group?</h4><p>Cano Jiménez is a family-owned group of companies. The company was founded in 1983, and was initially focused on road infrastructure, consulting, and transportation, as well as the construction of housing projects. As we developed and grew within the sector, we moved into other lines of business directed toward creating groups that promote road infrastructure concessions. At the time we deemed it necessary to partition the companies to promote specialization in specific areas. It also separated and mitigated the risks in each sector. Consultancy, design, and construction supervision have certain associated risks. Construction has different risks and real estate, of course, has different visions. As we defined the different lines of business, we realized that they needed to be under the direction of a corporate group that provides services to the three companies. So nowadays, we are operating with a completely independent operational structure in each line of business, but behind which is a corporate group that leads the general strategy and provides all three companies with services such as human resources, accounting, financial, commercial promotion, and legal support. The three companies today are CANO JIMENEZ ESTUDIOS, which handles consultancy, OCEISA, which is in charge of infrastructure, and PROMOBILY in real estate.</p><h4>What are the key infrastructural and development projects you are working on today?</h4><p>CANO JIMENEZ ESTUDIOS has participated in a number of large concessions. Today, the greatest achievement is the design of the first metro line for Bogotá. Regarding infrastructure, the use of trenchless technology is a major step. With OCEISA we finished a storm drainage system project a couple years ago in the Fontibon, an area of Bogotá close to the El Dorado airport, which flooded every winter because there was no drainage. In this densely populated area, we installed 68km of piping without disturbing the roads, with the trenchless method. We carried out a reinforcement of the main water pipe for Bogotá and Tibitoc with interior limestone and metallic tubes. Our project in Fontibon was the largest for OCEISA, alongside the reinforcement of the main water pipe for Bogotá. For PROMOBILY, the biggest projects are in Cedritos, namely BOTANIKA AQUA and BOTANIKA TELUS, where we are building 341 apartments. Another BOTANIKA building will have 46 apartments, and we are planning to start sales and production shortly.</p><div class="quote">“Our business strategies include our presence in Peru, Panama, and in Central America within the next few years. "</div><h4>What has been your role in the Bogotá metro process advanced engineering process, and what is your perspective regarding the development of the project?</h4><p>Our participation in the consortium that developed the Bogotá metro, which included two Spanish companies IDOM and Euroestudios, was granted due to overall experience. Euroestudios is a general engineering company and IDOM is an entity with a long history of working with train and subway technological systems, while we are a general Colombian engineering company with experience in local systems, such as the research of public utilities and traffic management. Our input in the consortium, which corresponded to one-third of the project, was mainly about field research and local support. The other two companies contributed with their specialized technology in railways, regarding security, evacuation, and so forth. Even though that was our main obligation and contribution, we participated in the whole design process and the transfer of technology. It was paramount for the Colombian engineers involved in the project to learn from it and make it our own. In summary, we participated in all activities related to the project, even though we didn't manage them directly.</p><h4>What are the next steps for the fulfillment of the project?</h4><p>The project has now been completed and handed over to the government. Both the national and local governments are performing the financial evaluations to determine the sources of financing for the construction of the metro in Bogotá. They are performing analysis, which includes scenarios such as construction by stages. Another option is to implement minor changes to the project to allow for a decrease in investment. Government officials, on both the national and local level, are working on this analysis and we are supporting them on adjustments to the designs, depending on final decisions. If they choose to build in stages, we help to determine what those stages include. In the event of a decreased investment amount, we would adjust designs to make them more financially viable. We expect the issue to be resolved within 1H2015 so that the public bidding of the contract for the construction of the first line becomes available in the second semester, with construction subsequently beginning early in 2016.</p><h4>Do you plan to enter international markets within the next year?</h4><p>Yes, our business strategies include our presence in Peru, Panama, and in Central America within the next few years. In the past we entered Costa Rica as a consultancy for a road concession between San Jose and Caldera, located in Pacific Costa Rica. We completed our work last year, and have enjoyed a highly positive experience working internationally.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Prima is one of the country's four private pension funds (AFPs), which have been an engine of growth in Peru for many years now. How has your association with Credicorp given you a competitive advantage?</h4><p>Prima AFP was launched in the market in 2005, and entered the private pension system as the fifth AFP. Prima AFP was launched as an alternative, with a value proposition based on a strong backing by Credicorp, experience in investment management, permanent information and assistance, and an adequate service fee. Along the way, we acquired another AFP, Union Vida, in 2006. Our growth rate increased during the subsequent years, during which time we fought to become the market leader. We achieved that goal in 2010. Being part of Credicorp, the top Peruvian financial group, is an advantage. The group has 126 years of financial experience in Peru. Prima AFP maintains the philosophy of innovation, change, and new products and also the values, solvency, experience, and quality of all of Credicorp's enterprises. Also, the quality of the management team provides a further advantage.</p><h4>What are the system's main challenges?</h4><p>I believe that the system faces three important challenges. First is the need to expand the pension systems' coverage. Our country's informality rates are high. This is a challenge for the Peruvian state, which must formalize the economy through policies, incentives, and benefits that motivate workers and companies to increase formal employment. This will give more Peruvians access to a pension upon retirement. Second is the need for education on the private pension system. There are still many doubts about the roles and benefits of the AFPs. As a point of self-criticism, I would have to say that in the last 22 years the AFPs have not communicated the system's benefits effectively. We need to be more creative and proactive to build trust and satisfaction in our customer base. Thirdly, we need to improve replacement rates, which is the ratio of the pension obtained by the affiliate at the time of retirement divided by the average salary of the last few years of his or her working life. Although this rate is increasing, efforts need to be made to ensure that this ratio follows an upward trend to eventually reach 70% of the average salary.</p><div class="quote">“There is a huge market in Peru for investment in infrastructure in different sectors."</div><h4>What have been, and will be, your preferred strategies for investing in Peru's infrastructure boom in the years to come as the government announces more projects?</h4><p>There is a huge market in Peru for investment in infrastructure in different sectors. According to one of the most recent studies on this matter, Peru's infrastructure gap will exceed $80 billion this decade, which is roughly one-third of estimated GDP. This infrastructure gap speaks with Peru's 105th place out of 144 countries in terms of “quality of overall infrastructure" in the latest WEF Global Competitiveness Index. However, bureaucracy appears to be holding up investment that is needed in order to close the gap. It is important to mention that around 10% of the industry's assets under management are invested in infrastructure, but we would like to increase that percentage. Prima invests in this sector along the entire capital structure of projects and companies, both directly, providing long-term indebtedness, and indirectly through dedicated infrastructure funds. For us, it is very important that the project has a strong business case and well-balanced risk and return profile.</p><h4>Last year, the total returns were around 9% across all AFPs, which is a solid performance. What do you expect from 2015?</h4><p>In 2014, we achieved first place in funds number two and three. It is not true that all of the AFPs have the same return. The difference between the first and the last place is significant. We are always trying to occupy the forefront of the market. It is important to mention that just one percentage point of difference with the average in the long term could affect the pension to the tune of 30%. In 2015, there is a lot of uncertainty in the market. I consider that diversification is going to be the best strategy. We would like to have a foreign investment limit not only of 42%, but of 50%, and in the future 80%. It is important to mention that, during 2014, we took our investment practice to a whole different level, much more aligned with major league players around the globe. Thus, Prima AFP worked on a robust strategic asset allocation (SAA) framework to ensure that portfolios were well rewarded in the long term for every unit of risk taken. As a part of the SAA, we enhanced our investment and risk management teams. In terms of governance, our risk management practice traditionally focused on regulation, and compliance has been better integrated with the investment process while setting a well-rounded risk appetite and budget to ensure prudent risk taking aligned with the investment goals of each fund. Also worth noting is our significant IT investment on risk management, portfolio management, trade execution, and front-to-back integration, among other tools that we believe puts us at the top of our industry not only locally but in the Latam region.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the bilateral relationship between the UAE and Seychelles?</h4><p>The relationship between Seychelles and the UAE, and Abu Dhabi especially, is a beautiful partnership. In September of 2014, we proved the strength of our relations by signing a visa-waiver agreement, making Seychelles the first African country to benefit from visa exemption in the UAE. Apart from that, we have an excellent program of collaboration between our two countries, which is not only characterized as a bilateral relationship, but as a friendship that has evolved over the last 20 years with His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan having a residence in Seychelles and the royal family, including His Highness General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan who comes to the Seychelles regularly for holidays. They have developed a love for the Seychelles and a friendship that is long lasting. As a result, they have been prepared to make tangible manifestations of that friendship through substantial grants to the Republic of Seychelles for the development of our youth and in social sectors, such as housing and healthcare. The economic reforms I launched in 2008 have been successful in opening the way for partnership as an avenue of investment with the UAE, and Abu Dhabi was the first to give us $50 million to boost our reserves. Over the past 10 years alone, the value of projects and grants between Seychelles and Abu Dhabi has amounted to almost $200 million. For a small country like Seychelles, this is huge. You can see the results of their investments all over the country, and they can see that the funds have been judiciously and properly utilized for the development of the country.</p><h4>The Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council has begun preparing the Seychelles Strategic Plan. What does the plan signify for Seychelles and how is it progressing?</h4><p>The Seychelles Strategic Plan will help in the proper planning and development not only of the town itself, but also the surrounding areas, which could turn into plans for the whole island and the whole country. It is a coordinated exercise that aims at creating ownership by the people in the future development of the country. We have meetings with the population and all stakeholders so they can give their views, and also try to maintain a balance with all the different sectors of development, including businesses, residences, national heritage sites, and the different utilities that will be needed over the next 30 to 50 years. It is a comprehensive plan that Abu Dhabi is helping us to develop that will enable Seychelles to ensure its orderly and sustainable development for the future. At the same time, it is a realistic plan, acknowledging what can be done now, and what can be achieved in the future. It is extremely important and useful for the development of the country, and the clean energy component will be incorporated as well. Technicians from Seychelles and Abu Dhabi will further study the plan, develop it, and come back with their suggestions. We have two more scoping exercises to do for the whole project.</p><div class="quote">“The relationship between Seychelles and the UAE, and Abu Dhabi especially, is a beautiful partnership."</div><p>© The Business Year - April 2015<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are KPMG's strategic priorities in Zambia over the next few years?</h4><p>Our strategic objectives revolve around quality, profitability, growth and people development. The strategic priority is to be the best in the market place, focusing on infrastructure, government, construction, power generation, and the more traditional mining and financial services sectors.</p><h4>What is the regional significance of Zambia for KPMG?</h4><p>Zambia is a fast-growing market in several respects, as can be seen by the influx of foreign entities opening businesses here, or entering into strategic alliances and joint ventures with local Zambian companies. KPMG is an international firm serving clients who have a wide African footprint, including in Zambia. It is therefore important that we have a presence in all major and minor economies. As such, the presence of KPMG in Zambia is important to the wider firm, particularly in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region.</p><div class="quote">“Our strategic objectives revolve around quality, profitability, growth and people development."</div><h4>What would you say are the peculiarities of the Zambian market and the most common concerns of a foreign company keen to enter the country?</h4><p>Often companies are concerned about indigenization laws. Currently, Zambia doesn't have any of these with the exception of the Citizens Economic Empowerment Commission requirements, whereby companies that are locally owned, influenced, or managed have a greater chance of doing business with the government. There are also investor-friendly labor laws, and no exchange control provisions. Investors are often interested in the availability of tax incentives, with the Zambia Development Agency incentives available (including up to five years free of corporate taxes, and 10 years at a reduced corporate tax rate) for investors in priority sectors and areas. Zambia also has abundant natural resources, not just in copper, but also in other natural resources. Agriculture in particular is a huge potential growth area with significant amounts of unutilized arable land and large freshwater resources. One area of concern for foreign investors is to ensure that there is stability from a governmental and policy perspective. This has been highlighted with the recent introduction of the new mining tax regime, which has been controversial. However, the new President has publicly indicated his willingness to engage with the mining companies on this, which should help to reassure investors.</p><h4>How would you assess the current level of foreign interest in the country and what needs to be done by both public and private sectors to incentivize and improve the framework for foreign investors?</h4><p>The level of foreign interest in the country is high. As a professional services firm, KPMG has advised several incoming potential investors, and the number is growing. Zambia is renowned regionally for being politically stable, which appeals to investors wishing to invest in the Southern African region. From the public sector, as mentioned above, policy stability is vital, especially in allowing foreign investors to produce reliable financing models. Meanwhile, certain basic services like internet connectivity, and power and water supply should be enhanced. However, having said that, the ease of doing business in Zambia has improved over the years, and the government has been taking steps to improve this, for example, with the creation of the Zambia Development Agency and the One Stop Shops (combining PACRA, ZRA, ZDA offices). The government is also encouraging public-private partnerships, for example with the border posts that have been privately funded, but that will be transferred to public ownership in due course.</p><h4>What regulatory changes are we likely to see in Zambia in the near future?</h4><p>A new Companies Bill has been devised to broaden the duties and responsibilities of directors. Additionally, an Insurance Bill seeks to restrict foreign shareholdings, and will require prior regulatory approval of CEOs, senior personnel, and auditors, although it is unclear whether this particular bill will progress. As mentioned above, the mining tax regime may also change depending on the outcome of the government's discussions with business.</p><h4>How would you describe the role of SMEs in Zambia, and how can KPMG assist the development of a more efficient SMEs structure in the country?</h4><p>SMEs are essential to the Zambian economy, as for any developing economy. There has been an emergence of a significant number of SMEs in Zambia. This is an area of policy focus by the government; the ZDA tries to support SMEs and to encourage joint ventures between local SMEs and foreign investors. The challenge with SMEs is that they are often reluctant to seek professional advice due to the cost implications. KPMG is pleased to assist any SMEs in need of advice.</p><h4>What is the significance of KPMG in the socioeconomic development of the country?</h4><p>KPMG, as a professional services firm, acts as a conduit for investors looking to enter the country. And as a big four firm, it also helps to implement and maintain the highest standards in the professional work we do, increasing transparency and standards of probity nationwide. I believe that the market has recognized our efforts as evidenced by the winning of, amongst others, such awards as Business Auditing Firm of the Year 2014 by Finance Monthly M&amp;A, Auditors of the Year 2014 by ACQ Global Awards, and Adviser of the Year 2015 by Acquisition International. KPMG also has an active CSR policy and looks to support the communities we work in as part of that. We are also active in the Zambia Institute of Chartered Accountants committees such as Taxation, Technical, and Education and Training. We are also key players in both the American and British Chambers of Commerce.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Another election is due in just over a year, which we expect to be hotly contested, but relatively peaceful. In the meantime, we expect greater policy stability from the government, which should hopefully attract more investment into the country. The Zambian economy will continue to grow, and we expect KPMG to grow along with the economy.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[aluminum-shower]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>BHP Billiton has decided to focus on five business lines, and is withdrawing from aluminum. How will this impact the company?</h4><p>In August 2014 BHP Billiton announced its plans to demerge its aluminum, manganese, and nickel and silver businesses along with some of its coal assets.  Subject to Board and shareholder approval, there would be a new company operating these assets under the name of South32, and Mozal will become quite a significant part of it. South32 will operate in five countries and be staffed by approximately 24,000 people. The business will then transition from a commodity-based structure into a regional-based entity, and Mozal will report to the African regional office located in Johannesburg. The new company will have a dedicated board and management team with a significant representation at the Johannesburg office, which will be greatly beneficial for Mozal.</p><h4>According to a recently published KPMG study, Mozal is still the largest company in Mozambique. How would you describe the evolution of Mozal's contribution to GDP?</h4><p>Since the company was established in 2001, Mozal has continued to play a prominent role, contributing around 7% to GDP. We recently won an award from President Guebuza in recognition of this contribution. Currently, Mozal produces just below 570,000 tons per annum of primary aluminum ingot, with production entirely destined for export, mainly to Europe, the primary market for Mozal's metal output.</p><h4>What are your plans to support the domestic use of aluminum?</h4><p>There has been a spiking development in Mozambique's downstream industry. There was no other local market established until the development of Midal. We began delivering to Midal in October 2014 and once they ramp up their operations, we will be delivering 50,000 tons of metal per annum. Businesses can now be established downstream of Midal, creating an increased diversity of products in the downstream industry, while a unique service industry will also develop around Midal. I expect our relationship with Midal to be long term and sustainable for many years to come. The sizeable tonnage of aluminum that company will be receiving from us will be a major catalyst for the downstream industry.</p><h4>How would you categorize the significance of Mozal in other sectors, be it transport, construction, or education?</h4><p>Mozal has played a significant role in infrastructure development, with road-access projects and a new port facility. For example, Mozal imports more than one million tons of alumina per annum through the port, which is then brought to the site by trucks. We also transport the entirety of our final product through the port, which is a considerable contribution to the transport industry. In addition to that, we continue to perform road maintenance even though it was not a part of our initial undertaking. We also direct around $2 million per annum toward our community work, some of which has gone into the construction of schools. To date we have built 9 primary schools, a secondary school,  a technical school and a maintainer-training center.</p><h4>What challenges do you foresee over the next ten years for Mozal?</h4><p>One major challenge will be electricity supply. We have managed to cope with this so far by working closely with ESKOM and focusing on our productivity and operational efficiency to get more out of the available infrastructure. We have made good progress and have implemented a system we call Maximum Technical Capability. The other challenge is with commodity prices. This has been a challenge over the recent period, although Mozal has been effective with regards to cost cutting, as we have been able to focus extensively on efficiency. We also pay considerable attention to skills. All of the potential development in the country and the exploitation of its resources will result in a great need for a skilled workforce, which will present a challenge for the entire industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What methodology does NCSI use in Oman?</h4><p>NCSI was established in 2012 with a board-approved vision to enhance knowledge and build national standards for information gathering in Oman. Our policy makers combined statistics and information into one unit, which are often separate centers, because our task is not only to supply data and statistics, but also to ensure that these are readily transformed into knowledge and information. Statistics are just a part of the process. Our methodology is to first have a network of up to 22 centers. We follow best international practice and standards. Oman is a part of many teams in the world, including the UN Statistics Division (UNSD), which oversees statistics worldwide.</p><h4>How does Oman's statistics center compare to the rest of the GCC?</h4><p>We have created our own statistics center in Oman, and follow the same standards as the GCC, that is to say, international standards. We are running the same program as the GCC's, and work in tandem. We believe that statistics need to meet these exacting standards to avoid gaps in information delivered to policy makers.</p><div class="quote">“According to our information, 2015 has already been a major challenge."</div><h4>How is NCSI using smart applications to provide social and economic indicators, and what is the importance of the census in Oman?</h4><p>One of our policies concerns the public right to information, and from this view we open channels for people to gain access to it. One of those channels is our website, and we are now improving our portal, both in Arabic and English. We have also created three mobile applications. NCSI Oman provides social economic indicators; NCSI GEO is more detailed and geographic, while Tour Oman is more tourism oriented. This is more of a service that we provide than pure information. We also maintain a presence in social media. We plan to conduct an e-census in 2020 to replace the traditional version, as innovation is essential.</p><h4>How is NCSI able to reach a wider audience in Oman and what media are being utilized?</h4><p>We have moved into many channels because each has its own audience. Most young people actively use social media, and our people respond directly to them. At least twice a week in Oman you can find information in most Arabic and English newspapers, and we provide televised updates. Our new portal reaches many young people, and we have also signed a MoU with Qaboos University to leverage its research, while also training its students. Indeed, we have been signing numerous MoUs, nationally and internationally, to encourage the fruitful exchange of experience. The UN has made a major call for big data, and Oman is leading a mobile task team.</p><h4>To what extent do you coordinate with other Omani government agencies and the private sector?</h4><p>NCSI, by royal decree, coordinates with all other government agencies. The data flows from them to us, and we return it for specific use. NCSI is responsible for all economic and social information. Dissemination of information is helping to improve the level of transparency in the government. People have a right to access information and measure the progress of our country. We want to ensure effective communication and act as a link between the government and the private sector. Indeed, one of our board members is from the private sector.</p><h4>What has been the effect of the drop in oil prices?</h4><p>According to our information, 2015 has already been a major challenge. Our economy is heavily dependent on oil and gas prices. We assist in decision-making, but we are not actually making the decisions; rather, our information assists decision-makers to better appraise alternative scenarios.</p><h4>What trends are occurring this year, and what are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Last year's GDP to September saw growth of around 5%, but it is still too early to forecast what might change. In March Oman, along with the Netherlands and Italy, was one of three countries selected to share its vision on big data. This was our latest statistic commission, and one that confirms Oman's significant international role. We are working to establish Oman as a national center to provide all data and information, and are creating a smart government with a national data warehouse. Information is power, and we can see where the opportunities lie.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the unique role that King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) plays in the healthcare sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>KFMC started life as a tertiary care organization under the umbrella of the Ministry of Health. The idea behind its establishment was to serve tertiary care patients in Saudi Arabia. We cover the core medical care competencies including, but not limited to, cancer therapy and the treatment of neurological, cardiac, and endocrine diseases, among many others. We evaluated Ministry of Health statistics on the incidence and providence of diseases and the limited tertiary care services in Saudi Arabia in order to determine our specializations. Specialties were chosen based on demands not covered by other tertiary care organization like King Faisal Specialist Hospital, military hospitals, and the National Guard hospitals to avoid duplication of services. KFMC helps take care of the needs of those patients who are not otherwise covered by healthcare on a tertiary care level. It receives referrals from all over the country, which are filtered through a medical committee that determines what needs treatment at KFMC, and what can be treated at a local facility. Through this process the patient receives a continuum of care once they return to their local hospital.</p><h4>How is KFMC investing to expand the capacity of the medical city?</h4><p>In 2004 the current complex was inaugurated, and started out by serving a mixture of secondary and tertiary care. In 2005 and 2006 our healthcare studies revealed the need to expand by 40%. Accordingly, we are expanding from 1,200 beds to 2,000 beds—ongoing construction is part of that plan—and we will be able to deliver service as a 2,000 bed tertiary care facility by 2017. This expansion was based on the population demographics of Riyadh region and the care needs of the kingdom. We are now making attempts to expand our scholarship programs in order to provide more healthcare training for our workforce. We are developing local training programs in every specialty within the medical city. On the administrative side we have begun Master's degree programs in healthcare administration in collaboration with international universities, such as Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Minnesota. In the first program we had 17 candidates, followed by 25 in the second, and this year our goal is to graduate 35 candidates. We are also developing a Master's degree program in research with 25 seats and, in collaboration with a university in the UK, a degree program in Medical Education.</p><div class="quote">“One of the obstacles KFMC has to overcome is the recruitment of the appropriate workforce."</div><h4>Is there a specific Saudization target that KFMC is working to achieve?</h4><p>The difficulties we have with Saudization have to do with particular areas of the profession like nursing. At this point our target is to reach 30% Saudization by 2020. We are developing scholarships to give our young people opportunities in nursing education and training, and hope to send 100 students a year to international universities. These scholarships would be completely funded through KFMC. Upon return graduates would have a job at the medical city that they would be obligated to fulfill for a period of years matching the educational scholarship KFMC provided. It is an ambitious plan that we have been working on for the past five years. Outside of nursing, we stand at about 55% Saudization of Medical jobs &amp; more than 90% in administrative jobs in the medical city.</p><h4>What obstacles does the KFMC face operating within Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>One of the obstacles KFMC has to overcome is the recruitment of the appropriate workforce. It has proven difficult to attract employees of the right caliber. This was foreseen 10 years ago, whereupon we began working on scholarship development for the local workforce. The other difficulty we face today is a lack of measurement of productivity. There are no set standards for physicians and nurses; every hospital has its own measures of performance. Consequently, in creating our own set of standards, we have turned to a consultancy firm to help develop our performance measurement scale. With this information we can gauge our own productivity, see where we stand in comparison to other establishments, and identify areas for development in our workforce. We have a highly talented workforce today, but do need to quantify their performance in terms of quality and quantity. We require a combination of quality and quantity to ensure proper productivity.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mexican exports increased by 5% since the previous year. How has NYK Line contributed to that growth?</h4><p>NYK has had a lot of participation in the west coast and Pacific area recently. We have some business in the east coast as well, but the majority is on the west coast and connecting the Asian countries and Australia. NYK Mexico coordinates all of the imports and exports for Mexico and Central America, and our participation in this region is very important. NYK's operations in this region are particularly relevant in terms of the import business from Los Angeles all the way to Costa Rica. We offer our customers many interesting services on a weekly basis for both imports and exports. Last year was very interesting for us in regards to automotive industry development. We participated in the construction of the new plants in Mexico. We first brought the equipment to the factories, and then we also brought in the raw materials to set up the factory. That was all a part of our container business, and we are still supporting them. We are also participating with them in the railroad segment of our business with the cars they will export to the rest of Central America as well as the west and east coasts of the US.</p><h4>How important is the automotive industry for your business in Mexico?</h4><p>In terms of the automotive cargo business, we are currently one of the leaders. Finished cars represent nearly 25% of the total volume that we are importing and exporting, and this is growing. It is expected that Mexico will manufacture about 5 million cars by 2020, thus this sector will continue being one of the most important ones for our operations in Mexico.</p><h4>The government is planning on private companies spending $600 billion between 2015 and 2018 to improve the infrastructure for the country. How could that benefit your business?</h4><p>For ports, it will be very beneficial for us. The main investment they are going to make is in Veracruz. Lazaro Cardenas is pretty much set, and Manzanillo will have some minor improvements. The improvements in Veracruz will help a lot with our industry. In addition to that, I think that there are some major improvements still to be made. Roads and ports are both very important in different ways. If you have a good port but not good roads and vice-versa then you will see a lot of constraints. Our government has invested a lot in roads in previous years, and it has helped to speed up how we do things and moving products. There are many industries like the automotive and electronic industries that rely on fast transportation. We are now receiving products manufactured in central Mexico and are delivering them to the US, Central and South America, or even back to Asia and Europe. This type of connection will help us bring factories in order to deliver to various markets. We want to become a major hub here, and the beginnings of that are evident now. There are big assembly plants in Mexico, but there are a lot of other industries that are smaller and looking to set themselves up for better export success. Being in the center of the country with access to both seas and the north will prove crucial to the success of the main markets of Mexico.</p><h4>What is the importance that Mexico for NYK's global portfolio?</h4><p>Mexico is going to have interesting growth levels in terms of GDP in the following years, with growth between 1.5 and 2% each year in our GDP, and we will be looking at something closer to 3-4% in the following year. Despite what happened last year with the automotive industry we still grew 2.1%. That industry was only part of the year, and now we will have productions for a full year, and it will give us something more to compare to.</p><h4>Why should a company entering the market in Mexico choose NYK Line over your competitors?</h4><p>Our service level and knowledge of the market it far superior to that of our competitors. We are the future of modern shipping because of the company that we have now. We are constantly evaluating our services and looking at how we can help our customers. We help to design logistics solutions for them in order to bring their products to the markets faster than others. We are working with our customers to reach their goals.</p><h4>This year you were chosen as one of the best companies to work for in Mexico. What steps have been taken to obtain such recognition?</h4><p>The key point is that we acknowledge that our company is ultimately founded on people, and we need to be people wise. We are all part of the body of people who are working here, and we try to develop things to help our people with training for their job and grow as a person. We want them to develop in their families. We are constantly working closely with our people to offer better solutions. When we hire someone, we recognize that it is more than two hands. They have a head and brain that can bring to us a lot of new ideas, and we want to give them the opportunity to do so for our organization.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[How About This]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[how-about-this]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>INCEIF is known as the Global University of Islamic Finance. When did the need for a university dedicated solely to Islamic Finance arise?</h4><p>It began 12-15 years ago. I was a practitioner then, both as a partner at Deloitte and then when I set up an Islamic bank here in 2005. There was an increasing recognition from about 2000 onwards, and that intensified from 2003 to 2005. So we had Kuwait Finance House, Asian Finance Bank, and Al Rajhi Bank all come into the market. This put pressure on the supply of human capital, and the people with money tended to get the best players. That also began to expose a shortage of quality supply in the marketplace, because international players were coming in and offering higher salaries. The market was expanding—there were huge growth rates and people were starting to see that this was a real trend. The Central Bank under Governor Tan Sri Dr. Zeti's leadership started taking charge of the situation and addressed this through a number of policies. One of these policies is that if you poach staff from another bank you had to pay six months of their salary into a staff-training fund. That created a pool of funds for education and training. The second move was to create INCEIF. The idea behind this center was to address the medium- to long-term development of industry-ready human resources that would move through quickly to senior positions. INCEIF was founded and help was sought from the industry—not just financial help, but from experts to help formulate the courses. A recent Thompson-Reuters report published in December last year on the Islamic economy indicated that as far as Islamic finance education, 11% of the world's accredited and referenced output in research came from our center and the International Sharia Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA). We also offer executive programs.</p><h4>Besides personnel shortages, what other challenges need to be overcome in order for Islamic finance to compete with conventional banking?</h4><p>The shortage of talent is one thing, but it's also a case of having the right talent to fit market needs. There needs to be closer alignment between academia, the industry, and aspiring students. I think we are doing reasonably well with this at INCEIF, but we need to improve. Regarding other challenges for Islamic finance, my preferred answer is called the EPL theory: Education, Perception, and Liquidity. To outline a few examples of this theory's relevance: if you do not have education—professional, or financial inclusion, or literacy education at a primary level—you do not empower people professionally. You need to educate people for what the market needs. In terms of Islamic finance, if somebody asks “What is Islamic finance?" I think the answer is, “It is about the efficient and effective mobilization of capital for the benefit of the real economy." This defines it completely. It may surprise you to know that in the US every year $33 trillion is churned in the capital markets. That is 10 times the size of global Islamic finance. One can ask how much of that $33 trillion goes into the US's real economy; in other words into creating jobs, buildings and making things, and creating substantial underlying assets? It is less than 1%. 99.2% goes into the financial economy. We look to create a balance that both addresses market needs, and the needs of the wider economy.</p><h4>What role can Malaysia play in exporting Islamic finance abroad and how do you assess its potential to become the Islamic finance capital of the world?</h4><p>Malaysia is already exporting Islamic finance. Malaysia has built up a robust infrastructure supporting Islamic finance. The British and US governments have expressed interest in our work, and have researched our contributions thoroughly. Several key elements are necessary for successful Islamic finance: a sharia and legal framework; a tax framework; an accounting framework; a regulatory framework that addresses money market, liquidity management, and so on; and a standards framework—standards around professional education in Islamic finance, standards for documentation and so forth. The Thomson-Reuters report places Malaysia 50% ahead of the next competitor as a global Islamic finance center. So Malaysia is clearly becoming the Islamic finance capital of the world, but we should not necessarily overemphasize this idea of being the biggest. I am more concerned about the quality of the work and the way you influence it. We see to encourage quality and this is our focus.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the industry?</h4><p>The message is clear: Islamic finance is here to stay, but we need to not simply develop it expand, but to lead people to understand that it is a viable alternative to conventional finance. This concept has some traction, now much more than 10 years ago, but we still have a good deal of work to do to convey confidently that this is a realistic alternative that the market needs.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have UniBank's major milestones been since its creation three years ago?</h4><p>In our three years of operation, UniBank has exceeded $400 million in assets, achieved an excellent position in the Panamanian market, and become well-known in corporate, consumer, and private banking. We have increased our share of the sector thanks to healthy, sustainable growth. We are one of Panama's boutique banks, and our aim is to become the most important player in this segment. Moreover, UniBank has managed to achieve sound levels of liquidity, delinquency, and capital adequacy, which are significantly higher than the average levels in the sector.</p><h4><br>What is the philosophy behind the creation of the bank?</h4><p>Our strategy is not based on extensively growing our branches. Instead, we use a customer-targeted strategy, where we work to find out which products our customers need, and make those products available in a quick and competitive way. We intend to keep being particularly active in the business of corporate and private banking. Our philosophy is to support our customers in adding value to, and growing their businesses, and thereby obtain and keep their trust. As part of Panama's financial system, UniBank has to make equity flows generate value for our customers, and continue to offer financial solutions that contribute to that growth. Since our inception, we have taken a responsible role regarding the poorest communities in our country and we have promoted social development as part of our strategy and management style.<br> </p><h4>Given that 86% of UniBank's business is located in Panama City, and 14% in Colón, how are you promoting your bank's international dimensions?</h4><p>We live in a globalized world, and to develop a fully integrated business, it is necessary for UniBank to diversify its markets and risks, and take up business opportunities where a competitive advantage exists for the company. The bank has executives with extensive experience in international business. Further, as part of our strategic plan, we are looking into opening representation offices in order to have a presence in some emerging countries. We are currently evaluating different options in terms of countries based on their economic performance, growth opportunities, political and monetary stability, and banking regulations.<br></p><h4>How would you describe your financial performance in 2013 and your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>In 2013, we became the Panamanian bank with the largest percentage growth in terms of assets, deposits, and results, and we were ranked second in terms of loans. As at year-end 2013, UniBank had $393.5 million in assets, which compared to 2012 represents an increase of 30%, and a net income of $1.08 million. We are particularly pleased with our regulatory liquidity levels of 61%, and our capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 20.82%. In fact, 2013 was an exceptional year in terms of percentage growth in income and turnover, way above the average for other financial entities. Within our 2014 strategic plan, important highlights include the acquisition of 50% of a brokerage business, the issuance of commercial marketable securities for $50 million, which have been successfully placed at six months and one year, and also the future opening of a representative office.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the conclusions of the latest OECD review on Panama?</h4><p>We still have to improve some aspects of our sector, mainly related to the rapid implementation of the detention or removal of bearer shares. Apart from that, the Panamanian banking sector has some challenges to face in the future. The main one is to maintain its competitiveness, and it needs to constantly innovate, as well. Panama's banking sector also has to develop a more approachable and culturally integrated approach to its customers, as there is a marked difference here compared to our international banking counterparts. Of course, we have to adapt and prepare for the new Basel III regulations, as well as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) ones, and maintain high standards in our compliance policies and customer knowledge, generally.<br> <br>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ready-to-embark]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate the financial performance of Global Investment Holdings in 2014?</h4><p>We did well because we expanded internationally, adding five new international ports to our portfolio and becoming the largest cruise port operator in the world. We also more than doubled our compressed natural gas business, which is now ready to embark on international expansion. We have also sown the seeds of future growth by completing value-enhancing investments in our mining business, which will move us up the value chain.</p><h4>How can Turkey collaborate with a slow EU economy?</h4><p>EU countries will remain Turkey's top international trade and investment partners for decades to come. Despite political ups and downs, the levels of collaboration have steadily increased. In terms of defense, we have been together in NATO for more than 50 years. There are also numerous areas in foreign policy, counter-terrorism, and immigration where Turkey and the EU are consistently cooperating. Over the past decade, Turkey has also adopted many of the standards and best practice criteria in EU legislation known as the acquis communautaire. Yet today, we recognize that there are two major issues. The first is that Turkey's accession negotiations have stalled. And secondly, the EU is in a serious economic crisis, which is in the process of spreading to Turkey. I will leave politics to the policy makers on both sides, but in terms of business I see a strong role for EU-Turkey cooperation, especially during these troubled times. I believe that the EU-Turkey trade relationship can be deepened by including construction services, agricultural products, free trade with third countries (especially with NAFTA), and increased visa-free mobility for Turkish citizens and vehicles into the current Customs Union framework. I see four areas of natural advantage that should be built on. With an advantaged energy supply position, low real interest rates, and a young, productive, and competitive labor force, Turkey can become a base for EU companies to manufacture energy-intensive products. Secondly, Turkey's proximity to the EU and strong logistics fleets also mean our country can expand its role as the flexible and quick top-up producer in the value chain, e.g. for textiles or auto parts. Then, in neighboring developing markets, Turkish companies offer a distinctive product and service mix that can be a real alternative to the EU's often over-engineered and over-priced product/service mix. This offers grounds for EU companies to use Turkey as a launch pad to grow in third countries. Finally, Turkey is on its way to becoming a world-class hub for natural gas and for passenger air traffic. Cooperation here can improve Europe's diversity of energy supply and connections. For Turkey, building on these four distinct competitive advantages by cooperating with EU countries will enable our firms to integrate better with the global economy, gain scale, move up the value chain, and increase the high-tech content of their products. Finally, Turkey has two core areas where its full economic potential is far from being achieved: agriculture and mining. We need to learn from Europe on crop diversity, agricultural efficiency, moving up to agri-industrial products, opening up new markets, health and safety, and growing key talent, to name a few.</p><h4>With demographics changing so rapidly in Turkey, what opportunities does this bring?</h4><p>Turkey is a big country, with a relatively young population. This can be a huge competitive advantage, but as the country ages, in 15 years, we could start facing the problems that most European countries are facing right now. That is why the economic reforms, announced by the Prime Minister, are very important. Before 2002 the Turkish economy was vulnerable, with economic policy makers often reacting to economic crises, rather than acting purposefully and proactively to build a better future. In 2002, with the new economic program and a new majority government, political stability became the norm. With these two crucial anchors in place, Turkey's position at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, with young demographics and a relatively skilled labor force, could become an unbeatable competitive advantage. As a result we could, and I believe will, be the manufacturing hub not only for European, but also Central Asian, Middle Eastern, and African markets. Keeping our workforce educated and motivated to work, as well as a fundamental reform of the pension system in Turkey are especially important in this regard.</p><h4>What is the reason behind the strong interest in Turkey as an investment destination?</h4><p>Turkey is an attractive large market, centrally positioned, with business-friendly legislation, a growing middle-class consumer base, and consistent growth. Yet today, much of the interest also stems from the fact that international investment yields are close to zero, and the loose monetary policies in large OECD countries mean that there is excessive money in the market. This era is fast coming to an end; therefore, the level of interest in Turkey is not likely to remain constant. It is for this reason that I believe we have to succeed in completely reforming our legal system. With that and other reforms announced by the prime minister, there is no doubt in my mind that Turkey will rank as one of the most attractive emerging markets to invest in for the next decade.</p><h4>How do you envision Turkey's economic future?</h4><p>If Turkey can stay on its current course for another decade—and I am confident that it will—the future of the country will be very bright. There will be bumps; there will be major bumps. But for too long the wealth, and decision-making process was in the hands of a select few. Starting in 2002 and onward, we entered an era where the masses were able to voice themselves. The idea of a protest like Gezi Park, which had a profound effect on society with its goods initially and bads later on, happening back in the 1990s was inconceivable. Now, the people have a voice. At the same time I could never imagine a woman with a headscarf attending a public school in the 1990s—new sections of society are able to express themselves now. People complain, but I lived in this country in the 1970s and 1980s and I remember not having a voice. Compared to decades past, Turkey has made great improvements. And frankly, some of the opinions and criticisms that are being voiced here would not even be possible in the Western World—there would be libel suits. I am also pleased and encouraged by the fact that Anatolian cities like Kayseri, Gaziantep, Denizli, Konya, Maraş, Urfa, Rize, Eskişehir, Erzurum, and many more are creating globally competitive companies and strengthening our country, once dominated by the Istanbul metro-line HQ's. I am not just saying this, as we at Global have invested in most of these wonderful cities.</p><p>This interview will be published in 'The Business Year: Turkey 2015'.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your projected growth rate for 2015 is 11% compared to an expected growth rate of 3.6% for the Mexican insurance sector. What is driving that growth?</h4><p>Over the past year, everybody has been talking about the tremendous opportunity of the Mexican market, both in terms of its emerging economy and of the consistent growth of the middle class, which is where life insurance and financial services take hold as an economy evolves and grows. Some companies have conducted terrific research on the inflection point of an industry and where growth really kicks in, which is indexed to GDP growth, and with the subsequent growth of personal and family income. Mexico has been at that point for a while now. Capitalizing on this situation presents the challenge, and the reason we feel comfortable about outperforming the market is based on our expectations, as well as our fundamentals. Firstly, we are financially robust—perhaps the strongest in the life insurance segment in Mexico. The support of New York Life, one of the world's few AAA rated life insurance companies with massive capital strength, gives us the confidence to approach the market from a growth perspective, as does the financial support and commitment of an organization like Seguros Monterrey. Another factor is that this year we celebrate 75 years in the Mexican market. We have strong foundations here, as well as brand recognition, and proven success and reliability. We enjoy long-term relationships with our distributors, partners, agents, brokers, and customers. Through that platform, there are a number of areas where we can grow more aggressively over the next couple of years, particularly starting in 2015. The opportunity to broaden our distribution channel in life insurance and individual life insurance, which is what we specialize in, and which forms the major part of our business, is sold on an individual face-to-face basis by professionally trained life insurance agents. If you look at the opportunity that Mexico offers and the size of the distribution force in the local marketplace, vis-í -vis the US for example, Mexico requires a further 135,000 insurance salespeople. As a result, the market is underserved in terms of services, products, and distribution. The US has a market penetration of 18%, which is still not that high, whereas Mexico has a market penetration of just 2.1%. Therefore, Mexico needs the salespeople, agents, and distributors to increase that figure, which is where our potential lies.</p><h4>You are also planning to establish a real estate company. What opportunities do you see in that business line?</h4><p>Real estate provides certain advantages, one of which is diversification of asset class and investment for our policyholders. We want to ensure that we have attractive and strategic investments on offer. Fixed interest equities, bonds, government bonds, corporate bonds, and property are all logical longer-term investment classes. Establishing a real estate business gives us the opportunity to broaden out our asset class for our policyholders to invest in, allowing us to leverage locations as we continue to expand across Mexico. But more importantly, this is an asset class for our investors. Life insurance companies in most markets have a diversified portfolio, which real estate enables.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the regulatory framework in the Mexican market and competition in the life insurance sector?</h4><p>Ours is quite a sophisticated marketplace. This has been attested to by the introduction of Solvency II into the Mexican marketplace, which from a life insurance perspective is crucial. It means that the lawmakers understand the significant role that financial services play in individual families' lives, and also that life insurance and financial services help build economies. By making the right investments, we will impact both infrastructure and economies. Solvency II brings rigor, compliance, and requirements that now reside on boards, and introduces significant committees with reference to the key parts of the business, particularly in ordered compliance, governance, and the risk of the business. It means that we have a marketplace that is as sophisticated as anywhere else in the world. Mexico speaks the language of insurance, and of compliance, and understands the responsibility we hold and role we play in the community, and as part of the growing economy. The fact that this environment is in place in Mexico means I don't have to work as hard at selling that concept to shareholders, or to a board. It enables us to operate, build, and grow a business the way we need to.</p><div class="quote">“Ours is quite a sophisticated marketplace."</div><h4>What do you expect for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are focused on 11% growth for 2015, which is what we have committed to both publically, and also to the board and management team. The other initiatives I mentioned regarding diversification of distribution, further growing our traditional agency marketplace, and ensuring that we have improved service and telemarketing, will all contribute to achieving it.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How many clients do you have in Colombia today, and have you grown in step with the market?</h4><p>We have around 15 key clients to whom we sell around 70% of our products. The market for asphalt in Colombia rose by 14% from 2013 to 2014. This represents the total amount in the country consumed by the road infrastructure industry, and not only for our company. All of these are Colombian companies, and the only important international contractor we had in was in the second stage of Ruta del Sol, which is managed by Consol and mostly owned by Odebrecht. We also had an important contract for a project with Invias, which was managed by the Spanish company Grupo Azvy of Sevilla. Nowadays, in the fourth generation of concessions, we have international construction partners, such as Constructora Meco from Costa Rica, which has projects in Central America and South America. We also have a business relationship with Grupo OHL, which has numerous projects worldwide, as well as in many infrastructure segments, such as roads and railroads, for example. However, the infrastructure sector in Colombia is mainly comprised of national companies. We are 100% focused on road infrastructure, and do not produce products for other sectors.</p><h4>In what ways does Incoasfaltos offer innovative integral solutions?</h4><p>We accompany the client through all stages of a project, such as the selecting the appropriate type of asphalt at the design stage of the pavement. First, they must decide if they want to use asphalt products, also instead of rigid concrete, which is not our line of business. If they opt for asphalt, we provide assistance in using the appropriate bituminous materials, analyzing their suitability, and determining whether the project is viable with pure asphalt delivered directly from the refinery. This is not usually the case, whereby we offer our asphalt modification services where required. We provide guidance in the design and execution of the solution. Afterwards, we offer the complete package, including asphalt and transportation. Within our package, we also offer training for our clients' personnel. We have a number of modules devised by our specialized staff on the correct use of our products, both in the preparation of the asphalt mixes as well as the construction stage of the road. When we offer integral solutions, we include guidance throughout the process of using asphalt materials.</p><div class="quote">“The market for asphalt in Colombia rose by 14% from 2013 to 2014."</div><h4>Can you tell us about the recent incursion into rubber asphalt manufacturing, the benefits of this product, and your innovative investments in this business line?</h4><p>The modified asphalt recycled rubber (GCR), or rubber asphalt, as we call it in Colombia, includes recycled rubber from old tires mixed into asphalt. The first promoter of these mixes was the district of Bogotá, because in 2011 the environment secretary of Bogotá promoted legislation stipulating stating that all public infrastructure projects include the use of recycled materials, defining two specific lines. The first was the GCR line involving recycled tires, while the second was recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) from milling cutter projects. The projects had a minor impact until last year. We decided to enter in this line of business in 2013, investing in a plant that operates in Mosquera in our existing complex. We incorporated GCR to the asphalt operations in a ratio of 18% of the total weight. This has a twofold benefit. First of all, there are environmental benefits, because tires are non-biodegradable materials if not processed, and experts talk of an 800-1,000 year degrading period. These materials can also be are used in contention walls. I know that Australia has installed barriers for coral reefs using whole tires. However, on a dumping site or a landfill a tire is unlikely to biodegrade. Secondly, the mixes made with recycled rubber particles are superior to conventional asphalt mixes from a structural point of view. They are more expensive naturally; however, the higher cost is reflected in two factors. Firstly, they have higher fatigue indexes, which translates into supporting a much higher number of vehicles on the same design period, meaning more useful years. In Colombia, it is normal to design pavements for 10 years of use, which is a short period of time. The country was mistakenly funding such projects, as from an economic point of view it doesn't make sense to invest for 10 years only to rehabilitate the project. It is preferable to have a slightly higher initial investment with increased lifespan, such as the infrastructures found in Europe and the US where you find pavements of over 50 years, and even perpetual pavements, where efforts are focused on maintaining the superficial state of the road, while the overall structural package translates into a period over 100 years. By using GCR mixes, we are talking about lifespans of over 30 years, which from a financial point of view is considerably more suitable for the local economy. As dynamic tests are performed to determine how many heavy-duty vehicles a pavement can withstand during a certain period of time, fatigue indexes are determined electronically. On the other hand, pavements suffer from permanent deformations called rutting, in roads such as the Troncal de Magdalena, amid conditions of high temperature and heavy truck traffic. GCR mixes are highly resistant to rutting. In summary, therefore, these mixes provide a solution to the disposal of non-degradable materials, while contributing to the construction of long-lasting structures.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which countries do you have a large presence?</h4><p>We have operations in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, and we are going to start in Guatemala in 2014. The business is mainly focused on Central and South America and Venezuela. We also have a business partner in Colombia, and we are trying to develop our business in the Dominican Republic. We also manage one of the main marine lubricant and oil companies, Castrol, and are its representative for all of Central America.</p><h4>How does Meyer's Group contribute to the development of the country?</h4><p>Actually, we started with two tugs and now we have five or six. We did this because there is new technology coming in from Damen, a major shipbuilding company, which offers the ASD range of tug ships. In this way, a new tug can make money more easily than the previous tugs. Usually in the market you see some old tugs and old technology, but with this new technology you can make more money in a shorter period of time. It has many advantages, and is better than the older tugs being used in Panama. In terms of job creation, more than the 95% of our employees are Panamanian, and we have more than 300-400 employees in the country.</p><div class="quote">“We are a small company, a family company, but we compete with big companies."</div><h4>How will the completion of the Panama Canal expansion impact your operations?</h4><p>Our experts are expecting about 7%-10% in growth in our operations and business. The only difference in the import and export sector in Panama will be the size of the vessels. That is the only difference; however, marine operations will increase. It is conservative to say 7% growth is expected, but on the whole, some are predicting about 10%. We are expecting about 7% growth in Meyer's Group. We are rolling out two new tugs in August, and they will arrive by the beginning of October 2014. For the beginning of 2015, we have three more coming for the business plan that we are developing in the new ports—one on the Pacific side and one on the Atlantic. They are making space on the dock, and we are also bringing in one more tug for this.</p><h4>How would you describe Panama's port infrastructure?</h4><p>I can say that the infrastructure is still developing. However, the development has been more important on the Colón side than on the Pacific side. On the Pacific side, we still have the same terminals, and there is another project similar to a service terminal. However, in Colón, the infrastructure is amazing. All the terminals are expanding right now. I think Colón is more developed because it is more developed in the Caribbean than it is in the Pacific. We started with the terminal of Patsa in January 2014, and now there is Hapag-Lloyd and Maersk coming to this terminal also. But there is only one terminal, though expansion plans exist for a second one. There is a great difference between the two ends of the Canal in terms of facilities.</p><h4>How would you assess the competition in the maritime sector?</h4><p>I think that our competition in Panama consists mostly of larger companies. We are a small company, a family company, but we compete with big companies, like Virtual Logistics. To be honest, the market in Panama is healthy enough for everybody. If you take all the concessions that Panama is giving, there are things that started 20 years ago that have still not finished yet. And Virtual Logistics has most of these concessions. If you remove those concessions from the equation, then Meyer's is the top company in Panama for concessions. However, we started from zero in Panama, and it is difficult to fight with big companies. Small fish don't try to eat big ones, but we are still trying to fight this massive competition.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[new-channels]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Interseguro developed in its sector in Peru?</h4><p>Over the past 15 years, a new Peruvian middle class has emerged with a greater disposable income for many new purchases, one of them being insurance, the sales of which have risen considerably. Yet while insurance premiums are growing at a rate of two to three times the growth of the economy as a whole, Peru remains highly underpenetrated. Insurance premiums account for just 1.8% of GDP, which is low compared to our regional neighbors. The way to accelerate this growth is for the insurance companies to reach customers through alternative distribution channels that can connect with new segments of the population in a cheaper manner. We also need to develop new products that are simpler to use, not least to mitigate the significant mistrust many people have for insurance in general. Many find it complicated, or else suspect some sleight of hand, and think that filing a claim would be difficult. Insurance products must therefore become simpler to buy and use, with people being readily able to collect their payouts.</p><h4>What specific products and tools are you leveraging?</h4><p>Digital distribution remains insignificant in Peru, with just a few products distributed to date. We believe that certain products naturally lend themselves to this channel, an example being Seguro Obligatorio de Accidentes de Tránsito (SOAT), the mandatory motor insurance. In that sphere, the superintendency is considering legal amendments to also make the insurance certificate for that insurance category digital.</p><div class="quote">“The way it works in Peru is that 10% of your salary is contributed to an Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones (AFP)."</div><h4>How has pension-backed life insurance changed the sector?</h4><p>The way it works in Peru is that 10% of your salary is contributed to an Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones (AFP), which manages individual accounts for every member of the private pension system. In addition to the 10% collected from you, a small percentage is also collected for disability and life insurance. In the event that a person becomes disabled or dies, they, or their family, receives a pension from this insurance company. Before, each AFP negotiated these insurance contracts with just one insurance company, but following a legal amendment all risk borne by the insurance companies entered one large risk pool, and today the superintendency has auctioned seven packages of that pool, opening it to competition.</p><h4>Were Peru to implement the Solvency II requirements in the near future, would Interseguro be ready to comply?</h4><p>The superintendency has been reviewing Solvency II and we have been working with the body, doing some sensitivity analyses to understand the impact on our industry. Right now, the industry as a whole is highly capitalized, and it could indeed be a good moment to introduce Solvency II. However, many criteria have yet to be finalized internationally, and we are waiting for the standard to settle and assume a stable definition before implementation.</p><h4>What is your five-year plan in terms of growth and focus?</h4><p>I can't tell you about our growth plans as we are a listed company. But I can tell you that insurance sector growth, as a whole, will continue outpacing that of the economy amid rising penetration. We also believe Interseguro's growth is set to exceed the industry average. Highly focused, we veer toward products for individuals, and not for companies. We also intend to develop our distribution channel further, which is our sales force and Interbank. The products that we work with can be distributed through our sales force, or through Interbank. In terms of data management, we have installed customer relationship management (CRM) software in a program set to be complete by mid-2015. But, our annuities and life businesses are already using this CRM software, which provides us a clearer view and deeper understanding of our clients.</p><h4>What is the importance of the insurance sector for the overall economy?</h4><p>I think the importance is twofold. First of all, we cover risks that families could not assume on their own. If something unforeseen happens, like the death of the family's breadwinner, or medical expenses, the insurance sector comes in and lessens the impact of such an event. This vitally enables people to plan for the medium term in the knowledge that if such an event occurred, they would be covered by the insurance company. That is the importance of the insurance sector in general. The second point is that we are also an important institutional investor in the country. We provide long-term funds that are used in different sectors. For example, we believe that our long-term funding is suitable for infrastructure products. Peru is underinvested in infrastructure and needs considerable investment in infrastructure that we can finance. For example, as Interseguro, we have already invested in highways, energy projects, gas pipelines, and water treatment plants. Our portfolio is above $1 billion and we need to make those funds profitable.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

He has created a vision and a culture. He liberated the government offices and made Dubai an attractive place to work, live, and invest. It's a complete lifestyle. We have approached Dubai as a holistic rather than fragmented solution. Putting all of that together has really energized Dubai. Dubai was always a hub in the region; however, we have managed to grow it onto a much larger scale. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster at times; however, Dubai's economy is open to the world. This is a result of it being an open economy; however, we have developed the agility and ability so that when we suffer a global shock, we are capable of bouncing back. If you look at the UAE or Dubai stock markets in 2013, we have bounced back better than any other exchange. That resilience is evident in the economy, and is in the very DNA of Dubai. That's what makes Dubai a dynamic place.</p><h4>How do you think that Mashreq Bank played a role in the resiliency of Dubai's economy after the recent financial crisis?</h4><p>While being the oldest bank in the country, we have enjoyed witnessing the progress, history of growth, and the challenges the economy has undergone. Because Mashreq has always believed in Dubai's direction, we continue supporting our clients during the difficult times. We have never dropped the lines and stopped doing business. Our clients have history doing business in the country and we believed they would overcome these challenges, and they did. Mashreq's success is because of our customers' success and our customers' success is because of the economy's success. It's a partnership between the economy, the customers, and Mashreq.</p><h4>What are the next steps for the bank?</h4><p>The next stage is growth, and we also aim for a better customer experience. At the end of the day, most banks will offer the same products and services. What will differentiate the banks is the experience that the customer goes through when they do their banking transactions. And this experience cannot be copied overnight. If the customer has a great experience, word of mouth and advertising will encourage more customers to come to us, be they retail, SME, or corporate clients.</p><div class="quote">“The next stage is growth, and we also aim for a better customer experience."</div><h4>How would you describe Dubai's role as a leading international city today?</h4><p>Dubai has rightly been recognized as one of the leading cities in the world. From the perspective of the airlines, Dubai's airport is today by far the largest in terms of international passengers. If you look at Dubai's ports, we are the third largest transshipment port in the world. We have established ourselves quickly as a prominent hub for business. If you look at regional offices for multinationals, there is no choice for them but Dubai. From Morocco to Oman, the only logical place is Dubai. The free trade zones will attract people to set up their businesses, and we've also tried to focus on a sector-based approach. We try to promote the finance sector with DIFC, while for media we have Dubai Media City, and a host of other free zones to allow people ownership and a place to set up their factories. Basically, we adapt our free trade zones to a sector focus and in line with the sector's regulations in order to make the investment climate friendly and conducive to business.</p><h4>What is your vision on the HH Sheikh Mohammed's goal to make Dubai the capital of the Islamic economy?</h4><p>It is achievable, as the market is well established. We have the knowhow, and are putting everything together as a unified product. It will encompass a spectrum of banking, takaful, and food, among other components. We are looking at what it will take, for example, to receive certification for halal food. We want to make an authenticated Islamic center for certification of halal products. We consider it achievable, and we have the track record of achievement on an international scale.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the Al Etihad Credit Bureau on the financial industry?</h4><p>A credit bureau is long overdue. We have done a lot of things here in the UAE except the credit bureau. Finally, we have it. I think it will slow down lending by banks because people will discover how much has been borrowed or over borrowed. Long term, it will protect everyone—borrowers, banks, and the economy—from a crisis. We will be undertaking lending, particularly on the retail and SME side.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the coming year?</h4><p>I am pretty optimistic, as we now have a strong currency that is linked to the dollar, which makes it even better for our economy. It may impact some tourists, but our tourist numbers are growing annually, benefitting from superb infrastructure, environment, logistics, and legal system. There is no other city in the region that can compete with us. We simply present a vast array of possibilities, which ranges from our own ice hockey team to a diversity of educational possibilities including many languages. Moreover, we have been spared the regional turmoil, while we leverage our strengths. There is no safer haven for investment than the UAE and Dubai.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are both the Hamriyah Free Zone and the Sharjah Airport International Free Zone (SAIF) contributing to economic growth in Sharjah?</h4><p>Both free zones are crucial components of the economy of Sharjah, and serve as its backbone. Today, over 13,000 companies have been established in both free zones, and over 1,000 industries ranging from small and medium to heavy industries have been set up. We have investors of 157 nationalities, who are active in diverse economic sectors in our zones. The free zones were developed to encourage grater FDI investment within Sharjah, since it was a leading industrial city and home to 33% of all the industry of the UAE. The free zones complement that growth, and we are targeting unique sectors for growth within Sharjah specifically, and within the UAE overall. When it comes to industries, we are highly specialized, and consider the merits of integration and clustering, by looking at how we can develop our services further to provide our investors a well-balanced, one-stop service business environment that enables their growth.</p><h4>What types of companies are operating in the free zones?</h4><p>Listed companies, limited liability companies, and family businesses have been established here. For example, Lamprell, which is our largest customer in Hamriyah Free Zone, uses it to build rigs for export throughout the world. There is also Eversendai, a Malaysian steel fabrication company that has undertaken multiple projects around the world. We are glad to have a variety of industries, because they oblige us to determine how best to segment them. We have to look at what is required to make these companies grow and make our free zones attractive to them. And since the service of the free zone alone is not sufficient to attract such companies, we also consider the third-party businesses they require for efficient operation. From the service to the supply sectors, we work to combine all elements to make the environment more competitive, efficient, and more timesaving for the client.</p><h4>Which economic sectors are most important in Hamriyah Free Zone?</h4><p>The biggest sectors are oil and gas and maritime. Furthermore, Hamriyah Free Zone is the largest steel zone in the UAE. We are also the second largest oil storage zone in the UAE, and we are expanding that offering and looking at new customers to set up their businesses in the sector. We have many other sectors like building materials and food production, which we are looking to expand as we have recently created a new food and plastic packaging zone. This is a new project in Hamriyah that will cater to a specific clientele; we are encouraging customers from around the world to participate.</p><h4>Are you experiencing an influx in investors as a result of these efforts?</h4><p>We are gaining ground in sectors such as the food and petrochemical sectors. We are expanding the steel sector in the free zone, and we have the largest private shipbuilding facility, namely Damen Shipyard with around 350,000sqm of land. We look at different sectors, and also work to complement these industries together. Sometimes certain industries are unaware of other industries in the Free Zone, whereby we match them together, which creates synergy and builds more business between them. Today the Free Zone has an area of 22 million sqm and, to cope with rising future demand, a further expansion of 10 million sqm has been planned.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on the incentives Sharjah Airport International Free Zone offers to potential investors?</h4><p>The SAIF zone is adjacent to the Sharjah International Airport. It was the first free zone to be set up in Sharjah, in 1995, and is unique. It caters more to SMEs compared to Hamriyah. Today, the SAIF zone has over 6,700 companies with about 500 industries spanning all kinds of production from consumer goods to logistics to building materials. Several aviation companies are located there. The free zone is about 13 million sqm and we are expanding it to include another 3 million sqm that is currently under development, which will be used for warehouses, road infrastructure, utilities, and offices for our clients. SAIF has a lot of well-established companies that are listed. What we are trying to do in SAIF zone, as well as in Hamriyah, is to cluster their focus; we are looking at complementing the airport by encouraging more logistics companies and more aviation companies to establish their business in the SAIF zone and we are looking at more consumer goods and cargo that is related to the airport.</p><h4>Which sectors have you prioritized for foreign investment in the coming year?</h4><p>Sharjah has always had a balanced economy; we have a certain margin of growth that we focus on. What we are trying to do now is look at how we can upgrade our services in the different fields in both free zones. We are looking at more software-enabled services—more third party enabled services to improve the efficiency for our clients when it comes to cargo and transportation and other facility management services. The zone has very good growth and we are very optimistic about the next five years. We are looking at new sectors and new countries, such as the US, Canada, Portugal, and Brazil. We are also looking at Europe in a big way, because it is a big market for us. We have recently gone to Japan, which was very encouraging. We already have some Japanese firms, but our aim is to accommodate more clients from Japan. From trading to manufacturing, we are looking at expanding that area because the Japanese are excellent at manufacturing and we want to encourage more industries to come here. Furthermore, we encourage foreign investors to visit the Hamriyah Free Zone and SAIF Zone, to see for themselves and get a clear impression of what the free zones can offer. We show them all the available services that they can get and the facilities that are available, and then they decide what is best for them. We work closely with the Sharjah Port Customs, the airport, and all the economic authorities to give the investor the right platform for them to do their business. We have had 1,000+ industries over the last decade and a half; we understand this business and we have a clear idea of what investors need. We look at specialized sectors that we know will add value—not only to the free zones and Sharjah, but also to the entire region. We look very closely at integrating our economy, not only gathering numbers. I'm confident that this strategy will allow us to grow in 2015 and the coming years.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current status of the Moma mine?</h4><p>We completed the expansion works in 2013 and are now just about ramped up to full, expanded capacity, having invested approximately $400 million. With this expansion we have seen a significant QoQ increase in production since mid 2013. The overall expansion increased our installed capacity from 800,000 tons per year of ilmenite to 1.2 million tons. We are currently close to producing at that level.</p><h4>What are your strategies for achieving solid results, despite the low price of zircon and titanium?</h4><p>The strategy is basically to maximize the price we can get under current highly challenging market conditions. Indeed, with the expansion our cost per unit has decreased. We are essentially a fixed-cost business, so for each extra ton we produce the cost per ton declines as our variable costs are limited, and the production increase, as we have seen over the past 12 months, has reduced our cost per ton quite significantly.</p><h4>How would you describe the current global demand for titanium and ziconium?</h4><p>Demand is weak and it has been for the past 12-18 months. This is mainly due to a destocking process evident in the pigment market. Yet we are confident that there will be a significant recovery in prices. At the moment we supply approximately 8-10% of global ilmenite demand.</p><div class="quote">“The strategy is basically to maximize the price we can get under current highly challenging market conditions."</div><h4>How have your export destinations evolved since we last spoke two years ago?</h4><p>Europe and the US remain the key export destinations. A fair volume of zircon is going to China; it will take an increasing amount of ilmenite, too. We have a few other destinations that are quite significant, such as Saudi Arabia. We export to around 35 countries in total, but the main ones are still the US for ilmenite, Europe for zircon, and China for ilmenite and zircon.</p><h4>How would you describe the company's contribution to the socio-economic development of the country?</h4><p>Currently, we employ about 1,650 permanent staff, of which around 1,500 are nationals. We are the largest taxpayers in the north of the country. Additionally, have a significant CSR program, featuring a range of activities that we implement in the local community. In 2013 we spent somewhere in the region of $80-90 million, locally, in Mozambique.</p><h4>How do you expect the LNG project to impact the region?</h4><p>The oil and gas projects will bring challenges as well as benefits. The key for us, on the positive side, will be the prospective electricity generating plant, which will add to network stability, and the electricity stability is a very important factor. It is going to bring some challenges as well: the infamous Dutch disease, I think we are going to see salaries of qualified nationals in particular going up quite significantly and that is going to put cost-pressures on everyone, not just us, but all businesses in Mozambique.</p><h4>What should be done from the public and the private sector to make the most of the support mining industry in the country?</h4><p>The key factor is the supply of electricity. You cannot process anything without power and, at the moment, the network in the north of Mozambique is not able to delivery additional power, and this will be the case for the next four or five years until a new second line is built. So, my view is that Mozambique, once it establishes an adequate power distribution infrastructure, will be able to benefit more than today from its natural resources. For example, it would be possible to install pigment plants, synthetic rutile plants, or whatever was required to spur value added. Currently, we simply export the ilmenite, rutile, and zircon.</p><h4>What is your 10-year outlook on the future of the mine in Mozambique?</h4><p>We will renew our concession in 2029. We have 100+ years of mine life. We would expect prices to recover quite strongly in 2015. We have a large deposit, and there is a considerable opportunity for a further increase in production. We have already done some work on what we would need to do for a Phase III to increase production further. At the moment it is not something we are actively working on due to the market situation; however, if the improvements we expect in the market situation come to fruition then those plans would be dusted off and I would certainly like to see Phase III within the next 10 years.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Being the flagship branch, what is the role of Ooredoo Qatar within the larger group structure of the company?</h4><p>In Qatar, our market awareness is at 100%, and brand equity has steadily improved as we have demonstrated to our customers that we promote growth. By having such a strong band presence, we have been able to launch life-enhancing products such as 4G Mobile Broadband, Ooredoo Fibre, Business Fibre, and the Ooredoo App. We have also been able to provide next generation entertainment services like our Mozaic GO App and state-of-the-art business services such as the data center with a safety net. By using our communities and Qatar's bustling industry needs as a launch pad for these services, we can perfect the products to make a truly global portfolio. At the beginning of 2014, we reached the milestone of 3 million customers in Qatar.</p><h4>How have your customers received the fiber and 4G services, and how do you expect demand to develop over the next year?</h4><p>Data access is now the single largest contributor to revenue growth, with 28% YoY revenue growth across the group. In Qatar, Ooredoo is the data market leader, with 26% YoY data revenue growth and 80% mobile broadband penetration in 2013. We still see a significant potential for growth in these figures, and intend to drive data market expansion. Over 175,000 customers have also been connected to Ooredoo Fibre, offering the fastest internet speeds available, access to our entertainment service Mozaic TV, and offering businesses a next-generation service. In order to encourage more customers to switch to Ooredoo and remain with us; however, we need to deliver the latest life-enhancing technology combined with great value promotions and reliable network signals. To deliver this we are expanding our 4G network and connecting more homes to fiber every day to keep up with the growing demand for fast internet and creating a high-tech networking infrastructure throughout the country that can cope with the growing population of Qatar.</p><div class="quote">“Data access is now the single largest contributor to revenue growth."</div><h4>What is your strategy with regard to Ooredoo's ambition to improve the services in mobile money transfers?</h4><p>As Qatar's economy continues to grow, the country has seen an influx of international workers contributing to key projects. These workers need to send money to friends and family in their home country. Many do not have bank accounts or easy access to financial services, but virtually all of them have mobile phones. Seizing an opportunity to enhance the lives of underserved communities in Qatar, Ooredoo launched the mobile banking service Ooredoo Mobile Money in 2011. Using any model of mobile phone, customers can send money securely, conveniently, and reliably, 24 hours a day, with money available for collection in just 10 minutes. Initially, Ooredoo customers could send money only to Pakistan and the Philippines, but in order to serve Qatar's diverse expatriate population, Ooredoo has partnered with leading global payment services company MoneyGram to enable customers to send money for collection at over 321,000 MoneyGram agents in 200 countries around the world. The partnership with MoneyGram was a global first, and matches the needs of expatriate workers perfectly.</p><h4>How will the global unification of the Ooredoo Group impact the capabilities of the company to improve its services?</h4><p>The purpose of transforming into Ooredoo was about much more than just changing our name; it was about taking our business to the next level and creating a new identity. A major part of that was looking to differentiate based on the customer experience. We wanted to improve networks, offer new services and deliver on our promise to stimulate human growth. In some markets, in parallel with the launch of the Ooredoo brand, this involved the launch of 4G and 3G services. Over the past year, every Ooredoo operation has carried out research to understand what customers are looking for and what their expectations of Ooredoo services are. Each operation has carried out a series of focus groups and customer surveys to help shape their respective “customer promise"—the commitments that customers can expect from Ooredoo.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

To what do you attribute that success?</h4><p>It was the vitality and dynamism of my colleagues. We operate in a team-oriented environment; I believe we were very fortunate to have been able to bring together a remarkable team at all levels and in all divisions. We are one of, if not the, youngest bank in the marketplace. The average age of our staff members is the lowest in the banking industry of Lebanon. What differentiates us is that upon taking over Bank of Beirut in 1993, we did not inherit a senior generation of employees. Our team is very young and highly educated. We do not spare any effort to employ additional well-experienced staff from overseas who can further add to our existing knowhow and experience; as their international exposure would enhance our business. The advantage of one bank over another is the extent of opportunities captured from the new generation of bankers as the tools currently utilized are much more sophisticated than those in the past. A young team provides a high competitive edge to our daily operations. The outlook is different, the horizons are different, and the energy is unlimited.</p><h4>Bank of Beirut has an enviable 12.6% equity ratio—number one among the alpha banks in Lebanon. What strategies have allowed you to achieve this exceptional ratio?</h4><p>In fact, we work in parallel with our requirements in order to continue increasing our equity. We do not wait until there is need for a capital increase to request it. We are invariably ahead in additional funds in order to fund our costs. And we do not distribute over 35-40% of our yearly profit. So we have almost 60% of our annual revenue reinvested in the business.</p><div class="quote">“For the last 20 years, Bank of Beirut has each year outperformed the previous one."</div><h4>How would you assess Bank of Beirut's performance in 2014?</h4><p>We did very well in 2014 in all growth indicators. Our total assets grew by 9.69% YoY, and net profit after tax increased by 20.65%, to reach $175 million. For the last 20 years, Bank of Beirut has each year outperformed the previous one. It is obviously another consequence of the productivity of each and every team member in all market segments. It is rewarding everyone positively.</p><h4>What strategy will Bank of Beirut follow to sustain growth in 2015?</h4><p>Bank of Beirut is primarily a trade finance-oriented bank. Each bank has its own characteristics. We are the leader in the market in trade finance, in housing loans, and in asset management. We intend to add additional segments in the near future. Regretfully, 2015 will be much different than the previous years. The regional environment is politically more difficult. Our markets are smaller. The Lebanese market itself has shrunk due to the prevailing political situation in the country. If we should add the pressures imposed from compliance procedures throughout the region, we could say that 2015 would be more taxing than the previous years. Growth is sustained through two types of strategies; one is human-oriented, whereby we keep our teams well motivated by constantly assessing their performance. This is the role of management. The second type of strategy is beyond our control. It is highly linked to the political environment, be it in Lebanon or the region. We will therefore do our best and pray that all will turn out in our favor.</p><h4>What steps is Bank of Beirut taking to maintain/increase its market share in overseas markets?</h4><p>This is another characteristic of Bank of Beirut, we do not pursue market share. Our main focus is how to outperform our previous year's profitability. Shareholders look for dividends and additional profits and for increase in their investment. We aim at that direction rather than market share. Our prime concern is providing added value to our shareholders' investments rather than increasing our market share at a higher cost. At times the two parameters work in parallel; however, more often than not such is not the case. I wish these would, but it is not within our control.</p><h4>What role does innovation play at Bank of Beirut?</h4><p>Bank of Beirut offers plenty of innovative solutions. Most importantly, is to take advantage at the right time of any added solution. We are here to assess and introduce fresh solutions to our customers' needs. More often than not you do not need a Ferrari to drive to the city as it is not always the case that high technologies serve your objectives, but rather the necessary technologies that would serve your objectives. Our IT people are always keen to acquire new technology and we are enthusiastic about new achievements. Here, we have to assess the right innovation at the appropriate time. Our markets are not yet as sophisticated as the highly developed markets, such as the UK or the US. Our markets are more customer oriented, to the extent that we have to adjust and to cater to our customers' needs.</p><h4>What is your mid-term outlook for Lebanon's banking sector, as well as Bank of Beirut's role in it?</h4><p>There is no straightforward answer to this question. Our target is to continue surpassing our own performance, whether it will help us to further penetrate the market remains to be seen. We care about exceeding our own performance rather than watching our competitors. We care about our own statistics and our internal growth. In the long run, we will see if we were relatively better rewarded than the competition. To date, we have succeeded in outperforming the competition. Whether this will continue remains to be seen.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements for Daimler Financial Services Mexico since your inception 20 years ago?</h4><p>Our 20 years in Mexico have been a success story, as well as an illustration of Daimler Financial Services' worldwide growth. Daimler Financial Services has grown globally to a portfolio of over ‚¬80 billion. Mexico is a more recent addition to the company, but we are a success story nonetheless. Last year, we closed the books with over Ps20 billion in our portfolio. We finance four out of every 10 vehicles sold, which is 40% of the vehicles sold worldwide, and the same goes for Mexico. Overall we have shown tremendous portfolio growth and increased our penetration, on the business side. Daimler Financial Services is also involved in financing public transportation. Our company is one of the pioneers in transforming small, informal transport into real enterprises. We are working hand-in-hand with public authorities to improve the quality of life and the air quality through modern technology in transportation choices. We have also established ourselves as one of the top-20 employers in Mexico.</p><h4>Which factors contributed to the current size of your portfolio?</h4><p>Daimler Financial Services is a customer-driven company, and we have substantial evidence to show that we have grown with our customers and users. We have helped both the dealers and distributors grow in the market, and we also deal with many second-generation companies, which has created lasting business relationships.</p><div class="quote">“Daimler Financial Services is a customer-driven company."</div><h4>What are your company's services in the truck and bus segment?</h4><p>Daimler Financial Services had a spectacular year in 2014 in the bus segment, although last year the truck segment had its share of problems stemming from the importation of used vehicles from the US. Nevertheless, our services in that segment were still solidly delivered, despite the unusual amount of importation from the US.</p><h4>The millennials are now responsible for 40% of new car sales in Mexico. How are you approaching this demographic?</h4><p>We are taking a different approach with millennials than we had with Generation X, which were focused on brick and mortar stores and traditional paper-based services. The millennials are different because when they come to a dealership, they have already made their purchasing decision by researching online. Part of our transformation involves targeting millennial consumers with online services. For example they can now check their account balance online, which is representative of the type of service that millennials regard as non-negotiable. We are trying to find channels and ways to seek out the millennials even before they reach the point of sale.</p><h4>What factors have led to an increase in financing in Mexico through companies like Daimler Financial Services?</h4><p>It goes without saying that everyone likes convenience. When you buy a vehicle the ideal scenario is going to the dealerships and getting everything in one package including the vehicle, financing, insurance, and services. That is a development that we are seeing already in the US and Europe, and it is now coming to Mexico too. By offering the complete package, we are able to meet the demands of new buyers. The overall leverage of the customers is much lower in Mexico than it is in the US. There is a lot of room for growth.</p><h4>What is the importance of Mexico for the company?</h4><p>Mexico is one of the few markets where you can still have double-digit growth, as it is not an established industrial country. The demographics of Mexico are very important and also add to national growth, whereas in countries even like China, stagnation of the population is affecting their economy. Right now Mexico is in somewhat of a sweet spot between growth, stability, and very positive demographics.</p><h4>What opportunities do you identify for Daimler Financial Services in Mexico?</h4><p>One aspect is definitely the mass affluent segment. We have invested heavily in small luxury vehicles like the A Class or the B Class. The segment provides vehicles and financial packages for a younger demographic that has money and a more stable financial situation. We are also involved in the bus segment, which involves public transportation and the transportation options for employees. We have two other segments including the truck and van segment. This equals a total of four segments, and the truck segment has been relatively inactive, meaning there will be demand in the coming years for upgrading fleets. We sell Freightliner here, and we are in a good position because Mexico has become highly professional with Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Companies are looking beyond the vehicle price to the long-term mileage costs. Freightliner has come out with a new diesel engine that has fantastic fuel economy. TCO, combined with our financing, allows companies to cut their costs. The fourth segment is the van business, and we all know that the internet economy has increased parcel deliveries. This has provided an opportunity for us to participate in the growth of this delivery van fleet. The government is really doing the right thing by investing in infrastructure. I am impressed with the new highways being built which are up to world-class standards. These have really improved the logistics infrastructure.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Mexican economy over the coming five years to 2020?</h4><p>Last year we were expecting better performance for 2015, and predicted that 2016 would be even better. We know that the next two years will be good, but we do see some clouds on the horizon. One issue is the social situation in Mexico, and we acknowledge that need to make a collective effort to talk about the problems facing our society. We need to look at the causes of the social unrest. Overall, this is not a major threat, but it is casting a shadow over the highly positive outlook we have for the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of COCEP in Peru?</h4><p>The COCEP is the second oldest chamber of commerce in the country, with over 120 years of history, however under its current name, it legally dates back to 1968, before which it was the Cámara de Comercio de Lima. Five years ago COCEP started a new initiative that aimed to bolster economic relations between Peru and Spain. We now have 275 members, compared with only 165 members five years ago. We have four main objectives: to promote bilateral commerce between Peru and Spain; to provide companies with the best possible service offering; to organize seminars, conferences, meetings, and workshops; and to promote responsible management, seeking new skills, tools, and techniques to improve corporate management among our members. This not only covers business practices, but also areas like social development and corporate social responsibility. We have two departments in the COCEP: the first promotes international commerce through three different kinds of services, namely commercial contacts, commercial intelligence, and legal implementation; and the second department takes care of social business activities at the COCEP.</p><h4>What are your most recent activities?</h4><p>There are around four major activities staged per year at the COCEP. “Visiones" is our most important corporate social function of the year. Another key event is our annual Spanish-Peruvian summit, which assembles ministers, politicians, officials, and business leaders from both countries for talks on, say, means of developing trade. Last year, for example, the topic was “Applied Innovations for the Development of Society." This year we will focus on the topic of “OCDE AGENDA" on May 18 and 19. Another major annual award is the most outstanding Spanish and Peruvian person of the year. Two years ago we gave the award to Mario Vargas Llosa, and last year to Familia Añaños. We also have regular legal and business seminars and work breakfasts with key figures from various sectors. Last year we had a topic called “A Study of the Impact of Spanish Investment in Peru." We signed an agreement with Pacifico University to organize an economic research team, which provided us with our most detailed study of Spanish investment in this country. Our study encapsulated all 386 legal and registered Spanish companies in Peru, although there may be up to 500 companies operating in Peru in total, and we now have an excellent idea of the size and impact of Spanish investment in Peru, which amounted to around $10 billion in 2012.</p><h4>How important are Spanish companies for Peru and what is the extent of their involvement in Peru's infrastructural and economic development?</h4><p>When you consider the ongoing major Spanish infrastructure projects in Peru, like the Linea 2 project for the metro, the modernization of the Talara refinery, and other such contracts, the above-mentioned figure is expected to double within two years. My job is to attract Spanish companies, businesses, and businessmen to Peru. I consistently focus on our potential in terms of technology innovation capacity in infrastructure and construction. We have more than 25 years of experience in developing technology companies. There are certain advantages that Spanish companies have here. A Spanish company today can offer cutting-edge technology  at a lower price than many Peruvian companies. There have been some huge projects undertaken by Spanish companies as a result, like the Linea 2 of the Lima Metro, the contract signed last year between the state and Técnicas Reunidas for the modernization of Talara refinery, and Repsol's modernization of the La Pandilla refinery. All in all, Spanish companies are involved in 15 of Peru's largest projects in innovation and technology. For example, all of the Peruvian solar energy programs and half of the wind energy programs are being undertaken by Spanish companies.</p><div class="quote">“The COCEP is the second oldest chamber of commerce in the country."</div><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[one-step-ahead]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Etisalat is striving to become the leading emerging market telecoms group in the world. What is your strategy to channel your resources in the right direction?</h4><p>Last year was excellent year for us, and one that illustrated the power and success of our core values of growth and innovation. Our expansion into French-speaking Africa, which increased our presence to 19 markets across the MENA region, was perhaps out biggest achievement of 2014. It was accompanied by stronger-than-predicted figures along with the continuation of steady growth for our home market in the UAE. We also established some excellent global partnerships in order to develop new, cutting-edge technologies such as 5G.</p><h4>How are you are working toward improving your network quality and connectivity?</h4><p>In the UAE last year, we invested AED2.5 billion in bringing 4G to its fullest potential. We also further expanded our fiber-to-the-home network, with efforts to reach 90% of UAE households in 2015. I'm proud to say that we remain the dominant force in the UAE's mobile industry. This is due, I think, to our consistently innovative product and service offerings, coupled with competitive prices.</p><div class="quote">“Last year was excellent year for us, and one that illustrated the power and success of our core values of growth and innovation."</div><h4>How would you describe the regulatory environment here in the UAE, and how has it enabled the Emirates to become one of the most technologically advanced nations in the MENA region?</h4><p>Because we have been operating in so many different countries, we have seen a spread of regulatory frameworks. We are lucky in the UAE to have one of the best regulatory frameworks in the region. The benefit of our regulatory system here is the balanced view of all stakeholders. Investors, operators, and people in the community are all key. If this view was adopted in other countries, I believe we would see ICT improve tremendously in those countries. We always call for regulators to have a balanced framework so that all stakeholders get the benefits. The focus should not be on taxation and fees, but rather on the benefits that can be provided. You have to see where your telecoms industry position is, and you must have the right position for those regulations. Many countries in the region lag far behind and need to take steps to catch up.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for investment in the mobile segment here in the UAE?</h4><p>The number one thing is to improve the connectivity or the quality and the speed. That is why we are investing heavily in 4G and eventually 5G. We also want to be a partner in the innovation framework. Today, mobile phones are the center of most people's lives through communication and contacts. You never leave home without it, and it is no longer an accessory. We have to make it simple for people to use services on their device, whether they are government or financial, for example. We also have to provide enough security so that people feel safe when they use mobile services. We want to become the enabler for people.</p><h4>How do you see the UAE's ICT sector developing over the next five years?</h4><p>We have actively worked toward establishing the digital infrastructure required for the ever-increasing data demands of the future. The expansion of data is essential to the future rollout of 5G. We are working against our own deadline of Expo 2020 in Dubai, so in addition to creating the infrastructure for the platform and developing the technology itself, we're adapting the way we operate and how we approach telecommunications in general. As data becomes more central to the equation and voice calls are further marginalized, we will need to have the agility, dynamism, and cross-sector relationships to respond and adapt effectively. We can establish new, creative revenue streams through creative value addition, but only if we work together.</p><h4>How are you looking to improve your position in your other countries of involvement around the world and where will your focus be in the near future?</h4><p>Last year was a critical one for Etisalat as an international operator. The milestone of acquiring Maroc Telecom—one of the largest in the region's history—has added strong value to Etisalat's global footprint. The world is more connected than ever before. And as we've been talking about, with the expansion of data and the digitization of services, access to quality telecommunications is increasingly becoming a necessity, not merely a luxury. Our expansion in Africa delivers affordable, accessible mobile technology to thousands of people in these markets. This is literally changing people's lives. Our portfolio of services is geared toward fostering improvements in education, healthcare, finance, and many other essential areas.</p><h4>What are Etisalat's aspirations and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE and the Ruler of Abu Dhabi and Commander of the Union Defense Force, has made the establishment of smart cities across the UAE a priority. As a result, Etisalat has received consistent support from the UAE government as we work to develop the infrastructure and digital architecture that smart cities will be built on. Given this aspiration, and our own goals—both for Expo 2020 and in a general sense as innovators—we will be heavily focused on these areas in the year to come.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the founding mission of CEPSA and how has it evolved?</h4><p>CEPSA is a 57-year-old company representing several important lines of business. In the lubricant industry, we have represented Castrol in Ecuador for the last 47 years. In the tire business, we represent several brands, such as Yokohama Rubber Company, Roadstone Tires from South Korea, and Daewoo Tires from South Korea. We also represent Volkswagen, a German automaker, which is the second largest automobile company in the world. Our ambition is to be the leader of the automotive industry, which is the goal of our three-year strategic plan from 2015 to 2017.</p><h4>CEPSA is the distributor of three renowned brands. How have these alliances emerged?</h4><p>CEPSA was initially a British-owned company, which brought the distribution rights of Castrol to Ecuador, which we have now handled for almost 50 years. CEPSA nowadays is a family-owned company, and we are proud to distribute Castrol Lubricants in Ecuador. In relation to Yokohama, we decided two years ago to distribute a prime brand, and when we looked at brands that were not distributed in Ecuador, we noticed the absence of Yokohama. We contacted the company, and they were delighted to grant us the distribution rights. We distribute tires for trucks, buses, and passenger cars. CEPSA was a General Motors distributor until 1999, but due to the economic crisis in Ecuador, we ceased car distribution. In 2010 after CEPSA re-gained financial strength, Volkswagen granted the distribution rights for the city of Quito and Los Chillos valley.</p><div class="quote">“Our main objective is to maintain CEPSA's excellent performance during this difficult year."</div><h4>In what areas is CEPSA investing its resources?</h4><p>We are building a new warehouse facility in Los Chillos, a valley 30 minutes away from Quito, with an investment of $3 million that will provide us with excellent distribution in the northern region of Ecuador. We have our own facilities in Guayaquil and Cuenca, and opened other offices in Manta, the second largest port of Ecuador. CESPA also increased its production facilities, investing in a new filling line of lubricants in Guayaquil.</p><h4>How did your financial performance in 2014 compare to 2013 and what is your outlook for the coming year?</h4><p>We have been growing for the past eight years, whereby our sales during 2014 exceeded $50 million, with an AAA credit rating, which is a challenge to maintain. We anticipate three difficult years ahead due to the impact of lower oil prices that will affect the economic growth of Ecuador. Therefore, we will concentrate on increasing our operational efficiency and diversifying our product and client portfolio.</p><h4>What are CEPSA's competitive advantages?</h4><p>First, in lubricants, we operate across the entire business chain. We import the base oil for lubricants and additives; we have our own bottle-making facility, a grease plant, and now a lubricants filling facility. We also have our own logistics and transportation company supplying the majority of Ecuador's cities with lubricants. In tires, our strength is reaching all segments of the market and we have a particularly dynamic sales force.</p><h4>The government is set to restrict automobile imports in 2015. How is CEPSA planning to overcome the impact of this?</h4><p>The sale of new vehicles will be reduced according to the quotas set by the government. We are planning to emphasize our sales in some vehicles that do not have the quota system such as Vans. Also, we are planning to grow in service shops and sales of spare parts throughout the country.</p><h4>How is CEPSA adapting its business strategy to the government's plan for the productive matrix?</h4><p>By producing lubricants domestically, and integrating all the business from imports of base oil and additives, by having our own filling, packaging, and blending facilities, and by controlling logistics and transportation, CEPSA will be aligned with the country's new productive matrix. In the tire division, we are investing in a retreading facility, which is crucial from an environmental perspective. If we recycle and retread the tires, we reduce the country's ecological footprint dramatically, while reducing tire imports.</p><h4>What is CEPSA's strategic plan of action for 2015?</h4><p>Our main objective is to maintain CEPSA's excellent performance during this difficult year. We will take different actions, such as launching new products in the lubricants division, increasing our retreating tire business, implementing new service workshops for VW, and finalizing our new warehouse at Los Chillos. These are some of the managerial steps in our 2015 business plan.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaysia and New Zealand have a history of strong bilateral links. What makes Malaysia an important diplomatic, economic, and security partner for New Zealand?</h4><p>Malaysia is an important partner for New Zealand for a number of reasons. In economic terms, Malaysia is our eighth largest trading partner overall, and our second largest within the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). And in terms of security, Malaysia is one of our closest defense partners in the region, a relationship that is underpinned by our longstanding cooperation on defense and security issues. We are both members of the Five Power Defense Arrangement, which is the cornerstone of New Zealand's defense and security engagement in the region. As our shared term on the Security Council gets under way, New Zealand will be working closely with Malaysia as fellow non-permanent members to represent the interests and concerns of the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, our close economic ties have fostered strong people-to-people links in many areas—education being one example. Many New Zealand universities have formal agreements with Malaysian education providers, with around 2,000 Malaysian students currently studying in New Zealand.</p><h4>How has the New Zealand—Malaysia Free Trade Agreement, in place since 2010, deepened the relationship between the two nations?</h4><p>The Malaysia—New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (MNZFTA) is central to our trade relationship with Malaysia, and builds on the twelve-country Agreement establishing the ASEAN-Australian-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA), which entered into force in January of the same year. For the year-ending 2014, Malaysia was New Zealand's sixth largest merchandise goods trading partner, moving up from 10th place before the Agreement coming into force. Total merchandise goods trade was worth NZ$3.3 billion for the year ending 2014, which represents an increase of NZ$1.5 billion over the past five years. And it is not just merchandise goods trade that has expanded under the Malaysia—New Zealand FTA. Services exports to Malaysia have also grown since 2010 in a range of high value sectors, such as private education, engineering and IT. Meanwhile, officials from both our countries continue to work closely together to ensure that the FTA responds to the interests of our businesses, and reflects developments in modern trade. For example, Malaysia and New Zealand negotiated an amendment to the Agreement to provide for more modern international invoicing practices. With a large and growing population of close to 30 million, more trade with Malaysia represents an excellent opportunity for New Zealand and New Zealanders. The Malaysia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement not only enables us to deepen our ties with Malaysia, but also provides New Zealand a foothold in the dynamic South-East Asia region.</p><div class="quote">“New Zealand strongly supports ASEAN's regional integration ambitions."</div><h4>Malaysia recently took over from Myanmar as Chair of ASEAN as the region moves towards the creation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). How will closer regional integration impact the importance of ASEAN for New Zealand?</h4><p>New Zealand strongly supports ASEAN's regional integration ambitions, including its steps towards its Economic Community. It is well known that global and regional integration can result in significant economic and social benefits, and the AEC has the potential to deliver these benefits to ASEAN and the wider region, including New Zealand. New Zealand has a strong economic relationship with ASEAN, which was further strengthened by the signing of the Australia-New Zealand-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) in 2009. This year marks New Zealand's 40th anniversary of engagement with ASEAN. If we consider ASEAN as a group, it is already New Zealand's fourth largest trading partner, and our second fastest growing trading relationship among our top ten partners—and this is just the beginning. Through the AEC, ASEAN's economy has the potential to continue developing and become an even more important, open and integrated force in the global economy. We want to work alongside ASEAN to support its integration ambitions and together make the Asia-Pacific a prosperous and leading region.</p><h4>What do you envisage for the future of bilateral relations between New Zealand and Malaysia, and on which areas will cooperation be focused over the coming years?</h4><p>We will continue to strengthen our relationship with Malaysia by further implementing the Malaysia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement, creating more opportunities for our businesses; enhancing our people to people links—especially through education and tourism; continuing to build on the strong ties between our defense forces; and increasing our engagement in security issues of mutual concern, including in the context of our shared term on the United Nations Security Council. New Zealand will also work closely with Malaysia and our other regional partners to support ASEAN's integration objectives and the development of an ASEAN Economic Community.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has your growth strategy been over the past five years?</h4><p>About 10 years ago we started to explore the international market more seriously, and most of our growth during the last few years has actually come from exports. We control approximately 90% of the domestic spirits market, so the only real option is to look beyond Panama to continue growing. We now export our leading product, Ron Abuelo, to 36 countries. Fortunately for us, the aged rum market is growing internationally, and there is an increasing interest in premium aged rums all over the world.</p><h4>What are your expectations in terms of production for 2015?</h4><p>In the international market, we expect double-digit growth over the next five years. For the local market, it will mainly be organic growth due to the important market share we already have, but with some interesting growth in a few specific niches.</p><div class="quote">“The quality of our rum has a lot to do with our success."</div><h4>What is the importance of Ron Abuelo for Panamanians?</h4><p>For many years, Panama was a market mainly of “seco" the national drink produced from sugar cane juice. Seco is for Panamanians what tequila is for Mexicans, or pisco for Peruvians. Rum always had some market share, but the impressive growth of Abuelo transformed the industry. For us it is vital to have a strong brand here, as Panama is today a great showcase to the entire world. Those visitors who try Abuelo and love it become ambassadors of Panama, and of Ron Abuelo, once they return home. Panamanians are particularly proud of our products.</p><h4>What makes Ron Abuelo so successful?</h4><p>The quality of our rum has a lot to do with our success. We have spent a good amount of our advertising and promotional budget just inviting people to try Abuelo, and discover everything that the brand offers. With “Añejo", the first product we introduced, we were able to produce a relatively light rum, but with much character. You can drink it neat, on the rocks, with water, or you can also make cocktails with it. It is a truly versatile product.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that Panama's exports are currently facing?</h4><p>Panama is mainly an exporter of services, with less emphasis on consumer goods. But the country has the potential to export much more than it does today. The country's geographical location is ideal, allowing for the shipping of goods from both oceans; our airport has also become an important hub for the Americas. There are generally competitive freight rates available from here. One of our main export markets for Ron Abuelo is Chile, whose main export market is the US. We ship our rum to Chile in containers that usually arrive empty from the US. For exports to become a more important part of our economy, the country in general needs to work on developing an export culture, which will take time, resources, and serious dedication. Hopefully the recently elected government will promote this effort.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bilateral trade between Turkey and South Africa was over $2 billion in 2013, chiefly in the mining and textile sectors. How has trade grown between the two states since then, and which areas of trade have proven the most important?</h4><p>In 2013 trade volume between the two countries amounted to R12billion, with South African exports accounting for R6 billion and imports from Turkey accounting for R6.3 billion of total trade. According to preliminary trade data for 2014, exports recorded an increase of 6% (from R6 billion in 2013 to R6.4 billion in 2014), while imports recorded an increase of 11% (from R6.3 billion to R7 billion). During the period 2013-2014, Mineral exports recorded an increase of 59% (from R1.9 billion to R3 billion). South African imports of textiles recorded an increase of 55% (from R538 million in 2013 to R970 million in 2014). South Africa's major exports to Turkey in 2014 included mineral fuels and ores, slag and ash, and iron and steel. Leading imports from Turkey included vehicles other than railway-related products, including tramways, machinery, and nuclear reactors. South African exports to Turkey continue to be dominated by minerals and semi-processed minerals. In this regard, the Department of Trade and Industry has undertaken several trade promotion activities to promote exports of high-value added products.</p><h4>What are some of the most beneficial aspects of the trade relationship between South Africa and Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey has a wealth of knowledge in the clothing and textile industry as well as the mineral beneficiation and jewelry sectors. Turkish companies will benefit from the need for South Africa to process its wealth of minerals into value-added products, to be utilized domestically or to be exported. Turkish experience in the machinery, textile. and construction industries can help the South African economy develop even faster.</p><div class="quote">“Turkish companies will benefit from the need for South Africa to process its wealth of minerals."</div><h4>How can South Africa facilitate access to the rest of Africa for Turkish investors?</h4><p>Economic relations between South Africa and Turkey are governed by the South Africa-Turkey Joint Economic Commission (JEC). The primary objective of the JEC is to promote and deepen bilateral trade and economic cooperation between the two countries. Trade and Investment South Africa just recently signed an MoU with ISPAT, the Turkish investment promotion agency. The objective of the agreement is to support investors from our respective countries with targeted projects. It is widely recognized that Africa is on a new growth trajectory. The continent has chosen an industrialization path driven through regional integration, infrastructure development, mineral beneficiation, and developing the agricultural value chain. Turkey already has a strong presence on the continent and by forging partnerships between companies from our two countries, and we can make an invaluable contribution to these objectives. South Africa is strategically positioned to serve as an entry point into the rest of the African continent for Turkish business. Cooperation and partnership between us will ensure that we contribute toward the promotion of the continent's interests, at both the regional and global levels.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Moody's has recently confirmed Sharjah's “A3" long-term credit rating with a stable outlook. What makes Sharjah an attractive investment destination?</h4><p>The rating is a testament to Sharjah's highly diversified economy that is not dependent on any single sector. The government of Sharjah has been working to ensure steady growth. Since the 1970s, the prime area of focus of HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan Bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, was to create an industrial zone in Sharjah itself and provide opportunities for foreign investors to establish long-term factories and businesses in Sharjah at an international level. Today, Sharjah is the industrial hub of the UAE, with almost 33% of the UAE's manufacturers located here. Nevertheless, the economy is diversified between manufacturing, publishing, logistics, healthcare, and tourism, in addition to a range of other sectors, which shows how resilient Sharjah's economy is. The government never aspired to develop beyond what is required. As a result, Sharjah's diversified economy was not primarily affected by the global financial crisis, and it has become a safe haven for a lot of investors. Today, Sharjah has close to 20 different industrial areas and two free zones—the Hamriyah Free Zone and the Sharjah Airport International Free Zone—that have played a major role in attracting foreign companies. More than 12,000 companies operate in those free zones today. This is where Shurooq comes into play, as we look to promote Sharjah and facilitate investors that are looking for long-term investment opportunities. There is a lot to be developed in Sharjah and different facilities in need of improvement, which means considerable opportunities and potential. Sharjah's strategic geographical location also plays a significant role in its ability to attract investments. It is the only Emirate with shared borders with all other Emirates, making it an ideal central location within the UAE. And even more importantly, Sharjah is the only Emirate that has direct access to both the Arabian Gulf and the Indian Ocean and boasts three ports—two on the Gulf and one on the Indian Ocean—all with excellent logistic capabilities. When you add the Emirate's excellent infrastructure to this strategic placement, it is easy to see why it is a perfect choice for a GCC and Middle Eastern hub, which elevates Sharjah's international profile. Not many investors are aware of Sharjah, yet we are slowly but steadily changing this.</p><h4>Shurooq has targeted four sectors requiring investment: tourism, environment, transport and logistics, and healthcare. Can you tell us more about the opportunities that exist in these sectors?</h4><p>The first area of growth is the transportation and logistics sector, which comprises almost 6% of GDP, and we need to increase that. Looking at the expected growth rate and what the expected market size increase is, there is a huge gap in what is available and what can be done. For tourism, our aim is to increase the current contribution of 10% to GDP. Sharjah requires almost 3,000 additional beds to cope with increasing tourist numbers, so we need more hotels and resorts. We also want to attract more passenger carriers/ cruise ships to Sharjah, and to expand the culinary offering available to tourists. Shurooq supports investors by providing them land with support for their facilities, and even connecting them to the right operators to fill those hotels in the future. We are actively trying to diversify the tourism sector to cater to all kinds of tourists, be it cultural tourists, beach tourists, or eco-tourists. We are developing eco-tourism in Kalba, beach tourism in Khorfakkan, and cultural tourism in the city of Sharjah. Healthcare is also a major area in terms of investment and development throughout the Arab world. The services are not as advanced as in Europe or Asia, so governments are trying to attract investors keen to establish their own hospitals and institutions. Most governments in the GCC have created zones, and Sharjah, too, has created the Sharjah Healthcare City, a free zone offering ample opportunities to investors. One area that we are targeting in particular is healthcare services for the elderly, where there is a huge gap between supply and demand for services. The fourth sector we focus on is the environment. We are trying to promote companies that can provide us with energy efficient products that would reduce our carbon footprint and emissions. It is a huge market that accounts for nearly $41million, and experiencing annual growth of 15%. Sharjah was the first city in the region to undertake recycling. Environmental and waste management company Bee'ah has played a major role in this sector, and we are trying to attract investors to work closely with it.</p><h4>How specifically does Shurooq facilitate investment in Sharjah?</h4><p>We create market intelligence, conduct studies, and provide investors with market data rather than simply inviting them to Sharjah. We promote Sharjah through international roadshows, and deal directly with Chambers of Commerce in many countries around the world. Furthermore, we have seminars with foreign business councils in the Emirate. However, Shurooq's role is more than just providing market intelligence. We actually work hand in hand with investors in providing land for projects and easing the process within the government departments. We don't give financial support to our investors because we believe those investors are coming ready to invest. However, we do enter into joint ventures with investors and work with local entities to facilitate the process for investors.</p><p>This interview will be published in 'The Business Year: Sharjah 2015'.

Barclays recently embarked on a recapitalization process with an injection of an equivalent of $125 million in September 2014 with the express purpose of repositioning itself for growth, to take a lead role in Corporate Banking, Debt Capital Markets (DCM) and advisory mandates in key growth sectors, while growing its Retail franchise in Prestige and Premier Segments. Our goal is to become Mozambique's 'Go-To' bank. We aim to be a trusted partner in the economic development of the country and its people. On this journey, we intend to become the employer of choice in the banking sector and build a sustainable and profitable operation.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Mozambican market for Barclays' overall strategy in Africa and worldwide?</h4><p>Africa is one of the four pillars of Barclays' strategy, as outlined by our Chief Executive Antony Jenkins in May 2014. Barclays Africa Group Limited (BAGL) is the legal entity listed in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange that consolidates the business of Barclays in the continent. At 30 June 2014, we had a market capitalization of R136.9 billion. We operate in 12 countries and have 12 million customers, and total assets of R977.8 billion, 10,749 automated teller machines, 1,287 branches and more than 42,000 permanent employees. Barclays Africa has majority stakes in banks in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania (Barclays Bank Tanzania and National Bank of Commerce), Uganda, and Zambia. It also has representative offices in Namibia and Nigeria as well as bancassurance operations in Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zambia. The creation of Barclays Africa Group gives us a strong competitive advantage. We offer our clients deep local knowledge and presence and the expertise and support of a global bank; hence, we have the ability to play a key role in empowering Africa by reducing the costs of doing business, by providing and enhancing access to the continent, and by being the bridge between local and global markets. Within the continent, Mozambique is one of the key markets for Barclays. It is amongst the countries in which the Group has invested the most in recent years and equally where it expects stronger growth. We believe that in the mid-term BBM can be among the largest businesses of Barclays Africa.</p><div class="quote">“Africa is one of the four pillars of Barclays' strategy."</div><h4>How would you describe the business environment in the country for foreign investors?</h4><p>Mozambique is quickly improving in terms of its business environment and foreign investors have very clear regulations in place and a relatively straightforward process to become established in the country. Mozambique's proximity to South Africa is an important feature when it comes to sourcing inputs and hopefully in the future also as a market for export. The major ports of Mozambique are another important factor, with Maputo, Beira, Nacala, and Pemba being strategically located. The development of services to support your business (banking, legal firms, consulting, accounting and auditing, etc.) is also making life easier for investors. Those coming from abroad appreciate the fact that well-known brands like Barclays are present in Mozambique. The political and regulatory environment has been stable for several years now and despite some uncertainty that always surrounds the electoral periods, we believe that Mozambique offers a unique opportunity for investment.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the role that Network International has played as a partner in the development of the payment service industry of the UAE?</h4><p>The vision behind Network International was to create a homegrown company with expert capabilities to service the growing demands of the financial sector in the UAE and beyond. With a strong management team, in-house expertise, and by leveraging next-generation technology, Network International has carved a niche for itself as an innovator in the payments arena within a short space of time. The company has been instrumental in transforming the payments sector in the UAE by providing the infrastructure for this industry to flourish. We are today the largest payments processor and acquirer in MENA, and the second largest in the MEA region. In addition to payments processing, nearly 60 banks across 27 countries in the MEA region use Network International for credit card issuer processing. We also offer end-to-end ATM services to several major banks in the region.</p><h4>What role does innovation play in the creation of successful products and services to meet the needs of the market?</h4><p>Our strategic growth plan and roadmap revolve around innovation. This may not just take the form of a new product or technology, but also be about adapting a technology that works well elsewhere and bringing it first to market. When it comes to payment innovation in particular, it could be about rethinking the business model, processes, product, or the way in which interaction with customers and potential customers takes place. Our aim is to be, in every sense, the leading innovative payments service provider in the emerging economies.</p><div class="quote">“Our strategic growth plan and roadmap revolve around innovation."</div><h4>What challenges do you foresee Network International facing as it continues to expand throughout the MENA region?</h4><p>The payments industry around the world continues to witness exciting developments and the Middle East and Africa markets in particular are teeming with opportunities. Although this market is one of the smallest regions in terms of a number of payment categories, such as payment volume and the number of cards in circulation, this could change as the region's payment infrastructure becomes more developed. As far as Network International is concerned, we have been able to effectively leverage our excellent performance and reputation in the UAE to tap into key markets across the region. Of course, as we pursue our aggressive growth and expansion strategy we do have to overcome our share of challenges, for instance making the necessary adjustments based on the various regulatory frameworks in different countries. However, thanks to our world-class infrastructure and highly skilled and experienced manpower, we have been able to maintain our leadership position in almost all of the markets we are present in.</p><h4>What is Network International's top-line growth strategy going forward?</h4><p>Our vision for the mid- to long-term is for Network International to become the leading provider of innovative payment solutions across the Middle East and entire Africa region. This top-line goal underlines our growth strategy. In terms of geographical expansion, while in the UAE and most of the Middle East we have been going from strength to strength, we have also been steadily building our presence in the high-potential Sub-Saharan and North Africa markets. On a day-to-day basis, the company is focused on addressing client needs through a proactive approach, aligned with the delivery of consistent, high-quality service. Simultaneously, we will continue to develop world-class products through R&amp;D, while never missing an opportunity to expand into new business lines. In addition, our underlying goal will be to consistently create value for our stakeholders and deliver sustainable competitive advantages by optimally playing our role as a technology partner, business enabler, and provider of innovative payment solutions.</p><h4>How do you see the payment solutions industry evolving in the Middle East going forward?</h4><p>The financial sector in the UAE has seen rapid evolution in recent years. We are witnessing increasing innovation among banks and financial institutions to meet the needs of sophisticated tech-savvy customers. As a result, solutions providers like us are keenly focused on creating the right infrastructure and platforms to enable these digital solutions. Payments migrate based upon customer convenience, from cash and checks that were physically handed over, and now to online payments. We have already moved to the next stage, where physical access to a computer is not necessary and customers have the option of on-the-go payments solutions via their smart devices. Identifying these next-generation payment trends and leveraging technology to increase customer convenience will shape the future of the payments industry. We will also see increasing innovation and new technologies offered to customers at the point of delivery, rather than at the point of sale.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[on-the-investment-side]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Claro has been reinvesting around 70% of its profits into developing the company. Where are you allocating that reinvestment?</h4><p>Claro has been reinvesting in its 4G network so as to meet the commitments we made at the time of the 4G spectrum auction. These commitments greatly exceeded those of our competitors in terms of the towns and communities that we intended to cover. It is critical that we build a 4G network, allowing us to offload data traffic from the 3G network so as to adequately use that spectrum, given our significant disadvantage compared to our competitors in terms of spectrum allocation. We have to serve close to 30 million subscribers with the same spectrum amount that our competitors serve far fewer subscribers with. Therefore, our reinvestment is critical not only in terms of providing a better and faster service, but also in terms of improving quality for all our users. In addition to our 4G users, our 3G network users are starting to see significant improvements in quality now that we are moving to the 4G network. This is thanks to better coverage, better movement of traffic, and better pipelines through which to serve our customers. A second major area where we have been reinvesting our earnings is in the infrastructure required to shift data traffic, namely our fiber-optic network, to connect up all base stations. The fiber optic project is coupled with the submarine cable project that we began five years ago and will provide worldwide internet connectivity to our users. This submarine cable connects Brazil to Colombia, Colombia to Jamaica, Jamaica to Miami, Miami to Mexico, and then connects back to Colombia. We are also working to increase capacity. Last year we added 600 additional base stations, or towers, and 3G to ensure that capacity was in place, while also extending coverage. As a result, data traffic is increasing YoY at a rate of 70%. On the fixed network, we are investing to connect more homes to provide fixed-service internet, TV, and telephony. The result is that the fixed and mobile networks are now a single network from a transmission perspective, employing 25,000 miles of interconnected fiber optic-cables nationwide. This also means that we have a more robust network of far greater capacity and reliability.</p><h4>You plan to offer 4G services to your current subscribers at no additional cost. How will you achieve that, and does Claro have the capacity to do so?</h4><p>We want to offer 4G services to 100% of our consumers. However for this to occur, we need a whole new coverage network. With the necessary infrastructure in place, where 4G is not available, the customer's device will pick 3G, or 2G. Today, our 4G coverage has reached 55% of homes and businesses throughout Colombia within a year, and we aim for 100%. Of course, none of this helps if people are not using devices that are 4G enabled. We used to be able to subsidize these devices, but currently a regulatory restriction forbids this practice. In response, we are implementing an aggressive sales campaign for phones and installment payments. Today you can get a smartphone deal with us for just $1.70 a month. This allows people to access data on their smartphones quicker, which is in both our and the consumer's interest, as they get better access to a data device that can use a 4G network. Therefore, the installment programs that enable consumers to access the 4G network are just as important as having a good 4G network in place. Our role is essentially to make technology accessible and useful to consumers nationwide and across all social strata.</p><div class="quote">“We work with the public sector in a variety of ways."</div><h4>How are you working with the public sector to improve connectivity?</h4><p>We work with the public sector in a variety of ways, because ultimately our interests converge. Installing the fiber-optic network across the country, implementing the 4G network, increasing data mobility, and introducing faster and more widespread internet access benefits Colombia overall, and these projects are also in line with the government's own plans to develop the IT sector and increase broadband connectivity. This year, we have issued significant subsidies in education, with 300,000 tablets being delivered to students of lower socio-economic status. We have also developed a platform called Educlick, which is the Wikipedia of education in Colombia, enabling teachers to upload five-minute lessons that can be shared nationwide. There is much more to be done and ways to use the network for education in Colombia, and we hope to be at the forefront of new projects like that. Another area where we are active is healthcare. Claro is tapping into some of the developments that Fundación Slim has done in Mexico. There is no such foundation in Colombia, but we are adopting the model to, for example, reduce infant mortality.</p><h4>How do you assess the level of competition in this sector in Colombia?</h4><p>There are nine mobile and 20 fixed operators in Colombia, so the competition is stiff. In terms of what differentiates us in telecommunications in Colombia, I would say that Claro has clearly led on the investment side, even through particularly depressed times where investments were scarce, and in some of the toughest parts of the country. But we did that through our 20-year commitment to investing in this country and to driving technological growth and development across Colombia. I think there's no better contribution to competition other than to compete. Our efforts have driven our competition to keep up with us, and to offer the services that we offer. As the government makes spectrum available to everyone, the competition is also increasing, and other multinationals are starting to invest in Colombian telecommunications. Thus, private entities have the task of delivering and creating opportunities, to deliver value to consumers, to invest in delivering that value, and ultimately reap the rewards of those investments.</p><h4>What targeted services and advantages do you offer SMEs in Colombia?</h4><p>Claro has made massive investments, and is now in the process of expanding capacity in terms of data centers, where we have made investments to host cloud services not just for SMEs, including renting software like the Microsoft 365, but also for hosting PBX services on the cloud. The country is still in the process of adapting to these new technologies, but investments have been made to ensure a smooth transition with adequate data centers in place.</p><h4>What do you see as your major objectives and challenges over the coming years?</h4><p>The objective is to significantly improve the consumers' experience. We have to create as many channels of communication as we can in order to make the interaction process as simple as possible. A new interactive channel that we are delivering, for example, is allowing people to conduct a whole variety of transactions from their handset or smartphone. We see millions of transactions executed every month through that new channel, and are trying to make the system as usable and accessible as possible. We also have over 100,000 subscribers for Claro Video, which provides on-demand TV and movie content. Meanwhile, Claro Música enables the streaming of music. So these all provide easy access that our users can tailor to their personal needs.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are new businesses currently developing in Ecuador and which sectors are most appealing to investors?</h4><p>There are several sectors in strategic development areas that are supported by the government, which of course will be attractive at first to new investors. That is what the government is aiming for in the future—bigger investments in sectors like healthcare, energy, tourism, agroindustry, and several others. There are still several obstacles and contradictions investors face when entering the country, but the government's aim is to streamline procedures for these strategic areas. Other areas such as the food and beverage sectors have also proven to attract large investments to Ecuador over the past few years.</p><h4>Ecuador recently promoted its tourism offering at the Super Bowl, becoming the first Andean country to do so during this event. What impact will this have on the tourist movements between the two countries?</h4><p>The largest group of tourists arrives from the US, and these visitors also spend the most while here, which is why it was a great idea to promote the country at the Super Bowl. This promotion, though expensive, is vital to increasing Ecuador's global visibility. Even before that campaign, the amount of tourism in the country from 2013 to 2014 had grown substantially, even among people from the US. One of our objectives now is to follow up and continue to inspire the curiosity potential tourists.</p><div class="quote">“Education should be a factor of importance between the US and Ecuador."</div><h4>In which areas do you feel that commercial agreements are needed?</h4><p>I think that Ecuador took a crucial step in signing an agreement with the EU, which should clear the path for more agreements in the future. This is the only way that Ecuador will be able to grow according to plans detailed by the government. These trade agreements should improve Ecuador's relationship with our diplomatic counterparts in other countries.</p><h4>In what other areas apart from trade could Ecuador and the US cooperate?</h4><p>Education should be a factor of importance between the US and Ecuador. Many students from Ecuador study in the US—some can afford to pay out of pocket, some receive financial aid, and others have scholarships from Ecuador. What is also good is that many students from the US favor an exchange with the opportunity to study in Ecuador. We should make a greater effort on this as a Chamber and as a nation. Other important areas of cooperation include energy and mining sectors.</p><h4>What opportunities does Ecuador offer foreign investors?</h4><p>We have a country rich in many ways beyond commodities such as oil, despite its weight in the economy. There is much tourism investment potential in Ecuador in infrastructure over the coming years. Ecuador is also a top destination for expatriates entering retirement, which should in turn bring visiting friends and relatives. Elsewhere, agriculture has been, for quite some time, a large contributor to the Ecuadorian economy and there is considerable potential to develop the agro-industrial sector. An example of this is happening with the chocolate industry, which is particularly interesting. We are no longer exporting traditional coco beans, but also semi-finished or finished products. We have been developing chocolate for export to Europe, which already has a highly developed sense of taste in chocolate that differs considerably from our market, or even that of the US and is a very specialized final product. And in the energy sector, alternative energy sources are an interesting proposition in terms of solar-powered energy, in addition to the hydroelectric plants being widely developed.</p><h4>What institutional reforms are needed in order to develop Ecuador's economic policy both in the public and private arenas?</h4><p>One prerequisite for any investor before committing is confidence. You have to develop confidence, which is not easy. This can only come over time and is demonstrated by positive experience. Ecuador has much to do to reassure investors that their investment is safely in reliable hands. Existing laws require major overhauls to foster this sense of trust. The judicial system has modernized notably, which is important. However, some laws that are less than friendly to investment remain in force. It is not always clear whether the government is aware of how investment should be approached because it hasn't traditionally done so in the past.</p><h4>In what specific ways does the AMCHAM plan to promote bilateral trade between Ecuador and the US this year?</h4><p>The first task is for the Chamber to become fully conversant with the ever-changing regulatory environment of both Ecuador and the US such that our affiliates can use us as the mediator for doing business. Indeed, we intend to become the primary option for them, which is a core challenge for 2015. And clearly, our relationship with the government and other chambers or associations is also a challenge to address this year. We will be structuring new services to complement the needs of our current members and of course the potential new ones from Ecuador or the USA.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2014 for Grupo Expansion?</h4><p>Simply put, 2014 was a fantastic year for us. Grupo Expansion was purchased by an investment fund, the Southern Cross Group, and after nine years we are no longer subsidiaries of Time Warner. Over the past two years, our plans had been to grow exponentially, but our strategy had differed from Time Warner's. This has been a major shift for us because we are now in hands of company aimed at high growth through Grupo Expansion. Regarding our performance, it was a challenging environment as the media business is highly indexed to the performance of the national economy, and last year Mexico did not meet its GDP growth target. On the other hand, we have been particularly successful in terms of audience. In 2010 we changed our strategy to become a multi-platform content brand, and have risen from 11 million readers per month to 32 million.</p><h4>What strategies were deployed to achieve the abovementioned rise?</h4><p>The key change came from changes implemented in 2007. We transitioned our content to digital, having assumed a pure digital approach. Even though we have over 20 magazines, the bulk of our network is online, while 80% of our audience is digital. This means that only 20% of our readership is paper-based, which is the source of the prestige we currently enjoy.</p><div class="quote">“Simply put, 2014 was a fantastic year for us."</div><h4>How does Grupo Expansion's digital strategy attract new readers?</h4><p>When we began to consider how to implement our digital strategy back in 2006, we decided to create a media network. In other words, instead of creating a website and dividing it into different sections, we made the decision to create one site for each media outlet. It works rather like the arms of an octopus linked to a central body, so to speak. Thus, we first created CNN Expansión for economic information, we created a sports website, and another website for the real estate and construction industry, and so on. Currently we are working on our second digital wave and are focused on developing lifestyle content. This kind of content is more interactive, and attracts an audience that is more prone to participating and engaging with the content creators. Our goal is to continue walking this path, and gradually develop content and media outlets for each reader. In fact, the ultimate aim is to allow the user to customize the content they see to their personal interests and likes.</p><h4>What trends have you observe in the journalism industry in Mexico?</h4><p>There are three trends that are occupying reader's attention nowadays. Most notable is the fact that today the users themselves generates content, often brilliantly on blogs. Secondly, video is taking over, to the extent that it is estimated that by 2020, most of the data exchanged will be visual. In that regard, we have to develop into an audiovisual company. And the third trend is the rise of mobile content, where we realize that it is not enough to simply transfer existing content onto mobile platforms. That is a mistake. We have to create specific content for mobile phones, because people these days are glued to their mobile devices. Hence, we have to be able to generate attractive content for their consumption.</p><h4>What are the main priorities for Grupo Expansion over the coming years?</h4><p>We have the most recognized media brand in the country and there are many ways to still grow and increase visibility. Even though we have 26 brands in the group, there are segments that we haven't attacked yet, and our target for the coming years is to further understand our audiences. In doing so, we will be able to identify market niches and create media options that interest them.</p><h4>What impact has the worldwide media crisis had in Mexico?</h4><p>I have to say that in Mexico, the disruption that the digital platforms created in traditional media was less severe because the readership levels were not as high as in other countries. People spend less time reading newspapers in Mexico than in the US or certain European countries. In that regard, the media crisis barely registered in the country and did not undercut the stability of the Mexican market. Our products have high-levels of subscription, and do not depend on being sold on the street as much as some media outlets in Europe or in the US. In spite of the rise of digital media, I do not anticipate paper copies disappearing. The news and information contained in newspapers is more focused on specific information, and has a more analytical understanding. On the other hand, the information that we provide in the media is a brief review of what is happening at the moment, and I see the digital media wining in that field.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the idea of establishing Transmed arise, and how has the company evolved since it was founded in 1946?</h4><p>My grandfather founded the company nearly 70 years ago. He was very interested in commerce, and traveled to the US to see what the consumer trends were. He brought some items from the US to sell in Lebanon and that's how the business started. He established partnerships with various multinationals like Procter &amp; Gamble, Mars, and Clorox, and he grew steadily in Lebanon before expanding into Jordan in 1975, the UAE in 1977, and then other markets in the rest of the Levant, as well as East and West Africa. Today, Transmed is present in 10 markets worldwide with on-the-ground operations, and we work with about 40 multinationals, distributing their fast-moving goods on an exclusive basis in these markets.</p><h4> </h4><h4>What trends in the industry are you currently seeing in Lebanon and how does Transmed respond to them to better serve its clients?</h4><p>Transmed is basically an extension of the partners that we work with, whether it's Procter &amp; Gamble, Mars, Kellogg's, Clorox, Sysco, Mondelez, or any other company or brand. We are the sales and distribution arm of those companies. They are not really present on the ground there, but they support all our marketing and advertising activities to build their brands, while we handle the trade and all key accounts, import the products, and distribute them. In terms of keeping a finger on the pulse of trends, we get firsthand contact with consumers. Certain trends do stand out; for example, most households that consume the products we distribute are double income households where both the man and woman are in work. That leads to growth in demand for products that are easy to use, easy to handle, and convenient, because those are the kinds of products that people with limited time most appreciate.</p><h4> </h4><h4>How do you ensure that each product gets the best promotional exposure from your sales teams?</h4><p>We make sure not to sell conflicting brands, although some of our principles can have two or three brands with the same category—but brands that cater to different markets and consumers. For example, we distribute three kinds of detergent, namely Ariel, Bonux, and Tide. These three brands cater to different consumers. Ariel is the best cleaning detergent on the market, and the most expensive of the three, whereas Bonux is more affordable, with Tide somewhere in between. So they cater to different income groups, but we would never have two brands or two Principals that directly compete with each other in the same territory. We make sure we have dedicated focus by principle and by channel. We have one team that covers modern trade (MT), one that covers middle trade, and another that covers the small stores and bakkalas.</p><h4> </h4><h4>What is Transmed's approach to human capital?</h4><p>We hire fresh graduates and promote them from within. Very few companies do this, and we take pride in what we do. This creates a unique corporate culture at Transmed. If you go to our various offices around the world and ask our executives what their first job was, many of them will say Transmed. Today, we have about eight general managers in those markets and most have been recruited straight from university, be it AUB, LAU, and so on. We have about 30 nationalities at Transmed. We have also developed a partnership with the London Business School whereby every year we send our top 25 executives to work with leading professors working on case studies that are similar to our businesses. The LBS is the second ranked business school globally, so this is a very important partnership for us.</p><h4> </h4><h4>What type of partnerships are you looking for to strengthen your core distribution business?</h4><p>We tend to operate alone most of the time in our other markets, relying on our own skill sets. We regularly transfer people between the various markets, and believe that the wide experience this promotes helps us better serve consumers and clients. Having said that, should a partnership opportunity arise somewhere, we gladly assess it.</p><h4> </h4><h4>What is the importance of the UAE for Transmed?</h4><p>The UAE is our largest market, and the second largest market by GDP, after Saudi Arabia in our region. It's really the backbone of our company. We've been there since 1976, and our market shares are very high in the UAE, up to even 80% in some categories. The trade structure in the UAE is different from most other markets, being up to 76% modern trade, mostly supermarkets and hypermarkets. We have been witnessing double- digit growth in the UAE, year after year. The market is growing as the population continues to grow; there is considerable spending power, a vibrant consumer culture, malls, restaurants, businesses, entertainment, and so on.</p><h4> </h4><h4>What opportunities do you see in West Africa and what is your growth strategy in the region?</h4><p>We entered the African market seven or eight years ago, beginning with Sudan. Since establishing ourselves in East Africa we have expanded into West Africa, and are on the ground in three regional markets; Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Ghana. We also cover several markets including Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali, Gambia, and Cape Verde, and have distribution relationships in all of them, with an export team based in Accra, Ghana. Consumers are all quite similar; everyone washes their hair, brushes their teeth, washes their clothes, and enjoys a biscuit or a chocolate. But you do have to cater to different consumers in terms of affordability; GDP per capital in West Africa is far less than what it is in the Gulf and GCC. In the UAE you have GDP per capital at around $43,000, while in West Africa it's somewhere between $1,500-$2,000. So you can't provide the same detergent, shampoo, or diaper. That is the main challenge we face in West Africa, although we expect continue expanding there, and are now looking at other markets in West Africa.</p><h4> </h4><h4>How do you envisage Transmed's future trajectory?</h4><p>We will remain true to our core competencies and will always be engaged in consumer goods, food, and logistics services. We will also always look to partner new principals and move into fresh markets. Our main focus for expansion is Africa. But once we have maximized our presence there next region to look at will likely be Eastern Europe.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the immediate and long-term benefits of Colombia's potential accession to the OECD?</h4><p>We work with our member countries to help them establish better policies that provide better lives for their citizens. The accession process gives Colombia the opportunity to undertake a comprehensive diagnosis of its public policies vis-í -vis the OECD's best practices. It is also an opportunity to accelerate structural reforms and upgrade its legal and regulatory frameworks to increase their effectiveness. For instance, the OECD has recently provided in-depth comments and suggestions on different sections of Colombia's next National Development Plan. But this is a two-way street, where learning from peers is also an important aspect of OECD membership. Our member countries will therefore benefit from Colombia's policy experience in dealing with its economic and social challenges.</p><h4>What fundamental regulatory reforms must be undertaken to promote inclusive growth in Colombia?</h4><p>Colombia's economy has done remarkably well over the past decade. Strong growth was driven by an oil and mining boom, and by foreign direct investment in the commodity sector and broad-based investment. This has allowed for fast catch-up in GDP per capita relative to OECD economies. However, income inequality and labor informality remain high. Poverty has declined, but old-age poverty is significantly higher than in most Latin American countries. Fewer than 40% of all Colombians have an old-age pension and half of the elderly live below the national extreme poverty line. The government provides old-age income support for the poor through the Colombia Mayor program, but that, too, is below the poverty line. An in-depth reform of the pensions system and old-age income support is required to increase coverage and equity. The minimum wage is high relative to the average wage, pushing low-skilled workers, youth, and those in less developed regions into the informal sector. Keeping minimum wage growth close to inflation would help with tackling informality. Furthermore, and despite real progress, unemployment remains high. Meanwhile, limited access to pre-primary and tertiary education for underprivileged households reduces opportunities for upward mobility. The tax system is largely regressive and does little to reduce income inequality. A comprehensive tax reform is needed to increase fairness, growth and revenues to finance better social policies and investment in skills.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia's economy has done remarkably well over the past decade."</div><h4>How should Colombia adapt to plummeting petrol prices?</h4><p>The Colombian economy needs to diversify beyond the oil and mining sector. The fading commodity boom requires policy action to sustain growth. Investment beyond the natural resource sector is needed to create formal jobs and reduce the high levels of income inequality. A comprehensive tax reform is needed. The gradual elimination of the net wealth tax on businesses approved in December 2014 was a step in the right direction. However, more can and should be done. In particular, a gradual reduction in corporate tax rates, broadening the corporate tax base by eliminating special regimes and taxing capital income more at the individual level, would boost investment and make the tax system more progressive. More investment in transport infrastructure, as well as reforms to improve the business climate, such as a better enforcement of bureaucratic procedures, improved monitoring of institutions vulnerable to corruption, and further reduction in barriers to trade and competition in product markets would also contribute positively.</p><h4>What can be done to reduce tax evasion in Colombia, and how serious an obstacle is this to inclusive growth? What other fiscal reforms ought to be prioritized?</h4><p>Widespread tax evasion is a significant drag on tax revenues. Official estimates are currently at around 25%, amounting to around 2% of GDP. While part of the high evasion reflects the overall high informality of the economy, institutional weaknesses in the tax and customs administration are also to blame. Strengthening and modernizing the tax administration (DIAN) would help reduce tax evasion. Tax revenues comprise about 20% of GDP, which is low compared to other Latin American countries and the OECD average. Lower oil revenues and the expiration of a number of taxes are straining the budget at a time when social and development spending needs are rising. Meanwhile, heavy reliance on corporate income taxes reduces investment. At the same time, the redistributive impact of taxation is reduced because firms, rather than households pay most income and wealth taxes. All of this leads us to believe that Colombia needs a comprehensive tax reform that boosts revenues and shifts the tax burden to support more inclusive and green growth. Tax loopholes and exemptions that reduce the tax base and mainly favor the rich should also be reduced significantly.</p><h4>One area where Colombia is significantly lagging in terms of OECD accession indicators is private sector-funded R&amp;D. What can be done to improve this?</h4><p>Colombia's innovation system needs to be strengthened. Gross R&amp;D expenditure is only 0.2% of GDP, compared with 1.2% in Brazil and a 2.4% average in the OECD area. Other measures of innovation, such as patent registrations and scientific publications per capita, place Colombia below regional peers such as Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. Colombia's innovation system lacks a strong business core as a result of which business R&amp;D expenditure relative to GDP is negligible in relation to the size of its economy, and only 30% of total R&amp;D is undertaken by the business sector, compared to 65-70% in leading OECD countries. Policy has thus far emphasized support for research-driven enterprises and university-industry linkages. This is important, but the potential for innovation goes far beyond such entities, and includes the broader base of small and medium-sized enterprises and young firms. Access to finance also represents a major constraint for the creation, survival and growth of small firms, especially innovative ones. Policy measures have recently been introduced in the business sector to alleviate financial constraints while fostering innovation and productivity. Raising the level of business innovation will require further investment in skills, particularly engineering, design, management as well as information and communication technology (ICT). Policymakers need to promote an environment of mobility between firms and public research institutes, facilitate student placements in industry and foster increased business investment in human resources. In addition to focusing on doctoral graduates and other high-level skills, more attention should be devoted to professional technical degrees.</p><p>Click <a>here</a> to see the Economic Survey of Colombia 2015.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[clever-adjustments]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In your view, what proactive structural adjustments should be made to the Malaysian economy to ensure its resilience to a challenging external environment?</h4><p>We have diversified our economy over the years to ensure that we are not overly reliant on any one sector or economic activity. There was a time when Malaysia was predominantly dependent on the commodity and agriculture sectors. Yet over the years we have promoted and developed other non-commodity based and agricultural sectors of the economy, which today have become more dominant. For example, the services sector now makes up 55% of GDP, while the manufacturing sector makes up a further 25%. The construction sector contributes 4%, while the mining and agriculture sectors make up 8% and 7%, respectively. At the same time, we have also reduced our reliance on oil and gas revenues, which at one time accounted for over 40% of total government revenues. We have deliberately reduced this level to the point where it is now below the 30% mark. Having said that, we remain a net exporter of oil and gas. Therefore, with the current slump in oil and gas prices, total government revenues will decline. Thus, we need to make the necessary adjustments in terms of the 2015 budget. And this is exactly what we did on January 20, 2015, when the Right Honorable Prime Minister announced measures to deal with the “new norm" in terms of the lower prices of crude oil and gas, market volatility, and changing global circumstances. When it comes to adapting to the lower level of income, we will also have to make decisions as to precisely where expenditures should be cut. We have made the decision not to cut our development expenditures, as these are crucial to sustaining broader economic performance. What we can do instead is optimize our operating expenditure, where we plan for savings of RM5.5 billion.</p><h4>How would you assess the success of the Tenth Malaysia Plan?</h4><p>We are essentially on track with the broader objectives of the plan, which is anchored on the New Economic Model (NEM). We have focused on three core components of NEM, namely high income, inclusiveness, and sustainability. With respect to high income, we have set a target of $15,000 gross national income (GNI) per capita to be achieved by 2020. Based on our progress to date, we have crossed the $10,000 level, and if we remain on track, we will be able to reach the target as early as 2018. In the case of inclusiveness, we want to make sure that as Malaysia achieves economic progress no one is left behind. This is approached from a number of perspectives. Firstly, we need to increase household income, and we have been able to do this through our efforts at improving productivity and introducing a minimum wage framework. For sustainability, it is not just a question of how we treat the environment or manage our natural resources, but also involves effective management of government finances. In managing Malaysia's natural resources, as much as we are blessed with oil and gas, we need to ensure that we are extracting less than the new reserves being discovered. We are happy that we have been able to maintain our oil reserves that can last us for a further 28 years and gas reserves that can last us for another 42 years. In terms of managing government finances, we realized that, during a crisis, there was a need for the government to prime the economy, which resulted in a much higher deficit of 6.7% of GDP in 2009. Such deficits are unsustainable, whereupon we embarked on a fiscal consolidation program. We are now working to achieve a balanced budget by 2020. We have consistently reduced the deficit over time, and in 2012 we reduced it to 4.5%. In 2013 it was at 3.9%, and in 2014 it was further reduced to 3.5%. This year we had targeted a reduction in fiscal deficit to 3%, but given low oil prices, we have since revised that target to 3.2%. As part of managing government finances, one of the key measures is the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), effective April 1 of this year. This will broaden our revenue base significantly. Although net income to be generated for this year will be approximately RM1 billion, there are other indirect benefits to GST such as enhanced tax compliance, which will further boost government revenues.</p><div class="quote">“We have diversified our economy over the years."</div><h4>What will the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) mean for Malaysian businesses and the local economy?</h4><p>Malaysia is not a large country. We have a population of 30 million, and a GDP of RM1 trillion. But if you look at the larger ASEAN economy, this population of 30 million will be amplified 20 times to 600 million people. Furthermore, the demography of the AEC is relatively young and growing, while rising urbanization spells growth in household incomes. ASEAN as a region is also growing at a consistent rate of 6% per annum. And in terms of GDP, we are talking about a sizeable economy of $2.4 trillion. In the AEC, one will have access to not just a bigger market, but also to one that is growing in terms of income and wealth. For the people and businesses in Malaysia, it is about having access to a much bigger market than what we have domestically. We also live in a digital age where many interactions and transactions may be done online. A physical local presence is no longer essential when exporting, given the potential for e-commerce. These factors underpin our excitement at being in ASEAN.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

The Ministry draws its strategy from these four pillars, bearing in mind creating a generation of citizens confident in their leadership abilities, in their land, in their homeland, and in the potential of their State to strengthen the union through this generation; hence, it could not only keep up with the developments, but to lead and always be in the foreground, and the road to this is knowledge and sustainable knowledge in all areas of life. We developed our strategic plan for 2014-2016 in order to contribute to the achievement of the knowledge society and the development of higher education and scientific research in the state. In addition to the establishment of the National Committee for Scholarships, with the aim of ensuring complementarity and coordination between scholarship authorities in the state, we aim to guide the system of scholarships and grants in line with the laws of the Ministry and to develop a strategy and performance indicators for the scholarship system to meet the needs of the labor market in the State. The signing of several agreements and memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with countries that have pioneering experiences in higher education and scientific research to raise the e-readiness and transformation of our services into smart services for more convenience for the customer have increased well-being and happiness indicators in the UAE under the guidance and initiatives of our wise leadership.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for educators, entrepreneurs, investors, and education businesses in the higher education sector in the UAE?</h4><p>The higher education system is a consistently integrated system; any change that occurs in one of the paths is definitely followed by change in other paths; the UAE market is a promising market and an attractive environment. In addition to local investments, foreign investment in the state reached $14.4 billion in the year 2014. Education and communication technology is considered one of the sectors with the most investment. The UAE is the first among Arab countries in attracting FDI due to sustainable infrastructure, pro-business legislation and regulations, safety and security, and harmony between more than 200 nationalities living in the UAE. In addition to a State-led green economy initiative regionally and its adoption of green technology, this means growing opportunities for innovation, scientific research, inventions, and academic study in the various fields of science. The state attracts prestigious top universities to set up branches in the UAE, and studies indicate that the number of students in GCC countries is continuously growing, and it is expected to reach 11.6 million in 2016. And through local or international exhibitions held in the state, which specialize in education and employment, the UAE environment is one of the most attractive environments for investment in education, and investment in some Emirates is expected to grow by 60% by the year 2020.</p><div class="quote">“All the affairs of higher education and scientific research are continually discussed under the umbrella of the Federal National Council."</div><h4>What sort of legislative reforms have been key to the education sector's development in the UAE?</h4><p>All the affairs of higher education and scientific research are continually discussed under the umbrella of the Federal National Council, and take all appropriate decisions consistent with the vision and ambition of the UAE in cooperation with the relevant institutions and bodies. The Ministry does not work in isolation; on the contrary, it is the federal agency most interconnected with others, and the proposals submitted by the Ministry or other relevant actors are discussed in order to develop or update some systems so as to improve and keep up with changes on the global education front, however big or small these proposals might be.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key principles that guide you in leading such an influential organization?<br></h4><p>Our aim at Qatar Foundation is to positively contribute to the Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) by “Unlocking Human Potential." It is with this principle of developing our people and our future leaders that we established our three pillars of education, science, and community development. By placing emphasis on these areas, our aim is to build a knowledge-based economy that will benefit not only Qatar, but also the region and the world. Qatar Foundation focuses on bringing world-class education, work experience, and career opportunities to our country in order to enable people of all ages to contribute to the country's future. Additionally, we are firmly committed to excelling at R&amp;D.</p><h4>How do you organize your operations in order to achieve the long-term goals set by the QNV 2030?</h4><p>The QNV 2030 has given Qatar Foundation the exciting challenge of being the “engine" driving the development of Qatar's community. We organize our operations by making people central to our country's transformation into a modern knowledge-based economy. By using our three pillars, our efforts are developing human resources. Whether it is furthering our work in education, R&amp;D, or community engagement, empowering our people is central to everything we do. One of my roles as the President of Qatar Foundation is to ensure that every member of our organization continues to play a fundamental role in achieving the key pillars and vision set forth by Qatar's leadership. Keeping people engaged and working toward our collective aim to transform Qatar into a knowledge-based economy by 2030 is what will keep us on track to achieve our goal.</p><h4>Qatar Foundation has become a globally known institute. Through which initiatives is the foundation aiming to have an impact at a global level?</h4><p>Qatar Foundation has a number of exciting initiatives that are having an impact globally. In particular, we are extremely proud of the progress we are making with our World Innovation Summit for Health (WISH) and World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) initiatives. Both are fully aligned with the mission and vision of Qatar Foundation and the QNV 2030, while also serving to highlight Qatar's growing role as an emerging center for innovation in healthcare and education. Our work with WISH aims to promote and facilitate innovation in the delivery of healthcare around the globe. To do this, we bring together a distinguished audience of leaders, key decision-makers, and influencers of global health systems and policy, including heads of state, ministers, senior government officials, academics, and strategic thinkers. We also invite the most influential business leaders in order to stimulate the implementation of practical, sustainable, and innovative solutions to tackle global health challenges. To date, I am proud to report we have already successfully launched a number of invaluable and unprecedented initiatives—from biomedical research to maternal health and clinical care. With our other equally important endeavor, WISE, we are focused on placing innovative education at the forefront of the global agenda. Qatar Foundation established this particular initiative in 2009, under the patronage of Her Highness Sheikha Moza Bint Nasser, the Chairperson of the Qatar Foundation. We understand that education is the key to addressing many tough challenges that face our global community, such as poverty, conflict, inequality, unemployment, and environmental sustainability. Rarely addressed in both policy and the classroom, we seek to revitalize education by providing a global platform for the development of new ideas and solutions. We host an annual summit and year-round activities in an effort to bring together stakeholders from 200 countries. Through WISE, our goal is to encourage people to share and collaborate on creative ideas that will address key challenges facing education. Currently, the educational system is outdated in many parts of the world. And in order to progress and meet the needs of future generations, change needs to occur. At Qatar Foundation, we strive to contribute to human development nationally, regionally, and internationally. Therefore, it is important for us to keep education and healthcare at the top of the agenda.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main objectives of the Qatar National Research Strategy (QNRS)?<br></h4><p>The QNRS was introduced in 2012. It guides all R&amp;D investments in Qatar, and provides a national framework to align the country's priorities with stakeholder capabilities and interests. The strategy is the culmination of an inclusive, wide-ranging consultation with diverse groups of national stakeholders and partners, and is being implemented collaboratively by Qatar Foundation's (QF's) research institutes, universities, service providers, government, industry, and funders. We are seeking to create a cycle of innovation in Qatar from research to commercialization. This new culture of innovation is an important part of Qatar's vision to move to a post-carbon, knowledge-based economy. Our R&amp;D programs are designed to be an inclusive system with several specific goals. First and foremost, we want to develop the capabilities of our people and institutions. Equipped with these capabilities, we seek to improve the health and social well being of Qatar's population, support Qatar's distinctive culture, the security of its people, and preserve and improve the natural and built environment.</p><h4>What are the key phases in the trajectory toward completing the QNRS?</h4><p>Over the next five years, Qatar Foundation Research &amp; Development (QF R&amp;D) is eager to continue building human capacity at all levels, expanding our national and international outreach efforts and solidifying our research infrastructure in Qatar. As we develop a research culture in Qatar, the QNRS intentionally focuses on a small number of grand challenges. We have worked with stakeholders across disciplines, institutions, and sectors to identify the R&amp;D grand challenges that are important to Qatar but also have potential global impact. The grand challenges we are focusing on are: water security, energy security, cyber security, and integrated healthcare. We are developing comprehensive plans to address each R&amp;D challenge. As we implement these plans, we will continue to promote a research culture that values partnerships across research institutions. We also will strive to ensure, where practical, that our research moves along the innovation value chain toward full application and commercialization.</p><h4>QF R&amp;D works through partnerships with researchers who seek funding. How do you select your partners?</h4><p>QF R&amp;D continuously encourages the participation and collaboration of stakeholders that include academia, government, research institutions, and private companies. Our partners share our strong values of accountability. We also share a commitment to the highest standards of research quality to tackle the nation's challenges and create a sustainable future. Competitive funding for research projects is provided through the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF). We fund researchers with creative ideas who we believe can find innovative approaches that can address QNRS goals in health, energy, environment, computing, social sciences, and the humanities. Collectively, our researchers are transforming Qatar into an international hub for research and innovation.</p><h4>The Qatar Science &amp; Technology Park celebrates its fifth anniversary in 2014. How do you assess its achievements in these inaugural years and how do you see it developing in the near future?</h4><p>We are proud of the Qatar Science &amp; Technology Park's (QSTP) achievements. Its goal is to take different types of research from transition and innovation, all the way to commercialization, which will eventually contribute to Qatar's economic development. Our various research partners in Qatar are all involved in this process, but they work at different stages. Since its establishment, QSTP continues on the path of commercialization of research by facilitating the transformation and development of promising ideas into viable technologies and enterprises. Although it is crucial to provide funding for R&amp;D, it is just as important to ensure that productive outcomes and valuable products that result from R&amp;D are properly commercialized for the benefit of both Qatar and the global community. QSTP plays a unique role here, helping drive Qatar's R&amp;D through the entire innovation value chain from basic and applied research to entrepreneurial commercialization and marketing. As QSTP continues to refine its institutional focus for advanced outcomes, it serves an increasingly essential role within Qatar Foundation's R&amp;D enterprise. As our research program grows, we are excited about QSTP's ability to continue supporting the commercialization of homegrown technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which recent accomplishments give you the assurance that Qatar University (QU) is improving its overall performance?<br></h4><p>Among a number of performance indicators that include achieving international accreditation for most of our academic programs from prestigious international bodies, as well as international awards in several non-academic areas, and progress in offering new graduate programs, I would point to the exponential growth in QU's research output. This is not just to say that we are now conducting more research, but also that the quality and focus of this research is improving, especially after launching our ambitious five-year roadmap and research priorities. In 2012, a study found that QU has had a compound annual growth rate of 28.7% in research output between 2007 and 2011, making it the fastest in the Middle East in terms of research growth. The growth rate has since risen to 37.8%, and the number of publications in internationally peer-reviewed journals is climbing. We have also grown in graduate offerings, with 26 programs up from only four in 2008. All of this is to indicate growth in programs and research output both of which influence the quality and preparedness of our graduates. As the national university, this translates into value-added to both Qatar's knowledge-based economy goals and development in the country's vibrant job market. Employers have increased confidence in the qualifications of our graduates, and we enjoy growing support from a wide range of partners, many of whom have themselves provided training and internship opportunities during the students' tenure at QU.</p><h4>Technology is completely reshaping the way the education sector operates. What is QU's strategy in addressing this development?</h4><p>QU has embraced technology in all areas of its administrative, academic, and research infrastructure. We are conscious of the need to stay at the forefront of changing trends in teaching and learning technologies. We have implemented a series of tools to empower students in their learning and to provide faculty with technology resources that add value to their teaching approaches. We established a Chair in Technology-Enabled Learning as part of our mission to produce well-educated, technology-savvy graduates prepared to make the best use of evolving technologies in furthering their personal and career interests. In terms of online courses, we are following with interest the international debate on the effectiveness of distance education, and we will continue to assess this approach in line with our specific context. Our current philosophy is that for most subjects, the classroom experience cannot quite yet be matched by the virtual classroom. Additionally, the campus environment is enriching the students in many ways beyond academic education.</p><h4>An interesting characteristic of the QU student population is the high rate of Qatari nationals and female enrolment. How do you interpret those numbers and how will it reflect on the future of Qatar?</h4><p>Indeed nationals constitute around 60% of our student body, which is a good percentage considering Qatar's demographic profile. This is a result of attentive efforts by the university to prioritize nationals in the admissions process. As a public university, it is our focus to enable and empower our citizens. At the same time, we are mindful of the value of diversity in higher education and believe that accepting a select group of highly motivated non-nationals enriches both the classroom and student life. As for the gender divide, having more women than men in higher education is not exclusive to QU, but it certainly is more accentuated here. This phenomenon has been attributed to social and economic factors including the availability of other career paths for men that are generally less available to women such as the military, police, or studying abroad. We would like to see greater gender balance in higher education. This is a national challenge that we address in collaboration with the relevant government entities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The QOC coordinates the action of various projects and work groups in order to optimize efficiency and deliver optimum outcomes, allowing for the overall promotion of sport in Qatar either at the community, grassroots, or elite level.</p><h4>What steps has Qatar made on its way to becoming an international sports destination in 2014?</h4><p>We are pleased to see that our sports events agenda is getting longer year to year, and the 2014/2015 agenda has reached a new height with over 100 sporting events including more than 42 international major events in various sports, such as the Swimming World Championships in December 2014 and the World Handball Championships for men in January 2015, in addition to other regular annual events in tennis, athletics, golf, and more. Our objective is to reach the target of 50 major international sporting events by the year 2020.</p><h4>How would you characterize professional Qatari sportsmen and women, and how do you aim to increase their number in the future?</h4><p>In the elite sports sector, we are satisfied with the progress that our professional Qatari sportsmen and women have achieved recently in their performance at high-level competitions. We are happy that a number of athletes who came out of the Aspire Academy for Sport Excellence have already performed at the highest level, such as our high jumper, Muataz Barsham, as well some of the young female athletes at the Arab and Asian levels. We are confident that this progress will continue, especially with the expectations from our leading Schools Olympic Program in its eighth edition this season, where students from all school levels participate in more than 10 Olympic sports. The competitions start in September/October of every year, with the finals being held at the Aspire Dome venue in March. This program provides a chance for grassroots development and allows federations to scout for young talents to be nurtured.</p><h4>QOC has signed a new memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the International Olympic Academy. What is the significance of this partnership?</h4><p>It is an important partnership at various levels. It consolidates the cooperation between the Qatar Olympic Academy and the International Olympic Academy and strengthens the role that the QOC is playing in promoting the Olympic values in Qatar and in the Arab world. Secondly, it enables the Qatar Olympic Academy to succeed in its mission to spread the knowledge and values of the Olympic movement in the Arabic-speaking world.</p><h4>QOC has announced the building of several new public sport facilities across the country. How does that fit into the strategy to promote sport in Qatar?</h4><p>The government's sport and physical education policy is built around two main streams: community sport and the elite sport. Sport facilities are a vital component of promoting and developing the two sectors. Stadiums and sport halls are needed for official competitions as well as for public sport activities. Facilities such as youth centers, districts, Al Firjan playgrounds, or Olympic parks, serve the same community sports and programs. In addition to this local level, dynamic, modern sport facilities and venues help to achieve the objectives of the country aimed at hosting major sport events at the Gulf, Arab, Asian, and World levels. Efforts are being made toward developing our men and women athletes and enabling them to perform at the highest level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar has seen great economic growth over the last decade, ringing in a new era for the country. How has this affected the local culture?<br></h4><p>Thanks to the strong and clear leadership of His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, The Father Emir and His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, the country has entered an age of prosperity. It is true that this development puts pressure on our national identity as the country is experiencing rapid change and people from all over the world are flocking to Qatar to build their future. The Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030, launched in 2008, anticipated these developments, and, thus, included a strong emphasis on the maintaining and preserving Qatari traditions and culture. At the same time, culture and creativity were identified as important avenues toward an innovative knowledge-based economy. I am confident to say that culture in Qatar is flourishing, as our national traditions are preserved alongside the many cultures that we welcome into our country.</p><h4>How is the Ministry of Culture, Arts, and Heritage reaching out to foreign delegations, and what is the objective of these international partnerships?</h4><p>Ever since the creation of the Ministry back in 2008, we have actively sought international contacts to build our network. The emphasis on culture in Qatar is now being recognized all over the world and great artists are coming here to exhibit their works. This image is best represented by the growing international fame of the Museum of Islamic Art. This is all part of the national strategy to strengthen our tourism industry and turn Qatar into a cultural center in the Gulf. Aside from the direct impact culture can make on the tourism industry, we also believe that these cultural ties with other nations can pave the way for stable political relations. Being a former diplomat, I can confirm that these cultural partnerships help in strengthening mutual beneficial and peaceful international relations. We can achieve this through pursuing different partnerships. A clear example of this is the cultural years that we organize in which we exchange arts and artists from two countries for a year. In 2014, we organized a successful Brazilian year, and we are poised to follow it with an equally successful cultural Turkey-Qatar year in 2015. Still, besides these larger events we meet regularly with delegates from around the world to create mutual understanding and a network for cultural exchanges.</p><h4>With an increasingly multinational population, what is your focus when it comes to raising children in Qatar with an understanding of culture and arts?</h4><p>In working towards the QNV 2030, we need to inspire our youth to build a full and rich life. An important element here to that is to help them understand culture, the arts, and our heritage. We have proposed several decisions in Qatar to take care of the youth culture and we implement this together with other institutions. An example of this is the Childhood Cultural Center (CCC), which is a private institution with great public utility that was established by HH Sheikha Mozah Bint Nasser. As for the Ministry of Culture, we play a pivotal role to play through a great number of child-oriented activities, books, and publications. Most of these books are stories extracted from traditions, and on which many authors have worked hard in order to publish in the proper form; a form that can address a child's requirements. Across the country we see art galleries organizing cultural and literary competitions for children, which we obviously support. It is also at this young age that we build international relations, since we recently organized the Fourth Arab-European Youth Forum in order to foster dialogue between cultures.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Agency Fish is a globally active creative publisher. What were the reasons behind coming to Qatar?<br></h4><p>The catalyst for us entering the market in Qatar was our winning the contract to publish Qatar Airways' Oryx magazine, and our position was further cemented in 2012 when we launched the Oryx Premium magazine, which is exclusive to the airline's premium customers. We have offices in London, Perth, and Jakarta, and bureaus in a number of other territories, including New York, Istanbul, Paris, and Doha.</p><h4>Agency Fish specializes in branding and custom publishing. What unique or standout features do you add to the local media sector here in Qatar?</h4><p>Clients tell us it is our unique mix of creativity coupled with our experience of the local market. In publishing, we approach projects from our position as a design agency. Our focus is on creating an engaging brand universe that delivers on the aspirations and commercial requirements of clients through strategic and compelling editorial. We won the Qatar Airways account with this creative approach, which has also seen the Oryx and Oryx Premium magazines win more than 50 global awards and accolades for editorial, design, fashion photography, and illustration. We had been working with clients throughout the Middle East for about a decade before we came to Qatar, and have an extensive network of specialists that we draw upon from our 20 years in business.</p><h4>Printed publications are increasingly being challenged by virtual and online content. How are you incorporating online platforms into your services?</h4><p>There's been a train of thought for several years that online will see the demise of print. This is somewhat of a myth, and reminds me of The Buggles song, “Video killed the radio star." Online and print deliver very different experiences and, when used in context, complement each other rather than compete. Interactive elements in printed titles, such as augmented reality, QR codes, and the like can work well; however, readers of physical titles are not looking for the immediacy of online from print, otherwise they would be online. Mobile is an extension of Generation Y and Z lives, and both its immediacy and ability to deliver two-way communications must be integrated into the marketing mix, but online also provides huge clutter. Print allows you to tell a story with more breathing space, and in-flight is the pinnacle of this breathing space, as there is very little competition for eyeballs. The challenge is ensuring clients are using all mediums available appropriately to deliver the needs of their customers, and that is what we have always done.</p><h4>What are the specific objectives of Agency Fish in Qatar for the next five years?</h4><p>There is huge international interest in Qatar as it continues its meteoric growth in all areas of life, business, R&amp;D, sports, culture, tourism, and social and environmental development. The Qatar National Vision 2030 provides the framework for this, and business and consumer demand will continue to adapt as the physical structure of the country changes. Agency Fish's aims are to continue to be a part of this growth and attract like-minded businesses that understand that content is king, regardless of platform.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[good-practice]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Al-Sulaiti Law Firm represents several of Qatar's biggest organizations, most notably Qatar Foundation. What are the strengths that have made it the preferred legal partner in Qatar?<br></h4><p>The law firm was founded in 2002 at a time when Qatar's economy was already flourishing. This economic boom immediately made it necessary to have an international outlook on our practice in order to be able to work for foreign companies and foreign investors and also to accompany Qatar's biggest entities, such as Qatar Foundation, the Rail, Barwa Real Estate, Damac, and Qatar Football Association. As such, the firm is positioned as an international player in its operational outlook of delivering legal services to its clients. We have a legal team made up of highly experienced practitioners across a wide range of fields, which means that we are able to address our clients' needs effectively and efficiently. Our lawyers are fluent in several languages including French, Italian, German, Arabic, and English. Our lawyers are all experienced and come from different legal cultures. This enables our law firm to respond to the complexity of the work that our clients deal with on a daily basis.</p><h4>What are the key legal issues that businesses interested in coming to Qatar need to understand before setting up here?</h4><p>To do business directly in Qatar, a foreign investor must act through a locally incorporated entity, which means that Qatari corporate law should have a foundational position in an investor's strategy. In ordinary cases, a minimum of 51% of a local entity's capital must be owned by Qatari citizens or other local entities. Though Al-Sulaiti Law Firm has successfully petitioned the Minister of Economy and Trade to allow some of its foreign clients to incorporate wholly owned entities, these were exceptional cases. We work with our other clients to draft articles of incorporation and shareholder agreements to maximize their control over the local entity. But so long as the 51% rule remains, the core solution is not creative drafting, it is embracing the partnership. We assist our clients in identifying local partners whose backgrounds and temperaments will compliment their own. We then guide our clients in using the articles of association to articulate a positive and synergistic mandate for themselves and for the local partner. With Qatar sprouting skyscrapers and GDP vaulting to new heights, it is easy for foreigners to forget that, for Qataris, Doha is still a small town. At the very least, seriously engaging the local partner allows the new entity to thrive by connecting it to other local players.</p><h4>Qatar finds itself in a competitive area that experiences rapid growth. How does Qatar's legal system compare to those in the region?</h4><p>Qatar is fully aware that it stands in the middle of a fast-growing geographical region. However, Qatar knows that it can rely on a strong, deep-rooted legal system. Qatar's legal framework is based on those of France and Egypt. Qatar's deeply rooted civil law framework is attractive to foreign investors because it is highly similar to those found in many of their own countries. Furthermore, Qatar continuously modernizes its legislation. Qatar also modernizes and diversifies its institutions to attract foreign investors. For example, the Qatar International Court and Resolution Centre, located in the Qatar Financial Centre, includes highly experienced foreign judges and applies procedures similar to those in common law jurisdictions. When welcoming foreign investors, Qatar stands on two legs. Domestic industry will be a foundation of Qatar's future. Qatar fosters the development of industry by granting interests in land at nominal rates. Also, Qatar recently established Qatar Development Bank (QDB), which finances domestic industrial projects. QDB and other banks are encouraged to lend to industrial borrowers at preferential rates. Moreover, Qatar is making parallel investments in human capital. Qatar Foundation, the architect of the country's interlocking initiatives in health and education, has created a new space for foreign investors. A foreign investor's jib will draw deeply where its ambition overlaps with national policy.</p><h4>What are the most important recent alterations in Qatar's legal system that have affected its standing as a foreign investment destination?</h4><p>Qatar is keen to keep its legal system up to date and in line with its booming development. Hence, several new laws have recently been issued and several others are being revised. The Real Estate Sector Law No.6 of 2014 aims at regulating real estate developers. In future, any individual or entity carrying out real estate development activities must apply for a license issued by the Ministry of Economy and Trade. Such licenses must be obtained by individuals or entities established outside or within Qatar. The Ministry of Economy and Trade will keep a real estate developers register in which will be listed the names and details of individuals and entities that have received a license. A real estate dispute resolution committee has been created. Its role shall be to resolve disputes that arise from the Real Estate Development Law and from real estate projects. Another significant change in Qatar's legal system deals with Law No. 25 of 2005 regulating commercial registration. Law No. 20 of 2014 has amended Law No. 25 of 2005. The department responsible for commercial registration at the Ministry of Economy and Trade has to reply to an application for a commercial registration on the same day. In case the application is rejected, the department must cite the reason for the rejection. This amendment to the commercial companies law aims at accelerating the registration process of new companies and at encouraging investments. The new law also increases the sanction to be applied to whoever misuses a commercial registration. There are also laws to be amended. As the Qatar authorities are concerned about the working and living conditions of expatriates in Qatar, the Labor Law No. 14 of 2004 and Law No. 4 of 2009 regarding the regulation of expatriates, entry, departure, residence, and sponsorship are being reviewed by the authorities of Qatar.</p><h4>What can be done to improve Doha's position as a preferred location in the region for international businesses?</h4><p>Qatar is already a preferred business location for international businesses. It has got a lot of potential for development in several sectors such as education, health, sports, and tourism. International companies are willing to participate in that development. Qatar has set up the conditions so that international companies will find in Qatar a business environment similar to that they know abroad. Hence, foreign entities will find local and international banks in Qatar to help finance development projects. Qatar's legal system is also adapted from time to time in line with international business practices.</p><h4>Considering the recent development in the legal structure of Qatar, how do you foresee this country developing over the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>Qatar will keep on developing itself the way it has always done; looking to the future but with a deep respect for its past, its culture, and its tradition. And so, in five or 10 years' time, Qatar will look different but I have no doubt its culture and traditions will have been preserved.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the University of Calgary in Qatar (UCQ) within Qatar National Vision 2030?<br></h4><p>As a university dedicated to educating nurses who will become healthcare leaders in Qatar, we support the Qatar National Vision 2030 as a pillar of the healthcare community. As we continue to realize our university's vision of enriching health and wellness in Qatar, our contribution to the National Vision will continue to grow. Over the last two years, our student enrollment has increased by 56%. The message is getting out regarding the quality of academic instruction that this university offers and the benefits a career in nursing. It is my hope that those numbers continue to grow over the next 10 years we realize our goal of having over 1,000 students on our campus. We received more than 300 applications for enrollment last term, and I believe that is because there is a strong interest in nursing. We are also pleased to see an increase in the number of Qatari students this year. We have achieved a rate of just over 20% for the past few years, but looking at our 2014 admissions that number is on the rise.</p><h4>What were the reasons behind starting the Master of Nursing program?</h4><p>We are changing the way nursing is practiced in Qatar. By providing the opportunity for education at the graduate level, nurses will have the opportunity to attain influential positions and help enact change in the healthcare system. As the first Master of Nursing program offered in Qatar and only the second in the region, we started with a course-based program in the area of oncology nursing in order to meet a direct need as outlined in the National Cancer Strategy. As the program has been so successful, there is the potential to expand our graduate offerings to include nursing leadership, a subject of great interest to Qatari nurses. We are hoping to continue to expand the program even further in the coming years.</p><h4>The academic health system is aiming to turn hospitals into academic centers. Is there a plan to integrate the university better with the healthcare agencies?</h4><p>We have already started the integration process by organizing the joint appointments of key nurses from Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) and Sidra Medical and Research Center. In addition, researchers from Hamad are working collaboratively on research proposals with UCQ faculty. It is an excellent balance between practice and education. This type of collaboration allows us to be sure that we are meeting the needs of the state. Another stream of integration is through the academic health system's research programs. Currently, there are four sub-committees consisting of academics from all of the educational health institutions in Qatar that are organized by the academic health system, and we have faculty members sitting on all four. It is a great collaboration and partnership. The most important initiative that has come out of the academic health system is in the area of inter-professional education. Here, we have funded two research grants in inter-professional education. This brings people who are involved in healthcare and health agencies together. We do workshops together, and try to influence the way people are practicing.</p><h4>Is there an international impact that the UCQ has within the region?</h4><p>One of the biggest impacts, we are having in GCC countries is from our teaching and learning. Over the last two years, we have held a conference that focused on teaching and learning practices as well as some of the techniques that our faculty are using in order to enhance student learning. This coming year will be the first time that our conference will be open to faculty and institutions from across the GCC, and we are expecting significant interest. It is important that, as educational practitioners, we collaborate and learn from each other's practices. This conference will provide an ideal venue for that collaboration in the GCC.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The rapid development of Qatar is putting pressure on the country's healthcare system. What are the current expansion plans of Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) to face that challenge?<br></h4><p>HMC is in the early stages of planning and delivery one of the most ambitious hospital building programs anywhere in the world. This initiative, which was approved in 2014, will see HMC unite its current Hamad General Hospital and Hamad Bin Khalifa Medical City (HBKMC) campuses to create a comprehensive, patient-centered healing environment. The expanded HBKMC will be a world-class health facility for the people of Qatar. Designed to be an urban health, research, and education district, it will incorporate new facilities currently under construction, combined with the development, renovation, and expansion of existing facilities and services. HBKMC will be the largest single healthcare complex in the Middle East. The development of tertiary services in central Doha is based on a new way of delivering care in the safest, most effective, and most compassionate manner. Already under construction are a rehabilitation institute, a new tertiary hospital for women, an ambulatory hospital, and the Hamad Bin Khalifa Translational Research Institute. We are also building a new communicable disease hospital, which will be the first of its kind in the region. There will also be a specialist cancer center and a school for clinical sciences, and acting as the hub for all tertiary services in Qatar, a new 1,100-bed Tertiary Hospital. The combination of specialist hospital and research facilities will support the development of HMC's academic health system. These ambitious plans will not just serve the existing needs of Qatar's population; HMC's vision is to deliver the next generation of healthcare facilities and build a legacy of healthcare expertise across Qatar.</p><h4>In which areas of these healthcare services are you inviting foreign partners and professionals to come into Qatar and contribute?</h4><p>HMC is committed to developing partnerships with leading local and international organizations in the fields of health, research, and education. Through these partnerships, HMC is continuously seeking to advance clinical expertise, transform the delivery of its services, and bring in innovative solutions. We have many ongoing partnerships with international accreditation bodies, agencies, and health providers. For example, we have been working together with Canada's SickKids International since 2010 to develop pediatric healthcare in Qatar. Another great example is our collaboration with Partners HealthCare from Boston, US. We have been working with them on transforming the Women's Hospital into the leading hospital in the region for obstetric and gynecological healthcare.</p><h4>How does HMC try to educate the populace in order to prevent them from getting ill?</h4><p>Qatar has undergone a rapid period of economic growth over the last 20 years that has led to a large increase and diversification in the population, rapid urbanization, and a higher standard of living. These changes have had a major impact on lifestyle, contributing to the rising burden of non-communicable diseases. The National Health Strategy identifies preventive healthcare as a major goal in improving the health of the population and recognizes the need to shift focus away from a purely curative healthcare system to one that is effective in preventing disease. The nature of lifestyle-related diseases means that not only the health sector, but also a wide spectrum of governmental and non-governmental agencies need to work together to nurture an environment that empowers people to make healthier choices.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[prepare-for-a-surprise]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Considering that retail is a competitive sector in the GCC, what strategies have led to Abu Issa's success?<br></h4><p>As a result of our considerable local experience, we are different from other retailers. We try to create our own concepts and find gaps in the market. Most of the retailers in the region are simply importers of brands, concepts, and ideas; however, in our case most of the business we do comes from our own ideas. For example, in cosmetics, there are people between the ages of 15 and 25 that are generally not catered to. We created a concept just for them called Karisma, and presently this is doing very well. Another example is the Arabesq brand. This is a collection of sweets from different Arab countries, with each product marked with its national flag. The most important of our concepts is Mosafer, our travel luggage brand, which caters not only to the Middle East but also to the broader world.</p><h4>How do you introduce your own concepts to the market?</h4><p>We do not really do any scientific research; we rely on gut feelings. I travel around the world and I am accustomed to shopping. I know how to do it, and I think this is a more effective way of finding out what works than carrying out formal research. With Mosafer, I tried the concept here first and it worked well. When Dubai Mall saw the concept, they loved it and wanted it in their mall. This is how the brand developed to the 13 stores we now have. It has become so successful that we have branched into an operating travel agency.</p><h4>What is it that makes international brands partner with Abu Issa Holding?</h4><p>We do not like to go for the major, well-known brands. We always like to do the work ourselves, and to do research on the market to find out who the rising stars are. These companies are more flexible. When you work with them when they are young and they feel that they are a partner in growth, there is a real energy. People today are tired of seeing the same brands next to each other all over the world. You can go to Turkey, Italy, or Spain, and see all the brands lined up next to each other, all in the same order, which I find boring. There is no creativity and people are getting tired of it. Everyone wants to go to the non-chain or non-franchise stores. People in Qatar travel to Dubai all the time and buy the big brands there. Here, they can find things that they cannot find anywhere else. Some companies use us as a stepping-stone; however, we are more like a partner for growth. Most of these companies really appreciate us.</p><h4>What is your overall expectation of the retail sector in Qatar?</h4><p>The market is getting saturated with malls. There are too many, and more than what the market can sustain. One has to be careful where they invest their money. It is difficult to know, because the success of malls is sometimes a matter of luck. Often their plans look great, but people do not like it when it is built. Other times, the planning is poor but people love the mall. The good thing about Qatar in terms of retail is that we are fortunate to have Dubai ahead of us. Dubai is a good indicator of what is going to happen to us in the future. Sometimes Qataris are reluctant to say that, but I can watch Dubai and see what will happen here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key values that drive the group's progress?<br></h4><p>Our values are very clear. We demonstrate a can-do attitude, we are accountable for our decisions and actions, we promise what is deliverable and deliver what we promise, we respect others' time, we take on tough challenges and make them happen, we set achievable goals and achieve them, we value teamwork, and we are forthright, direct, and honest. These are our values, and there is no option for comprise.</p><h4>What are the main challenges to doing business here in Qatar?</h4><p>A crucial indicator is inflation. However, inflation today doesn't reflect the state of this business because the authorities use items to calculate it that haven't increased in value for the last 50 years. Therefore, inflation doesn't reflect reality. The real issue is the significant increase in salaries and rent. If the company was being established today and not in 1979, we would need a lot more money; this is the face of the story. However, on the positive side, we know that there will be more than 1 million sqm of office space coming onto the market in the upcoming five years. I believe this is a great decision, and it will take businesses in the right direction again. Still, for the next two years, everybody is going to continue suffering because of rental costs. Another positive, however, is the zero tax policy in Qatar. I have to pay taxes in Oman, but I pay zero taxes in Qatar. That gives us some answers as to why rent is expensive. Furthermore, Qatar today boasts the highest average income per capita, meaning that people are willing to spend. This is a healthy market for an investor to be in. When looking forward, we don't use 2022 as a benchmark because it is not the benchmark for Qatar. It is an event, albeit an event we are very proud to have. Our benchmark today is the Qatar Vision 2030, and we are working on this and implementing our strategy based on its principle aims.</p><h4>E-commerce is a relatively new phenomenon here in Qatar. What is the strategy of Transind Holding in that field?</h4><p>Today, e-commerce is the right way to go if you want to future proof your business. We have already established our e-commerce framework in terms of food, beverages, and sport. However, we still aren't happy; this is not the final stage. Yes, we are the leaders, and we generate 12% of our total sales through e-commerce; however, we want to keep on growing in this area. Still, we don't have a clear road map for Qatar, and this is not just our problem; it is a problem for everybody. Mapping for Qatar is under way, down to house numbers, street names, zones, and everything else. I understand it should be fully implemented before December 2014, and could boost e-commerce rates two- or three-fold.</p><h4>How do you assess the government's efforts to support local SMEs?</h4><p>There is a clear vision from the government to enhance and encourage family businesses to become organized businesses. To do this, it decided to look at the SME market. In order to formalize a business, a lot of work is required in terms of documentation, policies, and procedures. The largest change is to develop a structure for the board of directors. This means that it is no longer your personal money but your shareholders' money, and you are responsible for generating a healthy profit for them. You will also sit at a general assembly where they will ask you the motivations behind your decisions. Today, the SME sector is a benchmark for any economy if you want to develop. For this reason, the government has decided to go for the SME market, which I am quite sure will be a healthy market in a couple of years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The company recently adopted the name Katara. What is the meaning of the name?<br></h4><p>Katara comes from the old name of Qatar. Catara was originally used by the ancient cartographers in 150 AD to refer to the area known today as the Qatar Peninsula, before European cartographers began using the spelling Katara on historical maps dating from the first half of the 18th Century. That is why we decided to rebrand our company in 2012 from Qatar National Hotels to a company with an international name that would reach the international market. In 2011, we were a more nationally orientated company; however, today 70% of our hotels are outside of Doha. Katara Hospitality's name has been tremendously successful in helping build our brand within Qatar, the region, and beyond. The rebranding has also made us look into the past and cherish our accomplishments, while inspiring us to continue to pursue excellence in our future journey.</p><h4>Tourism is one of the pillars in the national strategy to diversify the economy. How do you aim to attract more Qatari graduates into the hospitality sector?</h4><p>As Qatar's flagship hospitality organization, we are deeply committed to our role in developing the country's tourism sector. We align ourselves with the values and objectives of the Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030, including the country's Qatarization policies. We have implemented training programs for promising Qatari high school graduates as well as setting up a sponsorship initiative at Stenden University to encourage young Qataris to enter the hospitality industry. The initiatives that we run with talented Qatari students are one part of a larger puzzle to develop a dynamic and efficient workforce for Qatar. Within our own organization, we encourage multi-discipline training, creating highly motivated and deeply skilled individuals who are given a platform to develop their talents both locally and internationally. Personally, I try to inspire people by demonstrating my career path and show them where you can go to in such a short period of time. I started working in kitchens and now I am leading this great organization. I hope this will entice people to come and work in junior positions.  At Katara Hospitality the staff turnover is considerably low. That means that people are loyal, and we are loyal. Many companies find their turnover at 17%, while ours doesn't even exceed 3%. The majority of our employees have been working at Katara Hospitality for eight or nine years. It is easy to hire hundreds of employees, but how to select them and retain them is key.</p><h4>How would you assess the national tourism strategy and efforts?</h4><p>Qatar Tourism Authority (QTA) sets the strategy, and we are their main hospitality partner. The national tourism strategy has to be developed through various delegations and committees who meet to work out the best national plan. QTA has so far implemented Phase I of this strategy, which has been successful so far but requires more time to be realized. There has been a tremendous effort in the development of new cities to attract tourism further. For example, in Lusail City, you will see that they are developing numerous entertainment cities and malls, 20 hotels, a public beach, and museums. Katara Hospitality and other hospitality groups in Qatar support QTA in achieving their goals, and I'm sure most of them will be achieved in five years' time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Qatar Museums is, like Qatar itself, a young institution with great ambitions. Culture and art supports the realization of our National Vision. It nurtures the transformation of a hydrocarbon nation to onebased on diversity by supporting and establishing creative networks. Culture connects people of all walks of life; it has no passport and establishes a tolerant platform for dialogue. We welcome you all to Doha, because in Qatar we believe in partnerships and I am sure that we will forge many new networks in the coming years.</p><p>Key to our vision for arts and creativity in Qatar is the need to balance progress and heritage. In 2013, we hosted the 38th UNESCO Heritage Conference, with Qatar's first UNESCO World Heritage site named at the ancient fort of Al Zubarah in the north of our country. We are also in the process of converting our old fire station to an Artist-in-Residence facility, which will be fully operational in 2015.<br></p><p>We champion the work of artists from this region and we support their development through our local partnerships with Katara (Cultural Village) and the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage. We also bring art from all around the world to inspire, influence, and equip aspiring artists from the region and educate our communities about international art. I encourage you to take part in all the cultural offerings in Qatar, which are unlimited. Between the Museum of Islamic Art, Katara, public art, and our thriving art galleries, there is truly so much art and architecture to see and appreciate.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What technology initiatives are you pursuing?</h4><p>Internet banking is already active and is a platform that we use to service customers remotely from our distribution points. We also have a network of ATMs, although still relatively small. Another alternative channel that we will be focusing on in 2015 is mobile banking, which will enable us not only to offer additional services, but also to reach a wider range of current and potential customers. Agency banking is starting in Mozambique and we believe that it will grow. This has also caught our attention.</p><h4>With respect to corporate banking, why should a large international company choose your bank?</h4><p>In the corporate environment it is all about relationships and the way you are able to service and assist the company. There is little room for differentiation in that environment because all banks effectively offer the same products and are able to bring value added through products that meet customer requirements. We try to differentiate from that, interacting more with our customers and bringing in tailor-made solutions. Our track record has been positive, although dealing with a relatively small portfolio. We have, however, succeeded in dealing with the key players across all sectors, be it mining, energy, or transport.</p><h4>What are your main investment and development plans for the near future?</h4><p>Apart from the expansion of our branch network, with eight branches expected to be opened in 2015, we are also planning the building of a new head office as part of the whole range of investments that the bank has been making for the past three years. Meanwhile, our new shareholder Atlas Mara at Group Level will give us access to global markets, which will then allow increased investment to create capacity and enable us to increase our market share much faster.</p><h4>What are your strategies to facilitate credit to SMEs and promote entrepreneurship?</h4><p>Migrating to a wider customer base from all  segments, from corporate to SME and personal banking, was a learning curve. We partnered with IFC from which we received technical assistance for two years. An IFC  resident advisor worked with us on the methodology and processes for credit assessment and relationship management as well as recruiting and training suitable people. At the moment we are able to service the SMEs in a better way than we were before because we have the tools to assess them accurately, and a broader understanding of their nature and business.</p><h4>Are you capitalizing on the boom in the construction sector?</h4><p>Encouragingly, Mozambique is not only seeing investment in residential property, but also commercial and infrastructure as a whole, which is to include roads, bridges, schools, and hospitals. This is positive and banks have a role to play in terms of financing the construction itself, or else in the purchase of residential properties. BancABC is quite active in this, and dealing with numerous construction companies in the mortgage financing. We recently launched a mortgage product for retail customers, which was innovative in a way as would potentially allow more people to have access to housing.</p><div class="quote">“In the corporate environment it is all about relationships and the way you are able to service and assist the company."</div><h4>New players are entering the market with pension funds, insurance companies, and banks. How will these new entities impact the capital markets?</h4><p>Hopefully this will bring more activity and liquidity to the capital markets and for the financial sector as a whole. Unfortunately, we have a financial market that is dominated by banks. Competition among the banks is forcing us to innovate new products to find fresh avenues for income and customer service. We definitely need new players, and a diversification of the financial sector, with insurance and pension funds being a good example.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the inaugural period of operations at the new airport?<br></h4><p>Since the opening of HIA in May 2014, the feedback has been excellent, not only in comparison to the old airport, but also in comparison to other facilities worldwide. During the IATA Summit, which was held in Doha in June 2014, we also had a positive response from the delegates who attended—this is invaluable feedback from leading experts in the international aviation industry. The unique mix of retail and F&amp;B, which covers 40,000 sqm, has also received a positive reaction from passengers passing through HIA. There are currently more than 70 retail outlets open offering an unprecedented selection of designer labels, electronics, gourmet foods, and much more. Leading global fashion brands including Burberry, Bulgari, Hermí¨s, Giorgio Armani, and Tiffany &amp; Co. can all be found under one roof at HIA. The airport is also home to the Middle East's first branch of Harrods. To complement the five-star shopping at HIA, more than 30 cafés and restaurants offer dining options to suit the palate of every traveler. One of the most successful areas of HIA is the Al Mourjan Business Lounge, which caters for Qatar Airways premium passengers. The stylish 10,000-sqm lounge offers guests a relaxing and comfortable environment to enjoy before they fly.</p><h4>How is the airport anticipating and preparing for this continuous growth of goods coming into Qatar?</h4><p>Qatar Airways Cargo is already ranked among the top cargo operators in the world, and this will only continue thanks to the sophisticated cargo terminal now in operation at HIA. The new technology and automated systems that have been introduced in the cargo area at HIA have enabled us to increase the capacity, which now stands at 1.4 million tons a year. With the continuing growth of Qatar Airways Cargo, this will expand to 2.8 million tons a year, making it one of the largest cargo terminals in the world. Qatar Airways Cargo already serves more than 40 exclusive freighter destinations worldwide via its new hub in Doha and also delivers freight to 146 key business and leisure destinations globally on 146 aircraft. The Qatar Airways Cargo fleet now includes five Airbus 330 and seven Boeing 777 freighters. At the Dubai Airshow 2013, Qatar Airways placed a firm order for five new Airbus A330-200 freighters. Also included in the order were eight additional A330-200F options, for a total of 13 aircraft. At the recent Farnborough Show, Qatar Airways announced its intent to order four 777 freighters and options for four more.</p><h4>What is the influence of world-class infrastructure on attracting foreign investors to Qatar?</h4><p>The vision for 2030 is designed to change Qatar's dependency on oil and gas and upgrade the country's utilities and infrastructure, making it more attractive to foreign investors. The Qatari government understands the importance and the benefit of investment in utilities and infrastructure, as well as the significance of our geographical location. Ideally positioned at the global crossroads of east and west, north and south, Qatar has the opportunity to become an international hub connecting the world, and HIA is one of the key elements contributing to the improvements in infrastructure that will help secure Qatar's position as a major player on the global market.</p><h4>How do you look at the national trajectory toward achieving the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>There will be challenges to achieve the targets set for 2030, however with the support of the government and with hard work, we will overcome these challenges. We have to get to the vision step by step and we have to be realistic. The 2022 FIFA World Cup will be a significant milestone on the pathway towards achieving the 2030 vision. I am confident that Qatar will deliver on its promise to organize the best tournament possible and reflect our success in meeting the challenges that face us as we strive to achieve the vision that His Highness has for 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the Qatar branch for First Gulf Bank (FGB)?<br></h4><p>FGB has an official strategy to continue to develop its business, both locally and internationally, as well as to expand the franchises' products and services. As part of that, Qatar has a lot of good value and offers us an important platform. Being a UAE-based bank, the GCC provides us with a strategic geographic gateway for diversification and growth. Being the third-largest economy in the GCC, Qatar is a natural choice. With approximately $200 billion worth of GDP annually, Qatar has a big potential for growth in the next six to eight years. Having a branch here is important because of its volume of exports to the UAE, as well as to areas in the Far East, the Indian Subcontinent, and China. We have a big presence in these countries, so that branch would enable us to capture those trade flows. In addition to that, the country is expected to have a significant increase in local credit demand that would grant us a good share. Having a branch in Qatar is highly advantageous, as proven in the way we have performed over the last five years. We started as a representative office in June 2009, but in May 2011 we felt the need to establish a fully fledged wholesale branch. Since then, we have grown rapidly, and we are probably the most vibrant and fastest growing entity in the Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA). We attribute our rapid growth to the support from local businesses, the banking community here, and from the QFCRA.</p><h4>How would you characterize your position here in Qatar? What services do you offer?</h4><p>We offer wholesale banking services, such as accepting deposits and providing and arranging credit facilities, in addition to arranging and advising on investments. Furthermore, we are one of the largest banks in the region, with an equity network base close to $8.5 billion. Based on that, we have been able to partner on some of the largest and most prominent transactions in the country. We have been invited to all these transactions, which the local banks have been leading. Our model has been that we partner with local banks instead of competing with them. Given our size, we have been able to participate and be a strong partner to the local banks.</p><h4>How would you characterize the framework for foreign investors?</h4><p>Currently, there is a good framework that has been developed and implemented, which includes the tax policy, immigration, customs, and labor regulation framework. The government has shown a good approach, whereby it quickly adapts to something if it notices it is missing; it has a dynamic thought process compared to many other economies. Here also lies the freedom to bring in and take out capital. There are no restrictions in terms of foreign currency exchange here, unlike many other countries. These are all investor-friendly things that are beneficial. However, the government is continuously trying to fill all the gaps.</p><h4>What are the specific objectives for the Qatar branch of FGB in the next five years?</h4><p>The economy should be growing very well, and our approach is basically to deepen our presence here. We have a large appetite for Qatari assets, so we are keen on deepening our relationship with our Qatari customers and supporting their growth by partnering with the banks. That is what we have done and what we want to continue doing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the most important policies taken by the Ministry of Energy and Industry over the past year?<br></h4><p>The global energy landscape is fast-changing following the entry of nonconventional energy supplies in the US, the increasing penetration of new and renewable energy sources, more energy-efficient technologies, and gas supplies from both conventional and unconventional resources from other parts of the world.  The Ministry of Energy and Industry has to respond to such uncertainties, volatilities, and energy dynamics with appropriate policy measures. During 2014, we introduced policies that empowered key stakeholders and players in the energy sector, which included the promotion of “rationalization and energy efficiency," and “sustainable development and environmental sustainability" measures. The Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation (KAHRAMAA) had initiated the “rationalization and energy efficiency" (tarsheed) campaign. It has adopted international standards and specifications to achieve sustainable services with higher efficiency aimed at improving quality of life in Qatar and the protection of the country's valuable resources. With regards to “sustainable development and environmental sustainability," the Ministry of Energy and Industry has asked key stakeholders and players within the energy sector to submit annual reports on their sustainability initiatives. The aim is to enhance the management of economic, environmental and social impacts, thereby optimizing the energy sector's contribution to the development of Qatar. This initiative has increasingly encouraged key stakeholders and players to fulfill the requirements of sustainable development, which lies at the heart of Qatar's National Vision (QNV) 2030, under the wise guidance of His Highness Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar. The aim is to consolidate the position of the State of Qatar as a responsible global energy provider with world-class best practices. I have encouraged the companies in the energy and industry sector in Qatar to submit their five-year sustainable development strategies with well-defined performance targets. The “Sustainability in the Qatar Energy and Industry Sector Report 2013" was issued at an award ceremony held in June 2014.</p><h4>The year 2014 marked the 40th anniversary of Qatar Petroleum, the national oil and gas company that propelled Qatar one of the largest hydrocarbon exporters in the world. What are the distinct qualities that will support success in the decades to come?</h4><p>Among the critical factors that will help Qatar Petroleum sustain its position for a long time to come in the energy markets are the abundant reserves of hydrocarbon resources, particularly the natural gas held in the world's largest non-associated gas reservoir, namely the North Field; the diversity and size of the energy projects particularly LNG, GTL (gas to liquids) and many streams of LPGs; Investment in R&amp;D and education programs launched to build knowledge and competence within the workforce; and the strategic partnership with leading international energy companies based on mutual benefits.</p><h4>What is the role of the ministry in aligning Qatar's research and development stakeholders in the local energy sector?</h4><p>Aligned with the QNV 2030, the vision and goals of the Ministry of Energy and Industry are the driving force building Qatar's robust industrial sector with balanced growth. R&amp;D activities and initiatives are embedded in this pursuit of growth. They play a fundamental role in achieving the economic sustainability. This along with education creates the conditions for  healthy economic development. The necessary infrastructure capable of servicing and responding to the country's current and future energy needs has been established to support both national and private sector stakeholders, catering to their research and development needs. The Ministry of Energy &amp; Industry plays an active role to ensure a collaborative climate is fostered to maximize each player's contribution.</p><h4>What is the specific importance of the various improvements in the infrastructure of Qatar to the local energy and industry sector?</h4><p>The development of infrastructure projects, especially those related to transportation, is of particular importance for the development of the local energy and industry sectors. The sophisticated rail and metro network projects underway will link all industrial cities and main ports to the GCC rail network through Saudi borders and Qatar-Bahrain causeway project. It will minimize transportation costs for industries and speed-up delivery to local and international customers. While the oil and gas industry requirements are served by the ports at Mesaieed and Raslaffan, the development of a new port in the proximity of Doha city is also underway. It will provide a facility that will cater to the future growth of export goods being produced in Qatar. It will maximize the transportation synergy required by providing the needed shipment infrastructure to the future industrial areas and economic zones, complementing the existing facilities of our industrial cities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>RasGas started producing gas in 1999 and currently finds itself the supplier of choice in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. What are the driving elements behind this quick global success?<br></h4><p>RasGas has a relentless focus on reliability, efficiency and cost effectiveness, and innovation, and is leveraging its financial and corporate structure to deliver the best results to its customers and shareholders. We have expanded rapidly since our small-scale beginnings in 1993, and have gone from operating just one liquefied natural gas (LNG) train in 1999 to: seven LNG trains producing approximately 37 million tons per annum; two pipeline sales gas trains; two helium plants, which meet approximately 25% of global demand; and a fleet of 27 LNG vessels. All this could not have been achieved without the visionary leadership at the helm of the State of Qatar and the unwavering support and growing trust and responsibilities our shareholders have given us over the years. Natural gas has rapidly become the cleaner energy of choice and powers and transforms global economies. Our capability to adapt and meet the needs of a dynamic market demonstrates RasGas' ability to safely and reliably deliver cleaner energy to all corners of the globe with great flexibility.</p><h4>Gas flaring reduction is posing a high-priority challenge for the energy sector as a whole, and RasGas has set ambitious reduction targets. What is the company's approach to realizing that goal?</h4><p>In 2012, RasGas initiated a fresh, five-year flare minimization plan covering its Ras Laffan facilities, both on-site and off-plot, a continuation of the inaugural five-year plan set in 2005. The new plan, expected to be complete by 2016, aims to reduce flaring emissions from a baseline of 1.26% (volume of flared gas per unit of gas intake) in 2011 to 0.43% in 2016. RasGas' approach is to continue employing industry best practices and innovative efforts that include, but are not limited to, improving facility designs, enhancing operating procedures, and using waste gas for power generation. RasGas continued to reduce the amount of gas flared in 2013, achieving a rate that was roughly 18% below our target for the year. The most significant contribution came from a passing-valves monitoring program, which generated about three-quarters of the reduction in 2013. We have also made improvements to flare gas control systems and have sought improvements in plant reliability, leading to reduced flaring.</p><h4>All over the world, LNG extraction facilities are being built or improved and it is estimated that this will lead to a doubling in overall output capacity by 2025. Will this increase in supply change the way in which the LNG market now operates and, if so, how?</h4><p>The next wave of potential gas supplies and strategies that help connect supplies to the world's growing energy requirements will require a diversity in supply options not only from established producers with proven records of reliability and stability, but also from new market entrants. For these reasons, RasGas closely monitors the global gas supply-demand balance so that it is able to react appropriately and efficiently when markets signal an increased need for LNG supplies. RasGas has the commercial and operational flexibility to respond quickly to long-term and short-term market requirements. We remain focused on delivering energy to the world in a safe and reliable manner, while optimizing our business for the benefit of our customers, shareholders, and the State of Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Sasol's experiences in Qatar have been important to the international strategy of Sasol as a whole. What are the particular lessons learned, and how has it impacted projects abroad?<br></h4><p>Sasol's experience in Qatar has proven the low temperature natural gas conversion to liquid fuels and chemicals process at a commercial scale. ORYX GTL is the first commercial business of its kind in the world. We have taken the operational and safety teachings that have made ORYX GTL such a success and adapted and integrated into the way we approach our projects in other markets. On the basis of the success that Sasol has been enjoying here in Qatar, we are exploring and pursuing other opportunities around the world.</p><h4>A way in which Sasol reaches out to the community is through collaborations with the education sector in Qatar. What is the importance of these partnerships to Sasol?</h4><p>Academia plays an important role in achieving the Qatar National Vision 2030 along with industry and civil society. Educational institutions are critical, providing the training and innovative research opportunities that drive forward new technologies and methods in our opinion. From supporting scholarships to offering opportunities post-graduation, we at Sasol are proud supporters of higher learning institutions in Qatar and abroad. Our mobile application, Qatar e-Nature, in partnership with the Friends of the Environment Center in Qatar, is also a unique and powerful learning e-tool for all students in Qatar and to the public as well. In 2013, we also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Qatar University to establish a project that will advance research in the area of carbon dioxide recovery from flue gas. The three-year project will be conducted through Qatar University's Gas Processing Center.</p><h4>In Qatar, Sasol is mainly focused on the production of several GTL products. How do you foresee the position of GTL in the global energy mix?</h4><p>Currently, GTL plants supply less than 1% of the world's total need for liquid fuels. Even if another two or three substantial facilities come online, the total relative capacity would still be small. Global forecasts suggest that by 2030 there will be a 6% replacement of conventional fuels by biofuels, but that is not going to be enough to take up the additional demand for fuels. Conservative forecasts predict a 24% increase in fossil fuel demand by 2030. Qatar is well positioned on the GTL map, as the world's hub thanks to abundant gas reserves, proven capacity and infrastructure, and a stable, supportive government in place. Further helping the positioning of GTL, fuels created by gas conversion are inherently more environmentally friendly than conventional fuels created from crude oil. Market demand for GTL diesel is driven by the fact that GTL fuels are low in sulfur, have a lower carbon footprint, and offer a high octane number.</p><h4>By moving to a new office in 2013, Sasol demonstrated its commitment to Qatar. What are the pillars of your future strategy in Qatar?</h4><p>We were honored to have had His Excellency Dr. Mohammed bin Saleh Al-Sada, Minister of Energy and Industry, with us for the inauguration of our new office in Qatar. After more than five years in our previous office, it was time to expand. Looking ahead, we hope to have future opportunities in Qatar for collaboration. We see a country with strong leadership, a clear vision and the human and natural resources to lead in the energy and chemical sectors long into the future. The energy sector is doing well and the Qatari Government is continuously evaluating diversification of the use of carbon molecules to maximize value. At Sasol, we look forward to continuing to be part of Qatar's story as the world's GTL hub.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ExxonMobil Qatar and Qatar Petroleum (QP) collectively developed the North Field, which is the world's largest non-associated natural gas field. How has technology enabled you to develop that field?<br></h4><p>ExxonMobil is honored to have played a significant role in helping Qatar develop the North Field in partnership with QP—and we couldn't have done it without unique technologies and scale. Together, we took a complex problem and found cost-effective solutions that transformed this resource. At ExxonMobil, technology is the lifeblood of our company, and our 18,000 engineers and scientists are committed to overcoming the most difficult technological challenges. Many of the major advances in the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market were developed by ExxonMobil, and we are proud to be one of the few companies in the world with the expertise and financial strength to deliver an integrated approach to LNG, from wellhead to consumer.</p><h4>ExxonMobil is the only foreign player in two domestic gas projects: Al Khaleej Gas and the Barzan Gas Projects. What makes your company the only foreign player selected for these projects?</h4><p>The Barzan Gas Project is a great example of what we can accomplish together for the sustainable development of Qatar, and RasGas has done an excellent job of running it on behalf of the shareholders, QP, and ExxonMobil. It is particularly important given the rapid economic and population growth we have seen over the past several years. The gas produced from the Barzan Gas Project will be used for power generation for the new airport and seaport, and for major infrastructure projects in transport, health and education. The Barzan Gas Project will ultimately supply 1.4 billion cubic feet (bcf) per day of gas. The groundwork for the Barzan Gas Project was laid by Al Khaleej Gas (AKG), our first domestic gas project in Qatar. Together, the first and second phases of AKG have the capacity to supply approximately 2 bcf per day, as well as condensate, ethane, and LPG. None of this would have been possible without the combined strengths of QP and ExxonMobil. I believe that our long-standing support for the vision of their Highnesses the Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamed Al Thani and Father Emir is the real key to our success here, and why we have been trusted to partner with QP on these strategic projects.</p><h4>The global energy market is going through times of change. How do you foresee the global energy mix developing and how will that affect Qatar?</h4><p>Forecasting long-term energy trends begins with the simple fact: that people need energy. That is why we work relentlessly to apply the advanced technology needed to power lives, to deliver the energy needed to meet the world's growing demand, giving billions of people across the globe the opportunity to improve their lives. Over the next few decades, population and income growth, and an unprecedented expansion of the global middle class, are expected to create new demands for energy. We see global energy consumption rising by about 35% from 2010 to 2040. By 2040, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables are expected to deliver more than 70% of the world's electricity. Global demand for natural gas is projected to rise by 65% from 2010 to 2040, the largest volume growth of any energy source. It is in Qatar that this historic shift in the global energy mix is being led. Qatar is contributing to the greater use of natural gas worldwide, and is directly responsible for development of the global market for natural gas. Qatar has the capacity to produce 77 million tons per annum of LNG, which reaches markets around the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Celebrating 15 years of operations this year, how has Qatar Fuel Additives Company (QAFAC) developed over that period of time?<br></h4><p>This year marks a special anniversary for QAFAC.  It is 15 years since the establishment of our complex at Mesaieed Industrial City. A petrochemical complex for the production of methanol and MTBE, two products known as fuel additives. Going back to the 1990s, the conceptualization of QAFAC project followed from decisions that entailed significant risks. The fuel additive market and the geopolitical situation of those years represented a major challenge to the project. During these 15 years, QAFAC was able to master the technology needed for the production of methanol and MTBE. From 1999 to 2006, we enjoyed a stable period of production within designed plate capacity. Then, between 2006 and 2012, we introduced a CO2 revamping project (taking the CO2 from neighboring QAFCO), and increased the capacity of the methanol plant by 16%. From 2012 onward, a strategy formulation and implementation period with a number of initiatives was introduced.</p><h4>QAFAC is currently building the carbon dioxide recovery plant in Mesaieed. How will this new facility impact your operations?</h4><p>At QAFAC, our methanol production is becoming more environmentally responsible through the development of the Carbon Dioxide Recover (CDR) project. The CDR plant, with a design capacity of 500 ton per day, is the region's largest. It captures the CO2 from the methanol reformer flue gases, cleans them, and injects the high quality CO2 back into the process, enhancing the methanol production and contributing to a more sustainable source of CO2. The CDR plant allows us to reduce the CO2 emission consolidating one of our values, to be a green company.</p><h4>QAFAC took the initiative to organize the first Middle East Methanol Forum. What were the reasons behind bringing together the various producers from the region?</h4><p>As the theme of our Middle East Methanol Forum states “Miracle Energy On Hand," methanol is just a simple, miraculous molecule that is the basic building block for so many products that affect our daily lives.  The methanol economy, a suggested future economy in which methanol replaces fossil fuels as a means of energy storage, ground transportation fuel, and raw material for synthetic hydrocarbons and their products, is becoming more and more realistic. As a key producer and exporter of methanol, we at QAFAC have an integral and vital role to play in the overall development of the methanol industry. Under the Patronage of His Excellency Dr. Mohamed Al Sada Minister of Energy and Industry, who is also the Guest of Honor, we were excited and pleased with the participation of renowned speakers from all the corners of the globe in Doha on November 26th 2014.</p><h4>Being an international player with an aggressive export strategy, how do you foresee the global market for Methanol products to develop in the coming years?</h4><p>Since 2012, the Qatar Chemical and Petrochemical Marketing and Distribution Company (Muntajat QJSC) holds the exclusive rights to market, sell, and distribute QAFAC's products to global markets. Muntajat is responsible for the marketing of our methanol and MTBE products. Based on IHS, the demand for methanol in 2013 was 60.7 million tons per annum. They are forecasting a doubling of demand by 2020 to 120 million. Apart from traditional applications, the increase in methanol demand is due to a resurgence of US methanol production as part of the shale gas boom, an increase in potential methanol energy applications, new technologies like methanol to plastics (MTP) and methanol to olefins (MTO), and other emerging applications such as the use of methanol direct fuel cells and marine fuel.</p><h4>What are the specific objectives for QAFAC for the next five years?</h4><p>Our strategy is mapped out up until 2020, and our vision is to be among the top five producers of methanol and its butane derivative, though this represents a considerable challenge. We have been working very closely with our main shareholders (QP and IQ) in conceptualization and prefeasibility studies of our new projects. At the same time, we are working in derivatives of methanol and butane. Apart from our growth-driven strategy, our objective is to consolidate our organizational structure through the improvement of governance frameworks, Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and Business Continuity Management (BCM) projects, IT infrastructure, SAP Enterprise Resource Panning, Qatarization, and Corporate Social Responsibility. QAFAC is a firm believer in the importance of active citizenship and in investing in the local community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you working to build your reputation and establish a name here in the extremely competitive Qatari market?<br></h4><p>Voith Industrial Services supports energy and petroleum petrochemical producing plants throughout their entire life cycle. Our expertise includes specialized maintenance, including but not limited to heat exchanger overhauling, valves and pumps, tank design and construction, piping and steel fabrication, as well as minor EPC projects. Just like our European mother company, we focus on excellence so we make sure that all our projects are completed to the highest standard of quality and safety. We have entered a competitive market and the only way to really expand our market share in Qatar is to be competitive. We consider three prime movers to maintain interest among our clients: cost, reliability, and safety.</p><h4>Having entered the country in 2010, how do you assess the inaugural years, and how do you proceed in winning contracts?</h4><p>Voith decided to enter the Qatari market four years ago, and we consider ourselves to be in set-up mode. The recent business year has in fact set down foundation stones for our future development. Year one of practical operations was a tester and we have achieved some milestones. Having closely examined year two, we see improvements in market share and other essential areas. It hasn't been easy but we are focused and we understand that we are not the only people in the industry. Breaking into this market is very complicated as clients have a tendency to look at well-established suppliers who have track records and have in fact been there before. In order to get into a market like this, you have to be competitive. The lowest price normally gets the job, and we feel that if we win a job at the lowest price we gain the local experience to apply it to similar jobs in the future. Internationally, we have 150 years of experience, and we have never made a loss during that time. We are trying to break into this market by using our European knowledge and expertise in engineering, marketing, and sales strategies. It is a difficult road, but we are making progress.</p><h4>Voith chose Qatar as its first Middle Eastern destination. What were the specific reasons behind entering this market as opposed to others?</h4><p>Voith is a solutions expert and we decided to move here as European markets were declining and Middle Eastern energy and petrochemical markets were expanding. This paved the way for major developments in plant construction, and, thus, future repair and maintenance contracts. Voith identified this as a potential platform for the establishment and build-up of our energy and petrochemicals sector for the Middle East. Here we chose to focus on Qatar as a primary hub with intentions to observe other GCC markets and strategies for expanding into other countries. Having set up as an industrial services provider, we will look at growth patterns and decide on future expansions cautiously.</p><h4>How do you see the petrochemicals industry developing in Qatar?</h4><p>We are working with the petrochemicals sector and this is where most of our projects are. I expect that this sector will see more development than the oil sector since world demands are changing to renewable energy. We currently have contracts with several large customers, such as QVC, Q-Chem, and Qatar Petroleum. We were recently awarded the building of a new tank for one of these clients and various projects for other clients. Overall, you can say that we are very focused on the petrochemicals sector but observe all challenges and opportunities.</p><h4>Looking ahead, what is your strategy for moving Voith forward?</h4><p>We have to attract customers and price is a major interface here. This industry is a competitive world and we are infringing on markets that are saturated. Still, we strive to deliver perfection, based on performance and reliability, and with keeping cost in mind we believe that Voith has a solid foundation. Our focus is on the best solutions that the clients expect. We strive for perfection and we intend to further develop our technologies. We have overcome the startup challenges and are now gaining a position in the market. With the opening of our new workshop and the enlargement of our workforce, we are in a position to be more competitive and absorb more market share while still delivering high value projects to our esteemed clients. We are solutions people who are always aware of our customers' needs and we want to be the market leader.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Being the flagship branch, what is the role of Ooredoo Qatar within the larger group structure of the company?<br></h4><p>In Qatar, our market awareness is at 100%, and brand equity has steadily improved as we have demonstrated to our customers that we promote growth. By having such a strong band presence, we have been able to launch life-enhancing products such as 4G Mobile Broadband, Ooredoo Fibre, Business Fibre, and the Ooredoo App. We have also been able to provide next generation entertainment services like our Mozaic GO App and state-of-the-art business services such as the data center with a safety net. By using our communities and Qatar's bustling industry needs as a launch pad for these services, we can perfect the products to make a truly global portfolio. At the beginning of 2014, we reached the milestone of 3 million customers in Qatar.</p><h4>How have your customers received the fiber and 4G services, and how do you expect demand to develop over the next year?</h4><p>Data access is now the single largest contributor to revenue growth, with 28% YoY revenue growth across the group. In Qatar, Ooredoo is the data market leader, with 26% YoY data revenue growth and 80% mobile broadband penetration in 2013. We still see a significant potential for growth in these figures, and intend to drive data market expansion. Over 175,000 customers have also been connected to Ooredoo Fibre, offering the fastest internet speeds available, access to our entertainment service Mozaic TV, and offering businesses a next-generation service. In order to encourage more customers to switch to Ooredoo and remain with us; however, we need to deliver the latest life-enhancing technology combined with great value promotions and reliable network signals. To deliver this we are expanding our 4G network and connecting more homes to fiber every day to keep up with the growing demand for fast internet and creating a high-tech networking infrastructure throughout the country that can cope with the growing population of Qatar.</p><h4>What is your strategy with regard to Ooredoo's ambition to improve the services in mobile money transfers?</h4><p>As Qatar's economy continues to grow, the country has seen an influx of international workers contributing to key projects. These workers need to send money to friends and family in their home country. Many do not have bank accounts or easy access to financial services, but virtually all of them have mobile phones. Seizing an opportunity to enhance the lives of underserved communities in Qatar, Ooredoo launched the mobile banking service Ooredoo Mobile Money in 2011. Using any model of mobile phone, customers can send money securely, conveniently, and reliably, 24 hours a day, with money available for collection in just 10 minutes. Initially, Ooredoo customers could send money only to Pakistan and the Philippines, but in order to serve Qatar's diverse expatriate population, Ooredoo has partnered with leading global payment services company MoneyGram to enable customers to send money for collection at over 321,000 MoneyGram agents in 200 countries around the world. The partnership with MoneyGram was a global first, and matches the needs of expatriate workers perfectly.</p><h4>How will the global unification of the Ooredoo Group impact the capabilities of the company to improve its services?</h4><p>The purpose of transforming into Ooredoo was about much more than just changing our name; it was about taking our business to the next level and creating a new identity. A major part of that was looking to differentiate based on the customer experience. We wanted to improve networks, offer new services and deliver on our promise to stimulate human growth. In some markets, in parallel with the launch of the Ooredoo brand, this involved the launch of 4G and 3G services. Over the past year, every Ooredoo operation has carried out research to understand what customers are looking for and what their expectations of Ooredoo services are. Each operation has carried out a series of focus groups and customer surveys to help shape their respective “customer promise"—the commitments that customers can expect from Ooredoo.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some potential growth areas in Qatar?<br></h4><p>We have identified large growth opportunities in the enterprise segment and are rapidly growing in this market. The Qatar enterprise market is worth QAR1.8 billion, and we have a clear strategy to expand into this market drawing on our local knowledge and global track record. In 2014, we launched a comprehensive range of enterprise grade fixed products including corporate voice, internet, and data network solutions. We brought two firsts to the business market in Qatar with a locally supported secure device management solution and an audio conferencing solution with a free local dial-in number that can significantly reduce the telecoms costs for local businesses. In summary, we have the infrastructure, business solutions, and an aggressive product roadmap coupled with outstanding client management that will transform the way many businesses in Qatar work.</p><h4>Vodafone has invested massively in high-speed services like 4G. How do you see this developing over 2015?</h4><p>We see data usage increasing exponentially in the MEA region, to the tune of 70% compound annual growth by 2018. Already, GCC operators are seeing as much as 60% of their customers using 3G and 4G networks, which is significantly higher than in Europe. The increase we are expecting rides the wave of growing smartphone and tablet adoption. With 80% of all connections in Qatar coming from smartphones, we are already way ahead of earlier adopters such as Europe and the US—we lead the world in smartphone adoption. This also fits with what we are seeing in terms of the growth of internet users in the GCC region. In 2012, there were 26.4 million internet users in the region, and by 2017, this is expected to grow to over 40 million people, or over 52% growth. In Qatar, the growth is even more significant. We had 1 million internet users in the country in 2012, while by 2017, this is expected to nearly double to 1.8 million users, or 80% growth. With the increase in internet users, we also expect to see an increase online of Arabic language content, likely doubling within the next year or two. For telecoms operators, this represents both a challenge and an opportunity. Figuring out the best way to monetize this data usage is a top priority. The exciting next steps will be when we expand our 4G roaming footprint as well as the best voice quality service with applications like VOLTE Voiceover LTE, which can provide a remarkably different digital voice experience with 4G.</p><h4>Qatar is rapidly developing, and ICT and telecommunications are very important in that. How do you assess the national authority's efforts in facilitating this?</h4><p>I think there are three important reference points: 2016, which is the National Broadband Plan; the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where there is a mandate to have two suppliers of ICT in every building and stadium; and the Qatar National Vision 2030, which is about turning the country into a strong ICT knowledge-based economy. We are well on the path for 2016 in being a twin choice in broadband. Our role with regard to 2022 will be to develop technologies for the future. If you think about the video for the 2022 World Cup, it says that when you step out of your hotel room, a bus or train will literally pick you up outside the door and whisk you off to the stadium, and you will be using a smart device that will provide for everything. It is not, therefore, easy to define that for 2022. The easier part to define is 2030, because it is clear that by 2030 the major developments are going to be in places where there is substantial innovation and movement toward an ICT knowledge-based economy. I think the Qatari government is wise to adopt this milestone approach because it is possible to see each milestone the country achieves.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the specific reasons for taking on the Qatar Rail project?<br></h4><p>The main reason is to serve future generations in the State of Qatar. This is strongly linked to the State's vision for 2030, which is to provide an infrastructure network capable of serving the needs of the people. If you look at the situation in Qatar now, in terms of population and congestion, and compare that to the expected population of 2030, it is clear that, without a robust transportation system, the quality of life in Qatar would be severely impacted. Although we are a small country, most of our population is concentrated in a small and congested area. We have an additional 100,000 cars coming onto our roads every year. If you consider that growth rate continuing to 2030, any person looking at this population forecast will agree that, though the State of Qatar is small, it will need a public transportation system to serve the needs of the people. It is not only a rail system. It is an integrated system with rail, bus, and other modes of transport. In addition to that, it is our vision to be the hub for major events. The availability of a public transportation system will help Qatar to serve as a top destination for major events. It will make for a smooth and easy experience for visitors.</p><h4>The tunnel boring machines for the metro arrived in April 2014. Where do you expect the construction of the Doha Metro to be at the end of 2014?</h4><p>We have a plan, and we are on schedule. We received eight tunnel-boring machines and have already delivered them to each site. We expect to finalize the main foundation for around 15 stations by the end of 2014. By the end of 2014, we will award all the technical-related tenders for the metro. By the end of 2014, we will have all of the components of the metro. In addition to that, civil progress, which is one of the critical parts for the underground, has moved in line with the plan. According to the plan, the first metro can start its engine in October 2019. As of now, there is no indication that we will not be able to achieve this.</p><h4>In which specific elements of the Qatar Rail project are you still inviting foreign companies to come in and offer their expertise on?</h4><p>For Phase I, all of the projects will be awarded by the end of 2014. We have a master plan that is split into three phases. Once there is a need for further expansion, we will launch Phase II. Now, it is only in the planning stage. That is normal with any rail or metro project. You set up your network, and you will see that the network needs to be expanded every two to five years depending on the demand. In the coming years, the main focus will be on the operations and architectural companies to come and fit out the stations.</p><h4>The Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030 is pushing the country forward, and Qatar Rail is a very important element of that. How does it personally inspire you in managing this project?</h4><p>To be honest, people have asked why we need a metro. Qatar is small. But to have a vision, and know where you want to go, helps you to keep the path clear. You know what you want and understand what is required. This provides a clear motivation for any Qatari to do his best to achieve this vision. You should not look at what you need today. You need to think about the future and how you need to serve the future generations, so that the old people can do something good for the state. This is one of the main elements of QNV 2030. It has shifted the mindset of the people, especially for the management, from operations to strategy. Before, we did not announce our vision. However, once you announce your vision, even the management starts to think more strategically. Now, in any organization you will find will have a master plan for short-term, mid-term, and long-term planning. This is a key element to improve all of the management in the state of Qatar.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<url><![CDATA[know-how-it-works]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the construction sector in Qatar, and what is the role of STFA in it?</h4><p>STFA was the first Turkish construction company in Qatar. We have completed nine projects, but they have all been marine projects. Marine engineering projects have been our priority since the establishment of the company. We look forward to challenging projects that we can add value to. Since we sometimes do not have all the knowledge on a specific project, we team up with other foreign companies that have the right capabilities. So far, we are satisfied with our performance. There are some companies, like Ashghal and Kahramaa, which are going to issue new tenders. They are important players in the Qatari construction sector, and we need to adapt to their requirements and then try to increase our market share. I believe that in the coming years it is going to be easier for the companies that have been operating in Qatar for a long time, because they know how it works here.</p><p>Moreover, I expect the margins to go up because there will be a lot of contractors already engaged in other projects. They all have limited resources and will not be able to cover the coming projects until they have completed their current projects. This will take another three to four years. That means there will be more opportunities for new contractors to enter the market. Qatar is really trendy now. It has a highly competitive environment and provides a lot of opportunities for growth. We aim at staying in Qatar for the long term.</p><h4>When talking about construction in Qatar, how are regulations implemented?</h4><p>We have rules and regulations for immigrant workers, and the authorities inspect our labor camp on a regular basis. There will be more and more areas becoming regulated environments. On the other hand, I feel that standardization is approaching a level that it is making things over-complicated for the contractors that are entering Qatar. This can be a big barrier. In my opinion, companies with only Russian or Ukrainian experience will never be able to survive in Qatar because they fail to comply with the high safety requirements found here. This is a potentially beneficial situation for us and for other companies who really know the country. STFA is now treated like a local company.</p><h4>What is the significance of the tender for the Qatar Doha Metro Project for STFA as a whole?</h4><p>We won this tender with our partners and it is the largest contract ever signed by a Turkish contractor outside of Turkey. The eventual map of the Doha Metro network can still be expanded by 25% so we hope to be able to compete in that as well when the time comes. We are very excited because this project will ensure five years of future work for our company. Since it is a five-year project, it will create a balanced income. Once we have the right set up in Qatar, it will become a revenue source for STFA. This will allow us to expand our activities and feel more stable. This is greatly important for the construction business as it has lots of ups and downs. Eventually, we will have gained outstanding experience and we will have very skilled engineers. Considering that there will be projects worth $200 billion for the construction of railways in the Gulf area in the coming 10 years, this experience can add value to STFA in the whole region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Qatar play in the global strategy of Doka?<br></h4><p>Qatar is a booming market in the building and construction industry, which makes it a very important market for Doka. Worldwide, we have 100 branches, and we are active across the Gulf. In the region we currently see Saudi Arabia as our most important operation, followed by the UAE and Qatar. Our first project here was a water tank in 1998, and since then we have grown step by step to eventually offer all our services in 2002, when we opened our office in Qatar. We have increased ever since, and currently have 46,000 sqm here in Mesaieed.</p><h4>What is your position in the Qatari construction sector?</h4><p>Our main activity here is in formwork solutions. In high-rise buildings, we are definitely the market leader, but we are able to execute projects from small to large buildings, tunnels, and bridges. I would say our greatest service is not our product, but our engineering, since it is our knowledge on what we do, and on what we deliver to our clients. On top of that, we have a large warehouse and yard facilities that are capable of storing our materials in large volumes. This means that the availability of our materials is a big advantage. We are also capable of manufacturing formwork panels in our yard instead of doing it on-site. Another thing that I would like to highlight in this regard is the quality of our people. Our HR department at our headquarters takes special care of the education of our people. We have highly skilled people from all over the world, and every year we offer them specialized and individual training, because we want to have the best team possible.</p><h4>How is Doka Qatar preparing for projects in the lead up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup?</h4><p>We are currently working on several major government projects, such as the Doha Metro. This national railway project is where we are heavily involved with projects on several lines. This is a good opportunity to get our name out there among the leading authorities that will lead the World Cup preparations. In order to deliver now and in the future, the most important thing is a large yard and extensive stock. We have the biggest yard out of all our competitors, and although engineering is important, you need to deliver your materials very fast, which is the greatest benefit we can show our clients.</p><h4>What are the main challenges when working in Qatar?</h4><p>For the next three years, meeting deadlines will be a challenge. Sometimes time constraints force us to deliver at short notice, and that means we have no time to plan. However, based on years of working in Qatar and in the Middle East, we can definitely manage it. Still, that is a major endeavor at the moment, and it will be a challenge in the future.</p><h4>Looking forward, what are the primary objectives for Doka Qatar over the next five years?</h4><p>We want to maintain our position as a market leader. That is our challenge at the moment, and it is not easy as we are not alone. Our strategy in order to retain that position is to implement some more services. Doka's engagement with customers initiates from the earliest design stage of a project through to its shell completion. With each project requirement, customers receive added value services from us, including consulting, engineering, on-site supervision by Doka formwork instructors, sales, rental, preassembled formwork, material inspection, reconditioning, and return. Our ready-to-use service plays an important part for our clients as it saves time. Time is important, so assembling the formworks in our yard and preparing products beforehand is a service in high demand. In short, there is a local saying here; “Qatar deserves the best," and I am sure we are one of the best.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the services that Quantum Global Solutions provides to the construction sector?<br></h4><p>Quantum is among the market leaders in providing contractual, commercial, and forensic planning consultancy services to a diverse range of contractors and clients locally in Qatar, and supporting clients around the globe.  With an emphasis on solution-based services, we provide our clients with expertly managed, high-quality, tailored services to meet specific business objectives in a professional and efficient manner.  Our services are specialist and complex, but our goal is to get people talking, to listen to individual perspectives on an issue, and avoid disputes. In line with the Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) and the developments surrounding Qatar's hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the pace of construction in Qatar is phenomenal with, I would estimate, 30 years' development being carried out in the space of the next five years. The scale of the projects are enormous. According to Qatar National Bank (QNB), $183 billion of development remains to be completed by 2022.  Under such a high-pressure environment, change is inevitable and this can lead to disputes and conflict if issues are not managed correctly. Partnering with Quantum allows our clients to focus on their projects while we look after their profits.</p><h4>What is your competitive edge in this environment?</h4><p>Quantum understands the power of visualization and how a picture can tell a thousand words, and have developed a unique multi-media presentation method that assists us in presenting complicated issues in a clear and compelling manner. Our clients are actively involved in the multi-media presentation production process, looking at what's on the screen and what needs to be added to fully tell their story. Qatar is a multicultural country with many different languages and practices, and this in itself can cause many misunderstandings. Using this technique, we have successfully handled a number of cases triggering negotiation and amicable settlement, avoiding the need for the parties to follow a formal dispute resolution process. In our experience, the use of multimedia allows complicated issues to be presented clearly and gets people to talk and resolve construction disputes amicably.  The way it used to be… keeping it simple!</p><h4>What is your position in the growing construction market in Qatar?</h4><p>Quantum is continually growing to meet its local and international client requirements and currently have 80 specialist consultants working for our Qatari, GCC, and global clients. Quantum's flexible approach to working with our clients and meeting their individual requirements offers intrinsic value to projects of any size, value, and complexity, and we provide specialist consultancy support at all stages of the project, from cradle to grave, working with our client's on site teams. I have seen Qatar grow immeasurably over the past 15 years since I arrived and am continually impressed by the vision of the State to raise the bar when it comes to new development opportunities being seized by Qatar aligned to the QNV 2030 goals to create a long-term, sustainable, knowledge-based future for the country. I am confident that this future-proofing, forward thinking will continue to move Qatar forward.</p><h4>When describing the relationship you have with your clients, what are the main values that come to mind in Qatar?</h4><p>Partnership is the key.  Qataris are managing amazing construction projects, including many that are unique, challenging projects in our industry. It's how you manage change within these projects that is the key to success and you have to make sure that the parties continue talking together.  However, at Quantum we also work according to a company-wide philosophy of seven core values: vision, excellence, customer-focus, integrity, innovation, solution-based creativity and the Quantum family.  All of these values are intrinsic in how we do our business, how we become partners with a common goal with our clients, and how we develop the highest standards of employees in our industry through continuous professional development, on-the-job training, and knowledge sharing.</p><h4>Looking ahead, what is the strategy for growth you have here in Qatar?</h4><p>In Qatar, we will continue to partner with clients working on the many amazing construction opportunities within the country. We feel privileged to be part of this era in construction activity in Qatar and are fully committed to our future in Qatar.  We are now 80 people strong and see that doubling in the next five years. From our strong foundations in Qatar, we plan to continue to expand our operations throughout the Gulf and globally. Our current areas of focus, based on client demand, are the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and globally. The future looks strong for the State of Qatar and for Quantum.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-chance-for-all]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been QDB's most important achievements over the last year when it comes to promoting and supporting local SMEs?<br></h4><p>We know in Qatar, as everyone else does, that we are heavily dependent on oil and gas. The way we are building our diversification plan is by increasing the contribution of non-oil and gas productivity to our GDP. At QDB, it is not only about approving loans to SMEs, it's about giving a chance to those who are starting up. Our Al-Dahmeen program gives us that unique opportunity to see a business from its seeds to its yields. In 2013, Al-Dhameen was recognized by the Banker Middle East Product Awards for the Best SME Finance Scheme due to its effectiveness in building an ideal environment for the growth of entrepreneurship in the State of Qatar. The program has disbursed several hundred million riyal in guarantees, helping a record number of over 120 SMEs in Qatar. For us though, these guarantees are only as good as the support that comes with them for our partner banks and, therefore, their customers. What distinguishes QDB from like-minded development entities is the reputation it has earned from those it serves and the view it takes internally of its work. QDB is seen less as a bank and more as a strategic partner with the means and expertise to make a difference, providing the capital, advice, and skills needed to support Qatari businesses or individuals each step of the way.</p><h4>As a financial supporter to entrepreneurs, how do you partner with SME to ensure a return on the loan?</h4><p>I like to think of QDB as an overall business partner for SMEs, entrepreneurs, and Qatari exporters. Financing is only a part of that partnership, albeit a very important one. Through our partnership with clients and other key stakeholders we provide advice and training to enable the distribution of loans and support business. Our doors are always open for all clients and our advisors are happy to help with financing or any other issues they might have.</p><h4>What role does QDB have in encouraging foreign investment in Qatar?</h4><p>Qatar is a highly attractive market for foreign investors. Our exponential economic growth in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030 and accelerated preparations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup have generated a huge investment interest and QDB is very clear in its mission to support foreign investors. QDB is ready to welcome and assist companies, both foreign and local, that wish to expand or establish a business venture in Qatar. We help to link them to other government agencies and private sector organizations in order to help businesses make an informed decision regarding their investment prospects in Qatar. At the same time, we are keen to connect foreign investors with successful local SMEs and support healthy and fruitful partnerships.</p><h4>How do you assess the current ecosystem of SMEs and what challenges do you foresee emerging in the coming years?</h4><p>We are delighted to witness a consistent growth in the SME sector and great enthusiasm for entrepreneurship among Qataris. In September 2014, in partnership with the Social Development Center, we launched the Qatar Business Incubation Center (QBIC), a 20,000 sqm, mixed-use business incubator in Qatar and the largest in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition to funding the construction of the incubator, we allocated $7.4 million to support incubated projects, including 21 projects from the incubator's flagship Lean Startup program. A milestone of national importance, QBIC's launch means SMEs in Qatar are receiving integrated, world-class support through the provision of office space, workshops, laboratories, production services, technical and administrative support, and mentoring programs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[It's All In The Name]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[its-all-in-the-name]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The company name carries an interesting story. What does it precisely mean. How is its meaning reflected in your company's operations?<br></h4><p>SEIB is a name that relates to Qatari culture. This is something the founders of SEIB really focused on at the outset. The name refers to the individual who holds the lifeline of the pearl diver. The “SEIB" is responsible for the diver's success and survival. This name is reflects human care, team cooperation, risk management, expertise, and awareness, all of which tie into the insurance business. SEIB is not only the company name, it is what we do.</p><h4>What opportunities did you identify here in Qatar when you entered the market in 2009?</h4><p>The opportunity was identified during the global recession. Yet Qatar recorded a nominal GDP of around $71 billion, which was double that of 2005. However, that platform cannot translate into an opportunity unless it is matched by a clear vision, political stability, sound economic policies, and plans, in addition to a regulatory environment that would allow you to maneuver in the market place. We found those available in Qatar. That is how the opportunity came to light. The opportunity then became much more significant within the context of the Qatar National Vision 2030. Translating the known government plans into reality required massive investments by both government and private sectors. The role is mutual and is an opportunity for a new insurer that is capable of utilizing its expertise to be part of growing the Qatari insurance sector. On the regulatory side, the choice was on a platform that provides flexibility in operating locally as a national insurer and internationally due to the credibility that such a regulatory environment would provide to reinsurers and potential foreign business partners. Thus became the Qatar Financial Center (QFC) and its regulatory arm the QFCRA. On the other hand, the low insurance penetration rate of around 1% back in 2009, compared to a global average of 7%, was an intriguing challenge for a group of experts to establish for a business that penetrates the standard risks and apply creative products to elevate the insurance practice to new innovative levels.</p><h4>What is the position of SEIB insurance in the market, and what are your strengths?</h4><p>SEIB managed within a period of four years to play the game of a 40-year old player. We did this basically by setting up an organization that was solid in terms of structure, talent, risk management, and overall corporate governance. We lined up a group of among the best professionals in the insurance industry to make sure that our corporate vision paves the way to success through a strategy that rotates around superior customer centric elements. However, Qatar insurance market is not an easy one. Yet, the growing economy is, on the other hand, an incentive for us to continue to invest and focus on our core competitive advantages; technical expertise and customer service. SEIB is a strategic player that is strong in both commercial as well as retail lines. SEIB has the capability of providing the market with capital capacity to insure those large strategic projects, while at the same time focus on the SME and retail segments. Those latter segments need innovative solutions on a platform of superior customer service and that is what SEIB provides. The hard work of the past years was crowned this year by being awarded Insurance Company of the Year by Arabian Business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[new-concepts]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Qatar Meta Coats' core business?<br></h4><p>Qatar Meta Coats was established in 2001. Our main business is in aluminum glazing, space frames, steel fabrication, and powder coating. Facade work is our main professional business and we have done some large and interesting projects here. Our first major project was the College of the North Atlantic, which we started in 2006.We also worked on the City Center expansion phases two and three for our client Sheikh Faisal. After that, we worked on Barwa City, on the Barwa Commercial Avenue facade, and on Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital. At present, our largest job is Tawar Mall, which is under construction and will be completed in the summer of 2015. This project is more than just architectural; it is a green concept project.</p><h4>What is your strategy to expand your capabilities in Qatar?</h4><p>We are being awarded some good projects. Recently, we formed joint ventures with an Italian company and a company from Dubai for the Qatar Railway project and the sports stadium projects, for which we have submitted our pre-qualification. In order to expand our capability and the strength of our work, we are also qualified for steel jobs and have a galvanizing plant under construction. It is going to be the largest galvanizing plant in Qatar, with an area of around 12,000 sqm and that will be ready for production within a year. We see a lot of potential in the galvanizing field because there are no large galvanizing plants in Qatar presently.</p><h4>Are you looking into opportunities for further international collaborations?</h4><p>Yes, we are looking for opportunities in structural design. We also have a small construction company as a branch of Qatar Meta Coats. We have just started that, and the first project we have is for 16 villas. We are also interested in growing this section of the business with some large international companies, if they are interested.</p><h4>How are you aiming to exploit the construction opportunities brought about by the 2022 FIFA World Cup?</h4><p>With the 2022 FIFA World Cup coming up, there will be many new stadium construction projects. We are tendering for the Al-Wakrah Stadium, which we are really interested in. There are several other new stadiums that we can tender for, and as we are also into steel work we are expecting more jobs. This is just another reason why we are preparing our galvanizing plant to be ready within a year.</p><h4>What do you present as Qatar Meta Coats' primary field of expertise when you try to win a tender?</h4><p>In the tendering stage, we mostly propose better services at better prices. Similarly, we have design expertise; hence, we are able to check the client's design and propose something easier and better. During the tendering process, we keep the client informed at every stage, get their feedback, visit them, and have meetings to ensure that they remain involved. In many cases, such as the Tawar Mall project, the client accepted a lot of our ideas and designs.</p><h4>Do you need to upgrade and increase your capacity in anticipation of a growth in business due to the 2022 and 2030 targets?</h4><p>Definitely; however, it will depend on the workload. In order to be able to jump into opportunities, we have organized the company in a flexible manner, especially in regard to manpower. We increase our manpower as it becomes necessary. During every project, we apply the manpower that we need and during emergencies we mobilize immediately through manpower suppliers and agencies. We have established our company here and have the entire infrastructure ready, meaning for us, it is easy to double production. As I said, we are qualified for steel fabrication, and we are qualified for facade jobs. This is why we wanted to expand our galvanizing business and do everything in-house.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the company's experience over this first year of operating the first Es'hail satellite?<br></h4><p>After the launch in August 2013, it took another three months before we could operate from the satellite. We announced on the country's National Day, December 18, the first broadcast. We have tried to link national events with our achievements. The first broadcasts from Es'hail 1 was Al-Jazeera network news followed by beIN Sports in January. In that respect, the experience really started when we began broadcasting and having customer interactions. It is clear that lessons are being learnt. Es'hail 1 still has some capacity to be marketed. There is a demand from local customers; however, we do not want to keep it only local. We would like to have others as well because we want to be a regional operator.</p><h4>The first satellite is operated in partnership with your French partner Eutelsat. In the future, you are aiming to be fully independent. What is your strategy toward realizing that objective?</h4><p>This objective should be met when we operate Es'hail 2. Es'hail 1 is partially owned by the French due to their experience; hence, they are operating the satellite. Still, we have a center here for interfacing with customers and for troubleshooting. Es'hail 2 will be a fully owned satellite. We are building a huge operations center in the northwest of Qatar dedicated to it. However, we also have to build the human capital. During Eshail 1, we created a training program with our French partners. During the manufacturing process of the second satellite, we have a similar idea to deploy engineers to our new partner in Japan. The satellite industry is new in Qatar, and it is fair to say that we do not have Qatari experts. Qatar is small in terms of population, but that does not mean we should not develop and train our people, which is what we are doing now. We are investing heavily not only in equipment, but also in human capital.</p><h4>As an operator of satellites in this region, there are some competitors from Egypt and Saudi Arabia. What is your competitive edge over these other operators in the region?</h4><p>No doubt, we have the Egyptian NileSat as one of the largest competitors and we have ArabSat. When we decided to get in we did not want to start in a greenfield state; therefore, we decided to enter into discussion with ArabSat, who owns 26West. We got the acquisition, so 26East now has two operators, namely ArabSat and Es'hailSat. I do not consider ArabSat as a competitor; I consider it a partner. In competing with 7West, we have to have different advantages to bring and attract contract providers. The edge here as I can see is price and quality of service.</p><h4>What are your plans in expanding your operations in order to compete with NileSat?</h4><p>When we started in 2010, we had a tentative plan to launch six satellites. However, any strategy and ongoing business plan should be refreshed based on market factors and requirements. When we started the operation and saw the reality, we found the strategy should be refreshed and we should not quote a number. Satellites should happen based on requirements, on demand, and on company expansion. Now, I can say that Es'hail 1 and Es'hail 2 are moving according to the first version of the strategy. We are beginning to think about Es'hail 3, and its requirements, and where to deploy Es'hail 3, because any satellite launching has to have a spectrum and money. We have an issue with the spectrum, since we do not own one and striking a deal with Arabsat costs a lot. These factors should be considered when you make your strategy. We know the changes that happen in the market now and how it moves forward.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What specific tasks does the New Port Project (NPP) seek to fulfill?<br></h4><p>The vision for the Project is to develop a world-class port with advanced cargo handling systems, sustainable designs, as well as rail facilities that will link the port to the wider GCC region. Designed with the need to achieve this vision in mind, and to deliver much needed capacity, the Port will have many facilities, including three high-throughput container terminals, a multi-use terminal, and a general cargo terminal, as well as facilities for the Qatar Coast Guard and an offshore supply base. With an access channel of 10 km in length, 15m deep, and 300m wide, the port will be capable of handling the largest container vessels. With advanced port facilities and equipment, including the latest mobile harbor cranes, the port will offer fast and efficient services for unloading goods.</p><h4>What are the main benefits of the New Port Project being a greenfield project?</h4><p>Firstly, ports are capital-intensive investments, and, therefore, it is always best to plan for their long-term use and viability by taking the country's projected development into consideration. The projected growth in Qatar's import volumes dictated our master planning for the port. The demand for raw materials to complete large construction projects to prepare Qatar for hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup exceeds the capacity of the current port. The new port needs to meet those demands. On the project, our master planning was helped not only by it being a greenfield development but by the choice of location for the port. The choice of location was a strategic decision, and the result of an extensive research process during which seven other sites were also investigated. The current site offers several advantages. Firstly, the location is close to Umm Said and uses the same shipping channel. Secondly, this is an area that can and will be developed in future and is government owned. Lastly, its location will allow integration with other ongoing transport projects. Additionally, the proximity to the Qatar Economic Zone 3 and Mesaieed Industrial City will also maintain synergies between these industrial developments.</p><h4>The Project is budgeted at $7.4 billion. How is the trajectory of this project organized?</h4><p>As we designed the Port with the capacity to increase its cargo volumes, the facility will be completed in three phases. With the completion of Phase I by 2016, Container Terminal 1 will become operational at an annual capacity of 2 million TEUs. The completion of the Phase II and III expansions by 2020 will eventually result in a combined capacity of 6 million TEUs.</p><h4>Both Qatari and foreign companies have shown interest in collaborating on the Project. What criteria do you use in the tender process and are you still inviting foreign companies?</h4><p>The NPP is proud to be a pioneer of a robust and transparent tendering process. Our website is an important part in that process. The website lists, in detail, the scope of work of the current tenders, the awarded tenders, and the future tenders. There are strict approval procedures for the award of any contract, including the endorsement and approval of the separate Technical and Tender Committees and submissions are only opened if tenderers meet the minimum technical requirements. In terms of bid qualification, local companies must be financially capable to perform, as well as having the required experience and having a team of experts at their disposal. Their equipment also needs to be of a high standard. Infrastructure and buildings must be awarded to Qatari companies while, for equipment and marine projects, we allow international parties to bid directly since certain equipment is generally not manufactured here in Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of investments made in transport facilities and infrastructure here in Qatar?<br></h4><p>The country is investing heavily in infrastructure right now, as this is part of the Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030. On the other hand we have the 2022 FIFA World Cup, for which Qatar has made a public commitment and has set deadlines for the various infrastructure projects. This was the catalyst for a host of projects to be awarded. As mentioned infrastructure projects have accelerated like the airport project that was finalized recently. Also work has begun on the seaport, rail, and express networks, as well as mega construction projects such as Lusail. This spending has revived the economy, causing a population influx to Doha, which in turn triggers higher consumption and increases demand for services. Aramex offers services to diversified sectors and is regularly investing in expanding its infrastructure in Qatar to cater for this surge in demand. The main concentration is on the fast growing sectors that are finance, wholesale, and retail. In that regard, we can say that Qatar's investments in infrastructure directly impact our business.</p><h4>With regard to the operations of Aramex, what do you see here in Qatar as being the core activities of the company?</h4><p>Aramex Qatar offers its clients complete supply chain solutions, including transportation, courier, and warehousing services; the one-stop shop offering is considered as one of the competitive advantages of Aramex in Qatar. We are in the business of selling a solution to the clients rather than an activity. Considering the various industries we understand the business of our clients and offer a full supply chain solution that includes a bundle of our services to fulfill the client's requirements.</p><h4>How would you characterize the current e-commerce business in Qatar?</h4><p>There has been an exponential growth of online shoppers in this region in recent years. PayPal's 2013 report states that while e-commerce companies are still struggling with a variety of challenges, from customer trust to reliable logistics, the report estimates that 30 million people shopped online in the Middle East last year, up 65% from 2011, and that the e-commerce market is set to grow from $11.2 billion today to $15 billion by 2015. Of that $15 billion, Saudi Arabia will account for $2.7 billion, Qatar will account for $1.25 billion, and the UAE will account for the lion's share at $5.1 billion. Aramex was able to spot this opportunity early on. Aramex started building its online shopping platform Shop and Ship, 14 years ago, and today it has evolved to a comprehensive e-commerce solution for online shoppers worldwide. This product enables online shoppers to buy from online retailers around the world. Qatar is an affluent market and people love to shop. Shop and Ship has given individuals the possibility to shop online from global retailers across the world. Combining these factors has resulted in a surge of Aramex's e-commerce business in this country.</p><h4>What are some tailored services that you offer to the hydrocarbons business?</h4><p>Aramex offers customized services to the oil and gas companies. The company's extensive global network, in addition to years of experience in the supply chain industry, has created a wealth of organizational knowledge that allowed Aramex to create a specialized team dedicated to offer end-to-end supply chain management solutions to the oil and gas sector that includes customs clearance activities, project management, hub management center, regional distribution centers, and supplier order management, up to last mile field delivery.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Having opened its doors in 2009, Barwa Bank has already made a real impact by realizing substantial growth rates every year. What are the main forces behind this rapid growth?<br></h4><p>It was our decision to choose service as a point of competition. We really have the desire to make the bank revolve around the customers. We focus on understanding and catering to our clients' needs, ensuring the best-in-class service possible, and offering tailor-made services that satisfy those needs. We understand that the mass-market network for banking is already well provided for, but we feel that there is a space for a focused bank that looks at service for a selective customer base, and clearly our clients agree. In 2013, we maintained our title of fastest growing bank in Qatar in terms of profitability and also in terms of asset growth. Another advantage we have is the way we operate. We have a light hierarchy, which enables us to move quickly when it comes to decision-making and execution. That flexibility makes our business model unique in many ways.</p><h4>The sukuk market in Qatar is likely to continue to grow due to big infrastructure projects in the run up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. How does this development feature in the growth strategy of the bank?</h4><p>The sukuk market is an important area of growth for us. Since our inception, we've worked extensively on building a qualified team that can compete in this sector. We have held several joint lead management positions for a number of sukuks, namely the State of Qatar sukuk, followed by the Republic of Turkey sukuk in 2012, which is a testament to our competence and expertise domestically and internationally. The capital markets business is very much a credentials business, and being involved in such high-profile transactions has the virtue of attracting new business. We're confident that we'll continue to play an increased role in future sukuk issuance. When it comes to sukuk, we are particularly proud to have set and launched the first sukuk trading platform in Qatar.</p><h4>The Qatar Exchange went from being a frontier market to being considered as an emerging market in 2014. What does this mean for Qatar's financial sector and the economy as a whole?</h4><p>We're very excited and happy for the acknowledgement of the many achievements of the financial sector in Qatar. It's the result of years of hard work and the clear strategy laid out by our financial sector regulators and executed by all financial institutions in the country, backed by a strong economic environment at the state level. This acknowledgement will definitely serve to increase the already huge appetite of investors and businesses to enter the Qatari market and will further cement Qatar's position as a regional financial center. We at Barwa Bank are extremely excited about this, and expect to see an increase in business activity as a result.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>QIC celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2014 knowing that it is the largest insurance company in terms of profitability and market capitalization in the MENA region. What are the core values that have made QIC into such a successful company?<br></h4><p>At QIC Group, we value each employee and acknowledge their own distinctive contribution. We value their effort, enterprise, contribution, and opinions. Our Group is built on teamwork, respect, and mutual trust. Each person, at whatever level she or he may operate at, is empowered and will therefore make his or her own unique contribution. Employees are encouraged to be responsible for their own actions. We encourage positive contributions, acknowledge innovation, and reward excellence. At the same time, we are open to constructive feedback and candid comments, and are flexible in absorbing these into our business model. These are the core values that have contributed to QIC's success.</p><h4>With the extension of shares in February 2014, QIC increased its total capital by 30% to $439 million. What does this increased financial base practically imply for QIC?</h4><p>In February 2014, QIC's paid-up capital increased to $439 million with the issuance of bonus shares at 25%. QIC has always ensured that capital adequacy remains extremely strong to fully support targeted growth. The current shareholders equity for QIC Group, which is in excess of QAR1.6 billion, clearly demonstrates the extremely strong capital adequacy, which we expect to maintain in the short term, in line with our business forecasts for the coming years.</p><h4>Recently QIC acquired Antares Holding. How does this acquisition feature in the company's plans for international expansion?</h4><p>Companies must innovate and grow in order to avoid stagnation. With globalization, it was evident that there were both opportunities to be grasped and challenges to be met. Whilst retaining our leadership role in our home market, we chose to be ambitious and entered the global insurance and reinsurance arena. Our first venture beyond the borders of Qatar dates back to 1968, when we set up our first branch office in Dubai, UAE. QIC's internationalization strategy is aligned to our Group's mission, which is to be ranked amongst the top 50 global insurers by 2030. Gathering momentum, we are spreading beyond the Middle East, and have now positioned ourselves to be known and recognized in the global insurance and reinsurance arena. Qatar Insurance Group was highly successful in acquiring UK-based Lloyds Syndicate Antares Holdings Limited in a deal that was worth more than $275 million. With this acquisition, the Group has gained a foothold in the Lloyd's market and access to markets outside the MENA region. Furthermore, Antares also offers the Group a Bermudian Platform with a Class 3 reinsurance license. Antares, together with the Group's reinsurance arm Qatar Reinsurance Company (Qatar Re), constitute the key pillars of QIC's international operations, generating approximately 60% of overall insurance revenue.</p><h4>Qatar, like most of the countries in the region, sees a relatively low rate of insurance penetration. In which segment of insurance services do you see the most potential for short-term growth?</h4><p>My outlook is bullish for retail, given that the penetration ratio of insurance spending to GDP is particularly low when compared with global benchmarks. However, the ongoing development in infrastructure and energy will continue to attract more capital from both local as well as international sources. Going forward, I envisage that with the right mix of retail products, the market will gain more prominence in the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the responsibilities of KAHRAMAA in the national network of utilities?<br></h4><p>KAHRAMAA has the privilege of being the sole transmission and distribution system owner and operator (TDSOO) for the electricity and water sector in Qatar. The Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation, or KAHRAMAA, was established in July 2000 based Law 10 to regulate and maintain the supply of electricity and water to customers. Core areas of business related to buying, distributing, and selling electricity and water include: formulating power and water purchase agreements (PWPA) and providing the necessary technical and corporate support for the establishment of generation and desalination ventures; owning, constructing, and operating electricity and water transmission and distribution networks in the State of Qatar; setting up plans and programs for the development of electricity and water transmission and distribution networks; laying out regulations, standards, and codes of practice for electricity and water supplies to buildings and facilities; providing consultancy services related to its activities and operations; and regulating cooling services.</p><h4>In May 2014, KAHRAMAA ordered Phase 11 of the national network expansion to the value of $2.2 billion. How does this project fit into the larger scale of utility expansions?</h4><p>KAHRAMAA's electricity and water transmission and distribution network expansion plans are made based on the following criteria: demand growth, reinforcements, and the replacement of old and aging equipment. However, there are yearly updates on the expansion plans for the electricity and water networks as KAHRAMAA has five-year rolling plans that are updated every year. In 2014-15, KAHRAMAA announced Phase 12 for electricity transmission network expansion and also announced Water MEGA reservoirs, with its associated main piping network to increase the state's water storage capacity.</p><h4>Electricity generation capacity has grown rapidly to 8,755 MW in 4Q2013. Is there an imminent need to further increase this when taking into account preparations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup?</h4><p>KAHRAMAA forecasts its demand 10 years ahead of time and all the required generation capacity expansion plans are executed at the right time considering all the main national events and the growth in demand, all while maintaining the required supply reliability and security. Facility D is expected to see its first production in 2017 and full production in 2018. Special arrangements for the World Cup are already in place.</p><h4>Sustainability in both energy and water is essential to the future of Qatar. What initiatives have you forwarded to promote this and how are they received by the people?</h4><p>There are many initiatives that KAHRAMAA has initiated to promote sustainability within its activities and services, including: the Tarsheed program to reduce by 20% and 35% electricity and water consumption, respectively, within five years; introducing solar energy usage on KAHRAMAA premises to generate about 200 MW before 2022; implementing smart grids to adopt any new renewable energies; loss reduction; and coordinating with local government and the private sector on renewables.</p><h4>What are the specific objectives for KAHRAMAA over the next five years?</h4><p>KAHRAMAA aims to excel at customer services, provide high-quality water and electricity, increase social advocacy and environmental compliance, promote regulatory changes in the energy, water, and district cooling markets, strengthen financial performance, improve corporate governance and risk management, enhance processes and systems, optimize asset performance, attract, develop, and retain a high-performing workforce and support Qatarization, and ensure a safe and healthy working environment.</p><h4>How does the Qatar National Vision 2030 inspire you in managing KAHRAMAA?</h4><p>In recognition of the importance of meeting the state's expectations of a well-structured and managed electricity and water sector capable of meeting the Qatar National Vision 2030 challenges, KAHRAMAA has refreshed and launched a strategy to ensure full alignment and support for the vision and ensure that it can continue to provide a safe, high quality, and efficient supply of electricity and water well into the future. The strategy has been developed based on careful consideration and vision.

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most important recent developments at the Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE)?<br></h4><p>The first thing that comes to mind is that since the start of 2013, the QSE has become one of the best performing financial markets in the region. Moreover, we underwent an institutional upgrade by MSCI, which now gives our stock exchange Emerging Market status. We also became a full member to the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), earning Qatar a stronger reputation as a safe-haven for investment. The market thus became highly attractive to the investor post-upgrade. The successful IPO of Mesaieed Petrochemical Holding Company toward the end of 2013, notably brought investors back to the market. We know this because the amount invested in 1Q2014 was equal to that of the whole of 2013. It was pushed by the upgrade, but also by the announced national budget for infrastructure. As the Qatar Stock Exchange, it is our task to introduce and improve products and services to facilitate liquidity provision.</p><h4><br>What are the specific benefits of membership of the WFE?</h4><p>Being a member of the WFE brings certification; it means recognition of the progress made by the QSE at various technical, regulatory, and operational levels. Again, this is vital for appealing to international investors. We are happy to be part of an organization that represents markets worldwide that are fair, transparent, well regulated, and that play an important role in the economies of their respective countries. Although we are not even 20 years old in operational terms, we already rank alongside the 100-year-old exchanges, confirming our great progress. The WFE membership is an important reference for many international investors about the investment atmosphere in the member markets as it reflects the member exchanges' commitment to implementing the best international practices and standards. This membership will enhance our ability to exchange information and expertise with other members, and enables us to continue developing the capital sector in Qatar.</p><h4><br>In anticipation of increased foreign interest in Qatar, the government issued a decision elevating the foreign ownership ceiling to 49%. What has been the response to this investment opportunity?</h4><p>This has been welcomed by international investors, giving them more opportunities to pursue in Qatar. They will be able to invest in these well-established and profitable Qatari listed companies. The decision also allows citizens of the GCC countries to be treated as Qatari citizens in terms of equity ownership. In general, this will help in boosting liquidity in the market through attracting foreign institutional investors. We approach these potential investors in two ways. We organize roadshows to the US and Europe, where we promote opportunities and update people on the latest market developments. However, we will also organize an exhibition here in Qatar to make people aware of its potential.  All of our listed companies will attend and inform the public on their status.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the strong Qatari position in the global energy market help Qatar Petroleum International (QPI) in its mission to build an international investment portfolio?<br></h4><p>With the world's third-largest proven conventional gas reserves, Qatar has successfully positioned itself as the leading global exporter of LNG. As the international investment arm of Qatar Petroleum (QP), QPI was founded with the aim of securing a multi-billion dollar portfolio of global investments with leading international companies by actively pursuing opportunities that enhance its portfolio diversification across the energy value chain. In other words, QPI was mandated to fulfil the critical role of incubator for QP by building a portfolio of assets and opportunities internationally. In anticipation of increasing competition in the global gas market and slowing growth in domestic oil and gas projects, through QPI's global portfolio, QP is expanding its international presence in an effort to diversify Qatar's economy by growing its downstream and petrochemical sectors. Furthermore, QPI's alliances with partners who have appropriate technological expertise, as well as a proven track record, accentuates more opportunities and provides QP with a dynamic platform to position itself as a leading global energy player. There is huge political will for the Qatari oil and gas sector to move forward and internationalize, and this activity has so far been spearheaded by QPI. As a significant international energy investor QPI has carved a pivotal role for QP with the aim of promoting and advancing the interests of the State of Qatar in the global energy arena.</p><h4>How would you characterize your current portfolio and in which segment do you want to increase your activities?</h4><p>Since 2007 QPI has secured a multibillion-dollar portfolio of investment partnerships and joint ventures globally including within the UK, Italy, Greece, the US, Canada, Brazil, Singapore, Vietnam, Egypt, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and with other potential located around Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. The long-term goal is to develop infrastructure to support Qatar in maintaining its global market share. While QPI boasts a diversified investment portfolio, there has been great emphasis on upstream activities. QPI's upstream focus has been on producing properties with development and exploration upsides in its target markets. The upstream segment is expected to constitute the majority of QPI's future activities. The downstream segment on the other hand gives QPI the opportunity to diversify by going into the full stream of the energy value chain.</p><h4>What is your method for overcoming the challenges that arise during projects that are located in underdeveloped industries?</h4><p>QPI endorses comprehensive partnerships and stresses the importance of cooperation across all the projects and markets it operates in. As such, QPI aims to leverage its excellent relationships with countries that have similar interests to develop international investments with both national oil companies and international oil majors. The types of challenges we may encounter are naturally project specific. For example, site clearance may be one issue that may deter many foreign investors and is also a major concern for the project countries themselves as it creates a bottleneck that hinders FDI. We will continue to promote multilateral cooperation in the field of energy, and encourage dialogue. Our economic relations with underdeveloped countries will stimulate business and the cooperation environment in the field of energy as well as in other areas.</p><h4>Is there an ambition to eventually develop into an international operator?</h4><p>QPI has catalyzed QP's ultimate ambition to become the number one NOC in overseas investment. Over the last few years, QPI has partnered with leading global players to form 10 joint ventures across four continents, creating strategic and commercially attractive international investments. QPI's existing inter-governmental and IOC relationships will help leverage QP to become a partner and supplier of choice across the energy industry and eventually develop into a worldwide investor. QPI is proud to have strategically expanded and strengthened QP's international investment portfolio. Our recent investment in Brazil represents a major achievement in our long-term partnership with Shell, as it is our first upstream investment in Latin America. This project is not just a noteworthy achievement for our organization; it brings significant future economic benefits to Qatar by strengthening and diversifying its energy supplies for generations to come. Offshore production is seen as another route for expansion. QPI has struck a series of agreements over the past few years to develop petrochemical production projects in Vietnam and Singapore, among other places. These projects will see Qatar provide feedstock for other offshore developments and help the country expand its profile along the global supply chain.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most important achievements in your first years?<br></h4><p>Muntajat has started to fulfill its promise of bringing value to Qatar and assumed responsibility for the marketing and distributing rights of all of Qatar's chemical and petrochemical products. Looking back at 2014, we can say that it was a vital year to Muntajat as we completed the migration of sales, marketing and distribution activities of Qatar-produced chemicals, polymers, and fertilizers. This allowed us to implement our strategy and we were able to penetrate the market and connect with our customers without any disturbance. Over these first two years, we managed to increase our export from 7.7 million tons in 2013, to 10 million tons in 2014. In 2014, our focus shifted toward building scale and expanding our reach through the establishment of our global marketing network, Muntajat B.V., which we inaugurated the headquarters  for in The Hague, Netherlands, on the December 2, 2014. We have already opened 17 marketing offices around the world, which currently service customers in more than 120 countries.</p><h4>Muntajat represents the majority of Qatar's chemical and petrochemicals industry on the global stage. How do you work together with these companies in order to maximize the benefits?</h4><p>We work closely with our business associates to orchestrate production, because it will be key to our and their success. Muntajat was created with the idea to generate the best value for our shareholders and the different producing entities, so we enjoy great support in our efforts to maximize benefits. In practice, this means that our supply-chain committee has regular meetings in which we communicate on how to manage the different stockpiles and help each other to improve the undertaking and cater to the requirements of the customer. On the management level, we organize quarterly meetings where we review all activities and align our objectives to ensure that we are reaching our target. We all share the idea that communication is one of the keys to our success.</p><h4>What is the specific competitive edge of Qatar when compared to the region?</h4><p>Without competition life becomes boring, so we embrace this healthy challenge. I believe that it forces us to be creative and to enhance the services that we provide to the customer, be it before or after sales. Competition also requires you to enhance your production, efficiency, and quality. Our production is largely based on gas, so when it comes to production cost we have the advantage over everybody. Another strength of Qatar is our geographical location, as we can easily reach out to the Asian and European markets. Shale gas will have an impact on the market and will increase competition, but we don't shy away from that. With a volatile oil price and a market in flux, we need to be ready and look after efficiency and have a tight control on the operation.</p><h4>How are you planning to further develop your international reach?</h4><p>Muntajat already has a foothold in over 120 countries with its products. The global marketing, sales and distribution activities are overseen by 17 Muntajat B.V. overseas offices. The offices are distributed in South-East Asia, Central Asia, Africa and Europe. The US and Latin America are already important markets for us, so we are currently assessing how to be closer to our customers in these markets.</p><h4>How does Muntajat prepare itself to accommodate growth in the petrochemicals industry?</h4><p>The industry is projected to increase its production figures in the coming years. Muntajat is ready and prepared to accommodate this plan. Muntajat is not only selling, marketing, and distributing the products; we are also part of the team that is managing these projects in which we are heavily invested. Qatar will utilize the majority of hydrocarbon resources to develop the downstream industries. The government is investing in infrastructure and we expect the new port to have a major influence on our operations. It will allow us more flexibility as delivery times will be shortened.</p><h4>How does the Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030 inspire you?</h4><p>The QNV 2030 is of great importance and we should appreciate what Qatar has given us as individuals and as companies. It is our turn to respond to this by putting all our energy and knowledge into the realization of this vision. We have to pass this on to the next generations and at Muntajat we are currently training 35 Qataris to lead this company forward in the future. We are hoping to drive this economy forward with the young talent that is coming in. There is still so much to achieve and Qatar is doing a lot to put this together.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Looking back, what were the most important decisions taken by the Ministry of Transport over the last year?<br></h4><p>Since the formation of the Ministry of Transport and the issuance of Emiri Decree No. 31 of 2014, which details our responsibilities, the Ministry has progressed on two major work streams. The first one is the developing of the internal organization and the building of our capacity. Secondly, the Ministry has facilitated the delivery of ongoing major state transport projects, such as the opening of Hamad International Airport, the completion of the new port project's quay wall, and the implementation of a public bus improvement action plan that includes the introduction of the West Bay bus service to promote a public transport culture. The Ministry has also initiated a program to develop a multi-agency resilience plan for transportation under the national resilience program in preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and to ensure the safety and security of the nation's air, marine, rail, and land transport sectors in the future.</p><h4>Improvements in transportation facilities are essential for a country to reach its full potential. What is your vision for providing the State of Qatar with the needed transportation facilities?</h4><p>The vision of our Ministry is aligned with Qatar's National Vision 2030, and we are working to further integrate the strategic goals of various transportation modes to this vision. As the purpose of the Ministry's formation is to integrate the comprehensive transportation system of the country, our focus is to achieve an integrated multimodal transportation system that complements economic growth and improves people's quality of life by bringing in world-class and state-of-the-art transportation systems and infrastructure. Ideally, we would see public and sustainable transport modes being the preferred modal choice among residents and tourists.</p><h4>The first phase of Qatar's new port is due to be completed in 2016. What will be the impact of this new facility on the local economy?</h4><p>Qatar faces a high demand for construction materials to complete key infrastructure projects in preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The port will play a significant role in ensuring these material needs are met. The new port will provide increased throughput with a capacity for 2 million TEUs per year, eventually increasing to over 6 million. This will then be supported by transshipment links by rail, sea, and road to the GCC region. The establishment of an economic zone adjacent to the new port will facilitate manufacturing industries and position the nation to increase its non-oil and gas exports. The Ministry is also working with stakeholders to increase tourism through international cruise ship visits to Doha.</p><h4>Once completed, Qatar's rail network will be connected with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as part of the GCC Railway. What is the importance of this project to the future of the GCC region?</h4><p>Today, we live in a globally connected world, where ease of accessibility has a major impact on the economic development of countries. The GCC Railway will be a major socio-economic milestone in the history of the GCC, which will further strengthen our long-stranding brotherly relations. To keep up with Qatar's growing population and economy, we require reinforced transportation systems that continue to link industries to markets and people to services.</p><h4>In which specific elements of the future development of Qatar's transportation network are you inviting international companies to contribute?</h4><p>The Ministry encourages local companies to participate, though its megaprojects require the involvement of many international players. The Ministry also welcomes all world-class service and product providers that can deliver on high standards of quality, health and safety standards, innovation, and sustainability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of Mowasalat within the Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030?<br></h4><p>The QNV 2030 is for the whole country, and part of that is transportation. We have an obligation to provide and improve sustainable public transportation, from buses to taxis. For example, in 2014 we approved and launched a nationwide plan for a better bus service, through which we worked from six major stations to connect the whole country. With investments in infrastructure, such as the new airport and the upcoming metro, it is our job to make sure everything is well integrated.</p><h4>What are the projects that Mowasalat is currently working on?</h4><p>We see that there is a major demand for taxis, meaning we are evaluating how to respond to that need. Karwa recently partnered with Capital Taxis as the country's fourth provider after Al Million, Al Ijarah, and Profit Group. We are, therefore, responding to that demand, all while keeping an eye on the future. We are in the final stages of making arrangements to run a point-to-point taxi service in order to run more efficiently. On top of that, we are also working on a system for marine transportation such as water taxi, but that is being considered in planning.</p><h4>How are you currently planning your preparations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup?</h4><p>When we organized the Asian Games in 2006, we gained a lot of knowledge on how to run an international event from a transportation perspective. The best example is that, since the event we have only relied on our own driving school and training center in order to remain in full control. Looking ahead to 2022, we will be preparing step by step. First, we need to add more taxis. As the  regulator for taxi services, we set high standards to be followed by Karwa taxi and the other four franchises. We plan to add two more of them and ensure customers have easy access and availability. Currently, we have 3,500 and, by the summer of 2015, we need to have around 4,000-4,500. Ultimately, we plan to have 7,000 taxis. Besides that, we also plan to increase buses from 300 to at least 1,000.</p><h4>Do you currently partner with your international colleagues in order to learn best practices?</h4><p>In November 2014, we hosted the international UITP Second Public Transport for Large Events Summit at the National Convention Centre. This biannual conference, held under the kind patronage of the Minister of Transport, was opened by the Prime Minister and Minister of Interior and was a great event. The theme was Safety &amp; Security for Large Events, and we combined with a showcase to bring together experts in the industry for knowledge sharing to learn best practices and get an update on the latest innovation. An example of what we learned there is that it is essential to establish an understanding between the transport and non-transport sector. Thanks to the event, we have created more awareness about safety and security, which is a major issue.</p><h4>How will the infrastructure improvements impact the country's development and economy in the long run?</h4><p>When I look at the development of mass public transportation, it is clear that transporting mass amounts of people from point A to point B, instead of each person going individually, will make a huge difference. More people will arrive in time due to less traffic, a free flow of traffic, fewer parking challenges, and more choice available to visitors and public. All these are positive developments for the economy and society of Qatar and contribute to realizing the QNV 2030. We are here to support the country moving forward. In terms of 2022, I am ready for it and looking forward. We are building the infrastructure for 2030 and beyond.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How you do assess the inaugural months of the new Hamad International Airport?<br></h4><p>The opening of Hamad International Airport was a moment of great symbolic pride for Qatar Airways, and we are seeing continued growth at our new home and hub since the start of its operations in May 2014. Hamad International Airport has distinguished itself as a world-class airport and a key global hub. The airport continues to add new facilities to its passenger terminal complex, including new duty free shopping outlets, a spa, swimming pool, squash courts, and much more to ensure passengers have a seamless and hassle-free journey. This is, of course, in addition to our luxurious lounge facilities, and a wealth of restaurants designed to suit every palate from around the world. Hamad International Airport is a destination in its own right, for passengers transiting through, or traveling to Doha as their final destination.</p><h4>In 2014, Qatar Airways became a fully government-owned airline. How has this impacted the company?</h4><p>From a small carrier just 17 years ago, into one of the world's leading airlines, Qatar Airways has grown tremendously from the vision instilled in the airline from the beginning by The Father Emir, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. As the national carrier of the State of Qatar, the national colors are already proudly displayed upon the more than 140 aircraft in the fleet. As such, we are a representative of our nation when flying the flag to all corners of the globe. Not only does this apply to our livery, but it is also symbolic of the five-star service we offer our passengers, through to the impeccable standards that we adhere to as a company—a reflection of Qatari values and hospitality.</p><h4>Qatar Airways continues to expand its fleet and grows by around 30% YoY. In which geographic areas would you like to increase the Qatar Airways footprint, and which criteria do you use when selecting new destinations?</h4><p>Qatar Airways has seen rapid growth in the 17 years since its launch as a regional carrier. In 2014 alone, the airline expanded its footprint in the US, adding further destinations of Philadelphia, Miami, and Dallas, increasing our gateways in the US to seven. Europe has seen the added locations of Edinburgh and Larnaca, while other routes have been de-linked, meaning that we now serve these destinations non-stop from Doha, such as Bali and Phuket. Africa has also seen the advent of new routes to Djibouti and Asmara, together with the de-linking of our Cape Town route, which previously went via Johannesburg. Our expansion into Africa will continue, but also Qatar Airways will continue to add new destinations around the globe and capacity on existing destinations as our fleet grows in number.</p><h4>As Group CEO, you have said that the company's main goal of reaching the top-tier in the international airline industry has been achieved. Looking ahead, what have you identified as the main objectives?</h4><p>We have made significant strides forward in recent years and continue to grow at a significant pace. Not only did 2014 see the opening of our new home and hub, Hamad International Airport, but it has also been a year of strong fleet growth, with both the A380 and A350 as new additions to our family of aircraft, and A320neo joining in 2015. Designed to support and sustain Qatar's historic development as a nation, Hamad International Airport is delivering an exponential increase in Qatar's capacity to handle international movements of people, goods, capital, knowledge, and technology. It is a vital element of Qatar's National Vision 2030. This growth will fuel our own expansion, as we focus upon new route destinations, fleet growth, and continue to bring our signature five-star service to all corners of the globe.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the responsibilities of Ashghal in advancing the country?<br></h4><p>Ashghal was established as an autonomous body in 2004. It is responsible for delivering and managing infrastructure and public buildings of national importance in order to transform the country, drive socio-economic growth, and enhance Qatar's position as a developing global destination. Aligned to the Qatar National Vision 2030, Ashghal's 2011-2018 corporate strategy sets a clear vision and mission, and it aims to develop a more dynamic, responsive, and customer-centric organization. That strategy saw the appointment of consultants who have assisted in starting three key Ashghal programs: the Expressway Program, which will deliver more than 30 expressway projects; the Local Roads and Drainage Program, which will deliver more than 200 roads and infrastructure projects across Qatar in the next five to seven years, and the Inner Doha Re-Sewerage Implementation Strategy (IDRIS), which will upgrade and expand the sewerage infrastructure to accommodate the projected population growth in the south catchment area of Doha. These programs are well underway and making steady progress. Over the last year, the authority has been working to convert roundabouts to signal controlled intersections. In addition, various existing roads are being upgraded across the country to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion.</p><h4>Outside of infrastructure, what are some of the significant projects that Ashghal is currently working on?</h4><p>Ashghal is not just involved in infrastructure projects of national importance. Its remit also includes a number of buildings projects that serve local communities. Ashghal has been working with the relevant Qatari authorities on significant building projects that include healthcare, educational, and general sector projects. Ashghal is currently constructing educational buildings distributed across the country's various villages and suburbs. At the start of this academic year, Ashghal completed 13 schools and eight kindergartens in Doha and the surrounding areas. The authority is actively contributing to the development of the healthcare sector with more than seven healthcare centers under construction, in addition to Hamad Bin Khalifa Medical City Hospitals Project, which is scheduled for completion in 2015. Back in 2013, we also announced some key projects for construction, including the final concept master plan for Qatar Zoo, which will position Qatar on the global stage.</p><h4>Ashghal partners with world leading international firms for its projects here in Qatar. What are the requirements for a foreign company hoping to form a partnership?</h4><p>“Qatar Deserves the Best" is the slogan that Ashghal has adopted as its mantra. The process of selecting contracting companies is done based on certain conditions and criteria that take into account important factors such as quality, safety, expertise, as well as capability and commitment to implementation within the set schedule. Ashghal operates an open and transparent compulsory competitive tendering process whereby tenders are advertised on its website and in relevant publications. With major projects, Ashghal also holds pre-tender briefings to ensure companies are aware of the tender requirements for each stage of the project. Based on the value and scale of the projects, our tendering process includes clear categories for eligibility of companies that can apply. Currently, there are four categories that include eligibility for Qatari companies only, for joint venture companies, non-Qatari companies, and international and local consultants. Ashghal's requirements for companies to be eligible to tender are determined by value and a quality-based assessment system. We do, and will continue to encourage, all international, regional, and local firms to take part in our project bidding process and share their knowledge, expertise, and technical know-how in implementing some of the biggest infrastructure projects in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What advances has the company made in recent years?<br></h4><p>When Mazaya Qatar Real Estate Development started in 2008 it was a challenging time, especially for the real estate sector. Mazaya Qatar Real Estate Development not only survived but it has since gone from strength to strength. In fact, only two years later Mazaya Qatar went public and oversubscribed despite the misgivings of some that thought it was not the right time. Ever since, we have seen plenty of growth in both manpower and projects. This success has allowed us to expand outside Qatar as we moved into the UAE and Lebanon. However, when talking about development we have concentrated mostly on Qatar. Two exceptional projects in Qatar on which we are currently working are Sidra Village and the Marina Mall. Sidra Village, which we develop in partnership with Qatar Foundation, will be one of the largest compounds in Qatar with 1,165 residential units and we hope to deliver it in 2015. The Marina Mall is currently in the early stages and will develop into one of the most sophisticated high-end malls in the region. The Marina Mall has a modern and outspoken design because we want to serve the community and develop projects that speak to them. It will be a place that people can enjoy also from the exterior.</p><h4>Looking at your portfolio of projects, what is it that Mazaya Qatar aims for in each and every one of them?</h4><p>As a listed company, Mazaya Qatar Real Estate Development has a responsibility toward our shareholders, country, and community. We want to make sure that we are a profitable company in every undertaking; that is the first thing. Secondly, we live in a country where the environment is very important and we adhere to the guidelines in order to limit our impact on it. Thirdly, it is also a country with leaders that support and emphasize human development, so we have adopted that in our daily operations.</p><h4>Mazaya Qatar is a sharia-compliant company. How do you apply this to the real estate sector?</h4><p>Sharia compliance is a way of life. It is not only to do with the financial sector. Here in Qatar, sharia compliant business is the standard and investors like to run sharia-compliant projects whether they are financial, real estate, or education. Sharia compliance has some conditions, whether it is through the banks, how you structure your projects, and what you deliver on these projects. These are all part of our vision and mission, and part of our identity as a sharia-compliant company. What it practically means is that, for a real estate company like ours, hotels cannot serve alcohol. This is just one example. You currently see a rise in demand for sharia-compliant services, even in regions outside the Arab world, such as Europe.</p><h4>Recent figures indicate that the Real Estate Price Index is reaching record highs. How do you assess this number and how do you see this sector developing in the short term?</h4><p>We hope that this index will keep rising. Although lower oil prices are spurring concerns about the status of the economy and things might slow down, but I think will not go down. In Qatar, we are gifted with very visionary leaders who have seen this and when you see how Qatar has developed in the past five years, you can understand how we will be less affected by this decline than others. I think that the local sector will still grow, albeit not as aggressively as anticipated.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[three-become-one]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Milaha is organized on the basis of five business pillars. How does this structure benefit the overall performance of the company?<br></h4><p>Today, we operate in five divisions, which we call our “five strategic pillars," with the first three pillars being our core businesses. The pillars are, firstly, maritime and logistics, which includes ports services, logistics, container feeder shipping, and the shipyard. The second is offshore, which entails the charter and operations of offshore support vessels as well as associated construction, maintenance, diving, and other services. The third pillar involves the transport of gas and petroleum products. In addition to these core activities, we also have a capital pillar that oversees our strategic and financial investments, and our trading pillar that deals with the distribution of heavy equipment, trucks, bunker, and other industrial products. This reorganization was aimed at streamlining operations and focusing on serving customers within each sector, with strong linkages across pillars allowing enhanced levels of service for common customers with requirements across multiple areas.</p><h4>Milaha is steadily growing its fleet of vessels across the different segments. Which aspects of the fleet are you currently expanding?</h4><p>The company's fleet is currently quite diversified and includes small tugboats to large LNG carriers, and everything in between. Our fleet of approximately 90 vessels includes container ships, LNG carriers, LPG carriers, crude carriers, bulk vessels, and harbor craft, in addition to over 35 offshore support vessels. We are in the midst of a significant new building program. In addition to the offshore support vessels delivered in 2014, we are expecting another 10 offshore vessels to be delivered between now and the end of 2015. Milaha also recently took delivery of the 19 harbor operations vessels for the 20-year Mesaieed Port contract. Beyond what is committed, we are continuing to look for opportunities to expand our fleet in the offshore segment as well as the gas and tanker segment. Several initiatives are underway in these areas.</p><h4>In recent years, the Milaha Capital pillar has become increasingly important to the overall performance of the company. What are the factors behind this development?</h4><p>Milaha Capital's performance is closely linked with that of Qatar's equities market, given that we have a large portfolio of equity investments. The market has grown significantly in recent years, driven by overall economic growth, the strong investment program leading up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, as well as the inclusion of Qatar on the MSCI Emerging Markets index. This has naturally led the Milaha Capital business to generate strong returns relative to the core maritime activities.</p><h4>How will the new Doha Port, that is projected to be open in 2016, impact the company and eventually the Qatari economy?</h4><p>Qatar has thoroughly re-evaluated its port infrastructure needs, with the result that a new port project is currently underway and due to open in 2016, when it will replace the existing Doha Port. Beyond 2015, and particularly after 2016, Qatar is expected to witness significant trade volume growth fueled by projects related to the FIFA World Cup 2022. The New Port Project will greatly increase capacity and cater for future consumption and infrastructure growth within Qatar. We are, of course, participating in the tender to operate the New Port, which would have a significant impact on our own business. Beyond the port, Milaha is well positioned to participate in and capture such trade growth, and will certainly look to grow to meet the increased requirements, through both our container shipping as well as logistics activities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We established the firm in 1998 from scratch, and today it is one of the top-five companies in the sector. What sets us apart are our capabilities, our reputation, the projects we have completed, and what we are currently doing. There are a lot of clients who want to work with Redco because we deliver high-quality jobs on time; this is our main philosophy. We have established sister companies to cover any gaps in the construction field, such as ready-mix, aluminum, glass, electromechanical fit out, and facility management. We have made Redco successful and our vision for the future is to make sure it remains one of the top companies in the market. We aim to be a local contractor with international standards, and we are achieving this today by winning major tenders alone. For example, we have been awarded the Doha Oasis project, which was the biggest private-sector project to be awarded in 2014. We recently completed the Handball Association Complex, which went on record as the fastest sporting facility project completed in Qatar—we designed and built the stadium in 14 months. Redco was also granted one of the most sophisticated projects on the market; the Qatar Foundation Research and Development Complex. This project was designed and built in around 14-16 months. On top of this, we have ongoing projects at The Pearl and two towers already under construction in Lusail. In 2012, we completed prestigious hospitality projects such as Intercontinental the City Doha, Crowne Plaza Doha, and Viva Bahriya 11 &amp; 17 at the Pearl-Qatar.</p><h4>What is your policy in order to minimize the impact of the environment during your projects?</h4><p>Construction jobs increasingly require a certain level of sustainability to be achieved. We have established a consultancy firm called BG2 for all sustainability and green requirements. It also supervises our projects to make sure that we can add value. It is a new trend in Qatar, but it will be a requirement for most of our projects, like it was for the stadium we recently built. The desire to build a sustainable project should come from the client's side because it saves them money in the long term.</p><h4>How is Redco Construction—Almana preparing for the imminent boom in construction in the run up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and what challenges do you foresee?</h4><p>We are flexible in our ability to grow. Redco Construction — Almana has around 6,500 workers today with the possibility of bringing in another 2,500 depending on the requirements of the market. We are targeting megaprojects and moving away from small projects. I think we can handle any challenges we face because today we have reached the point where we wanted to be. The 2022 FIFA World Cup is one of the major targets for us because it will complete our vision of where we are going.</p><h4>How do you see Redco Construction—Almana developing in the next five years?</h4><p>I believe the company will grow according to the market. We can expect to be very busy for the next four to five years. We are targeting prestigious jobs like stadiums, hotels, resorts, and so on. In the next five to six years, there will be a lot of new resorts in Qatar and the country will be attracting many more tourists. The country's infrastructure needs to be properly managed and, if that happens, Qatar will reach a new level.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<title><![CDATA[Utility Belt]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[utility-belt]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Marafeq is Qatar's main utility infrastructure provider. What are the main projects that you are working on?<br></h4><p>Currently, our biggest project in Qatar is Lusail. We have been working on this project since the beginning and we are now entering an advanced stage. Marafeq is focusing on three main utilities at the Lusail Project, namely district cooling, gas distribution, and waste management. The networks for the utilities are already constructed, so we are moving toward the construction of the plants. In 2014, we started the construction of two district cooling plants. Besides this project we are in the operation phase of a few localized DC plants at Lusail and two district cooling plants in Barwa City.</p><h4>Are you planning to enter into other projects besides these two greenfields?</h4><p>As a utility development company we prefer greenfield developments. This allows us to add value at different stages of the project. However, brownfield projects are a target for Marafeq if we feel we can add value and provide quality services for the developer. We are, at the moment, looking at different opportunities, but we are selective and will take our decision carefully by God's will.</p><h4>What is the significance for Marafeq of having accreditation from QSAS and the US Green Building Council?</h4><p>It is essential for a utility company like Marafeq not only to support but also to participate in international and local efforts to save the planet. The US Green Building Council has a lot of experience in the development of sustainability strategies and practices, which gives us this international angle, whereas QSAS integrates best practices from 140 global assessment systems to create a solid green building benchmark for Qatar. This represents the local angle for us. On that basis, we can really make a difference, especially in projects for which you can efficiently coordinate from the beginning to ensure the standards are implemented in all phases of the utility development process. On the other hand, for a utility provider like Marafeq Qatar, QSAS and/or LEED certification means we can count on a building demanding less energy from all aspects at the operation phase.</p><h4>What are the specific benefits of district cooling?</h4><p>First of all, district cooling is 40% to 60% more energy efficient than conventional systems and it has substantially lower operating costs and higher operating reliability and availability. Second, district cooling reduces construction and maintenance costs, because air-conditioning requirements are outsourced from the developers' angle. On top of that, district cooling has a high economical scale as a single unit replaces multiple individual ones. Another benefit here is that spaces used for the cooling systems can now be used for different purposes that render higher economical value.</p><h4>What do you have planned for the next five years?</h4><p>I believe Marafeq will be participating in awareness and in building a culture of responsible utility use. The optimum situation for utilities, considering the current growth plans for the country, will require Marafeq to contribute by ensuring efficiency. In terms of business, within five years we aim to be a strong utility technology provider, contributing to mega projects in Qatar, and to continue to promote knowledge transfer between relevant organizations. In addition, Marafeq Qatar will be more tightly linked with R&amp;D in the utility field to meet the requirements of hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-lte-lunch]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you describe Telefónica's growth trajectory over the past year?</h4><p>The year was successful; we increased our customer base to above 23 million. We also raised our revenues in addition to meeting all our goals in compliance with our commitments to our Madrid headquarters.</p><h4>Telefónica saw its customer base increase in the last quarter compared to other companies such as América Móvil. To what degree is the appointment of your new CEO Carlos Morales linked to an increase in customers?</h4><p>Carlos Morales has motivated and organized the team and contributed to improving the distribution network. His initiative and strategic measures have proven him to be an excellent CEO. His role was key in achieving the turnaround of our operations.</p><div class="quote">“Perhaps one of the most important reforms concerns allowing foreign firms full ownership of a fixed line operator."</div><h4>By 2015 Telefónica will have network coverage of 70% with over 23 million customers in the country, and the company has invested in a new LTE network. How will the new network improve your services?</h4><p>Perhaps one of the key elements of our marketing efforts this year is to take advantage of the implementation our LTE (4G) coverage. To begin with we are concentrating on the three largest cities in order to improve our customer base in the post-paid market. Then LTE will be deployed further. The speed of our LTE is comparably faster than that of other service providers. In a comparison published in the local press, our LTE speed turned out to be four or five times faster when compared to other popular providers. If the consumer's interest is in data, LTE is key and Telefónica is their best option.</p><h4>What steps should be taken to increase Telefónica's penetration rate?</h4><p>We have to increase the percentage of smart phones in our customer base; it is rising quickly, but we have to move faster. The opportunity comes from a high turnover in handsets, which is the result of short battery lives. Handsets are, on average, renewed every year and a half. The fact that more smartphones will be available at lower prices is an opportunity because more customers will be able to enjoy broadband services. Penetration rates are already increasing naturally and will continue to do so.</p><h4>What is your short-term outlook on the sector and on the impact of telecommunications reform?</h4><p>Perhaps one of the most important reforms concerns allowing foreign firms full ownership of a fixed line operator. There have been many key constitutional reforms involving our sector, but this one stands out because it will allow companies like AT&amp;T to invest in urban fiber to provide television and voice services. If other, more financially limited firms, like Usacel and Nextel, recently purchased by AT&amp;T, are able to associate themselves with large foreign firms, they will grow quickly. Another favorable outcome of this particular item of the reform is that in order to be the 100% shareholder of a fixed line service we no longer need rely on a partner. Of course, we are more comfortable with this type of situation. The other reforms concern, for instance, the provision of interconnection points by the incumbent. The Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT) has already issued a resolution requiring connection points to allow us fewer interconnection points and at a lower cost. There is also the requirement for the incumbent to share its infrastructure through a partial and so far ineffective provision called terms of reference, but we are still waiting for additional resolutions from the IFT to put ceilings on the prices it can charge for its services. For the first time we have a small degree of asymmetry involving differentials between what we obtain in interconnection rates and what we have to pay. This is important because firms that are not incumbent are those netting on traffic. Asymmetry is essential since we have an infrastructure almost identical to the incumbent's, but a small fraction of total traffic, about 13%, whereby our unit costs are considerably higher than the incumbent's. Although we get net settlements from the incumbent, we are far from seeing in reality what the reform stipulates in letter as interconnection rates have been set with no regard for differences in scale. The fact that we have different sizes means we incur different costs, which is the point of the reform: the IFT needs to establish differential rates. Because this has not happened we have had to go to the courts to demand that the IFT recognize the letter of the constitutional reform. We do expect positive verdicts from the courts. Some IFT resolutions have reflected the letter of the law, but some are questionable. For example, a resolution by the IFT related to portability has inhibited it substantially.</p><h4>Is the television market appealing for Telefónica?</h4><p>There was the possibility of a merger with the telecoms component of Televisa, but it was not possible to move forward. If Televisa had purchased Iusacell it would have been possible for us to consider a merger, but the latter entity was sold to AT&amp;T. Currently, a merger with a television company is not in the works, and we have no plans to to do something with DTH. We have to decide where we want to put our limited amount of capital, and so far we have privileged our core business.</p><h4>What are your expectations for this year?</h4><p>We plan on increasing our LTE network even further, and currently this is our main emphasis. We are changing the mix of prepaid and postpaid services, and want to move further into the data section of telecommunications. This is where the greatest growth potential lies and where Telefónica is exerting its greatest effort.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Bonds Of Friendship]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-bonds-of-friendship]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>A HISTORIC PARTNERSHIP<br></h4><p>When the Republic of Korea inaugurated its embassy in the State of Qatar in April 1974, Qatar was just embarking on its journey toward development. This year, 2014, marks 40 remarkable years of successful friendship and mutual collaboration. During the past 40 years, Korea and Qatar have forged a strong partnership and close bond, demonstrated by ever-expanding bilateral cooperation in various sectors, most evident in the fields of construction and energy.</p><p>Indeed, Qatar and Korea have become very important strategic allies over the years, especially in the field of energy. Korea took part in Qatar with RasGas and acquired a 5% share in the very first LNG train of RasGas. Korean companies have participated in numerous iconic projects, including the Sheraton Hotel in the 1970s. In return, Qatar has been supporting Korea's iconic projects, including the agreements to export up to 10 million tons of LNG annually. Recognizing the importance of bilateral economic relations, the Republic of Korea and the State of Qatar are making efforts to further strengthen the strategic partnership.</p><h4>A KEY PARTNER</h4><p>The Korea-Qatar partnership in the energy and construction sectors goes back many years and remains strong to this day. With bilateral trade volume reaching $26.7 billion, Qatar is the single-largest supplier of LNG and the fifth-largest supplier of oil to Korea as of 2013. Currently, Korean companies are conducting about 19 construction projects worth over $7.5 billion in Qatar, including large-scale projects, as of 2013.</p><p>While energy and the construction sector continue to be the pillars of our economic relations, both our countries are currently exploring additional areas of cooperation. Currently, bilateral cooperation has expanded to areas such as the environment (waste water treatment and green growth), the industrial sector (Joint LED Project and the SME sector), as well as potential joint investment projects in third countries. These are the areas where successful cooperation can be achieved with the combination of Korea's technological prowess and Qatar's strong financial backing.</p><h4>COMMITTED TO THE FUTURE</h4><p>I hope that both our countries continue to work hard to open up new opportunities for cooperation in the future. For this, we need to identify new areas of cooperation, in which both countries feel comfortable to partner with each other. Since Korea and Qatar still do not have a good example of a joint investment, launching a joint investment scheme in third countries will be a good starting point in that we could establish useful mechanisms during the process. Also, Korea has hosted many international events such as the Olympics, the Asian Games, and the FIFA World Cup. In addition to having the required infrastructure, the Korean government and Korean sporting institutions that provided assistance in these events have a significant amount of information and experience in organizing events successfully. This could prove to be useful for Qatar in hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p><p>Additionally, bilateral collaboration should be expanded to fields such as green growth, manufacturing, education, health, defense, and culture. Korea is committed to go ahead with its development in accordance with green growth principles to address the climate change challenge. Qatar has also expressed that it wants to focus its economic and infrastructure development on sustainable growth and green practices such as promoting renewable energy and efficient resource management. An efficient and systematic knowledge-sharing program would go a long way in helping the two countries meet such goals. I am positive that Korea will continue to be a major ally in Qatar a development in the future, not just in the fields of construction and energy, but also in other areas that hold a lot of potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the historical relationship between Sweden and Qatar, and what are its main pillars?<br></h4><p>Our relations are good and growing. We see in Qatar a long-term trading partner. Swedish exports to Qatar currently stand at $260 million. With the opening of our Embassy in Doha in May 2014 and the arrival of our Ambassador Ewa Polano, we can do more in Doha, support more exchange and business, and keep a better and closer contact with our Qatari counterparts. We are aware of Qatar's eagerness to seek the best and the newest solutions and technology in all of their ambitious projects. Sweden is, therefore, well suited to partner with Qatar. We can offer globally leading industrial products and services, and taking into account life-cycle costs, all at a competitive price.</p><h4>What were the reasons behind the decision to open an embassy in Doha?</h4><p>The opening of our embassy is indeed a milestone in our relations. Sweden has followed Qatar's fast paced economic and social development with great interest. It is indeed unprecedented in its scope and quick transition. Looking forward, we see even greater developments taking place regarding infrastructure developments and the World Cup preparations. Qatar has also rapidly become an influential foreign policy actor in the region and beyond. We also value our political dialogue with Qatar in these areas, striving for peaceful settlements in a traditionally very complex region. Sweden has a longstanding and firm engagement with the Middle East, based on the notion of the region's strategic importance as a close neighbor of the EU and of our shared history.</p><h4>During your official visit to open the embassy in Doha you were accompanied by a delegation of the Swedish business community. How would you assess the results of their meetings in Qatar?</h4><p>Qatar is today our eighth largest market in the MENA region, and with potential for further growth. We see a healthy development in our bilateral trade with Qatar this year, with an increase of 45% in the first six months. The decision by the Swedish government to open our embassy has led to an increased curiosity from the Swedish private sector, which is excellent. Iron and machinery are especially prominent in our exports, but ICT, healthcare, logistics, and clean-tech also play an important role. Many companies already have a strong presence in the Qatar market, while others are just discovering its potential.</p><h4>Which areas of bilateral trade between Sweden and Qatar do you identify as having the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Our trade with Qatar is dominated by traditional Swedish industries. This will continue, but we also hope to see more of our new creative and innovative companies finding their way here, matching the impressive overall ambitions of Qatar's development. Sweden offers comprehensive and sustainable highly competitive concepts in infrastructure, sea ports, electronic road pricing, buses and trains, our holistic SymbioCity concept, and healthcare, IT telecoms, energy, and clean-tech, with environmental solutions that are highly appreciated worldwide due to our traditionally high profile on sustainability. Our continued focus should be on enhancing partnerships in business and development to further encourage growth and competitiveness in the long term. We also welcome Qatari business, tourism, and investments in Sweden.</p><h4>Besides the field of trade, in which other areas do you hope to see an increase of cooperation between Sweden and Qatar?</h4><p>We wish to see more trade and deeper relations with Qatar in areas such as R&amp;D, energy, climate, transport, infrastructure, and health. Qatar offers opportunities in tourism and impressive insights into a world heritage and art scene through their contributions such as the Museum for Islamic Art, and endeavors in the academic field, building cultural institutions and attracting global think tanks. An academic exchange and increased networking between people on topics such as women and leadership has begun and can be further developed. It is my sincere hope that more Qataris will discover Sweden as an exciting tourist destination as well. I also hope Swedes will take opportunity to visit Qatar and discover the world-renowned treasures they have, such as the Museum of Islamic Art.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Looking back at 2014, what were the most important policies taken by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce?<br></h4><p>The primary objective of the Ministry of Economy and Commerce (MEC) is to strengthen the foundations of a competitive Qatari economy through the adoption and implementation of policies that promote economic diversification and consumer protection. In this respect, the MEC has enforced a new set of regulations in 2014 aimed at protecting competitiveness as well as combating commercial fraud and monopoly practices. For instance, the MEC has introduced amendments to law No. 5 and 20 in a bid to streamline procedures for local and foreign investors seeking to do business in Qatar and is currently in the process of drafting a new law concerning commercial and industrial licenses.</p><h4>What measures has the Ministry of Economy and Commerce taken to attract foreign investors to Qatar?</h4><p>The MEC is committed to easing restrictions on foreign ownership as part of its efforts to encourage FDI in Qatar. In line with its progressive liberalization strategy, the MEC is currently considering allowing unrestricted foreign equity participation in an additional number of sectors. As of today, the MEC allows foreign investors in the agriculture, industry, health, education, tourism, and energy sectors to exceed the 49% ownership cap provided that their projects contribute to development plans as outlined by the state of Qatar.</p><h4>Public private partnerships (PPPs) have been identified as a priority for the development of the Qatari economy. What is the role of the Ministry of Economy and Commerce in this area?</h4><p>The Ministry believes that PPPs provide a framework that allows the government to make use of the private sector's expertise while ensuring that social obligations are met and successful public sector reforms are implemented. To ensure that tasks, obligations, and risks are allocated in an optimal way among public and private partners, the Ministry is giving priority to PPPs in areas where such partnerships offer huge potential, namely ongoing and planned infrastructure developments.</p><h4>What are the objectives behind the efforts of the Ministry of Economy and Commerce to tighten economic relations within the GCC, and what areas do you identify as priorities for increased regional convergence?</h4><p>The MEC seeks to foster economic relations within the GCC as part of its efforts to establish the Gulf common market and promote regional integration. While Qatar's small domestic market may fail to offer the scale needed for production efficiency, economically integrated regions can help attract foreign investors who are more inclined to open a production or distribution facility in Qatar if it serves a bigger regional market.</p><h4>Hydrocarbon products dominate Qatari exports. What is the importance of diversifying the Qatari export basket?</h4><p>Economic diversification plays a prominent role in creating productive jobs and is necessary to boost living standards. However, to diversify its economy, Qatar must first address several interrelated challenges starting with the need to foster an entrepreneurial culture.</p><h4>What are the major challenges that will emerge as a result of the rapid growth of the Qatari economy and what can the MEC do to overcome them?</h4><p>Rapid economic growth poses major risks at the social, financial, cultural, and environmental levels. To overcome these challenges, the MEC seeks to align rapid growth with social development and environmental sustainability. In following a path of sustainable development, Qatar will strive to meet the needs of this generation without compromising those of future generations, ensuring what is often called intergenerational justice. By adopting a development pace that ensures sustainable improvements in livelihoods and quality of life, the government will avoid depleting national resources and protect against economic overheating or financial imbalances that can manifest themselves in rapidly rising prices.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of Qatar Foundation Investments, within the larger structure of Qatar Foundation (QF)?<br></h4><p>Qatar has long recognized the need to secure its future in a post-hydrocarbon world, and QF for Education, Science, and Community Development's vision and mission is to support the nation on this vital journey to becoming a knowledge-based economy. In this context, and initiated by the founders of QF, Qatar Foundation Investments supports QF by developing its endowment and implementing an investment strategy that will secure its long-term financial sustainability. Qatar Foundation Investments is inspired by local needs, with a core objective to work with national stakeholders. It has developed the platforms for investing within different industries and territories that provide the right levels of return and also risk. The success of our investment strategies help to enable long-term delivery of QF's continued efforts to unlock human potential and foster a culture of quality and excellence in support of the Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030.</p><h4>What is your strategy when choosing the companies in which QF invests?</h4><p>Our strategy draws upon different factors to inform our investment perspective and assessment of associated risks for every opportunity under consideration. To achieve diversification in the range of assets we hold, we consider investments in mature and emerging markets, as well as across the full range of private equity, hedge funds, direct investment, real estate, and commodities, and then make an assessment against our portfolio's other investments and its policies. We are committed to a long-term approach. Furthermore, our investments are not necessarily based on financial returns alone; we have to support QF's core values, and be aligned within the long-term strategy for the portfolio. Seeking out investments that support innovation is a key driver of the investment strategy, particularly with companies in fields that support QF's three pillars of education, science, and community development. One interesting example is our partnership with Vodafone, the country's second largest telecommunications provider, where part of our investment decision was informed by an assessment of the infrastructure that QF requires to support education and research.</p><h4>How does building the human capital of Qatar feature in this element of the larger QF organization?</h4><p>QF's mission includes the objective to nurture and develop the nation's leaders of tomorrow, meaning turning our attention to the development of Qatar's younger generations is imperative. The greatest asset of any country is its people, yet the potential of its population is never listed as an asset on its balance sheet. As education is one of QF's strategic pillars, we focus on developing the youth by equipping them with the proper tools and guides so that they know how to apply the skills and knowledge acquired in their academic training to build a career in the business world and beyond. That requires investing in our younger generation. We sponsor them through different programs, train them, build their competency, develop their leadership skill and style, and provide them with the invaluable experience of working with our institutes.</p><h4>Where is QF investment focusing at this stage? What can we expect from Qatar Foundation Investments in the short term?</h4><p>Qatar Foundation Investments' focus is on delivering the platforms for QF's success and building the endowment demands long-term commitment to the strategies and policies that underpin the investment portfolio. Of course, no one can predict precisely where the economy will be in five years, just as no one anticipated what happened in 2008, or the shocks that led to the crisis of the 1930s. Achieving a diverse portfolio is a key part of our strategy to reduce risk whilst maximizing opportunities across the investments' geographies and commodities. QF and Qatar are part of a global market, meaning that worldwide economic factors will naturally affect us. However, the benefit to Qatar Foundation Investments, taking a long-term and balanced view of its portfolio, is that when one industry or geographic region suffers within the cycle, QF is protected elsewhere.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-word-from-the-wise]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Al Faisal Holding is active in virtually every sector of the Qatari economy. How do you organize such a large enterprise?</h4><p>We started the business in the 1960s and we now have three major companies under Al Faisal Holding: Aamal Company QSC, Al Jazi Real Estate, and Al Rayyan Tourism Investment Company (ARTIC). Al Faisal is the major shareholder in Aamal, which has been a publicly listed company on the Qatar Exchange since 2007, whilst Al Jazi and ARTIC are fully owned by Al Faisal Holding. Aamal market capitalization is almost $2.5 billion as of October 2014, and it focuses mainly on industrial manufacturing projects. ARTIC has an estimated value of over $4 billion, and is the holding company for our activities in the hospitality sector in Qatar and internationally. For ARTIC, the focus now is to further develop its investment portfolio, through the acquisition and development of valuable, iconic assets with high architectural design quality in prime city and resort locations. Al Jazi Real Estate is one of the leading real estate companies in Qatar and owns several residential compounds, as well as residential and commercial towers.</p><h4>Property, which makes up a significant part of the business activities of Al Faisal Holding, is a volatile sector both in Qatar and abroad. What is your strategy to mitigate the risks?</h4><p>We are successful in seeking out unique investment opportunities and we are always looking for high-quality assets. Any sort of success is based on know-how and know-who, and if you have a combination of both your business can fly. We have established a strong reputation as an investor and partner for world-class hotel operators. Looking ahead, we are considering a possible flotation of ARTIC, which will benefit its profile as a publicly listed company with disciplined corporate governance and greater strategic flexibility to support its long-term development as a major global hospitality company. Al Faisal Holding started in Qatar with hospitality and related businesses, such as catering and food supplies. We began looking outside Qatar by expanding into North Africa, then Europe, and most recently the US. Our company is multinational not only in terms of investment, but also in terms of location.</p><h4>In 2014, the subsidiary ARTIC acquired the Miami Beach, St. Regis Bal Harbour Resort. How does this fit into your overall investment strategy?</h4><p>ARTIC'S growth strategy is based on three important principles; investing in exceptional quality properties, geographic expansion both regionally and internationally, and a long-term investment approach. The acquisition of St. Regis Hotel is a true reflection of our strategy. The US is an important market for ARTIC; in 2012 we acquired Radisson Aqua Blu Hotel, Chicago, and in 2014 we acquired the iconic St. Regis Bal Harbour Resort, Miami. We also recently acquired the Manhattan Times Square Hotel in New York City. We are also building two new hotels in Chicago with condominiums and apartments. In Europe, ARTIC expanded its footprint in 2014, acquiring our first five-star property in Italy, the Boscola Aleph Hotel in Rome, which has unique architectural qualities and a prime location.</p><h4>How are you grasping the opportunities provided by the economic drive of the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>Through ARTIC, we are developing a significant proportion of Qatar's hotels. And we are studying the market carefully to identify further opportunities to add to our portfolio. Al Faisal Holding is also active in the education sector, where we have signed an agreement with DePaul University in Chicago to create an MBA program in entrepreneurship for both Qataris and Americans. We also have one of the best international British schools, the Gulf English School, as well as Stenden University in Qatar, which is specialized in hospitality management and has its main campus in the Netherlands. We are working hard to improve the quality of education, which for us is not a profit center, but rather an opportunity to contribute to supporting the local community and the development of a knowledge-based economy in line with the National Vision.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Jaidah Group is a family company with deep roots in Qatari society. What are the core principles that have made the company such an ongoing success?<br></h4><p>Jaidah Group has been in business for over 100 years and it is a traditional family business in the GCC sense of family businesses, whereby we are active in a lot of fields, from automotive to heavy equipment, and from safety and tools to lubricants and electrical goods. The business has evolved through the years based on the core principles of family, as we are a family in a small community where it's not only the company's reputation, but also the family's reputation. We seek to be fully honest and transparent in order to maintain both the company and the family image. Currently, we are very much in a period of natural evolution. Qatar has been a major center of international attention since winning the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, with a lot of international businesses wanting to set up shop here. Everyone wants a piece of the pie. Therefore, in Qatar you no longer compete locally, but on an international basis. This means that we have to focus on service excellence and customer satisfaction. At the end of the day, Jaidah is mainly a B2B business, apart from the retail automotive side, so it's all about how we can increase our customers' productivity to help them perform better. Our major aim today is to become the main go-to company that provides products and services to our clients that enable them to be more productive.</p><h4>The company operates under three separate divisions. How did this structure come about?</h4><p>It is a case of how the business evolved, and you'll find a similar mix of sectors in other GCC family businesses. In our case it's automotive, industrial supplies, and electrical goods. At the heart of the Group is automotive and heavy equipment, which falls into industrial supplies. That is from where we set out from back in the day and we have gradually expanded, although not into any radically different fields. Safety equipment, tools, and lubricants are natural accompaniments to what we do, and outside of automotive we mainly focus on the construction business.</p><h4>What is the importance for Jaidah of having such a diversified portfolio?</h4><p>I think it's important to stress that we are only in businesses where we're able to be market leaders and provide customers with services or products that answer their needs. That said, being diversified brings two benefits to the Group that make us durable and sustainable. Traditionally, it was important to have a diversified portfolio due to the size of the market. Qatar had a small population with a small market, no matter what field you were in. In that respect, it was important for companies to have a diversification strategy. Today, diversification is important because of the business cycles that we see in the economy and the country. As you know, we just came out of a tough three-year period in which the economy did not perform well outside of oil and gas. But now a new cycle is starting with the construction boom that Qatar is witnessing, and our heavy equipment division has been very active in the past few months as a result. Now we are also starting to see some renewed activity in the automotive sector. New projects have been awarded, which need equipment and employees. New employees are coming in, both white collar and blue collar, and they will need cars, then in a few years time they will need electrical components. So when you are diversified, if one sector is slow, you can be doing well in a different sector, and this keeps the cash flow going and the business running. It also minimizes risk in the long term, allowing us to hedge our risks by not being active in just one field.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Al Rabban Holding's core business and in what areas do you hope to grow in the future?<br></h4><p>We have three main activities, the first being fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), which is Rayyan and its subsidiaries. The other parts are real estate and construction. We are already in the ready-mix concrete business in construction, and now the family wants to concentrate more on real estate, which is where we see the most opportunity. Even though construction is booming here, the local contractors are not getting much of that business. There are also a lot of companies in Qatar now, and I can't see Qatar being able to absorb this number of foreign companies. The market is quite saturated. Another exciting area is food and beverage. Rayyan's subsidiaries are investing in new products that have not been produced in Qatar before. The big news is that we want to take this company to IPO, to turn it from a family business into a public company. We have had excellent feedback on this plan, although it will take time. It will be an addition to the Qatar Exchange (QE), because the exchange is saturated with real estate companies, banks, and insurance companies. I think ours will be the first FMCG company to be listed, and that is exciting, it is a bit of a change. Perhaps we can be an example for others to go into the market.</p><h4>What do you want to achieve through the IPO?</h4><p>It is risky after a certain point for any business to be owned by a single person or family; it is important that there is a diversity of investors and shares. Furthermore, by being listed and going public, you have to make certain changes and reforms to your company structure in terms of corporate governance. This is important to keep the business moving forward. The IPO will change the way that Rayyan is run, from being a family business to being an institutional entity.</p><h4>What is the strategy behind your real estate division?</h4><p>Real estate is an extremely strong sector in Qatar, although prices are rising to the point where it is becoming difficult to invest in it. Nevertheless, we have always had our eye on this sector, and it is the backbone for many businesses. As we say in Arabic, real estate gets sick, but it never dies. So this sector is always valuable, and we want to make it our company's backbone as well. It also ties in with the new investments we have coming up in hospitality with Qatar 2022, as Qatar is trying to attract more tourists, especially from neighboring countries.</p><h4>Tell us about Al Rabban Services, a company that helps international companies come to Qatar.</h4><p>A lot of companies would like to relocate to Qatar. In conducting our business we have had a lot of inquiries and requests, so we decided to create a division to deal with that demand. It is important to know how to enter Qatar, how to set up here, and how to deal with the regulations. We want to share our expertise and resources. But we are very picky; we receive many requests, but we sign very few deals.</p><h4>What challenges do you see arising as a result of Qatar's rapid development?</h4><p>I think infrastructure is a major challenge. Qatar has always hosted large, high profile international events, so it has that experience, but the infrastructure is crucial. You need roads, airports, and other transport routes. The country has grown in a huge way and the number of companies here has grown spectacularly; however, the infrastructure has to keep up. Qatar needs to deliver at the same pace as the speed at which it is growing. The airport took a long time to be delivered, for example, but I hope the port won't take as long.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Manateq is projected to complete its three economic zones starting from 2017. What specific benefits will there be for companies operating from these economic zones, and will these benefits also apply to foreign companies?<br></h4><p>The implementation of our project's master plan is very much on-track and the economic zone concept is a tried and tested one that facilitates overall economic activity and growth. Among the benefits offered by Manateq's economic zones is our promise to provide a region-leading ease of doing business process. This entails services, such as facilitating employment visas for expatriate workers, a competitively priced power, water, and gas supply, and a distinctly world-class zone infrastructure and services. Additionally, Manateq will provide a single window for all administrative queries, as well as all the necessary support facilities and services that help promote profitability and growth for its investors. The proximity of Manateq's economic zones to world-class port and airport facilities will enable a seamless flow of goods to and from other parts of the region and beyond. This is further complemented by a no duty policy in the GCC, low import duties, and an exemption for machinery and raw material importation. Manateq was created mainly to spur on the development and growth of SMEs and the private sector in Qatar, as well as to formulate lucrative business propositions for foreign investors to expand their regional and international businesses.</p><h4><br>Manateq has taken the economic zone model a step further by making them into specialized zones. What does this entail and how will it affect the activities of investors that will operate from the zones?</h4><p>We have specifically designed these zones as specialized economic zones. With their varying sizes and locations, we have designated them into clusters whereby each zone's infrastructure and services cater to specific industries and business sectors. For instance, Ras Bufontas is a 4.01 square kilometer advanced technology and logistics cluster that adjoins the new Doha International Airport. As such, it targets business sectors such as logistics, information and communications, healthcare, energy and environment, high-tech building, and global warehousing companies. On the other hand, Um Alhoul is a 33.52 square kilometer light-manufacturing zone that adjoins the new port project. To take full advantage of its key features, this area will cater to businesses involved in petrochemicals, building materials, maritime, metals, logistics, and food processing. Lastly, there is a specialized industry and logistics zone, which is a 38.43 square kilometer zone, just south of the current Doha Industrial Area. This zone is focused on businesses involved in building materials, machinery and fabrications, and specialized spillover industries.</p><h4><br>The growth of SMEs has been identified as a driving force behind economic diversification. What factors are currently hindering SMEs in their development, and how can Manateq help to overcome them?</h4><p>Economic zones have had both a policy and an infrastructure rationale in the development and growth of SMEs and the private sector. The creation of economic zones has sound justification as they can certainly encourage entrepreneurial creativity and innovation. As in any other country, provision of the necessary infrastructure, policies, financing, and opportunities are keys to spurring on the development and growth of SMEs. Manateq's role is in addressing the infrastructure, policies, and opportunity requirements. Given Qatar's seemingly underdeveloped SME and private sector, which constitutes a mere 15% of the country's economy, Manateq was created to spur the development of SMEs and the private sector in Qatar. Therefore, as we aim to encourage entrepreneurship among Qatari nationals and local residents, we strive to provide the most attractive and convenient opportunities for Qatar based entrepreneurs so that they no longer need to look anywhere else but home. We believe that operating one's own business, and dealing with your own country's investment policies, as well as local government and financial authorities, are always better alternatives than being a foreign investor in another country.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar currently finds itself in the middle of an Arab world in flux. What are the pillars of the country's foreign policy that aim to restore order in the region?<br></h4><p>Qatar is a stable, progressive country in a complex and often misunderstood region. Because of this stability, we have been able to develop effective relationships in the Middle East that allow us to facilitate conflict resolution and open doors for our allies that would otherwise be closed. Qatar's foreign policy is conducted in accordance with an integral strategic plan developed by the leadership of the country, known as the Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030, and this outlines the framework through which Qatar will further solidify its diplomatic position regionally and internationally. At the center of Qatar's foreign policy is the belief that international peace and security can be achieved only through dialogue based on principles of equality, compliance with international law, respect for human rights, and protecting human dignity—especially during times of crisis. It is with these guiding principles that we approach the stability of our region; by achieving peace and security for the Middle East, we will help pave the way to achieving a more stable world. Qatar has become a powerful and effective mediator among our allies and in the Middle East. This is a role that we believe represents an open door to peace, because of our country's stability, and our commitment to foster a dialogue among all parties in order to find peaceful solutions and avoid conflict.</p><h4>What is the role of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in paving the way for Qatar as a country investing in opportunities abroad?</h4><p>Qatar's global fund represents a long-term investment strategy and we have substantial interests in emerging markets as well as in Europe. In addition, foreign aid is a central component of Qatar's foreign policy strategy. The State of Qatar believes that economic development and social inclusion is the safest and most reliable path to peace and stability. Qatar's foreign aid contribution is now nearing the $1 billion mark annually, spread across 100-plus countries. On a relative basis, it is worth mentioning that Qatar actually spends more on international assistance. The State of Qatar is a generous development partner, but we have also proved to be a dependable ally to developed nations in times of crisis. What comes to mind here is the case of post-tsunami Japan, a country whose trust and friendship we really value. Year in and year out, Qatar provides critical support and development in post-conflict countries, helping them build the institutions most needed for a peaceful and prosperous future. Doing so falls both under the strategic interest and our moral obligation to build a better, safer world for all our children.</p><h4>Qatar has rapidly grown to a position of international importance. What is the long-term vision for the country when considering its position in the region and the world?</h4><p>In the words of the Emir, HH Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani; “We do not live on the sideline of life, and we do not drift without a destination; we are a people with a vision." The long-term vision for further enhancing our position in the region and in the world is focused on engagement for the purpose of promoting peace and prosperity in the Middle East and the global community. Qatar will stand firm and fulfill its shared responsibility to regional peace and stability where needed. Qatar has always been, and will continue to be, an engaged participant in the formal multilateral and regional forums, whether it is the United Nations, the Arab League, or the Gulf Cooperation Council. We recognize the need for, and the value of, these cooperative and rules-based institutions. Qatar will always aim to be a constructive party in these organizations and support the crucial initiatives they promote.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Our national economy remains, as it has always been, our primary preoccupation, and diversifying income sources has become a necessity that we seek to achieve by various means, namely through allowing the private sector to actively participate in various aspects of economic activity and the overall development of the State and to promote investments for future generations. Our economy has achieved good growth rates in terms of GDP, as it recorded a growth rate of 6.3% in 2014. Realizing this rate is considered a great achievement if we take into account that the contribution of the hydrocarbon sector in GDP did not post any significant increase in the same year, meaning that growth came from expansion in the non-oil sectors, such as the financial and construction sectors, which have been stimulated by the huge external and internal investments, whereby the growth rate reached about 11%, in addition to the development in this year's trade balance compared to previous years, which led to a surplus in the trade balance of 52% as a percentage of GDP.</p><p>While that growth was accompanied by a rise in the inflation rate to 3.1% in 2013, we continue our efforts to curb inflation through coordinating fiscal and monetary policies, encouraging competition, and setting a timetable for implementing major projects to reduce pressure on capacities. Encouraging competition to reduce prices will not be enough, but it is necessary to ease red tape procedures that increase investment risk, raise storage capabilities, and improve conditions to try to reduce real estate prices, while planning carefully for managing and implementing projects so as to avoid the constant change of specifications during the course of work that may increase costs. It is also necessary to control the prices of consumer goods.</p><p>With our constant emphasis on the private sector as the main partner in development, the government has approved an ambitious program to stimulate the private sector and support infrastructure for trade. The government is also in the process of completing the preparation of new legislation and measures that will contribute to developing the business environment and leaving the widest possible space for the private sector to contribute to sustainable development in the business sector. Within the context of our efforts to encourage foreign investment, non-Qataris have been allowed to increase the percentage of equity stake they own in companies listed on the Qatar Exchange, and GCC citizens have now the same treatment accorded to Qataris in this respect.</p><p>The government has taken other serious steps to promote the participation of the private sector, by encouraging government institutions to assign services and support operations to private companies, and a circular has been issued requiring the State-funded institutions not to establish companies or engage in economic activities without permission from the Office of the Prime Minister, as the State should not compete with the private sector. Within the same context, Mesaieed Petrochemical Company was listed on the stock exchange under the State's plan to offer part of the shares of leading government companies for the public, in order to increase citizen participation in economic activity and strengthen financial markets in the State.</p><p>In preparation for the annual budget for the year 2014-15, raising the efficiency of government spending was taken into account, allocating a large part of the increase in expenditure for implementing major projects in the health, education, infrastructure, and transportation sectors, since the total expenditure on these projects will be over 50% of the total expenditure in the budget for this year. Total budget expenditure estimates have reached $60 billion with an increase of 3.7% over the previous budget. I would like to emphasize that our economy is strong and solid and will not be affected by developments such as declining oil and fuel prices, as our budget is based on very conservative estimates.</p><p>Perhaps the best testament to the success of our economic policies and the strength and status of the Qatari economy is the international indices, which are prepared in accordance with the principles of objectivity and with actual figures, showing that Qatar has maintained an advanced credit rating, among the highest in the world, and is ranked high on global competitiveness indices.</p><p>Regarding our foreign relations, the GCC remains our main regional home. Supporting it and strengthening our relations with all our sisterly countries, and deepening the bonds of fraternity among us, come at the forefront of our foreign policy priorities.</p><p>Our region is passing through a dangerous stage where there are concurring crises in many countries in the region, foremost among which are the failure of the peace negotiations to solve the Palestine issue, the continuation of occupation and settlement policy in Jerusalem and the West Bank, and the siege on Gaza. The other major crises have resulted from driving the peaceful movements of the peoples in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Libya into bloody confrontations whose responsibility is borne by the forces that rejected the path of reform and gradual peaceful transition and confronted the peoples with arms, apart from the growing perils of terrorism and extremism that threaten dire consequences.</p><p>I said before that terrorism and extremism could not be addressed by air strikes. This is true from a military point of view, but also from both a political and social perspective, we must get rid of the reasons that have contributed to the formation of social environments that incubate extremism, namely the unprecedented violence perpetrated by the Syrian regime, and practiced by some militias in Iraq. Any policy to combat terrorism in Syria and Iraq that does not take this into account is a crisis management policy without a strategy. I would add here that our position toward terrorism and religious radicalism offending the religious sentiment and the community is a clear and categorical rejection, regardless of the analysis of the causes of its inception and handling. Our stand regarding combating terrorism and taking the life of another without right, and rejecting extremism, first and foremost, emanates from the social and cultural threat that it poses to our society, our religion, and our nation. We do not want us or our children to live under such ideas and practices.</p><p>The government is currently leading efforts to implement the national development strategy 2011-16. This strategy has been subjected to an objective appraisal three years after being launched to monitor progress made in its implementation, and the amendments to its targets in light of changes in various economic, social, and demographic factors. This appraisal has shown that a number of parties that are taking part in the development march have drawn up their operational plans. It has also shown that the institutional cooperation and coordination between these parties have achieved positive beginnings. Yet, some parties have not done that yet.</p><p>I have issued my directives to the Prime Minister to prepare plans with a practical timetable to solve issues related to warehouses, logistical areas, economic zones, industrialization plans, licensing the required factories for the State, resolving workers' housing issues, developing a plan to meet the need for land plots in the State, and a plan for promoting economic and trade sectors, activating the financial and stock markets, launching the first agricultural and food group, and developing a strategy for tourism with an illustration of tourist projects that will be completed during the next two years.</p><p>Sourced from the speech of His Highness Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar at the opening of the 43rd Advisory Council Session, November 11th, 2014.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the historical relationship between Brazil and Qatar, and what are its main pillars?<br></h4><p>The presence of the Portuguese, who colonized what would become Brazil, in the Arabian Peninsula and in the Gulf shores dates back to the late 16th Century, but formal diplomatic relations between Brazil and Qatar had to wait for the latter's independence to be established, in the early 1970s. One of the chief purposes of my recent visit to Doha was to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the mutual official relations.</p><p>After the bilateral exchange of state visits in 2010 (His Highness Emir Hamad Al Thani's travel to Brasilia in January and President Lula's visit to Doha in May), the potential synergies between the two countries loomed and were further enhanced. The main pillars of the relationship are: investments; cooperation in energy; cooperation in education, sports and culture; and political dialogue between decision-makers in both countries.</p><p>Qatar and Brazil have also been very active in promoting the Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), by holding the first two Summits in Brasí­lia (2006) and Doha (2009). This is an initiative that brings together two regions that share many cultural features and interest for social and economic development, for the preservation of the environment, and for an inter cultural dialogue.</p><h4>Which areas of bilateral trade between Brazil and Qatar do you identify having the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Both economies have considerable complementarity. Brazil is a major international supplier, not only of industrial goods, but also of foodstuff, including poultry and bovine meat, as well as other agricultural commodities of great demand in Qatar.  Brazilian construction companies provide high quality standards in complex architectural projects that fully comply with Qatari consumer standards and needs, an asset that can be valuable, for instance, in projects related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup extensive infrastructure program.</p><p>On the other hand, Brazil is a net importer of air services provided by Qatar Airways, a demand that the Qatari carrier can hugely benefit if it adequately takes the business opportunities made available by the coming 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. More importantly, Brazil has been, in the last five years, a significant consumer of Qatari natural gas, and both sides are in permanent discussion on how to improve this commercial relationship.</p><h4>Besides the field of trade, in which other areas do you hope to see an increase of cooperation between Brazil and Qatar?</h4><p>Brazil and Qatar share the very same vision about the pivotal role that the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) in Education, Health and Social Development must play in our national strategies and priorities, as well as in our diplomatic efforts in international fora, including the so called “unfinished agenda" of the MDG. My meetings with His Highness Emir Tamim Bin Hamad al Thani and Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser in Doha, last November, have inspired me to include Qatari Colleges in the “Science without Borders" program, through which my Government provides scholarships to Brazilian students so they can receive their college and university degrees in prestigious international institutions.</p><p>Furthermore, Brazil and Qatar can develop a fruitful partnership by offering joint technical cooperation to third countries, especially in the agricultural, health, industrial, education and sports fields. In other words, this describes what the Emir and I agreed to call “Strategic Partnership".</p><h4>Qatar continues to be a strong exporter of capital and has recently enhanced its relationships with Latin American countries. What opportunities does Brazil offer to Qatari investors?</h4><p>Brazil is, and will continue to be for decades to come, a major absorber of FDI in infrastructure. We offer political stability, investment-friendly business environment, excellent rates of return on investment, and a huge and powerful consumer market. After the excellent levels of mutual dialogue and confidence the Brazilian and the Qatari public and entrepreneurial leaderships have achieved over the last years, I have no doubt that we are about to witness the emergence of a dense and result-oriented  partnership in investment between the two countries. A good example of this business sentiment was the recent investment undertaken by a Qatari company in purchasing a billion dollar valued stake  in the offshore oil and gas field  of Parque das Conchas, in Brazil.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you manage your portfolio to ensure a stable stream of revenue?<br></h4><p>Salam International has diversified its business interests. We have divided our business into five sectors; real estate, technology, retail, construction, and oil and gas. Under each of those sectors sits a number of companies that are managed by a managing director specialized in his line of business. They manage the business, project flows, and they have budgets, which are reported to the head office. Being diversified means less volatility and more stability. Our company has five legs, and it can move around. This is like the 1940s and 1950s used to be in Europe. Most of the new companies are specialized. Because we are in a developing economy, it is working so far.</p><h4>What is your advice to companies that want to take family businesses public?</h4><p>We were the first company in Qatar to go public, though we have been through really tough times. The market in Qatar, when we started 10 years ago, was still undergoing a learning curve. The rules and regulations were not clear. We started the fund in 1996. Then, in 2002 and 2005 we went through our first, second, and third mergers. We took it in steps. Right now, it is settling down and I think our experience was not great, but it was an important step, not only for us, but also for Qatar. Today, it is showing results. The market is maturing gradually, but it has a long way to go.</p><h4>Would you advise other companies to follow your lead?</h4><p>Yes, if they are willing to take on the challenges of becoming a public shareholding company and go through the learning curve. Switching the mindset from a private to a public company is not simple. My mindset now is that I own shares, not the company. This is the mindset that the families have to realize and accept. Everybody should worry about their shareholding, but the performance of the company is the responsibility of the management.</p><h4>Could you talk about your international operations?</h4><p>We are a regional company, though not exactly international. We operate in the GCC and Levant area, from Lebanon to Jordan and across the countries of the GCC. That is our footprint right now, operationally. We have investments in Saudi Arabia and different places, and we have operations in five markets: Oman, UAE, Qatar, Lebanon, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. We manage the company in those markets. In the future, we are looking to expand. It is a generic style of growth, because we completed all our investments in the last five years. We upgraded our systems, and now we are in Phase II of upgrading the management and financial systems.</p><h4>There are many international expectations of Qatar. What are the main challenges you can identify in this process of economic growth?</h4><p>The problem is that it is over publicized in the media. Qatar is a small economy and there has been an oversell. While many countries suffered during the recession, Qatar was sticking its neck out and talking about megaprojects. Actually, in reality, they are humble projects. It is a boom for the people of Qatar, but not for the world. Many companies entered the Qatari market and were disappointed. They came to do a project, but then there was no continuity of work afterwards. While the country has a strong economy in the oil and gas industry that is about it. In five to seven years, many major infrastructure projects will finish, and the country will then experience more normalized growth. It is a window of opportunity now when the boom will continue. We don't see Qatar becoming a destination like Dubai; it is a small country, and I think it will stay small. There will be some development in the oil and gas fields, and a little bit in the SME sector, but that is it. Our tourism is limited to a special niche in the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the specific strengths of NBK Holding that have helped it to emerge as one of the leading companies in Qatar?<br></h4><p>NBK Holding owes its success to a long-term strategy of building a balanced portfolio of outstanding brands and businesses. Whether it is our range of international brands or our homegrown subsidiaries, it is our corporate vision and core values that have kept us on track. Our corporate leadership has also ensured that we have had the first-mover advantage in many of the industries we forayed into over the years. More than anything else, I believe NBK owes its success to an unwavering commitment to outstanding customer service and product quality. Any company that wishes to makes its mark in Qatar, or for that matter in any other market, must deliver on these key points. NBK Holding has been a prominent player in the Qatari market for more than six decades. A lot has changed in that time span. Today's business environment places very different demands upon any company that wishes to enter and succeed in the market.</p><h4>How do you assess Qatar's recent economic performance when compared to the international business environment?</h4><p>There is no doubt that Qatar's amazing economic track record in recent years has been a key driver of local business. Qatar has made giant strides to achieve a prominent status in the economic landscape of the region and, in fact, the world. Even when the world saw a huge collective slump beginning in 2008-2009, Qatar weathered the economic storm better than most countries, thanks to its vast hydrocarbon resources and prompt action by the government to ensure economic stability. In such a strong economic environment, confidence runs high and there is a general sense of optimism. NBK Holding as well as all other businesses in Qatar have been the beneficiaries of these excellent economic conditions in the past years. Most of our subsidiaries have seen strong growth during the past 12 months.</p><h4>What is the importance of having a diversified portfolio to the overall success of the holding?</h4><p>In a market that is growing as quickly as Qatar, new opportunities are constantly coming up in every industry. At NBK, we have made it our long-term mission to identify these opportunities and capitalize on them. In addition to maximizing our profitability, this strategy also gives us a diversified portfolio that is better able to withstand market fluctuations in different industries. Strong growth in one area of the economy inevitably drives growth in other industries. Our presence in a variety of markets allows us to keep a close eye on the pulse of the economy and to make better business decisions as an organization.</p><h4>How do you select partners when entering into joint ventures with international companies?</h4><p>The selection of our business partners is one of the cornerstones of NBK's long history of success. It involves a careful mutual vetting process to ensure that our organizations are compatible in several important regards. Once the expectations of each partner are spelled out and agreed upon, our analysts run the numbers to ensure the financial viability of the collaboration for both parties. If all goes to plan, it is usually the beginning of a long and mutually fruitful partnership.</p><h4>International investors and companies are flocking to Qatar of late. What would be your advice to these entrepreneurs targeting the Qatari market?</h4><p>For international companies that get their strategy right, there are indeed huge opportunities in the Qatari market. I think the single most important factor in this market is choosing the right business partner. An experienced Qatari partner can open doors for a new company, help them navigate the bureaucratic landscape and provide unique local insights for impactful brand positioning and marketing. Choosing the right business partner who stands alongside you and actively works with you to grow the business is not necessarily an easy task, but it is an essential one for long-term success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[bank-guarantees]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The banking sector in Qatar is developing into a competitive market. How does Ahli Bank QSC try to distinguish itself from the competitors?<br></h4><p>We are a medium-sized bank. It may seem that our capital is a disadvantage, but we actually tend to think the opposite because our size enables us to be flexible to meet the needs of our customers. However, that is not our only distinguishing feature. When a customer comes to one of the branches or corporate offices of Ahli Bank QSC, we promise to deliver a superior customer experience. Our team is extremely trained, and we are proud of the people that represent Ahli Bank QSC.</p><h4>What are the recent initiatives that the bank has taken to improve its services?</h4><p>In fact, when the ownership of the bank changed in 2013, we took the strategic decision to change our decision-making process within the bank and flatten the hierarchy. This should ultimately be reflected in meeting the demands and expectations of our clients. We also decided that we are not going to be a bank for everybody, but we will target specific segments. When this was decided, we also reset the delivery process. We are investing smartly in technology, such as mobile banking, in order to cater for the segment of the market in which we want to servce.</p><h4>What are the segments of the market that you are targeting?</h4><p>One of our priorities is to increase our market share in retail banking. The investment plan for 2014 foresees reinforcing our brand identity and advancing our human capital and management skills. We work on a wider basis in retail than some other banks, and we have set an objective to increase that. Moreover, the business community remains our targeted and important segment to grow with.</p><h4>In 2013, the Qatar Foundation got involved in Ahli Bank QSC by buying a 29% stake. Does that have any impact on the company?</h4><p>Definitely. The Qatar Foundation has certainly raised the profile of the bank in the local market. Currently, we are working with the Qatar Foundation on certain projects, which will eventually increase our revenues. The Qatar Foundation is always seeking safe and profitable investments. I am sure it has chosen Ahli Bank QSC to support its investment objectives; therefore, it gives us comfort to know that we are considered a solid business partner.</p><h4>How does the bank stand in view of the coming Basel III requirements?</h4><p>The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) enforces the implementation of the Basel III rules. Most, if not all, Qatari banks comply with those rules. Ahli Bank QSC complies with most if not all the requirements of the QCB in terms of capital and liquidity. One of the liquidity ratios to comply with has to do with liability maturity ladder, and we are working on that issue. I support the regulations of the QCB in terms of Basel III requirements, and they do not hinder us from growing our business. We have ample capital, so the Basel III requirements will not obstruct us from expanding.</p><h4>In 2013, the bank underwent a restructuring of its operations. Could you inform us about the changes that have taken place?</h4><p>Actually, there are three important aspects that we have worked on. The first was business banking. We have made the structure more intense. Secondly, we addressed the control issues, and started carrying out gap analysis procedures to understand where the risks are, allowing us to address them directly. And, thirdly, we examined our human capital. There are still some gaps left to fill, but we have already achieved a lot.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2014, QNB celebrated its 50th anniversary. Over that time QNB has become the largest bank in the MENA region and was recently ranked as the world's strongest bank. What are the main pillars that are driving this success?<br></h4><p>The QNB journey since being established as the first Qatari-owned Bank in 1964 has been rapid and impressive. The solid and prudent business philosophy of our founding fathers has been passed down through the decades to successive senior management teams and this has manifested itself in the QNB Group that exists today. QNB's expansion in recent years has mirrored the impressive performance of the Qatar economy and its position as the world's fastest-growing economy. Our continuing business strategy is based around the strength of the QNB brand franchise, the quality of the senior management team, robust cost controls, market leading capital ratios, and the Group's strong relationships with the public and private sectors. This has helped QNB expand its operations to more than 26 countries across three continents. Now 50 years on, our appetite to grow further remains undiminished.</p><h4>QNB has a deep-rooted history in Qatar and embraces a strategy to support local SMEs in order to push the country forward. What is the role of SMEs in the Qatari economy and how are you tailoring your services to their needs?</h4><p>SMEs are pivotal to the future success of Qatar as drivers of the economy. As a result, QNB has numerous funded and unfunded products that are tailored to meet the needs of SMEs irrespective of the sector they represent. We also have bundled products together to provide a one-stop shop approach, and this has allowed SMEs to manage their cash, take out loans, and cover their risks through appropriate insurance products at QNB. Our support to SMEs is both comprehensive and committed and as Qatar's biggest bank, we believe that our solutions on a range of products, such as current accounts, term loans, equipment finance, specialised overdraft facilities, and treasury services are the best in the market. We will continue to support current and future business owners who are seeking access to finance in order to expand or start a business in Qatar or internationally.</p><h4>E-Banking solutions are changing the way banks and customers communicate. What is QNB's innovation strategy in this regard?</h4><p>As the dominant bank in Qatar with an approximate 45% market share of assets, it is imperative that we continue to develop our product offering, enhance our customer service, and provide the best service network available to customers both in Qatar and across our international network. For these reasons, QNB has been extensively investing in our internet, mobile banking, and cash management systems to support product development and continued growth opportunities in the domestic market. We will continue to invest appropriately, and seek the best and most efficient solutions for our customers and clients to retain our position.</p><h4>QNB has followed a strategy of international expansion and the bank recently increased its global reach to 26 countries through acquisitions in Egypt and India. What considerations do you take into account when deciding on expanding internationally?</h4><p>QNB now operates in more than 26 countries and across three continents. Our vision is to become a Middle East and Africa region icon by 2017, and in line with this objective we acquired a 19.4% stake in Ecobank Transnational Incorporated in 2014. As a leading pan-African bank with a presence in 36 countries across the African continent, this strategic partnership is a significant milestone in QNB's expansion plans. At the same time, we are continuing to reinforce our presence in Asia's markets by upgrading our China and India operations, and by exploring potential representative office locations in other key locations. Our prudent and well-executed strategic expansion approach will continue to be deployed provided the right opportunities present themselves.</p><h4>How do you assess the Basel III requirements and what is the position of the bank in this regard?</h4><p>Investor confidence in QNB continues to be strengthened by our high Basel III capital adequacy ratios that exceed the regulatory minimum by satisfactory levels.  The strong growth in QNB's balance sheet and income statement has, in turn, generated A+ credit ratings from Standard &amp; Poor's and from Fitch. These are amongst the highest in the MENA region. Finally, there continues to be strong interest from the investor community worldwide in our Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) and Certificate of Deposit (CD) programs that are a leading indication of the confidence expressed in both QNB's strategy and strong financial position.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the early days of the bank, CBQ focused itself on the needs of shop owners in the souk. How has that traditional relationship developed into a modern cooperation with its SME clients?<br></h4><p>Things were simple and easy back then, but Qatar has developed so rapidly and the economy and banking industry have become much more complicated. However, CBQ still retains a large number of these relationships to date, and has helped many of them grow and expand their business. The most obvious assistance for the small trader in the modern world is the ability to accept payments electronically. Whilst we will never forget our roots and the customers who helped create the bank, we are encouraging them to move from their traditional habits to more electronic banking channels. Another key element is our close relationship with the owners and their families. We have been able to support and guide them as they grow and provide them with access to the full range of services from CBQ to help their growth. Typically, these include trade facilities for issuing guarantees and letters of credit, plus treasury for foreign exchange requirements and, of course, working capital and term facilities to meet their day-to-day needs. We also hold workshops for our SME customers to keep them up to date on the bank's products and services and to provide them with useful practical advice and information on managing and developing their businesses.</p><h4>How does CBQ reduce the risks involved when dealing with SMEs?</h4><p>When dealing with SMEs, knowing your customer is vital and in many cases reputation, clean credit history, and good account conduct play an important part in the decision-making process as there is little else to go on. We are fortunate that in Qatar there is a credit bureau that provides transparency on the credit behavior of not only the borrowing entity but also the guarantors. This is a useful tool for the banks when assessing the risks of a proposal, and it is also having the effect of encouraging all parties to meet their obligations in a timely manner as they do not want to have a negative credit bureau report. In addition, within the SME area at CBQ, which we call Enterprise Banking, we have our own dedicated credit area, with a team of professionals who have a good understanding of the specific risks associated with SMEs in Qatar. Having our relationship managers working alongside our credit team helps to increase our knowledge of the market and understand the risks associated with the proposals we are considering. We also continually encourage our customers to improve the quality of the financial and other information they provide to us. This is not an easy task as the related cost is often a significant factor for SMEs. We try to help through our own workshops, but there is also now a lot more assistance for smaller companies via organizations such as Enterprise Qatar and Qatar Development Bank (QDB), with which we have a very good relationship. QDB provides a guarantee of 85% for project facilities, which enables us to mitigate the associated risks, particularly for small or start-up operations.</p><h4>Qatar Exchange received an institutional upgrade from Frontier Market to Emerging Market in 2014. What will this mean for the financial sector of Qatar and for the Qatari economy as a whole?</h4><p>The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) upgrade is expected to result in huge inflows of foreign funds into the Qatari companies that have qualified to be included in the Emerging Market Index. Approximately, 50% of these qualifying companies are in financial services (including CBQ), and so the upgrade means a clear boost for Qatar's financial sector. More widely, the MSCI upgrade is international recognition of Qatar's maturing economy and equity market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on the economic, political, and cultural links between Qatar and Ireland?<br></h4><p>Qatar and Ireland have an excellent relationship that is going from strength to strength, with an increasing number of official visits confirming this. Many Irish companies are doing business in Qatar, and more and more Irish people are making their home there and contributing to the development of the country. The Irish Qatari Business Council was set up in Doha in 2012, and works to promote business and trade between Irish and Qatari entities. And as the Irish community in Qatar grows—I know the Qatar Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) is very active and successful, with a membership that competes regularly in regional GAA tournaments.</p><h4>What priorities do you assign to the economic cooperation between Ireland and Qatar?</h4><p>An indication of the priority we assign to cooperation between our countries can be seen from the number of ministerial visits and trade missions to Qatar over the last 12 months. Minister Simon Coveney led a trade mission with food and agriculture related companies in October 2013, followed by the largest ever Irish trade mission to Qatar, led by the Taoiseach in January 2014, which covered a wide number of different sectors. Following that, in June 2014, Minister Joe Costello led another trade mission to Qatar, which included companies in the construction and engineering, information technology, and health sectors. All these missions have been successful and work to increase and intensify the economic cooperation and trade relations between our countries. Enterprise Ireland, the government organization responsible for the development and growth of Irish enterprises in world markets, have opened an office in Qatar with a representative based full time in Qatar, which is another indication of the priority Ireland assigns to the relationship.</p><h4>How do you envision the future of relations between the Qatar and Ireland?</h4><p>I am confident that relations between Qatar and Ireland will continue to go from strength to strength. I believe that Ireland and Irish companies can make a positive contribution to Qatar's development in respect of the Development Plan 2030 in each of the four areas of human, social, economic, and environmental development. In terms of trade, I am confident that there is huge scope for Irish companies to continue and increase their contribution to the economic development of Qatar, given the extraordinary achievements of recent years, the scale of current and planned development, the opportunities across virtually all sectors, and the exciting path toward the future. Our vision is for Ireland to become the best small country in the world with which to do business by 2015, and I trust we will be able to demonstrate this in our dealings with Qatar. On a personal level, having recently taken over this portfolio, I look forward to leading the continued development of these relations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Financial stability is a top priority within the Qatar National Vision 2030. What issues are currently putting pressure on this objective and how does the QCB mitigate them?<br></h4><p>Law No. 13 of 2012 gives QCB the mandate to ensure financial stability and also provides for an institutionalized coordination mechanism through the Financial Stability and Risk Control Committee to address policy coordination, regulatory gaps, and overlaps between the regulators. The QCB Law also places the QCB Governor as the chairman of all three financial sector regulators, and QCB leads the work in this respect by implementing Basel III principles for better financial discipline and enhanced financial stability. Supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals and progress made under the Strategic Plan for Financial Sector Regulation, Qatar's financial sector remains in good stead despite the uncertainties surrounding global financial markets and economic recovery.</p><h4>Together with the other financial regulators, QCB introduced the Strategic Plan for Financial Sector Regulation 2011-16. How would you assess the progress that has been made in this regard?</h4><p>The Strategic Plan for Financial Sector Regulation provides the mission, vision, values, and objectives that underpin a coordinated approach to strengthening the financial sector and fostering stable and robust economic growth. As part of this strategy, QCB, under Law No. 13 of 2012, is leading the coordination efforts with the Qatar Financial Markets Authority and Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority to provide a stable financial environment to a broad range of businesses. In this context, and conforming to international standards, QCB has been moving to risk-based regulation, expanding macro-prudential oversight, enhancing transparency, strengthening market infrastructure, and improving consumer and investor protection.</p><p>In the area of regulation, Basel III-consistent regulations have already been issued to banks, which also cover a number of prudential measures and banks are largely in compliance ahead of the Basel timelines. Good progress is also being made on market infrastructure; a Qatar Central Securities Depository (QCSD) was established toward the end of 2013 to take over the activities and functions of the Central Registry Department at the Qatar Exchange. QCSD is a private company owned jointly by QCB and QE. In order to promote regulatory cooperation and augment management of systemic risk, a Financial Stability and Risk Control Committee (FSRCC) was established in 2013.</p><h4>You have been an early advocate of a single GCC currency. How do you assess the current regional will toward any implementation?</h4><p>A single currency for the GCC region would help to reduce transaction costs and promote a more transparent pricing system. It would encourage intra-regional trade and financial integration, facilitate foreign direct investment, foster macroeconomic and financial stability, and enhance international competitiveness and the credibility of monetary policy. Proximity, similarities in size, business cycles, trade structure, inflation performance, and labor and product markets further lend support for a single currency. More broadly, the recent international experience, including the lessons from the crisis in the euro zone, suggest that simultaneous work on fiscal and financial integration merits consideration.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The QFC Authority was established to support the development of a thriving financial sector in Qatar. How has that mission evolved in its first decade, and how do you expect it to develop in the coming years?<br></h4><p>Our main focus has always been to support the development of Qatar and contribute to diversifying its economy. Over the past decade, we have built a solid, first-class business environment locally, and we provided a competitive platform for domestic, regional, and international growth. Additionally, and so as to adapt to the growing and diversifying economy of Qatar, we have broadened the range of firms we welcome. For example, a significant number of professional and business services firms, across a variety of professional sectors, have now set up at the QFC. Moreover, we have also witnessed a substantial increase in the number of Qatari businesses that have joined our growing family. In fact, nearly 30% of QFC-licensed companies are Qatari. Attracting additional Qatari firms to the QFC remains a top priority and I am confident that our legal and structural enhancements will prove beneficial to both Qatari and international firms in the years ahead. The more the country moves forward, the more our role to attract and provide the required skills and expertise to support the economy becomes indispensable. QFC-licensed firms provide essential support to industries that contribute to diversifying Qatar's economy.</p><h4>In July 2014, the QFC Authority updated the QFC tax regulations and rules. What have been the most important changes and what was the reasoning behind this new policy?</h4><p>At the QFC, one of our strongest assets is our in-depth understanding of the economy's requirements. From the outset, we have attempted to respond to the nation's development, and that is why we continue to adapt our approach to the benefit of all concerned parties. For example, the introduction of the new tax regulations has helped Qatari businesses capitalize on the QFC platform while opting for the zero-tax rate on all operations conducted from the QFC. This policy was developed in line with the government's goal of strengthening the domestic private sector. In comparison to other financial centers in the region, our tax regime is unmatched. It is clear in its application and straightforward in its approach. The tax rate is low and the administrative process is both transparent and efficient. The QFC's tax regime is amongst the most favorable in the world, with a tax rate of just 10% on profits that are sourced locally. Binding, advanced tax rulings add to the certainty.</p><h4>What's your outlook for the future of the QFC?</h4><p>In 2014 alone, we surpassed our expectations both for registering firms and in building a healthy pipeline of businesses looking to participate in Qatar's growth. This reflects the bright future ahead of us. Qatar's economy is rapidly evolving, and we remain fully committed to supporting the growing private sector. We have expanded our scope to include special purpose companies, company headquarters, holding companies, single family offices, professional and business services, as well as corporate services. As the country is developing, we expect heavy investment in the construction, health, education, and technology sectors that will undoubtedly create a wide range of business opportunities for the private sector, and prove fruitful to both the economy and to companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main achievements of recent years?</h4><p>The acquisition of Palm District Cooling was certainly one of our main achievements last year. The acquisition helped us a lot to expand our operating zone, increase our domain, and the landscape of district cooling areas in Dubai. Through this acquisition, we now have representation in almost every major project in Dubai. Not only are we active in almost every major project, but we also have representation in almost every major sector. When you look at the way Dubai is developing, we have very strong representation throughout the tourism and leisure market, shopping malls, and healthcare facilities. Of course the acquisition provided a boost to our market share and it also saw us increasing our net profit by 65%. Our revenue grew to AED1.5 billion in 2014, a growth of 76% over the previous year, thus solidifying us as one of the real blue-chip companies in terms of size and market share.</p><h4>What is the significance of the MoU you signed with Johnson Controls?</h4><p>If you look at the district cooling industry, any leader in any industry should have initiatives and responsibilities when it comes to participating in R&amp;D. Part of our commitment to the district cooling industry is that we signed an agreement with Johnson Controls in the US to develop a cooling tower so that applications can be used in water cooling and air cooling to save energy. Saving energy is not just Empower's theme; it is a global theme. Everyone wants to save energy and have green buildings. By collaborating with the leading manufacturers in the world, it gives us the privilege to associate with them and it gives us an advantage in sharing a new technology that we are building for the Emirates.</p><div class="quote">“If everything goes according to plan, this market will give us the opportunity to double our capacity by 2018."</div><h4>How does Empower play a role in developing a green economy for Dubai and the UAE?</h4><p>District cooling is one of the main pillars of green buildings. District cooling is a new air conditioning technology that supplies cool air through an environmentally friendly application by using chilled water. District cooling is the main pillar of any green economy. Moreover, building owners are beginning to understand that the green aspect of green buildings isn't simply the building materials, but involves the overall operational efficiency during construction and after completion. Construction only lasts a short time when you consider the overall lifespan of a building.</p><h4>How do you see Empower evolving in the future?</h4><p>If everything goes according to plan, this market will give us the opportunity to double our capacity by 2018. The US, Canada, and Mexico have a total district cooling capacity of 650,000 tons. Empower, as just one company, has more than 1 million tons. The entire continent of North America only has 650,000, and we alone in Dubai have more than 1 million. If I double that to more than 2 million, it will mean a huge amount of business. It's really an opportunity for the manufacturers to develop their industry toward for green products.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What areas of Azerbaijan's economy have seen the most growth, and which sectors have the most potential in 2015?</h4><p>We have seen that the non-oil industries, specifically the construction and service sectors, have continued to support overall growth at a rate above 6% over 2014. Despite some restraint, they remain the main contributors to this relatively good performance and continue to benefit from heavy public capital spending. On the other hand, the oil sector has disappointed, with growth below expectations on the back of falling crude production and exports. We see similar trends for 2015. The agro-industry, IT, and tourism sectors are seen by the authorities as promising for increasing diversification and creating jobs.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the First European Games in 2015 on Azerbaijan's economic position, both in terms of investment opportunities and national spending?</h4><p>We have not assessed the Games' impact on investment opportunities, but we are aware of the authorities' plans to spend $1.6 billion in 2015 on sports infrastructure, as well as preparations and organizational work for hosting these games in Baku, as announced in the context of the approval of the 2015 budget.</p><div class="quote">“The IMF sees investment in public infrastructure as key to accelerating growth."</div><h4>The IMF recently announced that investment in public infrastructure in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Caucasus is increasingly important. How would you assess Azerbaijan's current investment in public infrastructure?</h4><p>Indeed, the IMF sees investment in public infrastructure as key to accelerating growth in both the near and long term. This topic is gaining increasing attention not only in the MENA region and the Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA), but also across the globe, as evidenced in the discussions during the 2014 IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings. For oil exporters in the MENA and CCA countries, this is particularly important, because oil revenues could finance spending. While recognizing that investment in public infrastructure is essential for growth, the IMF has stressed that its impact depends on the efficiency and choice of priorities in public investment. According to the recent IMF report, the Making the Most of Public Investment in MENA and CCA Oil-Exporting Countries, even after their high levels of investment spending over the past decade amid high oil prices, oil exporting countries still face infrastructure gaps. The study highlights that strong institutions and better management of projects are crucial to making the most of public investment. This entails greater scrutiny of public investment (for example appraisal information, competitive procurement, and bidding statistics). Modifications to the framework for managing public investment could also help improve its productivity, particularly by strengthening medium-term budget frameworks and the appraisal and selection of investment projects. During our visit to Azerbaijan in late October, we welcomed the ongoing public expenditure and financial accountability assessment (PEFA) update and commended the authorities on the improvements set out in the preliminary findings of this report. We think this update should pave the way for further improvements in the efficiency of public spending in the country.</p><h4>Diversifying the economy and encouraging the growth of SMEs have been highlighted as necessities for Azerbaijan. How would you assess national efforts to stimulate growth in this way and improve the business climate?</h4><p>The economy has not been diversified away from oil yet, and the main driver of growth is government spending, mostly financed by oil revenue. Although the share of the non-oil sector has increased lately, its growth, too, heavily depends on oil-sector growth and government expenditure. One way to help diversify the economy is to improve the business environment; the government has done a sterling job of tackling corruption at the lower levels but will need to broaden the coverage of anti-corruption programs to higher levels. Another form of diversification is helping SMEs that are essential for growth; they offer considerable potential for job creation. According to cross—country studies by the OECD and IFC on this topic, SMEs contribute much less to growth in Azerbaijan than they do in other countries—their share in GDP remains in single digits, well below the average of more than 50% in a sample of advanced economies, and below the Asian average of 30—40%. SMEs in Azerbaijan continue to face high costs associated with entry and exit procedures, contract enforcement, government inspections, and property rights. Insufficient access to finance is also an issue; more than half of SMEs in Azerbaijan lack access to financing. The government is making efforts in this area. The successful implementation of a one-stop-shop for registration, along with steps to create a credit bureau, could help to relieve some of these constraints. Developing a vibrant, competitive SME sector will also require lowering barriers to competition and trade, improving governance, and fighting corruption.</p><h4>What reforms and changes are necessary to ensure a continuation of macro-economic development in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>As mentioned earlier, continued expansion of the non-oil sector is essential to ensure sustainable growth and generate adequate employment, particularly in light of the volatility of oil prices. Additionally, reducing fiscal vulnerabilities is key to fostering non-oil private sector activity. So we welcomed last year's progress toward fiscal sustainability and have encouraged the authorities to continue reducing the non-oil fiscal deficit in the 2015 budget. With oil prices now lower than assumed in the budget, some reduction in the originally planned spending should be considered. The new oil price environment also heightens the need for reforms of the business environment and governance. The government's commitment to reaching a more sustainable fiscal position has heightened the importance of these reforms.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lebanese banks are known for providing a vital anchor of stability for the national economy despite regional challenges. What factors have created this resilience?</h4><p>The stability of Lebanese banks is related mainly to the monetary policy implemented by the authorities in Lebanon, which helps to ensure the stability of the currency exchange rate, and provides a good environment for banking and financial stability. Lebanese banking stability is also affected by the implementation of international standards—it is an important issue for us in Lebanon to implement international norms. We are implementing all standards related to the financial field, particularly accounting and disclosure standards. We are operating in a small country with a small market; however, our bankers are also active in many regional and international markets. We are in more than 30 countries and around 100 cities worldwide, and you cannot have a different set of standards for every country. That is the second importance of adopting and implementing international standards, enabling you to operate in Jordan, Egypt, or Paris. Diversifying and investing outside of Lebanon is a good management tool for us.</p><h4>The Lebanese banking sector has always been a pioneer in implementing international norms, such as Basel. What is the significance of keeping ahead, in terms of reinforcing the image and increasing confidence?</h4><p>Promoting the Lebanese banking sector is very important in order to have a robust industry. The reason so many countries want to deposit and save with Lebanese banking is because it is solid and robust in implementing international standards. The main factor behind the Lebanese banking sector expansion over the last 20 years has been the implementation of sound banking. We have been tested many times during the last 20 years, yet we survived several severe crises nationally, regionally, and globally. During the 2008-09 international financial crisis, however, none of our clients who deposited with us lost a single penny throughout that entire period. As far as confidence is concerned, it takes a long-term relationship to establish confidence with clients. Confidence does not come from a one- or two-year relationship, but a long-term tradition of managing investors' funds, and our investors have confidence in management skills of our bankers.</p><div class="quote">“Promoting the Lebanese banking sector is very important in order to have a robust industry."</div><h4>What are the other advantages of investing in Lebanon, and what would be your message to international investors seeking opportunities in the region?</h4><p>Unfortunately, during the last two or three years we have seen the FDI in Lebanon decline more than 30% compared to the 2010 figure. For international investors, they will consider the regional business environment, and, since, the Middle Eastern region has been characterized by instability over the last three to four years. It was not attractive for investments; and this also impacted investment in Lebanon. The entire region is changing, but our banks continue to attract foreign investors for many reasons; the main Lebanese banks are listed, and they are publishing and disclosing their results every semester. The other reason is that we have been dealing with certain countries in our region where we have had a solid clientí¨le base for more than five decades. The investors in these countries are very pleased with our professionalism and our prudent management and finally with our transparency, and they trust us and like to invest in our banks.</p><h4>What is your assessment of Beirut's potential to regain the role of a major banking center in the region?</h4><p>Personally, I do not think that Beirut is going to become the main regional banking sector. Throughout the last 30 or 40 years, the banking centers emerged in Arab countries like Bahrain, the UAE, and Qatar. Also, they developed in Jordan, Cairo, Morocco, and Tunisia. We cannot be number one in size taking into account the size of our economy, but certainly we will stay among the main regional banking centers. We are operating in more than 10 Arab countries and 20 other non-Arab countries. We have a lot of Arab investors in the capital of our banks. I believe we will continue to play the role of an active regional banking center, even though the competition is strong.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>I do not see any dramatic changes occurring in 2015 for the Lebanese banking industry. We are fighting to keep our industry developing at a good growth rate—aiming at 6-7%—and if we can attain such a growth rate (6.6% in 2014) it will be enough to finance our economy and the public sector in foreign and Lebanese currencies. We need a minimum amount of growth to continue to serve our economy and state adequately. I think we will reach the necessary levels of growth on our balance sheet, and this will be an important objective for us. Our other main objective is to maintain banking stability and not to have any ripples in the system. I do not expect to see any dramatic changes in the monetary policy, the exchange rate, or interest rate, which will continue to be stable. The structure of prices—goods and wages—is expected to stay stable also in 2015; this is a manageable issue!</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After visiting the Kingdom twice since September 2014, how would you characterize the importance of developing Italian-Saudi economic ties in relation to the Ministry's regional and even global mission?</h4><p>Italy is the second-largest manufacturing economy in Europe and has strong export performance. Italian exports have been growing consistently in past years and have a rising impact on GDP. The country's industrial basis, which mainly relies on SMEs, is large and diversified with a high innovation rate. When I visited Saudi Arabia in September 2014 and January 2015 I had the chance to appreciate how successfully the country has embarked on an ambitious path to diversify its economy and foster local entrepreneurship through SMEs and investments in human capital. I believe Italy and the Kingdom make ideal partners within a framework of long-term commitment and cooperation based on best practices sharing, technology transfer, training, and joint investments.</p><h4>In 2014, there were over 60 Italian companies operating in Saudi Arabia, with investments totaling roughly $3 billion. How do you see Italian participation in the Saudi economy developing over the next five years?</h4><p>Italian FDIs in Saudi Arabia fall mainly under two sectors; infrastructure and energy. We boast a successful and decade-long partnership with Saudi Arabia in these domains. Within the European Union, Italy is also the largest importer of Saudi goods and the second-largest exporter to the Kingdom. Nevertheless, long-standing relationships always need new initiatives to keep pace with a changing reality. One of the main avenues for our bilateral cooperation in the future are joint investments in Italy, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere across a wide range of sectors, including tourism, healthcare, and renewable energy. This will be the most promising way to give new impetus to our relationship with mutually beneficial results.</p><div class="quote">“Italian FDIs in Saudi Arabia fall mainly under two sectors; infrastructure and energy."</div><h4>Major Italian companies are currently active in such sectors as transport infrastructure and energy. What other sectors do you see the most opportunities for growth between Italy and Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We are witnessing an increasing role for Italian companies as strategic partners of the Saudi public and private sectors in key infrastructure projects. To mention a few, top Italian companies are part of such milestone building projects as the Riyadh Metro, King Abdullah Financial District, Saudi Landbridge, and Jazan Economic City. Many more companies, including SMEs, have been working with Saudi partners over the years building successful business relations. Within this promising framework, Italy is now focusing on ways to broaden its current cooperation with the Kingdom to include such sectors as healthcare and renewable energy that lie at the core of both our industrial expertise and Saudi Arabia's growth strategy.</p><h4>What major projects or initiatives are currently underway or planned to strengthen the economic relations between Italy and Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Exchange of high-level visits focused on our political and economic agenda, business delegations, scientific research programs, and joint pilot projects in high-value industries are the main leverages for boosting the economic relations between Italy and Saudi Arabia. These visits enrich the partnership, introducing new areas of cooperation and keeping it on pace with global trends. Nowadays Italy is offering its foreign partners a more and more attractive business environment, not only from a legal point of view, but because of its strong economic fundamentals. Our business people firmly believe in internationalization, innovation, and global partnerships. I believe there is a huge potential for Saudi investments in Italy, especially in technology-intensive industries that are the backbone of the Kingdom's diversification plans. Unfolding this potential is part of our main focus and it will be the new frontier of our cooperation.</p><h4>As Saudi Arabia strives to become a more knowledge-based economy, in which ways can Italian collaboration and technology help to achieve this goal?</h4><p>Italy boasts a wide and advanced industrial basis with a major role for SMEs. Italian small and medium businesses combine their unique district-based production model with innovative, global, and forward-looking production strategies. Most of them enjoy an outstanding export performance and represent points of reference for niche markets worldwide. Their products are found in the upper part of the global value-chain. They also have a big impact on job creation. I see great potential for our SMEs-based model as a way to promote entrepreneurial awareness in the Kingdom, foster the shift towards a knowledge-based economy, boost human capital, and combat unemployment among young Saudi people. Closer partnerships between Italian and Saudi SMEs can help the latter develop leading global technology.</p><h4>What are the major short-term goals for the Ministry regarding Italian-Saudi economic relations, as well as your long term vision and strategy for this relationship?</h4><p>In the short term we are mainly working on bridging the “information gap" that is still preventing the Italian-Saudi economic cooperation from fully meeting its potential. This means fostering closer contacts between our business people, identifying pioneering projects and, in general, making investment opportunities in both countries better known. All countries suffer from misperceptions and stereotypes, and Italy and Saudi Arabia are not exceptions. When it comes to our relations, this means we need to move beyond oil and gas and open up new areas for joint initiatives. Once we make this step I expect the Italian-Saudi cooperation to be an even more successful one as we can perfectly match Italy's longstanding expertise with Saudi Arabia's ambitious vision.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Choucair was the first company in Hispanic America to specialize in software quality control. How did it all start?</h4><p>Formerly it was the users who would run all the tests, and rather uncommon for a company to have its own test department since, at that time, there was no culture of software testing. That motivated me to embark upon this adventure and start this project of establishing a software testing company from scratch in a country where the concept and culture of software testing, as well as the perks of this discipline, needed to be created and shown. There were no testers, no marketing topics, and outsourcing was barely known, so starting under these circumstances represented a major challenge. People had to be trained, the methods and processes had to be created, and the culture had to be established in order to show the potential customers that this type of business was indeed something particularly useful for them. After 15 years, we have managed to create a whole industry in Colombia; there are many certified testers, not only here but throughout Hispanic America. There are more companies whose core business is focused on this activity, which means that an industry emerged from this idea, and it has been growing and gaining more importance, as evidenced by the fact that, at this moment, there are over 1,200-1,500 people working in this field. I started my company Choucair Testing S.A with an initial investment of $1,000, supported by a larger company that believed in me, and more specifically, in the idea. I have always said that larger companies are always willing to help entrepreneurs to develop their ideas; but, in order for that to happen, one must really commit to working relentlessly on the project, as that is what has helped me have a company that generates $12 million annually, creating direct employment for over 400 people, and has offices in Medellí­n, Bogotá, Peru, and Panama.</p><h4>How does your service enable companies to minimize risk and improve performance?</h4><p>First, we should highlight that when we talk about testing, we are not only referring to the process of going through tests and tasks, but rather, we should conceive the term within the framework of a much wider sense, since, when done correctly and aligned with the client's business strategy, we effectively become an enabler of such strategy directly from the testing stage. As we start measuring and testing, we are able to correct and rectify the production process of a given product and, as a consequence, the production speed rate increases and the gap between where the customer really is and what they really want to achieve based on their strategy narrows. This obviously requires highly qualified personnel with a clearly defined set of skills, a whole cognitive analysis and specialized tools and methods in order to perform the task properly. Finally, we strive to diminish the risk associated with production and make sure that the final product meets what the customer wants to convey.</p><div class="quote">“When we first started, we practically had to figure out the way of doing this job."</div><h4>What innovations have you implemented and how have you defined your services over time?</h4><p>When we first started, we practically had to figure out the way of doing this job. There is a considerable body of literature and guidelines on this topic, but ultimately, it has turned out to be a path of self-exploration and knowledge around the world. We have developed our own models and methods, which turned out to be highly effective and efficient; we created our own products and managed to present the testing process as something innovative. We have also striven to improve and innovate our internal processes, such as the knowledge management model, which has seen positive feedback from our collaborators and customers. It is important to mention that we have an R&amp;D department of seven or eight people who are continuously improving our current products and services and creating new ones. Likewise, we deliberately assumed a socially responsible position toward society, which involves both the executive directors and the collaborators. We always bear in mind how can we positively affect society and how to combine efforts to generate direct welfare for our environment and our zone of influence. Finally, we want to help this industry to be considered as an industry of knowledge, rather than one of workforce.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-great-deal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the process of negotiations for 4G technologies between the government of Ecuador and the private sector?</h4><p>This government has set the pace for an aggressive negotiation process for 4G. These negotiations have been well structured and all main parties have taken part; we have been the driving force throughout the entire process. We reached a global pre-agreement last October and ever since have been formalizing everything under the main regulatory framework and public bodies. The final and official agreement was reached in January with that the formulation of key legislation, and we are now in the process of implementation. We have already granted licenses to operations—Movistar and Claro for example. There has been a great deal of interest from the main international operators in obtaining an operational license. This has been a long process for all parties and has generated $330 million for Ecuador to date; the Ecuadorian government has long been investing in network and technology for the implementation of 4G technologies. This also means an improvement in the national network and in service quality for all Ecuadorians.</p><h4>What is the motivation behind the Ministry's efforts to increase cooperation with other countries in the ICT sector?</h4><p>We have a vision for our country in light of which we aim to increase the offer of our network and its capacity. We investigate potential new operators that might enter the Ecuadorian market, and the new telecommunications law creates a highly favorable framework for foreign investment. I believe that Ecuador needs, at least, a fourth operator in the sector—one bringing in an aggressive strategy. We see the development of broadband in the country as the key element for the ITC sector in terms of taking a decisive step forward. Over the past five to ten years, the government has invested considerably in ITC education and training, and yet I argue that we need to step up these efforts to take both sector and country to the next level. One of the challenges ahead of us is to increase broadband penetration in Ecuador, and we aim to offer a $10 dollar per month service to broadband users and consumers. Clearly, a larger number of internet users would also make a positive contribution to the software development industry. Meanwhile, the country is currently engaged in the implementation of a national cloud system that should become the basis of all of the abovementioned developments.</p><div class="quote">“We investigate potential new operators that might enter the Ecuadorian market."</div><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Ecuadorian R&amp;D and how can this sector contribute to nationwide efforts to change the production matrix?</h4><p>Ecuador offers numerous opportunities for R&amp;D, especially in terms of the shift in the production matrix. Ecuador has huge agricultural potential and is a leading international exporter of certain products; R&amp;D can make this, and other potential sectors, still more competitive, increasing their technological threshold. Certain challenges lie ahead and to cope with them we first need a large consumer base with internet access. The ICT sector along with R&amp;D has a key role to play in changing the national production matrix. We are in the process of aligning ourselves with the government's strategy and contribute by making sure that more Ecuadorians have internet access, improving services in fixed telephony, and investing in key segments of the sector such as education to boost future development. 4G technologies are therefore a key component in our efforts to contribute to the development of the ITC sector.</p><h4>What have been the main changes the telecommunications law brought into the sector and the country as an overall?</h4><p>It created a clearer regulatory framework for all parties involved in the sector, providing the operation basis for operators, and stimulates the sector as a whole. It has also eased up the licensing process for operators; operators today know the benefits and rules of the game. The law also provides support and protection to consumers and sets a clearer understanding of rights, duties, and fines for all parties. The new regulatory framework in the sector represented a turning point in Ecuador's ITC industry. For example, the law now foresees several levels of fines for operators and today a sole regulatory body monitors and implements regulatory policy. All this is vital in such a fast-paced changing industry as ITC, a sector that will drive the growth of Ecuador and its economy in the near future thanks to its flexibility, and within this context, the new law is a key step.</p><h4>What other challenges does the Ministry face in the near future?</h4><p>I would say that after the new Organic Telecommunications Law, we are in the process of democratizing the mainstream media spectrum, especially radio and TV. This in itself poses a challenge for our country, as the main media channels are private and concentrate on the most populated areas, whereas cities and regions closer to the borders with neighboring countries better receive the signal of those countries than of their own. This reality must be corrected; there must be a balance in mass communication between the public and the private spheres that ensures nationwide coverage.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

Waked is a common surname in Lebanon and there are many companies under that name; hence, people tended to think that all Waked companies had something to do with us.</p><h4>What is the main activity Grupo Wisa engages in at the moment?</h4><p>We have a diverse business portfolio, and our main activity is perfumes and fragrances. Newspapers are another one of our main activities; we own the newspapers El Siglo and also La Estrella, the oldest paper in the country, and among the oldest ones in Latin America. They are two of the main newspapers in Panama, and we have high expectations for the future of these titles.</p><div class="quote">“We have operations in almost all Central American and some South American markets."</div><h4>What is the importance of the Soho project for Grupo Wisa?</h4><p>This is a project that was started some six years ago by a Spanish entrepreneur, who subsequently faced some economic difficulties in making the project a reality. I ended up acquiring firstly 50% of the shares and later on a greater percentage of them. Today, the Soho project is the main commercial investment project in the country after the Canal. The project has been able to move forward thanks to the support of local banks, especially Bancolombia and Banistmo. We are talking about two office towers and one Ritz Carlton Hotel tower. In addition, 120 stores will be constructed featuring famous brands such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior, Prada, Valentino, Burberry, Fendi, Rolex, Mercurio, Carolina Herrera, YSL, Bvlgari, Bottega Veneta, Jimmy Choo, Ralph Lauren, and many others. We already have all these contracts signed, and I believe we will open the doors by the end of 2014. To date, we are talking about an investment of some $360 million, including constructing underground parking for over 3,000 vehicles. This project has had international expertise in its design and construction. One of the towers will be named after Banistmo bank.</p><h4>How has the company expanded its international profile in the last decade?</h4><p>We have operations in almost all Central American and some South American markets. Our main future focus will be on the Southern Cone. For example, we opened the first Burberry store in Chile. I also want to enter Brazil, despite the legal and tax difficulties this represents.</p><h4>What role does the Colón Free Trade Zone in Panama play in the group's activities?</h4><p>Initially, the zone was one of the reasons why we moved to Panama; today, it is a logistics center for us from where we bring European products and redistribute them among our subsidiaries. It is not a business center, rather it is a logistics hub. This is due to the fact that over the years we have ended up assuming the entire distribution chain for our business activities, prior to that we used to work more with intermediaries. Despite the increase in operating costs, we knew this was the way to succeed, and time has proved this right.</p><h4>What is the significance of Fundacion La Riviera for Panamanian society?</h4><p>The foundation is a personal project based on the idea that I have always believed as a businessperson that you have to give back as much as you can from what you achieve. I am extremely thankful for the work done by the management board of the foundation. My daughters have also been an essential part in the development of the foundation. The main goals of Fundacion La Riviera are education, healthcare, child welfare, and the alleviation of poverty. My future plan foresees the professionalization of the foundation in terms of having its own headquarters, better facilities, and more resources. For example, we want a space where we can set up a community center to provide training, food and care for low-income families.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the Chamber's major achievements so far?</h4><p>An important achievement is centered on EUMCCI's strong relationship with the Malaysian government and its agencies, built over the years. We engage regularly with many key agencies. For example, we had a briefing with Pemandu on the Economic Transformation Program (ETP) and Government Transformation Program (GTP); we had a joint activity with SME Corp. on Opportunities and Challenges of ASEAN Economic Community (AEC); we debated the AEC with key experts including Malaysian Royal Customs; dialogues with MITI and their “ecosystem" with the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water; and consultations with Bank Negara, and the list goes on. EUMCCI is indeed an important dialogue partner with the Malaysian government and the European Commission, with the role to map and provide input on government policies and strategies, contribute to free trade negotiations and dialogues, and to attract more investment and promote Malaysia as a gateway to ASEAN. We have 13 active committees, which are Aerospace, Automotive, the CSR Outreach Programme, Energy, Energy Efficiency, Healthcare, Human Resources, Intellectual Property Rights, Logistics and Transportation, Research and Innovation, Smart Grid, Defence and Security, and Wines &amp; Spirits. These committees meet regularly with their stakeholders to discuss issues affecting their industries and every year they put in together our EUMCCI Trade Issues and Recommendations (to be published soon) in line with the Chamber's mission to facilitate and accelerate business and investment between the EU and Malaysia.</p><h4>What are the main benefits for EU companies in Malaysia?</h4><p>Malaysia is situated in a strategic and unique position not only within the realm of ASEAN but also within the Asia Pacific. The population of ASEAN is more than 625 million and its GDP has reached $2.4 trillion, ranked seventh in the world. Furthermore, if we take into consideration the larger ASEAN plus three or ASEAN plus six (ASEAN plus China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand), the combined population and market is massive and Malaysia is sitting in the epicenter of this important region. In this context, Malaysia is attractive not only because of its internal market but most importantly because it can be an excellent gateway to the ASEAN and Asian markets. I often cite the example of Ireland, which is a relatively small economy, but global in nature, a large recipient of foreign direct investment from both Europe and the US, through innovative and pro-business economic policies Ireland has been able to attract high-tech, innovative companies in high growth sectors and has become a gateway to Europe and the US. Similarly, Malaysia can become a success case in this region; it has excellent infrastructure, good governance, a solid institutional framework, innovative incentives, and access to the ASEAN and Asian markets. It is also important to note that in recent years ASEAN has experienced one of the most stable growth rates in the world and Malaysia has excelled within ASEAN, showing a 6% annual growth rate since 1990, one of the highest in the region, and in the world, trailing only China and India. In this context, Malaysia is very well positioned to become a hub for ASEAN,  as it offers, in addition to its internal market, an excellent base for exports and market access into the ASEAN and global markets. Other countries such as Indonesia or emerging economies, like for example Vietnam and Myanmar, are also attractive investment destinations due to potential growth of their internal markets. Malaysia is in a somewhat different position, and notwithstanding its population, which has reached 30 million, is located in a geo-economic and politically strategic place offering other comparative advantages like, for example, swift establishment procedures for new businesses and competitive costs compared to places like Singapore, and access to the seventh largest economy in the world.</p><div class="quote">“We would like to see more European companies, in particular SMEs, using Malaysia as a hub to ASEAN."</div><h4>How is the EUMCCI helping EU SMEs to enter and grow in the Malaysian market?</h4><p>In the second half of 2013, we launched the Support for European Business in South-East Asian Markets Malaysia Component (SEBSEAM-M) project, jointly and co-funded by the EU. The project's main objective is to support trade and investment with EU-based companies in South-East Asia, with a focus on EU SMEs, and to use Malaysia as a gateway for regional investment. All EU countries that have councils or trade representations in Malaysia are partners in this important project, and this in itself a big accomplishment. In 2014, we were able to launch a series of key projects. We organized the EU-ASEAN Food Safety Forum in October, where we brought experts from all over Europe and ASEAN to talk about some of the challenges in terms of food safety, logistics, and labeling. Under the project, we also launched a Web Portal in a ceremony hosted jointly with our EU Ambassador and MITI. The main aim of the portal is to help to facilitate information, create awareness, and place companies in a peer-to-peer relationship with experts and, in so doing, help EU companies to learn more about how to invest, trade, and establish themselves in Malaysia within the context of promoting Malaysia as a hub to ASEAN. The market in ASEAN and Malaysia is well known to the European multinationals, but there is a lot to be done for European SMEs. Over the last two or three years, there has been a lot of interest from European SMEs to go abroad and come to Asia. We need to create awareness and promote Malaysia as a gateway to ASEAN. SEBSEAM-M is a relevant project for EU-Malaysia and EU-ASEAN relations and this year the timing is perfect as Malaysia is Chairing ASEAN and the ASEAN AEC will come to a fruition offering market access to existing and new EU companies coming to ASEAN. The EU is also co-funding similar projects in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.</p><h4>How will closer integration between ASEAN members, brought about by the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), impact EU-Malaysian trade relations?</h4><p>First is the relevance of Europe to ASEAN and of ASEAN to Europe. The EU is the largest  investor in ASEAN, and is the third largest trading partner in ASEAN (behind China and Japan), and ASEAN is the third largest partner of the EU (outside of Europe). We have more than 10,000 European companies operating in ASEAN and many of them have their Asia-Pacific headquarters in the ASEAN region. Second is the importance of trading blocs not only economically, but also politically. AEC will transform ASEAN into a single market with free movement of goods, services, investments, skilled labor, and freer flow of capital. This opens opportunities for growth but also presents challenges. For example, a lion's share of ASEAN foreign trade is outside of ASEAN, meaning that there is an upside potential to increase intra-ASEAN trade. ASEAN could learn from EU integration and its accomplishments and challenges and the EU can learn from the ASEAN approach to trade and financial integration. AEC will increase transparency and cooperation between countries and the harmonization of regulations and standards between countries will encourage trade and investment. A single market will enable companies to exploit economies of scale in the markets. The streamlining of customs procedures, as well as standards, which is ongoing, will make it more attractive from companies to access Malaysia and ASEAN markets. The aim will be to augment investment and trade between Malaysia and the EU.</p><h4>Where do you see EU-Malaysia trade relations five years from now?</h4><p>We would like to see more European companies, in particular SMEs, using Malaysia as a hub to ASEAN, more investment and trade between the EU and ASEAN, and more ASEAN investment into the EU. There is a growing and strong bilateral relationship and investment between the EU and ASEAN. The EU continues to be the leading investor in ASEAN and, in the other way, investment from ASEAN has doubled recently reaching $90 billion. So we would like to see more of the same, with more SMEs coming into Malaysia. Some of the 2,000 plus European businesses present here have an important operation and investment and some are already using Malaysia as a hub. In the recent past, the lion's share of this type of investment would go to places like Singapore. Our focus in coming years is to attract more companies to set-up their hubs and higher value added operations in Malaysia. The other is to be effective in promoting AEC and Malaysia as an access point and a hub to ASEAN.</p><h4>How does increased cooperation between the EU and Malaysia align with the country's 2020 Vision?</h4><p>They are presently aligned, because to move from a medium-income to high-income country, Malaysia needs to promote the development of value added industries and accelerate the development of higher skilled labor. In addition, with its population of 30 million, Malaysia needs to continue to attract FDI in key high growth sectors and consistently grow at 5% annually, or more, over the next five to 10 years. To transition from a mid- to a high-income economy will not be an easy task and will require a great deal of effort and innovative policies.  In this context, the Chamber is aiming to promote Malaysia to attract higher value added industries. Finally, I would like to note that EUMCCI is open to any company that wants to join. In addition to EU based corporations, we have a large number of Malaysian companies, global MNCs, state agencies, and universities. We also promote Europe as an investment destination for Malaysian investors.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have contributed to growth over the past few years?</h4><p>Growth has always been a priority for Rotoplas, a company focused on the water market. Today, water demand is outpacing supply for several reasons including the demographics of urbanization, climate change, and food production. Processing a pound of beef, for example, requires about 400 gallons of water. Additionally, although governments have resources allocated to water in their budgets, often this is not enough to meet demand. All of this gives us the opportunity to provide our value added water solutions for every problem. At Rotoplas we have been able to capture growth for different reasons, among them our top-notch management team, who have years of experience in the water industry, and our strong focus on innovation. We differentiate ourselves based on the special characteristics of the quality products we offer, where 42% of our sales in 2014 were generated by R&amp;D initiatives. We are leaders in every one of the markets in which we operate, with strong brand recognition and our unique platform being at the cornerstone of our success. When we enter a country we do not just sell products; we sell solutions to serious problems. We currently have 23 factories across Latin America and one in the US, and a strategic distribution network through which we reach close to 7,000 clients across the whole continent. Additionally, all our businesses are run on the SAP platform. These, in a nutshell, are the key elements behind our substantial growth rate.</p><h4>2014 was a strong year for Rotoplas. You launched your IPO and were able to raise Ps4.2 billion. How will this increase your presence?</h4><p>The revenue generated by our IPO will primordially be channeled to designing and implementing solutions to key water-related issues in the Americas, which we believe will contribute to ensuring that the company remains active and on a growth trajectory. We are seeing many opportunities in various areas, including the US market, which is currently experiencing a tough drought. We believe we are uniquely positioned to help them face this problem successfully, backed by our expertise in this area. In order to consolidate our business and to increase our market share, we are planning to build six or seven new plants in the US over the next two years. In Mexico, we will center our attention on building integrated water solutions for people who require urgent solutions to their water needs. Rainwater harvesting, sanitation, and water treatment—and more specifically water purification— have all become key issues in our country, and we offer integrated water solutions to counter them. For example, the government is going to allocate part of the income resulting from the recently imposed taxes on sugary carbonated drinks to installing drinking water fountains at schools in an effort to try to win the battle against childhood diabetes and obesity. Mexico today sadly ranks number one in terms of children affected by diabetes, essentially due to poor nutrition, and we are very proud to be able to be part of the solution. And finally, although Brazil has been successful in the past with its water initiatives, today both rural and urban areas are facing serious water problems that we intend to address. We will use the net proceeds of the IPO to fund our working capital and capital expenditure for all these projects.</p><div class="quote">“We are always looking for growth opportunities that add value."</div><h4>What are your plans for expansion and the challenges you face entering the US market?</h4><p>There are challenges to overcome in any business, but I am a firm believer that if you have the right processes and people, they are easier to face. In every country where we are present, we operate in what we like to call the Rotoplas way. The Rotoplas way is the common platform that focuses on reducing operating expenses and standardizing processes to support our strategic growth plan and profitability. This platform is based on robust processes, state-of-the-art systems, and extraordinary people. Also, above all, we invest our time and resources in developing leadership and teamwork through effective collaboration. It was by applying the Rotoplas way that we were able to have nine plants in operation in Brazil in just 18 months and to deliver integrated solutions to our clients in record time, all of which contributed to making us the current leaders in this category. We are also implementing the Rotoplas way in our operations in the US, a new market for us where we have the added advantage of having a local management team with local knowledge of the business and of the existing needs. The Rotoplas way, our local experienced team, and the quality of our solutions will all help us boost expansion in this country.</p><h4>Besides the US and Brazil, what other countries in Latin America hold commercial potential?</h4><p>We are always looking for growth opportunities that add value. Right now we are focused on all of the Americas. Colombia is the only market where we have no presence to date, but we certainly have it on our radar.</p><h4>You mentioned that demand exceeds supply in Mexico. How can reforms support your business in that market?</h4><p>I believe that the reforms will prove supportive not only for us but for all industries in Mexico, and this will translate into economic growth, greater investments, less unemployment, and a better distribution of income. The energy reform, for example, will bring new players and new processes to Mexico, and the upcoming growth will demand vast amounts of water. Another clear example of the potential benefits is the recently imposed tax on sugary carbonated drinks that will be used in part to install drinking fountains at schools, as I mentioned before. At the same time, demographic evidence of rising disposable income will also benefit business growth consumers. In summary, there are plenty of opportunities for Rotoplas that will be supported by the reforms.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for the company over the years?</h4><p>First of all, ADVOC is in a strategically located port. In the early days, the company was set up with the primary aim to supply Iraq. While this plan had some success, the demand was not consistent and thus the company revised the business model with a view to ensuring the factory was fully engaged on a regular basis. ADVOC began producing Coroli brand products in Abu Dhabi in 2000 and in 2004, and bought Cebag Middle East Limited, the owner of the Coroli brand, amongst other brands. ADVOC thus acquired the Coroli brand ownership rights for the MENA region, plus the Cebag trading business. This proved to be a significant milestone because it got the company away from relying on government tenders, which came on an irregular basis. In addition, the company also launched a range of other branded products as well to meet demand across several sectors in the major retail outlets in the region. Between 2004 and 2009, we built up a significant distribution network in all of the countries around here, from East Africa to Pakistan and we now deal with all of the GCC for Coroli and other ADVOC brands. We also make private label brands for selected major clients. In 2010 we began a major program of upgrades and installed several automated sections to our plant including high-speed filling lines plus robotic packing and palletizing. In 2012 we expanded our factory capacity by about 25% increasing both efficiency and output. In 2013, we added a custom built modern PET bottle making plant. We are now capable of making most of our own bottles and we plan to add further capacity as demand increases. In 2014, we also acquired a plot adjacent to our refinery that will double our current factory area.</p><h4>What is your strategy in terms of innovation and automation?</h4><p>Over the past five years or so we have undertaken several projects and have taken away many of the manual elements of filling, capping, and packing. There is one line, which is capable of producing a significant percentage of our filling and packing, and everything is done automatically, right to the end when the product exits the building on pallets ready for dispatch. As part of our current five-year plan we will introduce more new high-speed lines to meet projected increased demand. Our PET bottle making is pretty much fully automatic. The bottles are blow-molded and fed straight to the filling area by a series of conveyors. It is pretty much seamless production. The same applies to the refinery itself. The refinery is PLC driven, with minimal manual intervention. There our team set up the parameters and the refinery runs itself with supervisors observing the process. Our refinery works 24 hours a day and we have a staff of around 250 including administration, shift workers, and logistics staff plus teams in our branches.</p><div class="quote">“At ADVOC we have built a culture based on health and safety among our employees."</div><h4>What is your company's HSE policy?</h4><p>At ADVOC we have built a culture based on health and safety among our employees. And this is put into practice by assuring the protection of our most valuable resource; our manpower, prevention of loss or damage to lives or resources, the constant promotion of health and safety awareness throughout the company, and collaboration with all relevant authorities in line with the UAE's ceaseless effort in the overall development of its workforce by complying with all legal safety requirements. ADVOC is also certified with ISO 9001:2008 (Quality Management System) and ISO 22000:2005 (Food Safety Management System) and we continually strive to meet and exceed these internationally recognized standards.</p><h4>What is your company's strategy for being as customer orientated as possible?</h4><p>We check our audit data to see how the product is perceived. We always get feedback through our people and solicit feedback from the trade. The Coroli brand has been around for 35-40 years and it has built a good client base throughout the region as well innovating a lot with the packaging. You need to provide a quality, competitive product and you need to provide support for advertising and promotion in order to keep the trade and the consumers happy.</p><h4>What countries are you present in at the moment?</h4><p>Most of the business goes to the GCC and up to the Levant with Saudi Arabia being probably an even larger market than the UAE. Despite the various conflicts in the region we are still able to continue to supply parts of Syria plus Lebanon, and Jordan, and down to Tanzania and some of the top-end African countries. We have had a long business relationship with Pakistan, Nepal, and the Seychelles. It is quite a spread over all of these places, although the bulk of the business is done nearby.</p><h4>What is your plan for the future?</h4><p>We intend to expand into the African markets, and in time we will also further expand and upgrade into other nearby countries such as Iraq and Iran when matters improve. We have traditionally dealt with Iraq; however, when trouble starts, business goes down; it is a difficult place to do business. However, these are quite attractive and sizable markets. In the future, ADVOC will increase the output capability of the refinery further, including adding specialty fats like shortening, margarine, and fats for the bakery, hotels, restaurants, and catering segment. This will not just be here in Abu Dhabi, but throughout. This will give us a wider range of products. We have a substantial network of distributors, so it is easy for us to tack that on. We are also going to improve some of the product types that we make and widen the range of our existing products.</p><h4>What kind of partnerships is ADVOC looking for?</h4><p>ADVOC has distributors that go back to the 1960s and 1970s. We have been in discussions and been approached many times by potential strategic partners from the Far East who see us as a potential vehicle to enter the Middle East region since Abu Dhabi and the UAE is a great hub. We have also had interest from some of the major players locally. Some of them have talked to us about joining forces. This is definitely the way forward. We have been approached by individual investors as well and this is part of the reason for us to expand the business—we are aware that people see this as a place for expansion and we are a prime candidate to either attract additional investors or to merge and join other companies as part of the food business.</p><h4>What is your recommendation for export-oriented companies that want to come to Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>You only have to look at the map. First of all, it is a safe and peaceful spot in this region; it is like an oasis of calm when all around us is trouble. Furthermore, there are large countries all around us—Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran—meaning there is great potential. The transportation links are great from this country. We do in fact frequently use the road links, plus we are close to the port and the new port is in a great location. Looking to the future, as Khalifa Port builds up it will be an additional asset to anyone coming here. Overall, it is easy enough to do business here as it is transparent and there is good support from the financial institutions and the government.</p><h4>How would you assess government regulations in the food business?</h4><p>I see the government's work as successful. There is significant work being done to bring price stability to the sector. That is positive for us, for all companies doing business in this sector, and also for the ones that want to enter the market, not to mention the consumers. I also see the government working hard toward food safety. This boosts quality in the sector and motivates companies to create more value added while staying competitive. We are definitely looking for inward investment to grow the business, either from institutions or other investors. That is something we believe in because we have some good value to add to the economy.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to UNHCR, the number of registered Syrian refugees in Lebanon passed 1.2 million at the end of September 2014, representing 26.3% of the total Lebanese population. What are the costs and benefits of hosting Syrian refugees in Lebanon?</h4><p>Until 2010, Lebanon's economy was relatively stable and many sectors—particularly construction, tourism, and banking—continued to witness good economic performance. Moreover, economic growth rates ranged between 7.5% and 9% between 2007 and 2010. However, this trend has reversed since 2011, and the Lebanese economy has been witnessing contractions in investment and consumption trends as a result of the massive influx of Syrian refugees. Economic indicators also showed weakened results, producing negative factors, eroding the Lebanese labor market. Displaced Syrians began working in many of the commercial and economic sectors, taking jobs from hundreds of thousands of Lebanese employees. The budget deficit has also increased as a result of the international community's weak assistance to the displaced Syrians and Lebanese hosting communities. There has been erosion in the educational sector as well, since a large number of public schools in Lebanon started providing educational services exclusively to Syrian students. There has been a marked decline in private, public, and foreign direct investments as well. In addition to economic factors, the security situation is also deteriorating, with the increasing acts of disruption carried out by some of the displaced, which in turn has lead to a worsening in the overall economic activity.</p><h4>According to the World Bank's report on the Global Economic Prospects, Lebanon is among the non-oil-producing economies in the region expected to see reasonable growth from 2015 to 2017. What is the Ministry's outlook for the Lebanese economy over the medium term?</h4><p>Most forecasts indicate an increase in economic growth rates in the year 2015; however, this improvement primarily depends on a better security situation and on political stability, which can revive the economy and allow an increase in the various economic sectors' activities. Political stability will be achieved, first and most importantly, by the election of the President of the Lebanese Republic as soon as possible in order to rebuild investor and consumer confidence and increase capital inflows to Lebanon. It should be noted that in spite of all that the Lebanese economy has endured since has 2011, it was able to record positive rates of growth, ranging between 1% and 1.5%, and this is evidence of the economy's immunity and ability to survive in the face of these crises. Also, the IMF raised its estimate for growth to 2.5% in 2015, according to its latest report.</p><div class="quote">“Most forecasts indicate an increase in economic growth rates in the year 2015."</div><h4>Which sectors of the Lebanese economy hold the most potential for growth and development in the near future?</h4><p>Lebanon has a resilient mindset, a highly skilled labor force, a wide-reaching diaspora, and a service-oriented economy. In light of these factors, potential sectors in Lebanon for economic development include banking and finance, civil engineering, construction and related sub sectors, infrastructure, agro-foods, pharmaceuticals, medical materials equipment, cosmetics, logistics, and fashion.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to improve Lebanon's balance of trade?</h4><p>The Ministry's aim is to promote Lebanon as a trade partner in foreign markets and this is being done through pursuing an action plan and a program of meetings, which aim to activate economic diplomacy with countries outside of the Middle East. Economic diplomacy is the use of the full spectrum of economic tools of the state to achieve its national interest. Economic diplomacy includes all the economic activities related to export, import, investment, lending, aid, and free trade agreements. As such, various meetings with the ambassadors of countries that Lebanon wishes to expand its economic and trade relations with are taking place. Moreover, the Ministry is mobilizing potential trade agreements that would facilitate the market access of Lebanese products such as the Free Trade Agreement with Aghadir Countries (Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco) and the MERCOSUR countries (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Venezuela). Also, MoET organized the Lebanon EU Trade, Industry, and Agriculture Services and Internal markets subcommittees, where major subjects were discussed to increase the trade exchange and facilitate the market access to European countries.</p><h4>What is the role of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the development of the economy, what initiatives are aimed at strengthening the investment climate and promoting the country as a FDI destination?</h4><p>The primary objective of the PPP is to be able to use the experience and the ability of private funding on the public platform, whereby investments are private and are managed by the private sector, but within the legal framework depicted in the public-private partnership law. As such, reforms should be set and implemented, in terms of liberalization of economic sectors such as electricity and telecommunications, and in terms of securing an investment climate that allows the development of a suitable economic infrastructure for the execution of existing and expected activities such as oil extraction. On another note, and with regards to the initiatives aimed at strengthening the investment climate and promoting the country as a FDI destination, the MoET launched the “Lebanon SME strategy: a roadmap to 2020," which aims to accelerate the creation of startups, increase the productivity of existing SMEs, and improve the performance of existing SMEs. The main pillars of this strategy are to improve access to finance for startups and existing SMEs particularly through equity financing, strengthen and upgrading the legal and regulatory framework for businesses, facilitate access to markets for SMEs and increasing their compliance with international standards, upgrade the skills available and aligning them with the needs of businesses, and promote innovation.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-emergence]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>With exception to Saudi Arabia's natural exposure to the international oil and currency markets, our society, culture, and national economy have been, to a large degree, insulated from the economic instability felt in many parts of the world. You can call it protectionist, conservative, or lucky, but in considering these adjectives, you may also consider calling it wise. The global crisis, which began in 2007, was a regrettable man-made financial tsunami that consumed livelihoods, homes, and uprooted financial institutions seen as symbols of economic strength and stability. Whether directly or indirectly, the impact of the crisis continues to haunt Europe, and the picture remains daunting. Indeed, due to the Kingdom's gradual but progressive steps toward global convergence, we have fortunately avoided experiencing this ill fate.</p><p>Our national economy has grown at 5.4% CAGR since 2010, fuelled by significant expenditure on education, healthcare, and infrastructure, which together comprised close to 50% of total government spending (on average) since 2010. Private sector contribution in the national economy has also continued to grow at a faster rate of 6.5% CAGR over the same period, rising from 37.7% in 2010 to 39.5% of real GDP by the end of 2014.</p><div class="quote">“Looking further ahead, the Exchange is expecting to make significant investments."</div><p>Whilst recent conditions in the international oil markets are expected to weigh heavily on the Kingdom's revenues, an important financial dynamic continues to counteract the impact of this decline; namely, the strong appreciation of the US dollar. Indeed, every dollar of oil-export revenues earned by the Kingdom is 18% more valuable now from a global purchasing power perspective, than when the 44% decline in oil prices began in September 2014.</p><p>Though the Tadawul All Share Index (TASI) erased 23% of its gains by the end of 2014 in response to the sharp fall in oil prices, the index has had close to zero correlation with oil prices over the last 5 years, and has maintained a weak positive correlation with the US dollar and US and EU markets over the same period. This relationship has not materially changed over the 12 months of 2014.</p><p>Though on the face of it the picture looks less than ideal, the expected $39 billion budget deficit in 2015 may actually represent an opportune strategic pivot point for further economic policy development. Indeed, notwithstanding the Kingdom's fiscal reserves of nearly $737 billion, a budget deficit in 2015 could actually induce the issuance of government bonds to fund the anticipated shortfall. Currently, Saudi government debt stands at an insignificant 2.7% of GDP, one of the lowest ratios in the world (versus 9.4% in Russia, 96% in the US, and 103% in the UK). The issuance of new government bonds would serve to establish a sovereign yield curve to act as a pricing benchmark for local issuers; this would then serve to stimulate the growth of private sector debt issuances, a significant topic on the national agenda, whilst also reducing the public and corporate cost of capital over the coming years.</p><p>Another topic of growing focus on the national agenda is the non-oil economy and its role in contributing to employment and sustainability. SMEs are at the very heart of this debate, asserted as engines of Saudi economic diversity. The topic of SMEs continues to gain momentum as policymakers speak of a total approach to tackling the cross-jurisdictional challenges these enterprises typically face, especially in terms of access to funding, licensing, intellectual property rights, and human resourcing. Advancement in these areas of policy focus will impact the Saudi economy, generally, and the capital market specifically.</p><p>A more imminent development set to have a profound impact on the capital market is the introduction of qualified foreign institutional investors; a new investor class, with permissible access to around $50 billion of Saudi stock market capitalization; expected to bring further diversity to our stakeholders, a more sophisticated investment outlook, and a longer term investment horizon.</p><p>We are excited to be at the very center of this evolution knowing that it will redefine the boundaries of our scope and significantly expand our reach to global capital market stakeholders. In fact, we are currently finalizing a structured plan for reaching out to these new stakeholders via an international roadshow, which we hope will feature the critical pillars of our capital market community, including our regulator, issuers, members, and other important private and public sector stakeholders.</p><p>This, and other capital market developments, occur at a time when the Exchange is in the midst of activating its role as a self-regulating organization, whilst also being in the final leg of upgrading our trading engine to the latest in high performance trading technologies. The weight of these activities has prompted us to focus significant internal efforts in 2014 on detailed strategic planning, as well as on structural and cultural transformation, with the aim of strengthening our foundations and positioning ourselves for the future.</p><p>In 2014, we earned the honor of being voted Euromoney's Best Managed Financial Exchange in the Middle East for the third consecutive year. We ascribe this honor to the unwavering efforts of our staff, who continue to respond to the evolving needs of our stakeholders whilst maintaining an exceptional level of market integrity and an outstanding operational track record. Indeed nearly 37 million trades were conducted over our platform in 2014, registering a seven year high of more than $572 billion worth of value traded; equating to trading velocity of 118%, the third highest amongst our emerging market peers. In addition, 2014 was also notable for the initial public offering of the National Commercial Bank, which stood as the world's second largest IPO and one of six listed on our platform during the course of the year. Looking ahead, we expect a minimum of eight IPOs in 2015 as a number of company filings approach the end of their regulatory review cycle.</p><p>Looking further ahead, the Exchange is expecting to make significant investments over the next five years in building internal capabilities, and honoring our national responsibilities. We firmly believe that the value we derive from our investments is measured by the contribution these investments make to our core values of trust, innovation, and excellence. Indeed, we believe that value for the Exchange, as emphasized by our strategic position in the national economy, is defined by the trust we earn from upholding the integrity and reliability of our market; the innovation we aspire to in developing market infrastructure, management processes, and in the design and delivery of our products and services; and the excellence we strive for across all customer value streams.</p><p>I am confident that these investments, combined with the prevailing policy dynamics and planned development initiatives, will see the Kingdom continue to emerge over the next five years to take its place as the natural regional hub of capital formation and the destination of choice for foreign capital flows.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors contributed to your growth in 2014?</h4><p>If you look at the growth of Al-Futtaim Logistics, we have moved both vertically and horizontally. In terms of our vertical growth, our fashion design services and solutions have expanded considerably. One solution we have developed for our customers ensures that their products do not stay in storage for a long time; the retailer orders the product, which is shipped out immediately to the store as soon as it arrives at the loading dock. With the assistance of advanced technology and software, we can reduce storage time through the ways that we configure the variables involved. This has been one of the big successes of 2014 and we expect the fashion design line of the business to grow from here. In this case, we add value to the service that we provide to the customer by developing an understanding of their real needs.</p><h4>How do you adapt your solutions to customers working in different countries?</h4><p>Customers in different countries naturally have different requirements, which can present a challenge when you have shipments travelling to different regions of the world. For example, we have many customers shipping from Europe to the Middle East who require labels in Arabic, for which we have developed internal systems to simplify much of the process for the customer. Our solutions meet the principal's, the customer's, and the relevant government's requirements, as well as those of the end consumer. We aim to add value for all customers, whatever their requirements, by not only providing solutions, but by understanding the available technology and applying it to their needs.</p><div class="quote">“Customers in different countries naturally have different requirements."</div><h4>Recently Al-Futtaim Logistics opened a 50,000 sqm warehouse, distribution, and office facility, which includes a 30,000 sqm distribution center for your home delivery fleet. What has the impact of these developments been on your business?</h4><p>These two developments were a part of our 2014 strategy, and we made these moves to meet our customers' requirements in the fast moving retail division. Customers are looking for solutions dedicated to minimizing handling problems. These facilities have given our customers an advantage in a market in which lead times of over 10 days for delivery are not unusual, whereas in reality we know that customers want no more than three days. Once you learn what the customer wants, you have to find new supply chain and logistics solutions to make it happen, which is what we have done. We have fine-tuned our operational efficiency to increase productivity, and we deliver on time to satisfy customers. These days, the end consumer is more vocal about their requirements, meaning that our customers, the retail companies, understand more clearly what they need to do to address them. We take our responsibility seriously to listen and to respond, and to go much further than simply delivering products, but to give them the best solution to fit their needs.</p><h4>How do you accommodate customers from a wide range of industries?</h4><p>Whatever goods you are transporting, the customer wants to reduce the lead-time from the manufacturer to the end recipient. Each product sector has different service requirements; in the automotive industry you can store a car for a number of days, for example, but whereas the fashion industry operates seasonally, you cannot keep winter clothes for the summer. You have to look at all scenarios, and for each one you have to understand the product and the customer's demands in order to meet their requirements. A team of experts within our management team reviews every aspect; by selecting our products and methods, they control and adapt each solution to make sure that all possible scenarios are considered and prepared for.</p><h4>Al-Futtaim Logistics is the leading automotive logistics service provider in the UAE, and serves a range of other industry solutions such as retail, industrial, and project cargo. How do you see this dynamic going forward?</h4><p>During 2014 we expanded our verticals in the fashion and home delivery sectors, and are now looking at market movements very closely as we plan our expansion into food and other sectors. We foresee positive trends in the next few years leading up to Expo 2020 in the UAE. As an organization, we are well positioned in terms of starting sizeable projects and our expansion into new verticals.</p><h4>What is Al-Futtaim Logistics' regional expansion strategy going forward?</h4><p>We are looking for expansion and business growth as we expand geographically from our home market into new markets in the MENA region; including Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, East and North Africa, and then into Egypt.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Ciudad Mitad Del Mundo developed over the past few years?</h4><p>The Ciudad Mitad del Mundo is a touristic, cultural, scientific, and commercial city in Ecuador, and was established over 30 years ago. Its architecture reflects the colonial style and today it features stores showcasing handicrafts from around Ecuador; there are also restaurants offering national and international gastronomy. Here you can enjoy the typical and delicious cuy, fritada, ceviche, and more. This is the meeting point of the most colorful cultural exhibitions and popular Ecuadorian art, making this small city the main tourist attraction in continental Ecuador. This city is a scientific exhibition of our ancestral societies in Ecuador and their amazing scientific and cultural heritage. The city has evolved over the years, consolidating itself as a touristic destination. Since my appointment to the management of the city nine months ago, we have boosted innovation by strengthening our touristic offering. For example, we have the Colonial Quito Pavilion, whose purpose is to share the architectonic, touristic, and cultural values of the City of Quito. It presents an exact replica of the complex colonial architecture from Quito's Historic Center, including its churches, squares, public buildings, blocks, and entire neighborhoods. The Cultural Patrimony National Institute declared it “Ecuador's cultural asset" back in 1989. There are exhibitions dedicated to Spain, France, and the scientific research of our ancestors, as well as a planetarium, educational workshops, and exhibitions for children, among others. Overall, we have also boosted the role of technology to strengthen the educational component of our offering for both locals and foreign tourists. For example, we have increased the offering of elements related to the Ecuadorian communities, their culture, traditions, and legacy. Ecuador is also a rich country in terms of diverse climate and geography. Our offering allows visitors to become somewhat familiar with Ecuador in its entirety in a single city within two to three hours. These efforts have been accompanied by our increasing activity in training our workforce.</p><h4>What are the main countries of origin of your visitors?</h4><p>Around 60% of our foreign visitors come from the US, followed by Colombians, who represent around 20-25% of overall foreign visitors. The remaining are split into several small percentages from neighboring countries such as Peru and Argentina. I do not think we have more than 10% of tourists arriving from Europe. Nevertheless, we have increased technical efforts in our promotion and have started to pay more attention to promotional techniques from Europe with our participation in Fitur in Madrid, Spain. We have already generated tourism packages targeting European tourists and some particularly specific segments such as wedding tourism. We have addressed European visitors with tourism packages in South America, as we are keen to become the regional center for visitors to South America.</p><div class="quote">“Around 60% of our foreign visitors come from the US, followed by Colombians."</div><h4>What impact has Ecuador's joint efforts had to promote the country as a tourism destination?</h4><p>We are heavily reliant on tourist arrivals. When considering the number of visitors since I took office in May 2014, I can tell you that we have increased it by 10-15%. This has enabled us to invest in improving our offering still further. There are other elements that have helped us in our efforts to promote Ciudad Mitad del Mundo, such as becoming the capital of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR).</p><h4>What is the strategic plan for the future of the city?</h4><p>Over recent months, having changed the management structure, we have focused on making the surrounding area much more attractive. For example, we created a façade management project to make our buildings more attractive to visitors. Our next step was to enter the European tourism market via Spain and adopt useful promotional techniques for application in Ecuador. We want to jointly promote the City in the country and are keen to strengthen ties with tour operators to generate specific tourism packages. We also want to further consolidate the position of the US market vis-í -vis our own market. When I took over, the city had around 550,000 visitors per year. Yet over the past nine months or so, we have already welcomed 750,000 visitors. My goal is to welcome one million visitors within two years, which is quite a challenge as Quito attracts 1.2 million annual visitors.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the tourism sector?</h4><p>There will certainly be a rise in the number of tourist arrivals. Indeed, the idea is to make tourism the nation's main economic engine within 10 years. The country has a great potential in this sector with tourism products such as the cacao route of our internationally renowned commodity.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the corporate insurance market in Mozambique?</h4><p>The reason everybody is talking about corporate insurance is because of the hype around the extractive industry, specifically oil and gas in the north. It is similar to the atmosphere we saw 20 years ago with major manufacturing and processing projects being negotiated and established in Maputo. Insurance, as part of financial services, is concerned with sourcing financial indemnity in the event of an insured loss, as such it could be said that we restore capital in the event of a covered event. However, the insurance sector in Mozambique is in the early stages of development and the reality is that the local market has limited technical and financial underwriting capacity. As a result of this situation, the market depends significantly on reinsurance capacity. Insurance is essentially an international game, whereby you see risks being placed in international financial markets with global operators such as Munich Re and Swiss Re. Given this situation of dependence on reinsurance, you will note that there is a low level of risk retention of less than 5% of values at risk on corporate risk and mega-projects. It is on this basis that while there may be much excitement about corporate risks, in reality local insurers play a more critical role in peripheral cover such as motor and workmen's compensation insurance, rather than the key policies on assets that require significant reinsurance.</p><h4>How would you describe Hollard's relationship with the competition?</h4><p>There is growing cooperation among insurance companies through the Insurance Association (IA). This is vital in order to avoid a chaotic market situation and to ensure that appropriate standards are maintained in all key areas. And while we have to compete for the proverbial slice of cake, which has limited opportunities, it is also vital for operators to collaborate in order to ensure the appropriate development of the market and support for operators that have invested in this country. Without such safeguards, the market could be exposed to capital flight through entities not invested in Mozambique and only interested in extracting profits.</p><div class="quote">“There is growing cooperation among insurance companies through the Insurance Association (IA)."</div><h4>What role is the government playing within the insurance market in Mozambique?</h4><p>Sometimes in these environments it is up to the government to negotiate and attract large investors, and the results will depend on the concessions they give. They can and should create a kind of win-win scenario for the country. The jury is still out in terms of what is going to happen in the north with regards to the emerging oil and gas industry. We, as the insurance industry, received an urgent letter from the Ministry of Finance through the insurance association requesting our comments on the possible concession that the government was considering for the exploration area of oil and gas in the Rovuma basin. There was a proposal for these operators to be exempted from having to comply with local insurance legislation like all other companies that are locally domiciled. Naturally, the IA was concerned about this trend and what it could trigger in other economic sectors. Furthermore, such a policy would be in contradiction to the official government policy of supporting local retention, and in alignment with the policies of other countries with major extractive industries. While the policy-maker may see the advantages of creating an attractive incentive for new investors by permitting such exemptions, such policies can also amount to virtually “throwing the baby away with the bathwater" for investors in other sectors that have set up on the assumption that there would be the right conditions for local development.</p><h4>How do the general public, especially in rural areas, feel about the need for insurance?</h4><p>The emerging economy and the ability to create wealth are bound to change perceptions on insurance. As soon as you create an enabling environment that allows individuals to work, enjoy a regular salary that not only pays for food, but also starts to pay for a home, car, and education, there will naturally be a developed awareness of the value of possessions and risk. At some point in the development of an economy, the realization dawns that should catastrophe strike going back to square one is simply unacceptable. Insurance becomes a useful mechanism for risk mitigation. Then with growing buying power and interest in protecting their welfare, people will start thinking about insurance types such as life and health, which at the moment are not top priority in their lives. The process of insurance purchase is connected to an awareness of risk and of a need to find ways to control it. This is also part of a process known as risk management. There is a need for awareness campaigns in order for people to understand risk and how an unexpected event can set an individual as well as an economy back many years. Insurance is just one important tool that forms a component of risk management. It allows the insured persons to transfer risk and as such purchase capital that may be accessed if you are unfortunate to suffer unforeseen covered events. It is a new, very challenging and exciting environment to be a part of at the moment.</p><h4>What role do banks play as partner of Hollard?</h4><p>Hollard Moçambique, as part of the greater Hollard Group, which is known for its vast experiences in partnering with the banks across Africa, currently has bank assurance partnerships with a few selected and important Mozambican banks as well as some micro-lenders. Bancassurance, as this distribution pillar is known, is still a fairly new concept in the market, but growing. More and more, Mozambican banks are focusing on retail banking and associating themselves with insurance companies as embedded retail partners. In my opinion this is a sure sign of a developing economy and market. These partnerships are of vital importance for Hollard Moçambique.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your economic outlook for Peru for 2015?</h4><p>I think we will have a better year than 2014, especially in terms of improvement in GDP. At the beginning of 2014, we anticipated 6% GDP growth but ended up on 2.4%. One of the main reasons was the drop in commodity prices of traditional exports, which represent 75% of Peru's exports. However, I foresee a highly positive 2015, because 2014 was also a tough year for sectors such as mining, manufacturing, and fisheries. In the latter, we expect two peak moments in terms of exports throughout 2015. Peru faces the challenge of becoming more competitive and diversifying its economy and industry, and we must also become more dynamic with our traditional and non-traditional exports. In my opinion, GDP growth for 2015 will register at around 4%. That will be difficult to achieve, but tax incentives, public expenditure, and non-traditional exports can help to reach the goal. Moreover, the rapidness with which we implement such actions and strategies will drive our growth this year. Overall, I am positive for 2015 and 2016 and I anticipate fast growth in the second half of the year, despite 2016 being an electoral year. We also need to put this in context, because 2015 is a difficult year for Latin America in general, with Brazil experiencing slow growth rates and many other countries hit by scandals or low oil and commodity prices. Latin America is expected to register 1.3% growth for 2015. Oil and mineral prices will have an impact on the region's economy and their development. In this context, Peru is a leading regional copper exporter and, in two years time will become a more powerful international exporter. We are a country with vast reserves of tin, silver, zinc, and gold. Each of these metals has particular behavior trends and that has an impact on our economy. Over the past couple of years, Peru has seen high levels of investment in the mining industry and this trend will continue with projects such as Tia Maria. We will shortly start seeing the results of such investments. We expect the US to have a strong economy through 2015 and 2016, which should drive up demand again, especially for Peruvian copper. Our challenge here is to provide the volumes needed, as well to better control cash costs. On the other hand, energy costs in Peru are 50% lower than in Chile, for example, and labor costs are 20% to 40% less expensive. These are two of Peru's competitive advantages. Nevertheless, our rugged geography makes transport costs higher. Overall, we have certain efficiencies and advantages, but at the same time inefficiencies based on infrastructure and transport, which need to be tackled and improved over the next two years.</p><h4>In terms of infrastructure, how would you assess the overall development of the economy?</h4><p>The Association for the Promotion of National Infrastructure has calculated the infrastructure gap in the country to be approximately $87 billion. This includes all types of infrastructure, but the main problem has to do with road infrastructure. This sector has notable potential and has been labeled as a strategic one. However, we have to be more dynamic and provide investors with more advantageous conditions. Peru should be completing infrastructure projects every year at a rate of $15 billion in order to close this gap faster. However, we need to assess the capabilities of the government and the industry, bureaucracy for investors, and so on. We need to evolve to meet our potential. For example, we need to build bridges between the public and private sectors. The development of this sector will boost other strategic sectors for the country.</p><div class="quote">“I think the country offers macroeconomic and political stability."</div><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Peru as an investment destination?</h4><p>I think the country offers macroeconomic and political stability, and it has a favorable business environment for foreign investors. There are certain issues that need to be addressed such as bureaucracy and the licensing process. We need more outreach toward foreign investors, too, because many only get to find out about our culture and our particularities once already here.</p><h4>What is Peru's potential for boosting exports?</h4><p>Agriculture has huge potential. In fact, agricultural exports increased by 19% between 2013 and 2014, reaching $5 billion. For 2015, we expect them to reach $7 billion, which is on par with Chile's 2014 output. Agriculture is attractive for foreign investors as well. Peru has vast amounts of prime agricultural land all over the country that has the capacity to boost agribusiness. However, investors need to know how to be selective. I think retail and poultry are two sectors of huge potential for investment and export. Tourism also has great potential. However, I think we need to boost cooperation between the public and private sectors; there should be a national agenda, with key projects for the country realized in conjunction.</p><h4>How will the Peruvian sol perform over the coming years?</h4><p>It is not easy to make a solid prediction, but if pushed for an answer I would say that the sol would continue to devalue because the US economy is growing and the dollar is getting stronger. The challenge is to strike a balance between these currencies that benefits both importers and exporters. I talk about the US and the dollar, because they play a key role in our economy. In 2008, Peru had 52% of its economy dollarized. Today, this figure has decreased to 38% and the government wants to further reduce it to 33%. This renders our economy more attractive in the international arena. In general terms, think the country will become stronger with the further de-dollarization of our economy, especially it is done gradually. In my opinion, the secret for success is that changes are gradual and sensitive to economic realities.</p><h4>What are your 2015 expectations for Ernest &amp; Young?</h4><p>We are the leading business services company in Peru, and we are thankful for the trust of our clients. Our challenge is to continue growing and to develop an enterprise of knowledge in the areas in which we operate; audit, consultancy, taxes, and corporate finances. We develop business guides that provide technical knowledge for those needing it. We also have teaching tools and initiatives in place with workshops, round tables, and university courses. Our aim is to be close to businessmen at the moment when they need us the most. Our growth over the past few years has been 3 to 4 times the rate of the Peruvian economy, which is our economic segment standard and in 2015 growth will continue at this level.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the strategic importance of your recent KlimaPlus acquisition?</h4><p>The air conditioner market in Turkey is expected to continue growing year by year. There is especially high demand in inverter air conditioner equipment, a demand that has grown with the new energy regulations that came into effect in January 2014, which promotes the use of inverter air conditioning rather than standard air conditioners. The company formerly known as KlimaPlus was our sole distributor in Turkey for 10 years. As of July 2014, KlimaPlus is continuing operations as Mitsubishi Electric. KlimaPlus was a reliable and successful Turkish company that offered a very high quality of customer service and this was very important for us. Our objective is to further strengthen our position in the Turkish air conditioning market and KlimaPlus's expertise in the local market will prove a very valuable asset for us.</p><h4>How do you attract, retain, and develop capital in Turkey?</h4><p>We serve major companies and institutions in the Turkish industrial sector through our factory automation systems. Mitsubishi Electric Turkey Factory Automation Systems offers services for leading industrial enterprises in many sectors including the automotive, food, packaging, metal, processing machinery, and the PVC processing machinery sectors. Main products in factory automation are programmable control devices, speed regulators for alternate current engines, human-machine interfaces, servomotors, motion controllers, low-voltage switch-gear products, and industrial robots. Mitsubishi Electric offers high-quality services to Turkish industry by combining its products with the design, projecting, software and commissioning activities of Turkish engineers employed by Mitsubishi Electric Turkey. In terms of air conditioning systems, we've sold and supplied products to Turkey's leading banks, hotels, education and health institutions, business centers, transport terminals, and residential complexes. Our durable, energy-efficient, high-performance, top-quality air conditioning systems and engineering services serve all individual and corporate needs. These are all done with Turkish manpower. We have roundly 200 employees in Turkey. Our philosophy is to contribute to the enrichment of society through technology and we follow this same philosophy in Turkey. Being in Turkey is very exciting for us and we see a lot of potential here. As a global high-tech company, we aim to add value to Turkey's economy and we want to transfer our knowledge and technology expertise to contribute to Turkey's 2023 vision. As we increase our presence and market share in Turkey, we will also increase the amount of jobs we create in the country. Let me add that Turks are very skilled and dedicated employees, and they produce top-quality work. That's really one of the reasons why we're here.</p><div class="quote">“Turkey is a fast-growing market with strong demand for high-tech products."</div><h4>How receptive do you think Turkey is to your innovations?</h4><p>Turkey is very open to new technologies and very receptive to high-technology products and systems, especially considering how young the population is. So we think Turkish industry will continue its rapid growth and that demand for factory automation systems and energy saving technologies will continue to grow as a result. Mitsubishi Electric has the technologies to meet these challenges.</p><h4>How would you assess Turkey's importance for Mitsubishi Electric?</h4><p>Turkey is a fast-growing market with strong demand for high-tech products and a young population. Our aim has been to expand our operations in Turkey. As Mitsubishi Electric, we believe Turkey is at a pivotal point in its history and will become even more productive in the coming years, both industrially and technologically. It will produce far more value added goods and will take its place among the advanced economies of the world. This is attested to by Turkey's ongoing investment in major projects like Marmaray, the second Bosphorus tunnel for vehicles, and various dam, bridge, and tunnel projects across Turkey. We believe in Turkey's energy and strength. With our energy-efficient, innovative, and environmentally friendly products, Mitsubishi Electric Turkey will contribute to the development and growth of Turkey and continue to invest in the future of this country. We can also not ignore Turkey's geopolitical position, its young population, and its potential for quick and sustained growth. We believe Turkey will continue to develop and grow rapidly. That's why this country is a priority market for us. We also believe Mitsubishi Electric will come to be much appreciated in Turkey.</p><h4>What are Mitsubishi Electric's future plans for Turkey, and what is your outlook for the next two years?</h4><p>We can say that we have more than achieved all of the objectives we set ourselves in the Turkish market in the short span of time that we've been here since 2012. Our priority now is to expand our factory automation services and provide high-quality technological products with which to help Turkish industry grow and develop further. The integration of Mitsubishi Electric Air Conditioning Systems' activities is a major step that will further provide important opportunities in the market. Mitsubishi Electric has shown very strong growth in Turkey over the last few years. We expect a turnover of TL270 million in 2015. As Turkey grows, we too will grow in parallel with it.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The modernization of public sector administration has been at the top of the government's priorities in recent years. How would you assess the progress made by MAMPU?</h4><p>We have done a lot. In fact, many ministries and agencies are not as up-to-date as we would like in terms of what we are entering and producing. But many agencies and ministries are also receiving our ideas very well. For example, one of the things that we have introduced is online exams. We used to have to organize different centers throughout Malaysia for public examinations for people who applied for jobs in the public service, even if sometimes there were just a few applicants. That was very taxing in terms of human resources, time, and money. But now we are going 100% online. So we organize examinations online, and on certain days people anywhere who have access to the internet can take part, and the questions are structured that they will not be able to cheat. We don't have to send supervisors; we know that there will be some verification questions during the follow-up face-to-face interview. I have heard that a country in Europe has wanted to do the same thing, but they have been having problems with the security aspects. Another ASEAN country that wants to do this is Brunei. They're coming here to learn from us. This has been a very successful project. The other thing that we are doing is introducing big data. Another is the One Malaysia One Call Centre (1MOCC), and also the One Malaysia Training Centre (1MTC). This has really enabled us to improve quality, reduce costs, and increase the efficiency of the public service. For example, at the 1MTC, we put all the various facilities available throughout the country onto one website. Anybody who wants to organize a function, whether it's a wedding, seminar, conference, or whatever, they just go there. They look at what the equipment they need. If they cannot find it, they inform us about what they need. Then we help them to source out where they can have it. It's very cheap compared to hotels. We save a lot of money, but not only that; whatever facilities we have under utilized in the past are now being fully utilized, using the 1MTC System. 1MOCC is a system for the public to call just one number and they can ask any question. Our trained receptionists will answer or direct that call to the relevant agencies. There have been many other things we have been introducing under the public service system transformation program.</p><h4>What is the current percentage of government services available online and what is being done to improve the quality of these services?</h4><p>We have 70% of our services online. Due to financial constraints, some agencies could not participate in what we proposed because they have other priorities. In some cases, what they have now in terms of what they are doing cannot fit into our proposed system and they will have to make adjustments later on. We will give them one or two years to change their system before they can migrate to our system. Those are some of the not-so-major constraints, but it does delay the 100% target that we set.</p><div class="quote">“We have tried our best to help in terms of providing free tablets and laptops."</div><h4>Other countries have approached Malaysia to learn from its civil service sector and public administration. What can other countries learn from Malaysia?</h4><p>If the developing countries can follow what we do in Malaysia, I would be very proud. We have the Government Transformation Programme (GTP). We have the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP). We have the Political Transformation Programme (PTP). The various transformations that we have introduced have been very well received. So much so that the United Nations has recommended that other countries that want to transform their government, their economic development, their physical development, and political system copy Malaysia as a model. One country has done that; Tanzania. One of our top officers in charge of all this transformation has been invited to more or less assist the government of Tanzania to introduce a similar transformation. From what they learn about ours, they will make some adaptations depending on the circumstances that they have there, because each country has different scenarios. Then one of the states in India is also trying to learn about what we have done here. Harvard is using one of our transformation programs as a case study. That is how unique our transformation program is. Our rankings improved, in ease of doing business, and in the various indices have increased. Wherever the public thinks we have not been transparent enough, we try to figure out what they want in terms of transparency. We try to comply. Of course there are many areas where we cannot be totally transparent, for example in terms of military secrets and so on. But other than those, we have been progressing a lot. In the past we had a tender system, for example, where things were very much not publicized and now tenders and projects are very much open; they are put online for people to access. Of course there are some very special projects, such as high-tech projects that only very specific companies can do, where you cannot have an open tender, or having an open tender is just wasting time. The first thing that people have to understand if they want to learn from what Malaysia is doing is that Malaysia is very committed. It must not just be a publicity stunt. The commitment must be there. Of course one advantage we have in terms of giving the commitment is that from independence until today the continuity in terms of leadership has been very smooth. Otherwise, a new government that takes over from a previous government may have a different agenda. Sometimes, having one government ruling for decades and decades may not work well for some countries, but in the case of Malaysia we have no regrets.</p><h4>MAMPU is working with the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDeC) on developing Malaysia's Big Data Framework. Could you elaborate on this?</h4><p>We need to synchronize everything. Data is everywhere but we need to congregate it under one big center. So when you want to do research, for example, you just have to go into one place and get the information from there. We have to understand how big data works, otherwise we will miss many  things.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges that you expect to face in the coming years in terms of improving public sector delivery?</h4><p>Being a developing country that aspires to be a developed country in the next five to six years, we are short of scientists in the field of ICT. We are still looking for scientists who really understand all these things and take the lead. Another is that a large part of Malaysia is rural. Those who are lagging behind in terms of ICT knowledge pose a big challenge. We would like the rural people to benefit a lot from this modernization. We have tried our best to help in terms of providing free tablets and laptops and we spend hundreds of millions on that. We have programs by the government's Malaysia Communications and Multimedia Commission. The government also gets contributions from the various ICT companies and then politicians suggest where we think the funds should go. These are some of the efforts that we have made.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2015?</h4><p>We are very much focused on big data and open data. We have several phases. The first is done already but we have a problem with the second phase. The first cannot be utilized without the second, so the government has to provide money for the next phase. Completing this will be our priority. But a lot of things have improved. I am proud to be part of this administration. Our Prime Minister is a very intelligent man.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you talk about the performance of PROBIOMED® in 2014?</h4><p>PROBIOMED® is a family business and I was brought on board for three objectives. The first was to institutionalize the company and establish corporate governance. My second objective was to expand PROBIOMED® internationally. And the third objective was to continue growing our products' market share, and develop and launch new products. These objectives will carry into 2015. At the end of 2014, the new biotechnology regulation was published, and it is already in effect. Now, my fourth objective is to make sure we comply with it, and by doing so, guarantee high quality biosimilars at low cost.</p><h4>What is your perspective on the new regulations on biotech medicines in Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico has made remarkable progress from a regulatory standpoint within a short time. COFEPRIS, led by Commissioner Mikel Arriola, was recently recognized as a regulatory agency of reference in Latin America. Today, many Latin American countries recognize Mexican regulatory approvals and supporting documentation, thus reducing time-to-entry into these markets. COFEPRIS was able to obtain PAHO certification for pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals as well as WHO certification for vaccines, thus positioning it as a strong regulatory agency worldwide. The latest biotechnology/biosimilars regulation (NOM 257) is of note. It is already a benchmark in Latin America and I would dare to say it is close to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulation. Companies that manage to comply with these new regulatory requirements will have met high standards for their products. With the new NOM 257, innovative biopharmaceuticals and biosimilars will coexist in the Mexican healthcare system, while ensuring product efficacy and patient safety. Prior to this new regulatory framework for biosimilars, around 65 products were registered as generic drugs and the quality and safety requirements were not as strict. The new norm requires characterization and biocomparability studies, as well as safety and efficacy trials that altogether will have to demonstrate their similarity to reference products. The previous regulation was more flexible in all aspects, and today we have moved from one extreme to the other, significantly raising the bar on requirements. At PROBIOMED® we fully believe in this approach. However, the country is still not fully ready for this in terms of infrastructure. To give you an example; if a full characterization study is required for approval, there is no local supplier in Mexico that can do this. We need to outsource it from abroad. Mexico still needs to develop its infrastructure capabilities in the area of biotechnology, and that will take time.</p><div class="quote">“Our expectations for 2015 are compliance with the new regulation."</div><h4>How do you expect the national pharmaceutical industry to perform over the coming years?</h4><p>I expect it to grow in a number of ways, initially because of demographics; the population is aging and chronic degenerative diseases are now more common than infectious diseases, which means that people have more comorbidities and are treated for longer periods of time, with more expensive and complicated drugs such as biotechnology drugs that have significant budget and cost implications. The second trend is that patients are opting for public hospitals over private counterparts because of the cost of treatment. Many chronic diseases are treated with biotechnology products, which are more expensive. The third trend will see many more biotechnology products because of the types of diseases we are looking at today. The biotechnology industry will continue to see double-digit growth. Today this segment grows at approximately a 25% annual rate. In early 2000, 1/10 NDAs submitted to the FDA were biotech drugs. Today the number is 7/10, and will only increase. PROBIOMED® is fully committed to becoming a strong player in this segment internationally. Product development time to market and international expansion will be the name of our game. We aim to be the Mexican biopharmaceutical company for the world. PROBIOMED® manufactures from the gene to the finished medicine with a strong innovation in the development process, and has a bar-none value proposition. Governments are aiming to reduce costs and are in search of company offerings like ours. The fact that we are fully integrated helps our cost structure and evidently gives us control of the quality from gene to drug. Innovator companies, on the other hand, import finished biotechnology products and local companies either import API and only do fill and finish in Mexico, or else they also import finished products. Ultimately, it all impacts either cost, quality, or both. Moreover, multinational innovator companies are suffering the patent cliff in a cost containment environment. Companies like ours are poised to continue growing, whereas others will see a decrease in their sales/share.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2015?</h4><p>Our expectations for 2015 are compliance with the new regulation. First though, we must meet our 2015 sales forecast. Secondly, we will comply with the new regulatory requirements throughout our biotechnology portfolio. Today, the entire company is committed to ensuring that. We are working closely with COFEPRIS to make sure we meet all requirements, but this clearly represents a colossal investment of time, money, and resources. We will succeed in this endeavor. Thirdly, we will pursue global expansion. PROBIOMED® is in the right place and at the right time to start exporting. With COFEPRIS' international recognition, it will be easier for Mexican companies to enter markets in Latin America. PROBIOMED®'s value proposition—to provide high quality products at low cost—is exactly what governments and patients are looking for. We are currently exporting to 14 countries on four continents and are planning to further expand to countries that urgently need these products, thus making our products available and accessible. We will also open a new manufacturing plant to meet future international demand, notwithstanding the fact that there are limited incentives in Mexico for this industry.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Wide Range]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-wide-range]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you outline the history and objectives of Procapitales?</h4><p><span></span>Procapitales was founded almost 14 years ago by a group of professionals from different institutions involved to some extent with capital market issues. The underlying idea was to establish a sort of trade association for this type of institution so as to jointly develop a stronger capital market practice. Back then, banks were by far the prevalent source of financing, while capital market alternatives were almost non-existent. Moreover, financing predominantly consisted of short-run and dollar-denominated alternatives. We identified that a major drive was necessary to foster capital development based on a consistent effort from the private sector, but interacting with governmental authorities. Thus, the aim was to have the organization work closely with our regulator so as to develop the Peruvian capital markets. The initial stages were not easy, but nowadays, Procapitales comprises 70 institutions. But more important than that figure is the fact that it comprises a wide range of institutions by its nature, from security issuers to institutional investors, including brokers, investment banks, law firms, and others. In this sense, to the best of our knowledge, there is no other similar trade association in Latin America, or perhaps in the world, comprising these diverse institutions under one roof. Their common interest is a well developed capital market, and Procapitales constitutes a permanent institutional platform to boost initiatives regarding the legal, institutional, and operational settings to achieve that objective. In this framework, and referring to Procapitales' track record, I should emphasize the role that our association has been playing in order to promote good corporate governance practices within the Peruvian business sector. From our inception, we have been committed to disseminating the importance of transparency and accountability as a key foundation of more developed capital markets. We are proud to assert that Procapitales has played a major role in this area. Firstly, we actively participated in shaping the corporate governance code issued in 2002 and also in its updating in 2012-2013, along with the sector regulator—formerly Conasev, and today SMV—and other trade associations and market institutions. Secondly, we have been participating within a World Bank-supported Latin American network of peer institutions that promote good corporate governance throughout the region and Procapitales is now playing the role of chairing this network. And, more recently, we are stepping into the establishment of the Peruvian Institute of Corporate Governance, which is a joint venture with Confiep. Some time ago we approached Confiep in order to support this common project, and finally, it seems to be underway. We expect to receive funding from multilateral organizations.</p><h4>What can be done to increase the efficacy of the securities market as a source capital for companies operating in Peru?</h4><p>Despite the securities market having grown over the past 15 years or so, the number of instruments available remains quite limited and is unable to accommodate the consistent expansion of funds administered by major institutional investors. Thus, an imbalance with respect to demand is remarkable. Moreover, the market is heavily concentrated around a few issuers. As far as the secondary markets are concerned, over the past few years daily traded volumes have decreased sharply to the current level of about $10 million. This lower level of trade heavily reflects domestic structural conditions, particularly the lack of liquidity and deepening of the domestic securities market. Within this framework, in recent years some efforts have been made to face these constraints by means of a reform process. Thus, some legal and regulatory initiatives have been approved in order to promote the issue of securities on the basis of more flexible requirements. In this regard, it is worthwhile mentioning the creation of a new segment, the Mercado Alternativo de Valores, to facilitate access to the capital markets for medium-sized firms as well as the creation of a special regime for IPOs focused exclusively on institutional investors. Seeking to promote liquidity in the market, some administrative decisions have been implemented to lower transaction costs. Another initiative that may be helpful is the expected consolidation of the Latin American Integrated Market (MILA), because this enlarged market should lead to a surge of new investment products. Finally, something should be done in the tax arena, so as to homogenize tax regimes applicable to capital market operations among MILA-participating countries.</p><div class="quote">“This industry has emerged and expanded both in terms of managing firms and assets under management."</div><h4>There is a lot of movement in bond markets internationally right now because of the end of quantitative easing and changes in monetary policy in Europe and Japan. How does Procapitales interact with that environment and where do you see room for improvement in the Peruvian bond atmosphere?</h4><p>In effect, in the last few years, a growing number of Peruvian corporations has had access to global capital markets, by issuing both debt instruments under the SEC's 144-A Rule and equity instruments (ADR) in NYSE, which have allowed the involved corporations to take advantage of historically low interest rates, thereby reducing financing costs. While the prospects of this kind of deals heavily depend on future scenarios on the international financial markets, we foresee there will still be significant opportunities in the near future provided their associated risks are managed properly, particularly exchange-rate risks. Several of these corporations are Procapitales members and their experiences have been disseminated by means of our institutional platform seeking to contribute with learned lessons for the benefit of the whole market. We strongly believe that to the extent the liquidity and tax conditions be more favourable in our domestic market, the debt market and also equity market should react in creating a supply of instruments suitable to accommodate growing demand for instruments.</p><h4>How have private equity investors altered the trajectory of medium-sized businesses?</h4><p>This industry has emerged and expanded both in terms of managing firms and assets under management. In addition, a wider range of economic sectors is being reached by these investment vehicles, such as health or education to name a couple. Also, the presence of foreign investment fund management firms is growing and they are seeking to invest in local firms with growth potential. But there is still much room to progress and this may constitute a key vehicle to inject not only capital, but also improved management and good corporate governance.</p><h4>Where do you see the regulatory environment two to three years from now?</h4><p>We basically see a regulatory environment playing a role of facilitator so as to have more issuers, more investible instruments, more liquidity, more transparency, and more investors. In sum, a more developed and an increasingly sophisticated market. Bearing this in mind, we have seen the need to shape a new vision for Procapitales in order to properly accompany these efforts. To do so, we have developed a medium-term strategic plan for Procapitales, with the support of internationally recognized consultancy firm, Deloitte. We have defined a revised mission and a number of strategic objectives with which to face the challenges that future capital market developments will pose.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What efforts is the Municipal Council taking to restore Beirut's reputation and attract more foreign visitors?</h4><p>First of all, we shall be publishing a book about what we have achieved up to date, what we are trying to achieve, and what the plans are for the future. People still think of Beirut as a magical city for tourism. It is a beautiful city in terms of both modernization and heritage. Since I became Mayor, the Council set up huge infrastructure projects to upgrade the storm water and waste water systems so that Beirut's streets will never flood with storm or rainwater. Beirut is beautiful by nature with great weather, excellent restaurants, good nightlife, and modern highways and streets—tourists just love it. This is why it was recently voted among the seven wonder cities of the world. We invest $20 million a year on different maintenance contracts including infrastructure systems, pavements, sidewalks, lighting, and green spaces. Moreover, and since I became Mayor, the maintenance of downtown Beirut has become the responsibility of the Municipality. Our city's infrastructure endures considerable wear and tear as one-third of Lebanon's population resides in Beirut. It is a city of one million cars, and our streets, highways, and sidewalks are abused. That is why we always have to keep up with maintenance. I like my city to be an image of a beautiful modern city with a strong heritage, which is a place for both visitors and the Lebanese people to enjoy visiting and investing in.</p><h4>What is the importance of public-private partnerships (PPP) for the sustainable development of Beirut?</h4><p>The role of PPPs is tremendous. Many industry leaders have come together to invest in Beirut's future, and have donated to the city. This is one important route where we can bridge over the routine of bid rounds and the bureaucracy of the public sector. We approve donations of the private sector as long as they are unconditional. One example of successful PPP stories is the Rene Muawwad (Sanayeh) garden, where we partnered with Zeina Majdalani, the landscape designer, to put our dreams and ideas on paper and, with Azadea, to execute the works. Look at the garden today; it is one of the most beautiful and well-maintained areas in the country. The Council is also partnering with St. Joseph University to start the rehabilitation of the St. Nicolas garden facing St. Nicolas church in Achrafieh. Another gift to Beirut was Horsh Beirut Master Plan, provided by Raed Abillamaa. This project will include an amphitheater, a jogging track, biking track, bathrooms, benches, and other facilities. Apave is preparing the tender documents for us so that we can start the bidding process to commission a private firm for the execution of the master plan as well as conducting the management, maintenance, and the security of the 300,000 sqm lung of Beirut. It is our ambition to finish the works and have the Horsh open to the public in 2016. Other PPP projects include the designs of Sioufi and Karantina gardens. The execution of rehabilitation works on these two gardens will hopefully start in 2015.</p><div class="quote">“The role of PPPs is tremendous."</div><h4>Beirut is no stranger to challenges related to traffic congestion and the lack of parking spaces. How does the Municipality work to boost the efficiency of the urban transport system and reduce traffic congestion?</h4><p>There are three main reasons for traffic jams in Beirut. First is the lack of a decent and punctual public transport system. Beirut receives more than 250,000 cars every morning and these cars leave in the evening. That is why there are traffic jams every morning at the 12 entrances to Beirut, and then every evening at all of the exits from Beirut. Everybody wants to come in his or her car to Beirut for work or leisure. The average number of people in each car on the streets of Beirut is around 1.5. This is completely unacceptable. If we have a public transport system this will be cut in half. The City has commissioned Team Company, in cooperation with Light Rail Transit Consultants (LRTC) to perform executive studies and to submit a tender file to introduce public transport in the Beirut. The scope of work shall include all the preparatory planning and engineering studies, systems evaluation, sketch designs, and feasibility studies required to launch a design build operation maintain (DBOM) tender for implementing a multimodal public transport system in Beirut. Tender Documents for launching the DBOM tender are the major output that will include the qualifications and conditions to be met by the qualified tenderers. The government needs to construct mega parking lots on the outskirts of Beirut where people can park like everywhere else in the world. Then people can take a bus to enter the city. The executed study shall be compatible with plans to expand public transport to all of greater Beirut. Hopefully, the studies shall be finalized and bidding launched early in 2016. The second reason for traffic congestion on the streets of Beirut is illegal parking. People are double parking and triple parking because we do not have severe law enforcement. If there is no law enforcement, you cannot have order in the city. On top of that there are a huge number of illegal buses and vans on the streets of Beirut from all over the country. To solve the parking crisis in the city, the Council has launched several projects including a huge parking space under the current Municipality stadium in Tarik Jdideh, a parking structure under the Manara sidewalk facing the Ain Mraisseh mosque, parking spaces under a few gardens in Beirut, and parking spaces under a few public schools. One huge project whose studies are completed is the 1,600-car parking structure under Martyr's square in downtown Beirut. A beautiful landscaped area will be established above the parking facilities. Bidding on a BOT basis will soon be launched. We are working on expropriating several lots all over the city to have multi-story parking buildings and this is taking a lot of time due to bureaucracy in the public sector.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main role that King Saud Medical City (KSMC) is fulfilling?</h4><p>It has a long legacy. It was the first referral hospital ever built in Saudi Arabia. Although KSMC has most services, its core competencies are emergency care, trauma, orthopedics, burn, critical care, and dental care. Over the years, KSMC has played the role of safety net for Riyadh. We receive more emergency cases than any hospital in the Kingdom. Many of us were born here, including myself. For many years, most medical students in Riyadh had rotated at KSMC. It is very busy and students love that. KSMC is a main referral hospital for the Ministry of Health. Last year, 50% of acute care referrals within the Riyadh region came to KSMC. What we are trying to accomplish now is to be part of an integrated health system. KSMC and King Fahad Medical City are integrating to complement each other.</p><h4>What are some of the centers of excellence that you focus on here?</h4><p>Number one is trauma. KSMC aims to become a top level trauma center in the next 2-3 years. A lot of effort is being put into this project through a number of initiatives. One of them is building tower number three, which focuses on trauma and surgery. We have a large fund to build a state-of-the-art surgery and trauma center that is going to be built on a new plot of land we have recently acquired west of KSMC. We are heavily investing in training young Saudis in the best centers around the world and we are collaborating with a number of international partners in the US, the UK, Australia, and Canada to help us in training and transferring skills and knowledge. The second center of excellence is orthopedics. We probably have the biggest orthopedics service in the region. We have about 120 orthopedics beds. It is quite busy. Again, we are trying to develop orthopedics by bringing in new skills, upgrading services, and reaching out to the community in better ways. Number three is burns. We own one of the few burn centers in the Riyadh region. It is the biggest one and we are investing more and more into burn care. Our fourth center of excellence is the dental center. We provide comprehensive dental care and maxillofacial surgery free of charge for Saudis. The fifth center of excellence is critical care. We have a total of 150 critical care beds, the most in the Kingdom with a dedicated 40 beds for trauma ICU.</p><div class="quote">“KSMC aims to become a top level trauma center in the next 2-3 years."</div><h4>Can you talk about your expansion plans?</h4><p>This is very exciting. We are going to expand from 1,200 beds to 2,000 beds in seven year's time. Tower number two should be operating in six months. It will be a women and children's hospital. That will be really wonderful news for the community we serve because our current facility is very old. Tower Number three will be for surgery and trauma and it will have a large burn unit. Other new projects that will commence in the next 12-24 months are a 200-clinic dental center, a 300-clinic ambulatory center, and a parking building.</p><h4>What are some of the main challenges for hospitals in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>A shortage of skilled professionals is the number one challenge everywhere in the Kingdom. Number two is the lack of integration in our healthcare system. Our patients suffer because of a lack of integration. No hospital could provide excellent care in all specialties. Today, there are 275 hospitals operated by the Ministry and there will be another 100-150 hospitals commissioned in the next five to six years. How are we going to operate all these new hospitals when most current hospitals are suffering from the lack of a skilled workforce? I strongly believe that the answer is in integration and sharing resources. Skilled professionals that are difficult to find should have privileges in more than one hospital. In other words, we should create multiple integrated health systems. We have started integrating with King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) and we have agreed that there will be services that will expand at KFMC and others that will expand at KSMC but they will complement each other. For example, if we diagnose a case of cancer, it will be referred smoothly to KFMC while trauma or burn case will be transferred to us.</p><h4>What role do private hospitals play?</h4><p>The private health sector is gaining market share very quickly for a number of reasons, mainly due to new medical insurance policies. All non-Saudis must have a medical insurance. Furthermore, the percentage of Saudis who have private medical insurance is on the rise. As you know, some of the big privately owned health systems have gone public. Not long ago, it was really unusual for a skilled Saudi professional to take a full-time job at a private hospital. That was considered an insecure job and not challenging enough. Now, it is totally a different story and this is a threat to the stability of public hospitals. I know many skilled Saudi physicians that have left public hospitals in the last one to two years to work full time in private hospitals. The private healthcare sector is offering very attractive packages, while public hospitals are stuck with a non-competitive fixed salary scale. This may be part of a natural progression toward a completely privatized national health system.</p><h4>How do you see the role of public hospitals over the long term?</h4><p>There is still a severe shortage in the number of hospital beds per capita compared to international benchmarks. And so, I think the partnership between the public and private healthcare systems is in the best interest of the community. Public hospitals have definitely not been able to attend to everyone, so having the private sector take a larger role is a good thing. We still have a huge problem with regards to access to care and waiting lists. Our ERs are usually full. Having fewer patients will allow us to improve quality. I believe the hospital of the future will have much more critical-care beds—at least 30% of total beds—with more patient procedures and care being provided as the outpatient level. There will be much more investment in home care to apply the “Hospital in the Home" concept. Future hospitals will integrate and share their skilled professionals. They will focus not only on the healing of the body, but also the mind and soul, by which patient-centered care will be the standard model. At least this is what I hope for.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Trinidad and Tobago's role in global democracy and what steps are being taken to move forward in the international scene?</h4><p>Trinidad and Tobago is at a pivotal point, both globally and hemispherically. Our visitors like the Vice President of the US, the President of the People's Republic of China and Japan's Prime Minister are evidence of this. In terms of global diplomacy, we have always operated according to certain fundamental principles, and been anchored in human rights, peace, security, and democracy. We have attempted to mediate in global affairs wherever we are present and, in that sense, have earned the respect of the global community as a country that takes its position on the basis of fundamental principles that are rooted in international relations. We are also proactive in global issues such as the Arms Trade Treaty. Not only did Trinidad and Tobago participate with other countries like the UK and Australia to make sure that the Treaty was actualized at the UN, but it also offered to host the Secretariat. That decision will be made later this year. We have also been able to secure support from several major groupings including the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States (GRULAC). On the subject of climate change, we have also played a key role. We co-chaired the climate change negotiation with Germany up to December 2014 and are preparing for the upcoming meeting in Paris, which will focus on the agreement. In global diplomacy, we have been very proactive on critical issues, as well as being contemplative on issues of conflict.</p><h4>How do you assess the air traffic links between Trinidad and Tobago and Latin America?</h4><p>I travelled to the Dominican Republic and met with the Foreign Minister to discuss connectivity and how we can partner with Avianca and Caribbean Airlines. Those talks have to be followed up with technical discussions for prospects and possibilities. There was a definite interest expressed by Avianca to consider this option for more direct flights to Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean. Meanwhile, the aviation agreement we are working on is being finalized. And with respect to Colombia, we are working on air connections, and hopefully Caribbean Airlines and Avianca will meet soon to explore commercial viability and logistics. Secondly, the air services agreement should be finalized shortly. That is a specific move with respect to Colombia, but there has been a general feeling that we need to open up more links with Latin America in terms of air transport. Air transport follows trade and the movement of people. It is expected that as trade and travel increase, so too, will air transport financing is expected improve. The Latin American countries have brought this issue to the agenda, and now the commercial and logistics are being worked on. I anticipate that over the next decade this will become a possibility. There was a time when Trinidad was a fueling stop for flights coming from Latin America to North America, but the situation has changed and this historical pattern needs to be revived.</p><div class="quote">“We are very mindful of Ecuador's leading role in UNASUR."</div><h4>Trinidad and Tobago and Ecuador have long enjoyed positive diplomatic relations. What issues have been strengthened over the past few years between both nations?</h4><p>We are very mindful of Ecuador's leading role in UNASUR and the way they have been able to provide leadership in UNASUR. We are not a member, but are constantly apprised of that role. Our relationship to UNASUR and Ecuador is really co-terminus. They are involved in other bodies, but we see them as critical in this respect. They are also an oil producing country and a commercial relationship exists as well as technical exchanges. This is a natural area of cooperation. We have also been trying to mediate with Latin American countries on issues of the OAS, of which Ecuador</p><p>has a definite position. We see no conflict in OAS playing a role in the wider hemisphere. On the diplomatic front, we have been working very closely with Ecuador, especially on issues relating to OAS and CELAC.</p><h4>Trinidad and Tobago is a major exporter of gas and hydrocarbons and has great experience in refinery. In what ways are Trinidad, Tobago, and Ecuador cooperating in the energy sector?</h4><p>The global economy is rapidly changing and there are oil cycles with respect to prices. The idea of jointly pursuing exploration opportunities is something that could be placed on the agenda as we both have expertise in this regard, and in that sense, our firms are also interested in partnering Latin America in this area. The question is whether or not firms can work together in a complimentary fashion.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Trinidad and Tobago economy for 2015 and beyond?</h4><p>Three areas of diversification have been successful in Trinidad, one of which concerns energy itself. We have been able to shift from a monoculture petroleum production economy to one that produces gas, petroleum, petrochemicals, and a number of byproducts. But the energy sector just is one source of diversification. We have also been able to extend the scope of our financial sector, which is now highly diversified and robust, operating in the entire region. The services sector is the third area undergoing diversification. While nascent, it is where we intend to focus in terms of diversification, which includes tourism, financial and IT services—success there has still to be seen. We now have a strong commercial relationship with Panama, which is creating many opportunities, and we will be opening an embassy there this year as we seek to diversify and expand our reach. Trinidad and Tobago's economy is quite solid and stable. The price of oil is always an issue and we are now facing management and risk associated with that. Hopefully, it won't be a protracted cycle. Apart from that, ours is also an economy of potential in the onshore sector, which has performed solidly in terms of its macroeconomic contribution. For some time now, we have been able to maintain relatively low inflation and unemployment rates and a high capital formation with good export potential. Although we still need to do much more beyond the energy sector, I would say the economy has been robust, having withstood the turbulence of 2008. We faced our own local crisis when one of our major insurance companies collapsed creating huge liability, but have since been able to resolve this issue. Trinidad and Tobago has persistently pursued solid macroeconomic policies and in so doing has maintained its high credit rating. But, we do face the same challenges that most countries face when the global economy begins to shake. Trinidad and Tobago cannot be defined by its geographic location, but its economic, diplomatic, and political space. In that sense, it is not a small country. It is a country that is actively engaged in all the affairs around it. We have had candidates in major international bodies. We have had many judges in the International Tribunal Court from Trinidad and Tobago. We have found that the presence of Trinidad and Tobago in international institutions has been acknowledged by the success of our participants.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has the Ministry played in the development of the agricultural sector over recent years?</h4><p>The agricultural sector has become one of the less volatile economic sectors, growing at an average of 4% annually over the past few years. We expect to close 2014 on more moderate 1.5% growth, but there are positive signs pointing to a fast recovery in 2015, with growth of 3% to 3.5%. Non-traditional agricultural exports, as well as the poultry industry, are two of the most dynamic segments within the sector. In terms of growing agricultural exports, there are strong products such as avocados and cinchona, where exports have grown by 70% and 200% YoY, respectively. There are alsoother Andean grains that show highly positive development signs. The private sector has played an important role in the development of the agricultural sector over the past decade, and the Ministry of Agriculture has focused on being a promoter. For example, we introduced the Law on Agricultural Promotion to render exports and labor regulations more flexible, and in doing so, boosted development of the agricultural sector in different regions of the country. This has also meant investments in irrigation and Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs). These PPPs have, so far, focused on 200,000 hectares of wood production with a business plan for the next 10 years. The Ministry has also invested significantly in health and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)—our goal has been to eradicate several diseases affecting livestock and fruits. In this context, the coffee segment has been one of our priorities, and Peruvian coffee exports currently total some $1 billion. Production has been affected over the past couple of years and we have set up a credit line to renew production areas. We also have increased investment ($1 billion for this government's term) to boost small and medium-sized producers' activities and help them with irrigation issues. This plan especially targets producers in mountainous regions.</p><h4>What are some of the other near future priorities for the ministry?</h4><p>The irrigation plan for producers in the mountainous regions is a crucial project. The ministry provides technical support to small and medium-sized producers, as well as support in terms of cooperation such that small producers can combine efforts to make their activities more profitable. Regarding livestock activities, we have as a main focus the promotion and development of alpaca, a type of meat the world has yet to fully discover. We also have plans to reforest some areas of the country for different purposes—wood production and simple reforestation of affected areas. The country has 18 million hectares, seven of which have already been awarded in a concession scheme. We also have 10 million deforested hectares. We currently work on potential credit lines for forestall production, after we developed a regulatory framework for this business activity. All in all, our priorities and investment target infrastructure, credit lines, disease eradication, and the simplification of administrative and bureaucratic processes. In addition, boosting exports is one of our top priorities, and we closely work with the Ministry of Foreign Trade. We take part in international exhibitions and fairs, as well as other promotional activities with the support of Peruvian embassies abroad.</p><div class="quote">“The country is in the process of adapting itself to climate change."</div><h4>What are some of the highlights of the Ministry's activities regarding the protection of the environment?</h4><p>The country is in the process of adapting itself to climate change, especially in the agricultural industry. Peru is not holding back, and is investing heavily in related activities and policies. For example, we invest in large water reservoirs, especially at river headwaters. We also attend to vulnerable communities in the mountains who are affected by extreme weather conditions. Reforestation and agroforestry processes are another aspect of this drive, especially for coffee plantations; yet this also includes rice plantations along the coast, and promoting a change in cultivation and irrigation to foster greater efficiency.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the ban on transgenic products?</h4><p>We are keeping a close eye on transgenic products and evaluating their implications for Peru. So far, they do not seem to be something that would affect Peru in terms of export volumes, because we have a wide variety of export products, and as I mentioned, some with great potential for growth in the near future, such as avocado and cotton. We have several specific projects based on these products that have great potential. Developing these will boost R&amp;D and generate added value to these products. This research is also aimed at reducing the usage of pesticides, and related costs. We have already done a great job with plantations of asparagus, for example, where the usage of high technologies has enabled us to reduce pesticides, optimize production, and become a world leader in this segment. Producers can make more informed decisions based on information derived from these technologies. We do a similar job in the avocado and grapes segments, for example. At the moment, we are looking at new markets for our products and expect important developments in that regard. We have already signed health protocols with countries like China and Japan, with Korea being the next in line. At the moment, we are evaluating a more global strategy for entering the above-mentioned markets, along with Colombia and Ecuador, as a global brand. We have already held some talks in this regard.</p><h4>How do you see the Peruvian agricultural industry over the five years?</h4><p>Agriculture, including forestry, is set to become the second most dynamic sector of the Peruvian economy after mining. It also driving the current government objective of economic diversification. Regarding competitiveness, we will continue improving as long as we continue introducing modern agricultural techniques. Our strategy is to boost cooperation between small and medium-sized producers, and link them to exporting companies. Peru has a true agricultural vocation, and we have a wide range of products and activities thanks to our 85 microclimates, which puts us in a highly favorable position to target foreign markets. I would like to invite foreign investors, whose arrival, since we are an open economy, is a smooth process. Peru has great agricultural potential, and businesses here enjoy a stable economic and political community.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you invest in the training and development of your staff?</h4><p>Everyone here has a part to play, from the administration team to the finance team, in supporting the paramedics and EMTs out on the roads. We have invested quite heavily in training. Our training is specific to our needs and is a major part of our core business. Our training teams cover all areas of basic life support to pediatrics and advanced coronary care. Our trainers are in house and our courses are registered with the Health Authority Abu Dhabi (HAAD) and are scrutinized and accredited. We even have hospitals that are asking us to come and train their staff. Training, for us, is a part of our DNA—it is what we do. Our staff has a tough job to do. They work in shifts. They are exposed to a great deal of trauma; therefore, we provide peer support networks to assist them. It is essential for us that we look after our staff. Our turnover rate for staff is less than 2% over four years, which we are very proud of. We look after our people and we provide competitive compensation and benefits. The Clinical Medical Education training we provide is a best practice. I frequently receive feedback from staff who say that if they were back in their previous country they would have to pay for their training or just never get access to it.</p><h4>How has your fleet grown over the years, and how are you looking to develop it further?</h4><p>Our fleet has increased over the past four years to just over 100 vehicles. Ahmed Al Hajeri led the design of the vehicles so they would meet the demands of the environment we work in. The fleet is deployed across the UAE. The largest public deployment of our ambulances is in the Northern Emirates. We are providing a basic life support service in the Northern Emirates with 24 ambulances operating 24/7. We have invested in brand new ambulances based on the Mercedes-Benz 324 chassis, which is a reliable frame for this type of service. We get them sent directly from Germany to our Ambulance converter in the UK, and then we ship them here. The Northern Emirates has the most advanced ambulance fleet in the Middle East. We are currently in Phase I of this project. In Phase II, we will add more vehicles and crew.</p><div class="quote">“Our fleet has increased over the past four years to just over 100 vehicles."</div><h4>How successful has the service been in the Northern Emirates?</h4><p>We are very proud of the way in which the service has been received in the Northern Emirates. The response by the community has been overwhelmingly positive. Our staff are co-located with the staff from other emergency services. When we are dealing with multiple casualty incidents this training makes them more effective when getting to and treating patients. Perhaps the greatest form of recognition for the work of our team has come from HH Sheikh Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Ajman, who has allocated a plot of land for constructing the Northern Emirates headquarters in Ajman.</p><h4>What sort of operational model do you implement at National Ambulance?</h4><p>There are two different models. The Franco-German model is where a doctor is part of the ambulance crew, and they go from the hospital to the patient and back. What we provide is an Anglo-American model of service where we have emergency medical technicians and paramedics as the team go to the patient and take them to the most appropriate hospital; that is the model that works best here. EMTs have a scope of practice that allows them to provide basic life support skills, while paramedics have a more advanced scope of practice that allows them to provide additional interventions and provide advanced life support.</p><h4>What sort of technology do you use to enhance efficiency and reduce response times?</h4><p>Response times are one metric that is often used when people look at Ambulance services. It's important that patients received the most appropriate level of care as quickly as possible. In the Northern Emirates we are continuing to improve our response times. As our fleet increases this will allow more ambulances to be deployed in the area. In terms of technology, we use computer-aided dispatch. One of the challenges here in the UAE, and something people take for granted in the US, for example, is that you can pick up the phone and order something and get all the information through the call line number identification. That system is being rolled out progressively in Abu Dhabi and Dubai and will eventually be rolled out in the rest of the UAE. Internally we have developed systems that allow us to locate someone quickly. We will continue to refine this process and look for ways to move resources as quickly as possible to patients. We leverage technologies from all over the world. We have a local company as our system integrator and use Google map databases, the King County Criteria Based Dispatch system for triage, and our Computer Aided dispatch system was developed by a regional company. We have also implemented a pre-alert system that allows our dispatchers to advise a receiving hospital if a serious injury is coming to their emergency department. This pre-alert allows the doctors to make appropriate arrangements prior to the patient arriving. The alert system has been well received by the hospitals in the Northern Emirates. The development of an Electronic Patient Care Record (EPCR), which we are using in the Northern Emirates, is an example of how we are leveraging technology and bringing best practices to the UAE.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4> How would you assess the nature of diplomatic relations between Kazakhstan and Italy?</h4><p>Italy and Kazakhstan, since the dawn of independence, have always been excellent partners, both in political and economic terms. The opening of our diplomatic relations immediately after the declaration of independence, the fact that Italy was the first EU Member to locate its embassy in the nation's new capital, and the number of fruitful meetings between our leaders—among which the last discussion held between Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and President Nazarbayev was last October—proves that our ties go beyond daily relations. Prime Minister Renzi and President Nazarbayev have entrusted us with the task of re-launching and deepening those excellent bilateral relations. A first step in this direction was the notable Italian business mission to Almaty and Astana last November, with over 120 participants belonging to strategic sectors of our partnership, such as clothing, agro-industry, infrastructure, and construction materials.</p><h4>Italy is a strategic economic partner for Kazakhstan, accounting for 13% of the country's total foreign trade turnover. What sectors of Kazakhstan's economy are particularly appealing for Italian companies?</h4><p>Economic and commercial relations are excellent in terms of numbers. From a commercial point of view, in 2013 Italy was the fifth client and eighth supplier of Kazakhstan. At the European level, Italy is the second trade partner of the country. Clothing, agro-industry, infrastructure, and construction materials, the selected sectors for November's mission, are among the most promising ones for the development of bilateral relations, given the strong appreciation for made in Italy products, the growing purchasing power of the population, as well as the several infrastructure projects launched by the Kazakhstani government. However, energy, the traditional sector of greatest bilateral cooperation, continues to offer lucrative opportunities to our companies. Other highly promising sectors are those of machinery and construction materials. Finally, interesting opportunities exist in the green economy and high-efficiency technologies, also in view of Expo 2017, the slogan of which is “ Future Energy." The event will be dedicated to the development of energy-sustainable and responsible policies and technologies.</p><h4>What advantages does Kazakhstan offer Italian investors?</h4><p>Beside the advantageous conditions provided for by the law on investment attraction and the decision to lift visa requirements for countries like Italy, Kazakhstan offers many other opportunities. It is a country growing at high rates of between 4% and 5%, and also has huge reserves, an important public investment program in infrastructure (road and rail networks, port on the Caspian sea, airports modernization), and new technologies (including renewable), and has seen its per capita GDP grow to significant levels. Kazakhstan, moreover, belongs—along with the Russian Federation and Belarus—to the Eurasian Customs Union, with a market capacity of about 170 million people, opening perspectives for investment in Kazakhstan as a hub for other Member Countries.</p><div class="quote">“Economic and commercial relations are excellent in terms of numbers."</div><h4>You recently led a business delegation to Kazakhstan. What are the highlights and achievements that characterize this event?</h4><p>Many opportunities have arisen during the B2B meeting between entrepreneurs in the course of the recent business mission. With governmental counterparts we have jointly decided to draft a cooperation program for the short and medium term, with precise and verifiable objectives. For this, an important moment will be the Joint Economic Commission in early 2015.</p><h4>What will be the focus of bilateral relations over the medium term?</h4><p>During the above-mentioned Joint Economic Commission, we will have the chance to define the main economic and trade issues, with a focus on enhancing the respective enlargement of investment, profiting from the highly promising opportunities offered by new Kazakh legislation on FDI, and the potential assured by several Italian sectors. Lastly, Expo 2017 will certainly give Italian companies another excellent opportunity to increase their presence what the highly promising Kazakhstani market, and the entire Customs Union area.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do international events facilitate the attraction of FDI?</h4><p>Over the past few years, Azerbaijan has turned into a host for many international events. Every year, we organize various international business and investment forums, sporting events, music contests, and international trade exhibitions. In a competitive world, these events are an important means of raising the profile and awareness of Azerbaijan among key business decision makers. The portfolio of events to be held in Azerbaijan confirms that our country has the necessary attributes to attract FDI in non-oil sectors. Our hosting of the World Economic Forum 2013 in Baku is evidence of our sincerity to offer an attractive business environment. Although we are a young country with only 24 years of independence, the hosting of the first European Games will put Azerbaijan in the exclusive company of countries that have hosted a complex event such as the Olympics. Additionally, the forthcoming Asian Development Bank AGM in May 2015 will be held in Baku, with 3,000 key decision makers from business, government, and international organizations. For many, it will be their first time in Azerbaijan, and I am convinced they will leave Baku with a better understanding of what Azerbaijan has to offer, and reduce their perception of the risks of investing. Our country recognizes that investors have a choice when investing, and our international events demonstrate that Azerbaijan is a good choice for them.</p><h4>What opportunities for international investment have the First European Games provided, and how has AZPROMO contributed to this?</h4><p>The Games have provided opportunities for international business to expand into new markets, and demonstrate their products and services using Baku as a stage from which to broadcast to Europe. In particular, significant business opportunities have been provided in construction, infrastructure, tourism, and services, among many other areas. Foreign investors working with Azerbaijani companies and people have created impressive venues around the country for the long-term benefit of the country. In 2014, the value of these foreign investment opportunities was $11 billion. Like previous international events, we expect the Baku Games to generate increased awareness of non-oil investment and trade opportunities available in our country. Whenever I travel overseas, I tell my fellow business travellers that Azerbaijan was at the center of the Silk Road, and was where the Nobel brothers made their fortune that funded the Nobel Prizes. Although surprised, they are even more intrigued by the modern opportunities presented by our country. AZPROMO is ready to help these opportunities become a reality, by providing authoritative information, advice on company establishment, and matchmaking to domestic investment projects.</p><div class="quote">“Over the past few years, Azerbaijan has turned into a host for many international events."</div><h4>Which sectors of the economy have been the most lucrative for investment and export in 2015, and where is there the greatest potential in the medium term?</h4><p>Economic diversification is an important goal for Azerbaijan. Two decades ago, oil and gas was the dominant industry and the most lucrative sector. Today, we have made progress to re-balance our economy. With a 61% share in GDP and average annual growth of 7% to 10%, the non-oil sector has become a driving force of economic development. In recent years, the GDP contributed by communications services has increased eight-fold, industry has almost tripled, and agriculture has grown by one and a half times. As our economy diversifies, opportunities in agriculture, food processing, machinery, and chemical industries can increase while new technologies, such as pharmaceuticals, IT, space industry, and nanotechnologies have also developed. The construction sector has boomed in recent years, especially in the production of construction materials. The metallurgy industry in Azerbaijan is also being established and new production facilities have been developed with the focus on end products. The services sectors, where a big part of foreign investments have accumulated, have been growing in recent years including in communications, transport, banking, insurance, tourism, and healthcare. They have increased both the quantity and quality of services. Sumgait Chemical Industrial Park (SCIP), Balakhani Eco-Industrial Park, and High Technologies Park provide opportunities for state-of-the-art investment in the mentioned sectors of economy. As for exports, 2014 was successful in terms of promoting non-oil exports and discovering new markets. Traditional groups of products for Azerbaijan, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, processed foods and beverages, as well as chemical and metal products and articles of light and heavy industries, have huge export potential; for example, exports of fruits and vegetables in 2014 increased by over 16%, chemical products by 33%, and plastic products by almost 29%. The export of services is another important area with significant potential.</p><h4>AZPROMO has representative offices in Georgia, Austria, the US, Germany, and the UAE, and continues to strengthen ties with a number of international organizations. How important are these offices and partnerships to AZPROMO's strategy?</h4><p>In order to achieve our goals, we established a network of representative offices in foreign countries, such as Georgia, Austria, Germany, the US, the UAE, and the UK. Our representatives have the spirit of the Azerbaijan office of AZPROMO. They are working hard to create a network between foreign and Azerbaijani companies that is undeniably important in business today. Representative-offices are providing us with the all-necessary new events and opportunities, which allows us to reach many countries with efficiency. For example, our US representatives actively participated in business events and exhibitions in Washington D.C., Chicago, Las Vegas, and other cities during 2014. This shows the important role our representative offices play for us in accomplishing our company's goals. We have also a network of 71 partners, including investment and export promotion agencies, chambers of commerce, international organizations, and public institutions from 36 countries. In 2014, we signed 15 MoUs with institutions from different countries. We closely cooperate with investment promotion agencies through the World Association of Investment Promotion Agencies (WAIPA)—where we hold the Vice-Presidency—gathering together over 250 national and sub-national agencies from 162 countries. In terms of the practical implications of these partnerships, these are important in promoting Azerbaijan's export and investment opportunities. We continuously share experiences with our partners in trade and investment promotion, and exchange information on trade and investment. This is important for the understanding of our export and investment potential and the analysis of foreign markets, the organization of various important promotional events, the capacity to find new partners for Azerbaijani companies, to help them to enter foreign markets, and to address any issues. We actively disseminate information on Azerbaijani products to potential buyers and distributors through our partners' network and invite international companies to invest in the non-oil sector of our economy.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the Council of Clusters of Nuevo Leon play in boosting activity within the State of Nuevo Leon?</h4><p>We have 12 clusters to date, with the new one being tourism specific. The clusters have three points of interest; the government, private initiatives, and academia. The purpose of this triple helix is to promote the cooperation of these three interest groups both within the clusters and among them.</p><h4>Where does the Council fit among those three parties?</h4><p>The Council works with the presidents of each cluster and our principal function is to align the different missions of the clusters into a single point of view. We determine how to help all sectors collaborate horizontally, instead of just vertically. Clusters work vertically together with the government, too. The Council has been undertaking this work for around a year now. Our first objective is to establish what problems each cluster has and to see how we can overcome them through the work of different sub-commissions. Ultimately, the Council's mission is to work together with the clusters and focus its efforts on the creation of new jobs, attracting new investment, and expanding Nuevo Leon's economy.</p><div class="quote">“I think the greatest challenge lies in comprehending how each cluster works by itself."</div><h4>What are the main challenges in assisting the clusters in working together, and what steps have you taken to address them?</h4><p>I think the greatest challenge lies in comprehending how each cluster works by itself, given that there is no structure in place to unite them. Each cluster has its own particular way of going about its business, and no one has questioned that to date. I believe they could enjoy better results by working with government bodies and the universities. As each cluster enjoys operational autonomy, there has historically not been sufficient communication between them. Another challenge is to work with the health cluster, specifically in the spheres of biotechnology and nanotechnology.</p><h4>The number of clusters in Nuevo Leon has increased over the past decade. How have these clusters contributed to the competitiveness of Nuevo Leon as compared to other states in Mexico?</h4><p>Competitiveness derives from the way we share this information, and our best efforts have been expended in teaching. For example, health personnel know how to find resources and information in their field, but we have no crossover of information between various sectors. We need reports, indicators, and balance sheets that we currently lack. Some of the more successful clusters have a narrow focus, for example in technology and biotechnology. Naturally, they need funds to realize their projects. Several of the clusters will not have experience in how to achieve this, and need to learn the ropes. In this case there is a need to learn more about project finance from the clusters of greater experience, which, again, is predicated on effective communication.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the most important projects coming up for the DHA?</h4><p>We are concentrating on Dubai's health sector, keeping in mind the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to achieve happiness by improving and developing our services. With the health sector in particular, development cannot be in one direction; we have undertaken multiple projects at the same time, all of which are aimed to provide holistic development for the health sector. First, we are renovating our existing hospitals, building new hospitals, renovating old primary healthcare centers, and building new ones—that is from the engineering point of view. Second, we are concentrating on the mobility of services, which is essential due to factors such as population increase, expansion of geographical areas, and so on. We are concentrating on the mobility of services, rather than waiting for patients to come to us. This includes ambulance services, geriatric services, and people with special needs. Our approach will save much time and reduce the anxiety that patients are their family members often go through. And thanks to technological advancements, we are able to provide laboratory services such as blood tests through the mobile medium.</p><h4>How is the DHA planning to utilize IT services to create total health solutions?</h4><p>IT is a critical component for the  development of the health sector and there is considerable potential in establishing electronic hospital files, management systems, and improving the efficiency of operations. We are working toward the implementation of electronic medical records systems, hospital information systems, as well as using IT to improve the patient experience. All these projects will help enhance efficiency in the health sector.</p><div class="quote">“Education is vital for the sustainability and development of the health sector."</div><h4>What role does education play in the development of the health sector of Dubai?</h4><p>Education is vital for the sustainability and development of the health sector. After all, human capital is the lifeline of the sector. The DHA has several programs for ongoing medical education for our medical staff and we are collaborating with universities to ensure Dubai provides medical education in areas that are much needed to develop the health sector.</p><h4>How does the compulsory healthcare initiative contribute to the development of Dubai both socially and economically?</h4><p>Mandatory health insurance guarantees totality of  services. Once implemented, a patient has universal access to healthcare across private and public hospitals. Wherever you go, service is available; there are no longer specific venues that provide specific services. In Dubai there are 2,700 clinics, centers, and hospitals. And given the size of Dubai, that means there is a clinic on every corner. With universal healthcare insurance, one could enjoy coverage wherever they go. It will increase the speed, totality, and reduce the burden on the clinics and hospitals. Moreover, compulsory health care coverage will play a major role in guaranteeing that a person need not worry about making payments when visiting a hospital or clinic. At the same time, it will encourage investors to invest in the health sector, while positive competition amongst players will further lead to high quality of health services across hospitals and health centers. Dubai is already witnessing high-demand in health investment. Last year, everyday there was more than one new license issued in Dubai. This will play a big role in achieving the vision of His Highness. It will also automatically bolster the medical tourism initiative. DHA has already established a medical tourism club, which comprises 30 private and public hospitals. We are working hand-in-hand with the private sector to develop our services, which in turn will provide an impetus to the medical tourism initiative.</p><h4>The DHA has introduced a price cap increase of 4.22% on healthcare services. How do you think the dynamic between price and quality will play out within the health sector?</h4><p>We are not saying not to increase the price, but rather, that when you do so, you need to convince us that you have improved quality by introducing introduced new equipment or specialties. The price regulation model is based on the annual rate of inflation published by the Dubai Statistics Centre which was 4.22%. This is a legitimate and reasonable model for investors in the health sector. They have 11 months in which to notify, as a hospital, of a prospective price increase. They have to convince us as to why they need to increase the price. This way, it will create stability. Just inflating prices does not mean there is a sustainable development in the sector. We have essentially adopted more of a long-term perspective. In so doing, we protect the investor's investments in the field. There is also a price control mechanism. Hopefully, with this, we are building a system that will create a sustainable environment for healthcare investors.</p><h4>How do you attract and retain international talent to work in Dubai?</h4><p>The secret here is the living environment. People like to live in a place that is safe, affordable, that provides services, and that is secure health wise. That is what we are trying to build; totality of international standards. His Highness says that if one service is lacking—water, roads, education, and so on—people cannot be contented. And meanwhile, when it comes to practicing medicine, it is more than a financial consideration; it is also a matter of research and education, which is supremely important for many doctors. Often, doctors prefer the public sector because the government offers additional advantages, such as education and research opportunities. These individuals tend to be keen to develop the field of medicine itself, and the government is keen to support this. Therefore, it is by understanding the motivation of medical professionals that you best offer them the conditions that they find most convincing.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your key achievements in terms of projects undertaken in recent years?</h4><p>Coninsa Ramon H. is 40 years old, and is pursuing continued growth with marked results. One of our main achievements over the past two years has included participation in diverse infrastructure projects, and the opening of new branch offices in Santa Marta and Cartagena. While we have a formidable presence in Medellí­n, Bogotá, and Barranquilla, we need to establish ourselves in every part of the country where we have projects. We have been investing considerably in consolidating our processes, and in technology, which gives us a competitive advantage and reduces costs incurred by our customers.</p><h4>Where are new technologies most evident in your operations?</h4><p>We are working to control the cost of our projects, and having the most advanced programs to monitor these factors is important. Technology is also critical for generating sales. In addition to infrastructure, we are also working in the real estate sector, and there are technological tools that enhance the selling process significantly. So it is not a hard investment in technology, such as new equipment or machinery, but rather an investment in soft technology.</p><h4>Coninsa Ramon H. has a significant presence on the Caribbean coast. What projects are attracting interest from external investors?</h4><p>A slew of large infrastructure projects in the region are attracting foreign investors to Colombia. Five years ago, 80% of the attendees at local construction and infrastructure conventions were from Colombia. In stark contrast, these days, around 60% are from abroad. This reflects a surge in interest from foreign investors, be they contractors or builders, seeking opportunities in Colombia. The Caribbean region in general is growing. For example, net sales of new properties last year in Barranquilla grew by about 25% over the previous year.</p><h4>Is the changing balance of foreign investors specifically in infrastructure projects?</h4><p>The influx of internal investment started with infrastructure, but lately investors are moving into real estate as well. There has been a change in their risk perception. Initially, they had been looking for constructed buildings already generating rental income. But now, we have seen that these investors are coming to companies such as ours looking for off-plan projects, where the selling process has not even begun. They are beginning to consider the risk worthwhile, which is logical because with higher risk comes higher return.</p><div class="quote">“We are working to control the cost of our projects."</div><h4>How does Coninsa Ramon H. collaborate on an international level, and what do you look for in strategic alliances?</h4><p>For Coninsa Romon H. the future looks bright, because we have experience in establishing both local and international alliances. And one of the key requisites that underpin such alliances is project viability from start to completion. Prioritizing the project over the various partners ensures that the project at hand is successful. This keeps the relationship between the local and international investors from collapsing because the goals are always well defined.</p><h4>Why do you feel that foreign investors and multinationals have not been as successful, or persevered with the majority of infrastructure contracts in Colombia?</h4><p>Our company was appointed to participate in four such projects. One of those was with a Chinese company that was bidding with us, but it ultimately opted not to go ahead with the proposal, which prevented any of the local companies that had partnered with it from participating. Many foreign investors seek out local partners to gain the on-the-ground knowledge necessary to attain the projects they seek. Unfortunately, not too many investors from abroad have first-hand experience of closing deals. Generally speaking, multinationals seem to feel that they are taking on too much risk and are therefore unwilling to meet their financial obligations.</p><h4>What are the key infrastructure projects that you are involved in this year?</h4><p>We are working on two major infrastructure projects. One is the Ituango hydroelectric project, which is the largest hydro project in the country, and on which we are partnering Brazilian company Camargo Corea as well as Conconcreto. The second infrastructure project is the Tunel del Oriente, which is the tunnel that connects Medellí­n with the east.</p><h4>Coninsa Ramon H. hopes to double the property it owns by 2017. What is the strategy behind that?</h4><p>The decision was made five years ago, and we are close to achieving that goal. One of the strategies that we adopted was to concentrate on reducing our own costs, and those of our customers. The second was a growth strategy based on establishing branches in other cities around the country. Coninsa Ramon H. has four strategic business units. We have real estate, which includes housing and renovations, and we also engage in rental property, where we are the management and agent for the property owner. With regard to that business, we manage around 5,600 homes. Our other units are housing, housing construction, and infrastructure and the public sector. These strategic departments rather resemble the four engines of a jet in so much as if one business unit sees a decline the others pick up the slack.</p><h4>What needs to be done to improve public private initiatives (PPIs) in the construction sector, and in infrastructure projects?</h4><p>PPIs are on the verge of taking off in Colombia. Three years ago, if you looked at the white pages, the government might be soliciting bids for around 28 PPIs. However, these days there might be around 220 PPIs—the government has been obliged to demonstrate their viability in Colombia. At the end of last year, the government started awarding the first PPIs and I am optimistic of their potential for success.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Coninsa Ramon H. in 2015?</h4><p>We do not expect notable growth this year, as macro economic conditions changed late in 2014 with the devaluation of the peso and decline in oil prices. For example, GDP, forecast growing by 4.2%, registered 3.8% growth. Our commercial tempo is encouraging, however, and we have no need to sign new contracts in order to generate positive results. That being the case, we are ever on the lookout for potential developments that could advance our position in the local market.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the tourism sector in Almaty?</h4><p>We believe that there is huge potential here, and in the coming years Almaty should become one of the biggest tourism destinations in the region, particularly in the development of ski tourism; the region of Almaty is surrounded by very beautiful mountains, which are located very close to the city center and to the international airport. During the year we have more than 300 sunny days and the altitude of Shymbulak Mountain is 2,200 meters from the bottom station and 3,200 from the top station. We have excellent skiing conditions. The season is very long, and the amount of snow per year is about nine meters. When you combine all of these advantages that we have, there is no city in the world that compares. There are many beautiful places around Almaty, not just ski resorts. From the city center, you can drive a half hour to reach glaciers in one direction, deserts and dunes in another, and a lake in another. We believe that in a few years the tourism industry will contribute at least as much to GDP as minerals and oil production.</p><h4>In 2013 Russian Forbes included Shymbulak Resort among the best 10 ski venues in Eurasia. What factors have led to the success of the resort?</h4><p>In 2010 we completed the first stage of the refurbishment project of Shymbulak. Shymbulak is no longer solely a sports base to prepare the national Alpine Ski Team. It is now a beautiful leisure resort, operational every day, even during the summer. All of the equipment we installed during the refurbishment is brand new. We hired many well-known consultants worldwide, from France and Italy for example. This resort is smaller than some resorts in the Alps, but it is unique. It is very modern and it has many different kinds of slopes. The ski lifts are very fast and can support 2,000 passengers per hour. We also built a gondola from the city to the resort, and that takes only 15 to 20 minutes.</p><div class="quote">“We have started the year with very good figures."</div><h4>What facilities characterize Shymbulak? What kind of additions will be implemented in the second phase of the project?</h4><p>In the first phase we replaced all of the lifts, snowmaking machines, and the lighting system for night skiing. We changed the slopes to make them more friendly for beginners. This building includes seven different restaurants and food and beverage facilities. We have a rental point downstairs to find any level of ski equipment or snowboards. We also have a huge spa area. In the second stage we will add a hotel, service departments, apartments for sale, and retail units. There will be shops, discos, cafes, and even festivals—it will be just like a European-style resort village.</p><h4>90% of the visitors at the resort are Kazakhstani. Can you share with us your strategies to attract more foreign tourists to this venue?</h4><p>During the weekend when the weather is sunny, Shymbulak has more than 7,000 visitors per day; we have lines on the gondolas even though they are the fastest in the world. That is why we have not advertised as much in foreign markets. There is a national project for a new Almaty ski resort, Kok-Zhailau, which will have 60 kilometers of slopes with 16 ski lifts. In total the project will include 500 kilometers of slopes, which is huge. Even though Europe has many places to ski, we have our own market. If you look around at a three-hour flight radius, there are so many different places that have access to Kazakhstan; China, Russia, India, and the Gulf countries. It is already a huge market.</p><h4>What are you doing to attract customers in the off-season?</h4><p>Five years ago, Shymbulak had a record of 2,000 people per day in the winter, and fewer than 100 in the summer. Now 52% of people are coming to Shymbulak in the winter, and 48% in off-season. We want to introduce more activities for people in the summers, not only having coffee and steak in a restaurant. We also have some hiking and trekking trails. We have the rope park for kids and adults who want to improve their skills. We have open-air parties, food festivals, and laser shows in the summer.</p><h4>How are you working on establishing partnerships with schools and universities in the city to promote skiing?</h4><p>We are studying similar programs in France and Austria. In the academic curriculum of schools and universities, the students have mandatory ski lessons, at least 10 hours per season, and can supplement sports lessons with skiing. We are preparing a plan to present to the Ministry of Education soon. We also offer special deals for students to rent a ski pass, equipment, and hire an instructor at half price or less.</p><h4>Do you have any specific goals or targets that you would like to achieve by the end of this year?</h4><p>We have started the year with very good figures even though there was a devaluation of the currency. We were afraid that people would be more careful with spending, especially with leisure. However, we see that figures are very good and even better than last year. For the next year we have some technical goals. We want to expand and create new slopes. For 2015 we want to concentrate on increasing Shymbulak's presence in international markets. We want to create more tourism packages and cooperate with hotels and airlines in order to start international marketing. We are already working with Air Astana, and there are already many comfortable direct flights from Almaty to many cities. For many countries, a visa is no longer needed to come to Kazakhstan, and we are seeing the effects of this reform.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of GlobeMed Lebanon's performance in 2014?</h4><p>The performance of GlobeMed Lebanon in 2014 was excellent. As expected and projected in 2013, we were able to succeed not only at the financial level, but also in strategic objectives, particularly new initiatives related to care management. As a third-party administrator (TPA), we are an organization that manages the medical insurance portfolio of insurance companies, mutual funds, and self-funded schemes (collectively called Risk Carriers), controls the bills, and is able to negotiate better tariffs and conditions with the hospitals. We excel at this, but we also want to take a step further toward the management of care. In order to do that, we need to focus on preventative care and disease management measures. We have set up wellness programs so people who are healthy can stay healthy, and disease management programs so that people with chronic illness can live better with their conditions. We have also partnered with an NGO called Balsam that takes care of people who have terminal illnesses, and we are working with them on a research project to show that palliative care decreases cost and increases quality of life. We also sponsor a football academy for children between ages four and 16, the GlobeMed Racing Football Academy; they eat better, exercise more, and stay healthier, which in turn has a positive influence on the lifestyle of their families and the communities they live in.</p><h4>What is the role of innovation and technology for GlobeMed Lebanon?</h4><p>Innovation and technology play a huge role for the GlobeMed Group, next to human resources. I would say they constitute the backbone of the organization. I will not dwell on the IT solutions used to run our business, and which is in continuous development, but will focus on the new tools being built to accompany our new care strategy. We are setting up our GlobeMed Mobile App, which is still in its first phase. It includes basic functions such as policy conditions and listings for nearby providers, hospitals, pharmacies, and clinics, and other basic information. In the second phase, the app will include functions related to healthy lifestyles such as nutrition plans, diet, and exercises. It will also take into consideration seasons, like Ramadan, Christmas, summer, and so on. We are also going to create a web portal that is going to mirror the mobile app. In addition to the portal and mobile app, the entire strategy integrates a clinic as the core element of the care programs, staffed by family doctors, gynecologists, pediatricians, dentists, and dieticians. It will offer prevention consultations, awareness campaigns, and diet counseling for people suffering from diabetes or hypertension.</p><div class="quote">“I support PPPs, especially because the public sector in Lebanon needs improvement."</div><h4>How does GlobeMed Lebanon work with GlobeMed in other countries in terms of exchanging know-how and expertise?</h4><p>GlobeMed Limited is the franchisor and the coordinator of all the activities of the different GlobeMed companies, which are GlobeMed Lebanon, GlobeMed Qatar, GlobeMed Kuwait, GlobeMed Saudi, and so on, all operating as TPAs. GlobeMed Limited gives the TPAs the IT systems, the operating procedures, the organizational structure, the KPIs, the contracts with our providers, suppliers, and clients. GlobeMed Limited conducts workshops, takes best practices from different operations, and disseminates them so we can learn from each other. We have a strong migration of talent between operations. An employee that has experience here has the opportunity to go to another operation outside Lebanon, especially if it is a new one that requires people with experience to set it up. Lebanon in particular sends out talent to the different operations. We also have an e-learning platform, where all the employees of the company, depending on their position and role, are required to take courses and exams online to make sure they have learned the basic modules that are needed to stay competitive. We also have e-learning courses for our suppliers, such as a pharmacy, which has joined us and wants to understand how we operate.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the current condition of the healthcare industry in Lebanon?</h4><p>Despite deficiencies and weaknesses in the political and economic climate in Lebanon, the education, healthcare, and insurance sectors are strong. It is widely known that the schools, universities, and hospitals in Lebanon are the best in the region, and the insurance sector is more advanced than any other in the region. Lebanon is the first or second in terms of insurance penetration. This is a pretty good indicator of the level of maturity that this sector has. On a regulatory level, the insurance sector is regulated through the Ministry of Economy, which is doing a pretty good job, though there are some hiccups that need to be addressed. The TPA industry, however, is not regulated. There is no need for a license; anyone can create a TPA company and start operating, which is not very healthy in the sense that it creates unhealthy competition and does not set standards for quality of service. Regulation is important, especially if it is handled by a professional entity. In the healthcare delivery level, of course, the Ministry of Health is the regulator, and all things considered, it is doing a good job as well.</p><h4>What is the importance of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for the further development of the Lebanese healthcare sector?</h4><p>I support PPPs, especially because the public sector in Lebanon needs improvement. Around 50% of the population of Lebanon relies on the Ministry of Health, while about 25% rely on the national social security fund. The public sector covers about 75%, and there is a need for improvement in management of the relationship with the medical service providers and the administration of their medical schemes. Social security, for example, has great coverage in terms of benefits that are provided to the employees of the private and public sectors. However, because the tariffs for social security are low, sometimes the hospital asks patients to pay extra amounts, and because of the inefficient administration, when a patient send bills to be reimbursed by social security, reimbursements are not recovered for up to 2 years sometimes. The efficient management of the processes that are needed to adequately serve the population is non-existent, and this is where a private entity can come in with the public sector and help them improve their service delivery through a PPP.</p><h4>What are GlobMed's plans and expectations for 2015?</h4><p>GlobeMed Group is already present in 12 countries: Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Nigeria, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi, Syria, and the UAE. On the expansion strategy, we have an expansion plan in Oman, which is the only GCC country where we do not have a legal entity as yet; however, we have a network of hospitals that are contracted with us, so people who travel to Oman can be served, and there is an expansion plan that is being worked on for North Africa, in Tunisia and Algeria. Iraq is also on the radar, but the security and political situations are standing in the way. On the servicing strategy, and as discussed earlier, we are moving toward wellness, prevention, and disease management in order to decrease cost, improve quality of life, and enhance the customer experience. This is going to be one of the biggest initiatives that GlobeMed Lebanon is going to undertake in 2015.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the firm developed in Peru?</h4><p>OHL came to Peru some years ago for a specific project, but the real story of its involvement in this market starts in 2008. In 2002, OHL decided to branch out and become an international company, seeking projects beyond Spain, which accounts for 92% of its business, and Europe. OHL has focused on Peru for the past six years, having entered the Peruvian market through the acquisition of Peruvian company Constructura TP. In our first year, we were granted a major concession to build a road to Trujillo, and that project whetted our appetite sufficiently to remain in the country. We now have three major business areas here; construction, concessions, and industrial, which is the APC component. The industrial component is our smallest branch, having been in operation for just a few years. In terms of construction, we have more than a decade of experience in Peru, making it our largest branch, along with concessions. We operate as independent units under one roof, but our construction and concessions departments work hand in hand, and we never undertake concessions that we are not going to provide the construction for.</p><h4>Tell us about the state of progress regarding the Trujillo highway, and the concession process regarding that project?</h4><p>There are four stages, the third of which has been finalized and delivered. The fourth stage will be completed before the end of the year, and work continues on the first and second stages. We started with the third and fourth stages heading from north to south because of the low availability of free land in stages one and two. It made the most sense to begin work at the stages allowing rapid progress, as negotiations continued with the government concerning the availability of free land in stages one and two. We were also awaiting the introduction of new legislation regarding the expropriation of land on which to build the highway and lay the necessary infrastructure, which includes fiber-optic cables, towers, and toll stations. That said, we expect to finish the main project by December 2015, with the ancillary projects to be completed the following year.</p><div class="quote">“Competition in Peru is tough, although it is a thoroughly open market."</div><h4>How competitive is the construction sector and concessions? What are the challenges in obtaining them, and how free and fair are the concessions and competition overall?</h4><p>Competition in Peru is tough, although it is a thoroughly open market, which is encouraging. When I was a politician in the Peruvian senate, I worked hard to ensure that this was the case. The Senate has of course since been abolished, under the presidency of Alberto Fujimori, following his coup d'état, and today there is only Congress. But we were the group that struggled to open up the Peruvian economy. Mario Vargas Llosa lost the election, and Fujimori won, but thankfully the free market spirit won out in the end, and we have an open economy, while the country has been opened to foreign capital and investment. Today Peru has no restrictions other than a somewhat slow-working bureaucracy. Peru is an attractive investment prospect for multinationals, and in terms of transparency I see little evidence of wrongdoing in private initiatives. In the public sphere, they talk of corruption in the private sector, but I don't know of many cases, and those I do know of have been exposed and dealt with. This suggests that the image of corruption is overblown and outdated.</p><h4>What is it that distinguishes OHL, enabling it to win large concessions?</h4><p>The difficult projects set us apart; we specialize in them, and realize them effectively. We compete in public tenders, and invest our own money in the projects. Our profits are then reinvested in company growth. Our highly skilled engineers add value to our construction projects by providing effective solutions for every eventuality. When mineral prices are low, clients make expenditure cuts, and we often have to match those cuts, but there is a point past which we cannot go. Many companies think that making cuts is the solution, but they fail to realize that cutting costs can be more costly in the long run. In companies I have worked with before, I never sourced the cheapest suppliers, but always the best ones. After all, one weak link in the chain can bring a whole operation to a halt.</p><h4>OHL wants to double the size of its global operations over the next five years. What will Peru's role be in this growth?</h4><p>The new CEO of OHL, Josep Pique, has declared this to be the target for the next five years. Peru is the first branch of OHL to have already doubled the size of its business. 2013 was spectacular for us, and we more than doubled sales over the course of the year through various projects, mostly in the mining sector.</p><h4>What performance do you foresee for 2015?</h4><p>By the end of 2015 or early 2016 in the construction sector we will have reached similar growth levels as 2013. These will be the result of the concessions won today, which are due to be completed by around the end of 2015 or the beginning of 2016. In the second trimester of 2015, we will assume new mining sector projects. Overall, I think we will be much stronger in 2016 or 2017, when the mining sector will have gotten through this tough period. I expect growth in private initiatives (IP's) and public-private partnerships (APP's), mainly in the mining sector, and we also want to enter the energy sector, mainly through hydroelectric projects.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>YDA Group celebrates its 40th anniversary this year. How has the company evolved since its establishment and what do you consider YDA's landmark achievement?</h4><p>There were some key milestones in the history of the YDA Group. One of these was the merging of YDA and AKSA Construction, which was the genesis of the group known as YDA Construction. The YDA name is much more valuable to us than all of our assets, because it is our father's name. Penetrating the aviation sector with the Dalaman Airport BOT Project in 2003 was one of the other key milestones for us. It enabled YDA to enter a very prestigious sector and to establish facility management knowledge and experience, which drove us to enter the hospital PPPs. We started the journey into PPPs three years ago, as Turkey has a great vision for 2023 and a main part of that is the transformation of the healthcare system. The Ministry of Healthcare is expected to invest around ‚¬20 billion for this massive program. I can say that hospital construction PPPs are some of the most important key milestones in YDA Group's development.</p><h4>What is YDA's growth and diversification strategy for the long term?</h4><p>YDA is very diversified in various sectors, including aviation and construction and agriculture and facility management for PPPs as well as concessions. We have a backlog of more than $5.8 billion. Firstly, we have already issued bonds, which is very unique in the construction market in Turkey. We now want to achieve further penetration in the capital markets. By becoming familiar with the capital markets, our main vision is to enable YDA to be listed as one of the top 10 companies in the industry, one which has already finalized corporate governance, guaranteeing sustainability, and which is respectful of international standards in environment and healthcare. Elsewhere, our strategic vision is to change our portfolio from construction to other sectors such as facility management so that we can easily talk about a predictable and stable cash flow for YDA. We are also trying to increase the PPP projects in our portfolio to ensure a stable cash flow for the future. We have five PPP projects, including two airports and three hospitals. We are still interested in hospitals and upcoming projects and tenders. We are already planning on establishing a company and integrating all these PPP projects under one holding. Our main target is to hold a successful IPO either in the local market or internationally.</p><div class="quote">“Turkish companies are competitive and meet international quality standards."</div><h4>Kazakhstan is YDA's core area for activity abroad. What opportunities do you see there at the moment?</h4><p>This is our 14th year in Kazakhstan. We have great experience there mainly in the construction market, acting as a conventional contractor. We have completed very prestigious and landmark projects, including the Almaty Finance Center, the Nobel Pharmaceutical Plant, and the Esentai Shopping Mall. We just delivered the Astana National Museum, a unique project, costing around $400 million. We are currently constructing the Astana Waste Water Treatment Plant and also building a large landscaping project for a recreational area in Astana, a city park. On the other hand, we are also invested in Kazakhstan. We have an airport in Kazakhstan in which we have already invested $90 million and have a 30-year concession. Besides for this, we also have land development experience in the real estate market in Kazakhstan. In 2009, we had a portfolio there worth more than $1 billion. We developed the Samal Turkuaz Tower, the Maxima Residences, the Almaly Country Club, and the Arman Ville, which was the most prestigious project in Kazakhstan and sold for up to $10,000 per square meter. Now we will discontinue land development projects because of market demand and supply risk, but we have a lot of experience in Kazakhstan and consider it our second home. When we analyze and look at Kazakhstan's future, there are many opportunities. As you know, Kazakhstan was awarded Expo 2017, and we are in talks with the government for three related projects. We are very hopeful that we will be awarded two or three of these projects. We are also following the Kazakhstani market and we know that the government is very interested in PPP developments for schools and hospitals. It is discussing the subject with the IFC and other international financial institutions, with the intention of utilizing their knowledge. We want to export our knowledge of PPPs to the Kazakhstani market for the construction of hospitals and universities. If the authorities launch a successful PPP program, we hope that it will have bankable documentation meeting international standards. We will then definitely be interested in future PPP projects there.</p><h4>What makes Turkish companies in the construction sector so cost efficient?</h4><p>As a member of the Board of Turkish Constructors Assembly, we are proud to say that Turkish companies are competitive and meet international quality standards. I can even say we are much better than our European competitors because of our efficiency. We have an office in Dubai, and when you compare construction site work done by GCC contractors, the output of one Turkish laborer is equal to the output of at least five workers from other countries; this is the main secret. For our first projects in Kazakhstan we brought our local team with us because we had to be successful. We had to prove our quality and ability to deliver projects ahead of schedule. We wouldn't have been able to do this with a local team or other foreign workers. After our first two projects we started to optimize our efficiency. We started with an 80-20 Turkish labor to local labor mix. Then we began training local workers and created mixed teams. The locals learned from working alongside the Turks, and now we have no more than 10% Turkish laborers while the rest are locals. This took 13 years and optimized our costs. We know that Turkish laborers are more expensive, but when efficiency and output are compared, they are equal to four or five.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some things foreign companies should know about the business environment and norms of Abu Dhabi's local market and society?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is one of the most rapidly growing economies and entrepreneurial places in the world along with Dubai—it is quite an achievement. Foreign companies can carry out business activities in the UAE only after having been registered by the relevant authorities. A foreign investor can generally establish a business presence either on the UAE mainland or offshore, which basically involves a business presence in a free trade zone. In terms of legal forms, there is a company law providing regulation governing the operations of a foreign business. The federal law provides for seven categories of business organization: limited liability companies (LLCs), branches, partnerships, joint venture companies, public share holding companies, private share holding companies, and share partnership companies. But owing to certain restrictions, the choices commonly adopted by foreign companies are generally limited to an LLC or a branch. Other options like partnerships and joint ventures are usually not favored by foreign investors. As to UAE commercial company law, the foreign owner of an LLC may not exceed 49%, meaning 51% has to be held by a UAE national.</p><h4>What are some of the factors that are attracting foreign companies and foreign investors to Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Some of the factors include political and economic stability, the Emirate's strategically well located position between Europe, Asia, and Africa, excellent Infrastructure, strong healthcare and enhanced education policy, and solid investment incentives. In Abu Dhabi , there is a disciplined process for registering your company and entering the market. Foreign companies like to know that there is a consistent set of regulations. This disciplined procedure is very important for the UAE and Abu Dhabi in terms of attracting foreign businesses. Abu Dhabi also provides very competitively priced utilities. Electricity and gas are provided at very reasonable prices. Abu Dhabi has been attracting more and more visitors, and the hospitality sector is constantly growing and is attracting many residential and office developments. Investors are being attracted here for the good returns on their investments.</p><div class="quote">“The federal government of the UAE has not promulgated any tax laws."</div><h4>What should foreign investors know about taxation in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>The federal government of the UAE has not promulgated any tax laws. Most of the individual Emirates have issued corporation tax decrees, but in practice taxes are only imposed on oil and gas producing companies at rates set forth in government concession agreements, and also on branches of foreign banks at specific tax rates. Unless you are an oil and gas producing company or a bank, you are not subject to taxation. That is very attractive for foreign investors. The income taxes that have been enacted in each Emirate provide for tax to be imposed on the taxable income of all bodies and the branches that carry on trade and businesses at any time during the taxable year through a permanent establishment in the relevant Emirates. But apart from those three industries—oil, gas, and banking—nothing is being collected. In terms of taxation in Abu Dhabi, according to the Abu Dhabi income tax decree, all companies carrying on trade or business in Abu Dhabi are required to pay tax on their earnings. Legally, the tax rates are on a sliding scale, with a maximum rate of 55%. But in practice, oil and gas companies pay taxes at rates specified by the relevant concession agreement. Oil companies also pay royalties on production. Branches of foreign banks, meanwhile, pay an annual flat rate of 20% on profits. The taxable income of the banks is determined by the reference rates audited on financial statements. The Abu Dhabi Income Tax Decree of 1965 specified that an organization that conducts trade or business in Abu Dhabi shall be subject to taxation as follows, bearing in mind this is what is set out in law but not applied in practice: companies are exempt for up to $1 million; $1-2 million is 10%; $2-3 million is 20%; $3-4 million is 30%; $4-5 million is 40%; and above $5 million is 55%.</p><h4>What are the major business reforms taking place that foreign investors, companies, and entrepreneurs should be aware of?</h4><p>The UAE is looking at reforming both those laws concerning foreign ownership and insolvency. That would do wonders for the jurisdiction. Another reform that would be of great value to Abu Dhabi is a property law regulator, and I believe the reforms are under consideration. This would give greater confidence to investors. Overall, you need a good regulatory environment with good professionals, consistent and disciplined procedures, and a stable environment for business and the economy to flourish, and Abu Dhabi has all those ingredients.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In August 2014 a new Ministry of Energy was founded. Please tell us more about the benefits of a single Ministry of Energy for priority projects?</h4><p>The Republic of Kazakhstan occupies the 18th position in the world in the production of primary energy resources, 12th position in oil and gas reserves, and 2nd position in uranium reserves. It seems like a logical and tested step for us to create one single ministry to look over all the energy departments in our country, such as transport infrastructure, the oil and gas sector, nuclear energy, possible alternative sources of energy, and the issue of transition to the green economy. Moreover, our ministry is responsible for the issue of environmental protection, which allows us to avoid unnecessary cross-department bureaucratic barriers, and cut the time required for decision making, thus increasing our own efficiency.</p><h4>Production at the Kashagan deposit has been delayed until 2016. What is the Ministry's strategy in terms of compensation for oil production at other sites?</h4><p>It is widely known that after the start of oil extraction at Kashagan in September 2013 several leaks were discovered in the sour petroleum gas piping, which led to a complete halt in production. The inspection of the piping system indicated that repairs are necessary for the proper operation of the facility. In order to ensure economic growth and price stability for raw hydrocarbons, the ministry introduced corrections into the resolution entitled “On establishment of uniform rules of rational and complex usage of subsurface resources during the extraction process," which proposes the increase of norms of selection of raw hydrocarbons to 10% per year instead of 2% per quarter. This measure was part of other projects aimed at increasing economic growth and stability by the end of 2014, approved by the protocol of the Prime Minister's council in September 2014. Moreover, the ministry is working on including into the contracts of subsurface resource developers the obligation to deliver raw materials to the internal market of the Republic of Kazakhstan.</p><div class="quote">“The Republic of Kazakhstan occupies the 18th position in the world in the production of primary energy resources."</div><h4>How do you try to attract new investments into Kazakhstan's oil sector?</h4><p>Based on a message from the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan on January 17, 2014, and as part of the project to see Kazakhstan included among the 30 most developed countries in the world, special attention is being paid to geological exploration and the attracting of new investment from foreign engineering companies and technological enterprises for geological exploration. The Ministry of Energy is conducting several projects for the development of geological examination. A tender was issued for the right to explore and use subsoil resources on two sites in the Kizilordinskiy and Atyrauskiy regions, which cover a combined area of 5,472 square kilometers. The final amount of the tender came to KZT4.51 billion, of which the amount of social deductions is KZT360 million. The ministry is planning to hold another tender to provide the rights of exploration and use of subsoil resources on other sites. On the direction of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Ministry is carrying out Project Eurasia, the main purpose of which is the exploration of the deep geological structure of the Pricaspian region with the aim of discovering raw hydrocarbons. The project will facilitate work by an international consortium consisting of members of large petrol companies interested in the program. The Republic of Kazakhstan has a successful track of conducting similar works in the Caspian Sea bed, having created a consortium in 1993.</p><h4>Recently, you acted as the head of Kazakhstan's delegation to the IAEA's 58th General Congress. Could you please comment on Kazakhstan's strategy for global nuclear disarmament?</h4><p>The Republic of Kazakhstan became the first country in the world to voluntarily give up nuclear arms and shut down nuclear testing areas on request from its citizens. In 1991 the historic Order No. 409 from the President of Kazakhstan closed the testing ground and destroyed the last nuclear weapons. As part of the project of nuclear disarmament, The Republic of Kazakhstan signed the Lisbon protocol to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, whereby it confirmed its obligations for the non-proliferation of nuclear arms. In December 1993 the Semipalatinsk testing ground was de-commissioned, and the same year Kazakhstan became one of the first countries to join the treaty of non-proliferation of nuclear arms, and in December 1994 leading nuclear states around the world signed a memorandum to guarantee Kazakhstan's safety. In 1994 the removal of all nuclear weapons from the country was completed. The process of nuclear disarmament in the Republic of Kazakhstan was finalized in 2000 when the last building on the nuclear testing ground in Semipalatinsk was scrapped. Our country has been systematically supporting global initiatives to provide nuclear safety and will be carrying on with these policies in the future.</p><h4>Kazakhstan has expressed its intention to build its first nuclear power plant. What is the potential for nuclear energy here and what impact will it have on the country's development?</h4><p>Nuclear power, compared to traditional energy sources, and especially coal energy, holds quite a few convincing advantages. Chief amongst them is the low cost of energy generation and ecological benefits, which makes nuclear power one of the most competitive sources of energy in the world. Today, the Republic of Kazakhstan has all the right elements to develop its nuclear power industry. To elaborate on this idea, our key advantages are: an abundance of geologically explored uranium reserves; a developed industry in uranium extraction and processing; developed nuclear science; a sufficient number of qualified specialists in the area; and a legal base to regulate the questions of nuclear energy usage according to the requirements of IAEA. The development of the nuclear energy sector will allow us to use fuel and mineral resources in a balanced way, increase the export potential of the country, ensure the green benefits of power technologies, develop nuclear technologies for usage in different sectors of the economy, and boost the socio economic development of the country's territories in the regions where nuclear power stations are to be constructed.</p><h4>On the topic of the approaching Expo 2017: Energy of the Future, what support does the Ministry of Energy provide for the development of renewable energy programs in the country, and how does it assist the transfer of knowledge and technological advancements for a green economy?</h4><p>Despite the fact that the Republic of Kazakhstan is abundant in traditional energy sources, such as oil, coal, gas, and others, we fully understand that these energy sources are non-renewable. Moreover, their usage is harmful to the environment, and Kazakhstan is also full of renewable sources of energy, such as hydro, wind, solar, and others. Therefore, not making use of these resources would be unreasonable. As of January 1, 2014, energy in the Republic of Kazakhstan was being produced at 76 power stations, with a combined capacity of 20,591.5 MW. The share of hydropower in our overall production is 2,583 MW, wind power 5.6 MW, and solar power just 0.5 MW. The whole share of hydropower stations in the country is 8.1%, and other stations, including small hydro stations, amount to 0.3%. These numbers are not too encouraging but we are working toward improving this. Our Ministry, along with the related government departments and large national companies, is directing systematic work to introduce and spread the production of renewable energy in the country, and preparing for Expo 2017 is a part of that. In July last year, taking into account the best global practices as well as current affairs in the country, the active law on supporting the usage of renewable energy sources was further improved. The new law was directed not only at supporting investors but also consumers. At the same time, some concrete measures of support are being taken to achieve the key indicators of alternative energy development. According to the “Kazakhstan 2050: a new political course for a successful country" strategy, President Nazarbayev set out his goal to develop alternative and renewable types of energy. By 2050, such sources will provide for no less than half of all energy used among the population.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What innovative services have you have created to support new companies coming to Mozambique?</h4><p>First of all we had to establish ourselves in all of the country's 11 provinces to widen the scope of our institutional assistance to investors, and secondly we had to equip our institution with appropriate human and technical resources. These were the most important steps that we have successfully taken. Thirdly, we had to improve our relations with other institutions involved in the process of attracting investments as well as with relevant government ministries who have a strong say the in the process of investment approval, such as the Ministries of Agriculture, Interior, Labor, Environment, Finance, and Mineral Resources. The government also recently approved a new investment promotion strategy to be implemented over the next three years, which is expected to substantially increase investment flows into the country.</p><h4>What are the most common concerns of and challenges faced by international companies upon entering the market?</h4><p>I would identify the rather limited development of basic infrastructure in rural areas, as well as a low level of scientific literacy and professional training, inadequate electrical power distribution, and susceptibility of certain productive processes to international price fluctuation.</p><div class="quote">“Mozambique is proud of being ranked among the most strategic locations in Africa."</div><h4>What would you say are the most significant large-scale projects set to take place in the country in the near future, and how will they impact the broader economy?</h4><p>One of the largest forthcoming investment projects is the LNG plant set to cost some $30 billion. This project is to be developed in the Rovuma basin, in northern Mozambique, with the first exports due to start in 2018. There are other large-scale projects associated with gas exploration in the Rovuma basin, such as setting up a container terminal, a pipe-coating plant, a shipyard, bunkering, an LNG receiving terminal, a fertilizer plant, and gas to liquid (GTL) and dimethyl ether (DME) facilities. In addition, CPI recently approved investment projects worth more than $7 billion, mainly in hydro, coal, and gas power plants. The investment will also cover the development of the northern ports of Pemba and Palma, where a giant logistics base and LNG production plants are planned, which will use gas produced from offshore fields in the Rovuma Basin being developed by US oil major Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Italy's ENI. These projects will have a major impact on the entire economy directly or indirectly through their contribution to GDP, and the creation of employment, especially in Pemba and Palma. Moreover, Mozambique will enjoy much higher international visibility as one of the most important producers and exporters of natural gas. Mozambique's economy is already growing at 7.5% annually. In the medium term, as a result of the LNG plant and other mega projects in the mining sector, the economy is expected to see acceleration of 9%, or even 10%.</p><h4>What sectors and regions have you identified as having the greatest potential for growth?</h4><p>Mozambique is proud of being ranked among the most strategic locations in Africa and in the world at large, and of having up-to-date logistics infrastructure, including ports and railways that offer an easier link for hinterland countries to the Indian Ocean trade routes. As a result of these corridors and other factors, all the three regions of the country—the south, center, and north—are prime investment destinations. The sectors of greatest potential include agriculture and agro-industry, construction and public works, mineral resources and energy, services, transport and communications, and tourism.</p><h4>From your experience, which countries have invested most heavily in Mozambique?</h4><p>Mozambique annually approves investment from over 45 countries. Topping the list in 2014 for example were the UAE, Mauritius, South Africa, Portugal, China, the UK, Macau, Turkey, Kenya, and France.</p><h4>How would you describe Mozambique's current business environment?</h4><p>It is healthy, as we remain one of the most stable regional countries both socially and politically. Dialogue in our society is the order of the day. All institutions mandated to assist investors are functioning properly and in concordance with laws in force in the Republic of Mozambique, and in a well-coordinated manner. Legal instruments have undergone major reforms. These include business licensing, fiscal, investment, and labor laws. And meanwhile, infrastructure such as ports and railways, energy and water supply, roads and bridges, telecommunications, and airports are being upgraded.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the competitive nature of Mozambique in attracting FDI compared to other countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region?</h4><p>Mozambique has a strategic location in the region, providing infrastructure that gives access to SADC Countries—ports, railways, pipelines, and roads. Besides, Mozambique has plentiful fertile land and an excellent climate for the production of both food and cash crops such as maize, soya, rice, sesame, and fruits, as well as for livestock production. In addition, we have an energy potential of about 14,000 MW, mainly from water resources, gas, and coal, which is sufficient to supply the entire SADC region. Finally, Mozambique has numerous mineral resources, notably coal and gas.</p><h4>What is your outlook for CPI for the next two to three years?</h4><p>CPI is a government agency with a mandate to promote, attract, and facilitate national and foreign direct investment. Therefore, our vision is to become a modern, innovative, and proactive promotion agency spurring investment both in the country and the wider world, taking into account the need for the balanced and sustainable growth of Mozambique. Implementation of an investment promotion strategy is one of the key factors in boosting investment inflow to the country, and CPI plays a pivotal role in realizing this strategy.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Free Zone Tayrona (FZT) contributing to national development?</h4><p>One of the most important functions of an FTZ is its catalyzing effect on the development of a country. These zones play a role in generating employment, improving industry, and bringing investors to the country. Our advantage is the ability to produce new products that can compete on the international level, which in turn develops Colombia in broader terms. We intend to take greater advantage of related free trade agreements, and of our geographical position. In May 2008, the process started with the adequacy of lots and enclosures, and was finished in 2010. In 2011 we began operations and began to seek out clients. The FZT invested around $11.5 million in roads, public services, and amenities for clients, such as industrial and commercial services to help them settle.</p><h4>How credible an alternative is Tayrona Steel Pipe, which has made a huge investment here, to more conventional US investments?</h4><p>Tayrona Steel Pipe is an excellent investment opportunity because it has plants here and is able to leverage its access to Santa Marta and Colombia. Meanwhile, the company is based in Houston, giving it access to an international market of international clients, while this location is better suited to accessing the overall international market. The plant is located just 12 kilometers from the ports, enabling it to also service the US market from the home-base location. The climate in Santa Marta is also much more conducive to companies that need to operate in all weather conditions. Even compared to the other FTZs in the Caribbean and Central America, the climate here is unique, and the wind comes from the Sierra Nevada, which means that there is less corrosion. This is because of the lower salinity in the air, which is why there is such high demand for the services of metal mechanics, industry, alimentation, and logistics. Knight was our first major industrial player here. Its export/domestic operational ration was 60%. This trend has repeated itself in other production as the company imports 100% of its primary materials.</p><div class="quote">“The companies we are keen on should primarily be oriented toward exporting."</div><h4>That is a high export ratio. Are you focusing on bringing in companies with a high export ratio to the Santa Marta Free zone?</h4><p>The companies we are keen on should primarily be oriented toward exporting, although we do want a significant presence in national distribution, so as not to neglect Colombia. Ultimately, the role of these FTZs is to generate national growth and development. We are in the process of encouraging national companies based in Bogotá and central Colombia to relocate to the coast. We are noticing with the relocation of the industries that currently are centrally located that they are migrating here because of the climate. For example, Knight, and another European company that we are currently in negotiations with is contemplating an investment of ‚¬80 million for a special project, which would involve relocation to Colombia. We have other clients that are hoping to relocate from other countries, such as Venezuela, Italy, and the US, to dedicated 20-30% of production to the domestic market, with the remainder given over to export. We have a Spanish company that is undertaking the development of the logistics cluster.</p><h4>Logistics is your most significant cluster. How has it attracted companies?</h4><p>This is a perfect example of how clients are specifically drawn to the FTZ on the merits of its logistics cluster. Many companies have decided to relocate based on two criteria; firstly Santa Marta was a good location in terms of equipment durability, and secondly the FTZ's proximity to the port. This cuts out a significant logistics headache for producers. A good example of this is Auto Germana, a company that distributes BMW and Audi in Bogotá. Auto Germana made an investment in Tayrona and relocated its distribution center to the FTZ in Tayrona. It obtained the related benefits, and at the same time forged links with various dealerships around the country that require clients. VG is an important brand in Spain and Europe, and currently it is consolidating vehicles that are imported from Europe in the FZT. It is using the zone to offer special services, and is managing various brands from its Colombian base.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Fenix Power recently commenced commercial operations. What lay behind your entry into the Peruvian market?</h4><p><span></span>In 2008 AEI acquired Fenix, which was called Egechilca at the time, and was developed by Panamanian investors at Grupo Lakas. They had launched the project in 2004, purchasing the gas turbines and securing the requisite permits. The financial crisis of 2007 prevented its strategic investors from completing the project. Under those circumstances, AEI reached an agreement with Grupo Lakas to purchase the assets. AEI completed the project development, although construction could not immediately commence due to a gas and gas transportation crisis in 2009. The government stepped in with a competitive bid for their gas supply company, which we won. We had already acquired the turbines and related permits, and winning this bid took care of the gas supply component. Construction commenced in 2011, and was completed in early 2014. Commercial operations began in May 2014, but at 50% capacity utilization. From May to December of 2014 we were operating at 280 MW capacity, and on December 24 2014 we received COES approval for a commercial operation date (COD) with full capacity of 570 MW. With full capacity at our plant, we are now contributing 10% of the electricity consumed by Peru. This will push prices in the right direction, reducing consumer prices with the huge capacity we will be bringing into the system. We are proud of the major contribution that Fenix Power is making to the Peruvian economy by reducing electricity prices, while increasing electricity supply. We also feel proud of our social impact in Chilca, a community of 17,000 where we operate. Fenix Power has built a potable water system at the power plant, of which only 20% is used for our own consumption, including desalinization and potabilization, with the remaining 80% going to the local community in Las Salinas, Chilca. This water supply can only gain in importance over time.</p><h4>Assessing political risk is a crucial factor for companies seeking to invest in foreign markets. How did you carry out that assessment and what challenges did you face?</h4><p>Our political scene has been highly encouraging overall. At the executive level, the government has delivered on all its pledges. In the broader arena, local politics and political associations now and then oppose infrastructure in their regions. If we include them, then yes, we have faced certain problems, especially in the early years when certain organizations masqueraded as environmentalists to conceal a political agenda. We are doing what we pledge to do, and these stakeholders have observed that and respect us for it. This is despite the changes seen at the energy ministry over the past few years. Every administration has supported our project, and we have been unhindered in that regard. This is because what we are doing on both the social and economic front is of too much national significance for any official or government to oppose. All in all, I believe that what differentiates Fenix Power from other companies that produce thermal energy using gas-combined cycles is our social commitments and what we give to the local population.</p><div class="quote">“Our political scene has been highly encouraging overall."</div><h4>How are you able to provide low prices to the market, and how does your plant compare to other power sources in Peru at the moment?</h4><p>Fenix Power was not the first energy company to use a combined-cycle power plant, although we were the first to announce that we would build one. When others began putting their power plants into operation, they were open-cycle, simple-cycle plants, coming into operation in 2006-2007. But the threat of the new power plants being combined-cycle facilities forced many simple-cycle plants to convert to combined-cycle facilities. Today we have about 2,500 MW in combined cycle plants using natural gas. Various companies converted their simple-cycle plants to these combined-cycle alternatives, but we did it quicker, since we set out by building combined-cycle plants, whereas they had to undertake the whole conversion process. The entry of these combined-cycle units is certainly having a major impact by reducing the price of electricity in Peru, although it must be said that the drop in oil prices is also a major factor. That being said, thanks to the combined-cycle power plant, we can generate 40% more electricity without requiring additional fuel. That has led to a huge increase in supply over the past three or four years, which has naturally helped reduce prices significantly, especially when you also consider that demand has not been growing as expected, with Peru registering GDP growth of less than 3%. In a nutshell, lower demand, higher supply through the introduction of combined-cycle plants, and lower oil prices have all brought electricity prices down in Peru. We now see spot prices of below $20 per MWH.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Peruvian electricity sector, and are you worried that the current economic climate and recent government policies will make it more difficult to pursue new projects?</h4><p>The government has an objective of diversifying the power sector, and in its efforts to increase power generation from gas it has supported the development of gas infrastructure. The government has also artificially maintained prices at what it calls “ideal" levels. Its model assumes there are no restrictions, and that energy at any amount can be supplied at ideal rates. Although these policies served a purpose a few years ago when the government was keen to diversify electricity supply, setting these artificial price levels with no time limits can create prices that fail to represent the true costs of the system. And while this works for short periods of time, lengthier periods send the wrong kind of message to the market, which both our colleagues and us are concerned about.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>
