		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe INJAZ's role in empowering Kuwait's youth to “own their economic success“? What is your strategy as CEO to ensure the organization is achieving its objectives?</h4><p>INJAZ Kuwait is a non-profit organization committed to inspiring, preparing, and empowering youth in Kuwait to succeed in the global economy. Together with the private and public sector, our programs provide hands-on learning experience in entrepreneurship, work readiness, and financial literacy from our corporate volunteers. Business leaders lend a hand in transferring work readiness and entrepreneurial skills to students starting from middle school to university to help prepare them for work in the private sector. INJAZ Kuwait forms part of the global network of Junior Achievement Worldwide (JA) based in the US. The programs are designed to narrow social inequities, encourage social engagement, foster creativity and experience, and develop generations of highly skilled workers. INJAZ Kuwait offers English and Arabic-based programs from Middle School in Personal Economics and an Entrepreneurship Master Class, High School through the JA Job Shadow, Innovation Camp, JA Company Program, and JA Personal Finance programs, to University with our Business Leaders Campaign, JA Job Shadow, Steer Your Career, JA Company Program, and Start Up Program. The youth of Kuwait have extensive exposure to the world around them. I believe that preparing young people with the necessary critical thinking, analytical abilities, and soft skills needed to function in a competitive workplace will allow them to become the entrepreneurs, leaders, and drivers of tomorrow's economy.</p><h4>What have been some of the major achievements of INJAZ in Kuwait over the past year?</h4><p>INJAZ over the past year has worked with government, private sector and relevant bodies in driving youth engagement in different forms. Our values remain unchanged; a belief in the boundless potential of young people, a respect for talent, creativity, and the perspectives, and backgrounds of all individuals, conviction in the educational and motivational impact of relevant, hands-on learning, commitment to the principles of market based economics and entrepreneurship, belief in the power of partnership and collaboration, passion for what we do, and honesty, integrity, and excellence in how we do it. We will continue to encourage a larger number of youth to expose them to our hands-on educational programs and become confident, skilled workers, who understand the real world and are people employers want to hire.</p><h4>INJAZ's member countries include Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Yemen. What synergies exist between INJAZ Kuwait and these other member countries and how do you collaborate with your regional partners?</h4><p>Collaboration within the network comes through the sharing of best practices and therefore INJAZ-Kuwait is able to gain from the knowhow available and vice versa. We also collaborate in training and regional competitions. INJAZ Kuwait is an active member in good standing with the regional head office, INJAZ Al-Arab. As a member in good standing, INJAZ Kuwait provides training and capacity building for its regional partners. Over the past 10 years, INJAZ Kuwait has attended every Annual MENA Training, participated in almost every company program competition, and hosted two regional competitions in Kuwait, hosting 14 member nations. INJAZ Kuwait has won a number of regional awards, from INJAZ Al-Arab including Communication and Collaboration.</p><h4>What networking opportunities does INJAZ offer through its corporate and educational partners? What benefits do corporates receive from working with INJAZ?</h4><p>INJAZ works with its partner companies by involving corporate volunteers with INJAZ programs. Other than monetary support for INJAZ Kuwait, corporate volunteers contribute their time and effort in teaching INJAZ Kuwait's programs to high school and university students. In turn, the volunteers have a unique opportunity to experience first-hand how work in the community and voluntary sector is conducted. Volunteering impacts the community in a way that changes lives for the better. INJAZ Kuwait's partners are mentioned throughout INJAZ programs and events as well as INJAZ's marketing activities.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for INJAZ Kuwait in 2016?</h4><p>Awareness is key. Today, youth and stakeholders involved directly and indirectly realize the hardships of the job market. Therefore, I feel the youth are more willing and able to invest in themselves to secure a brighter future. But standard education is not equipping our young people for success. Our young people have the opportunity to contribute to their communities and nations through engagement and involvement in the development of a private sector for their nation. INJAZ over the past year has been involved in working with government, private sector and relevant bodies in driving youth engagement in different forms. We plan to continue working with the communities to address that gap and we encourage the youth to take the utmost advantage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaysia and the UK have a history of strong bilateral relations. What is it that makes Malaysia an important political, economic, and security partner for the UK?</h4><p>There are a number of aspects about Malaysia that are important to the UK, and it starts with a shared history. We speak the same language, both have democracy, and a similar mode of governance. Many of Malaysia's rules and regulations are also similar to ours, and it is a comfortable country for British companies to do business in, and similarly it is easy for Malaysian companies to do business in the UK. On that front, it is straightforward, and we are also happy to be supporting Malaysia as one of the key members of ASEAN. There are trading opportunities that go along with that, and it is helpful for British firms to be in Malaysia to access those markets. Above all, it is a two-way street, because both Malaysian and British firms are mutually comfortable in both locations. Large numbers of Malaysians have also been to college and university in the UK, and they have a natural affinity for the place, which helps the relationship.</p><h4>You recently visited Kuala Lumpur along with the Mayor of London and a delegation of businesses. What similarities did you observe between the two cities, and how can trade and investment further be facilitated between the two?</h4><p>I have been to Kuala Lumpur several times because we have had a lot of interface with Malaysian companies and sovereign funds with investments in London. This past trip was interesting because it was the Mayor's first time; it was an amazing trip where he was able to renew acquaintances, as he knows the Malaysian Prime Minister quite well. He was also able to interact with many of the investors and people who are involved in London. The similarities include the fast rate of growth in both of the cities in terms of population. They both have the challenges of infrastructure, and both have the need for further development in this capacity. The skylines are both changing quickly, and this, too, makes business in both cities rather similar. They are both springboards; London is very much a springboard into Europe as an ideal headquarters location. Kuala Lumpur, in a similar fashion, is an important location for European firms to establish themselves to go into Asia. </p><h4>The Battersea Power Station in London is being redeveloped by a consortium of three Malaysian companies. What is the significance of this project for Malaysia-UK bilateral relations?</h4><p>The significance comes from the example of Malaysia being able to extend some of its financial might into the UK for the development site. This is a scheme we have very much wanted to see get going, and it has worked well. What we are now seeing is an on going and developing relationship, and again London is viewed by many Malaysians as the gateway city to Europe. That is why developers are putting schemes like the Power Station together and offering accommodation and locations for Malaysian firms. The schemes are ones that London has wanted to see get off the ground, and also ones that are very popular. There are a number of other investments in the city that are also underway with Malaysian companies as individual companies, joint ventures, and investors.</p><h4>Malaysia is halfway through its chairmanship of ASEAN as the region moves toward greater integration. How will this further strengthen the relationship between Malaysia and the UK, and what are some of the ways in which the two nations will collaborate in the future?</h4><p>We need to work harder on the London side of things. We have begun issuing Islamic bonds and are active on the global Islamic finance market; however, there is scope to expand further, and I believe the link between Kuala Lumpur and London is a great opportunity on the financing side. This is building upon London's strength as a financial market. In addition, when the Mayor was in Kuala Lumpur, he also visited Indonesia and Singapore. It shows just how aware we are of ASEAN, and how it should be viewed. We consider Kuala Lumpur to be the entry point to it, and have shared concerns over terrorism. It is relatively low level, but we both need to cooperate in addressing it. There is a growth in the number of British universities coming into Malaysia, and it is important for them and good for the on-going relationship with the UK. The Mayor had been calling for an air link for British Airways with Kuala Lumpur, and it has finally been established. Those are some of the developments we are seeing today; however, we see matters going beyond that. We welcome this relationship and anticipate it only strengthening in the future. The World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF) is also an area where we have observed a tremendous amount of support and growth, with the UK's first sovereign sukuk being offered in London at the previous WIEF. These relationships are constantly creating new opportunities for both countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the current state of the relations between Lebanon and Mexico?</h4><p>2015 This year marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Lebanon and Mexico. Our relationship is mature and vibrant, nurtured by constant political dialogue, increasing trade and investment flows, and a desire to cooperate in a progressively widening number of developmental areas. Together we have witnessed seven decades of friendship, solidarity, cooperation, and mutual trust.  Relations between Mexico and Lebanon offer a vivid example of hard work, shared values, and confidence building for the future. The 70 years of common history are witness to that. Endowed with such a legacy, the two countries will now aim higher in this most valued relationship.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of your visit to Lebanon, and your Lebanese counterpart to Mexico?</h4><p>I went to Lebanon to further enhance our bilateral relationship with the country, bearing in mind that Mexico is home to close to half a million people of Lebanese origin, an important force in our economy, society, and culture. The Lebanese diaspora is no doubt the most visible and dynamic bridge between our countries today, and will continue to be an essential asset for our shared development in the future. In addition to my visit last February, Mexico had the honor of hosting Lebanon's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants, Mr. Gebran Bassil. On that occasion, Minister Bassil and I discussed important bilateral and regional issues, and signed agreements on how to foster a deeper knowledge of our respective societies and cultures. We also agreed on various programs that will draw our respective diplomatic academies closer together, and will also allow us to share better practices relating to the protection of our nationals living abroad. With my visit to your beautiful country, we plan to follow up on those initiatives and have added others to strengthen our cooperation, facilitate our trade and investment relations, turn our markets into preferred entry points to the Middle East and Latin America and the Caribbean, respectively, and promote more frequent parliamentary contacts.</p><h4>How do you envision the future of bilateral relations and what areas of cooperation will you focus on particularly over the coming years?</h4><p>Mexico and Lebanon have long enjoyed friendly relations, and the two nations have profited from this significantly. However, the level of development and modernization of our economies offer us great potential and possibilities that we must be able to develop and take advantage of for the benefit of our peoples. Frequent high-level political dialogue is an asset to both countries, and will allow us to identify new areas of collaboration, and successfully address any challenges we may face. Our respective private sectors have also set out to increase their involvement in a number of attractive sectors in each other's markets, such as agriculture, telecommunications, energy, and pharmaceuticals. To spearhead specific projects, during my visit, a Mexico-Lebanon Business Forum took place in Beirut, with the active participation of key Mexican and Mexican-Lebanese entrepreneurs. Mexico is also aware of the lively cultural scene in Lebanon. Various Lebanese figures, living in this country or elsewhere, have claimed worldwide attention in many fields. This is the case, for instance, of writers such as Hoda Barakat, Elias Khoury, and Lena Merhej; designers Nicolas Jebran and Elie Saab; architects Nabil Gholam and Hashim Sarkis; or artists such as Juliana Seraphim, Saliba Douaihy, or the Armenian Lebanese painter Paul Guiragossian. Such cultural blooming is also evident in Mexico. We are decided determined to bring more Mexican culture to Lebanon, and to promote cultural events that will showcase our history, traditions, and current artistic innovation. We take inspiration in Minister Bassil's phrase “Our border is the world,“ the slogan of the Lebanese Diaspora Energy Conference 2014; an event that reinforces the bonds between Lebanese residents and emigrants worldwide. Mexicans of Lebanese origin, and indeed Mexicans themselves, believe borders pose no limits to creativity and community.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ambitious-targets]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This year, Mexico and the EU celebrate the 15th anniversary of the signing of their Free Trade Agreement. What have been its main achievements?</h4><p>The past 15 years have been highly beneficial for both of us under this agreement. In just 15 years we have tripled our trade value, reaching $65 billion in 2014. The EU is now Mexico's third largest trade partner after the US and China. If we talk of investment, nearly 40% of all FDI in Mexico derives from the EU. We are the second largest investor in Mexico after the US. In 2014, the amount of accumulated EU FDI in Mexico reached $145 billion. With all this, our economies have grown increasingly connected to one another. Yet, the main achievement of our partnership goes beyond trade. The Free Trade Agreement is a part of a wider Global Agreement covering political dialogue and cooperation. In that regard, these have been fruitful years. We have developed a relationship of trust and respect; we have grown closer. In particular, we have enhanced our cooperation on human rights, on drug trafficking, on education and lately also on climate change action, ahead of the COP21 in Paris next December. We have also established several lines of contact at the governmental, parliamentary and civil society levels, all of which help in fostering integration. Mexico and the EU are like-minded partners in the fullest sense.</p><h4>What political and commercial areas should Mexico and the EU work on to boost international cooperation?</h4><p>As we said at the EU-Mexico Summit recently, we still have scope to increase cooperation in several areas. In particular, we need to do more on research and development, on renewable energy and energy security, on international migration and on organized crime, including drug trafficking. Security is a priority for us all. And we have to cooperate more on this. When it comes to a bilateral agreement on Passenger Name Records (PNR) with Mexico, we are fully committed, and my Commission has sought a clear negotiating mandate from EU Member States. But we have to be aware that we will not be able to finalize it until the European Court of Justice gives its opinion on a similar agreement between the EU and Canada. This is an important part of our efforts to thwart security threats. We also commend Mexico for its decision to resume participation in UN peacekeeping operations in Haiti and in the Western Sahara. We are convinced that we can cooperate and make strides together in improving international security and that in this way we will be able to do more together in crisis management operations. Concerning trade and investment, once the process begins to modernize the trade pillar of our Global Agreement, the specificities will be left to the negotiating teams; yet there is no doubt that in this increasingly interconnected world—and with our economies increasingly interconnected too; we will aim for ambitious targets that are mutually beneficial. We want to go beyond current World Trade Organization levels, reducing non-tariffs barriers, while still ensuring the protection of our citizens. We have to address public procurement and investment protection and we will need to have a new chapter on intellectual property that includes commitments on geographical indications. And of course, we will have to ensure a model of sustainable development that protects workers and the environment. </p><p class="quote">"Europe and Latin America share deep-rooted bonds."</p><h4>What will be the EU's approach towards the Latin American region in the coming years and what role will Mexico play in that regard?</h4><p>We had the opportunity to discuss this thoroughly this month at the EU-CELAC Summit. Europe and Latin America share deep-rooted bonds. We share values, principles, and interests. We share many years of history, too. Our approach to Latin America will be that of a relationship between equals, where we can take advantage of mutual benefits at all levels and where both regions assume their responsibilities towards one another and towards the rest of the world. We want to focus on building a partnership for the next generation by building closer economic links and reinforcing political dialogue. We are already deeply engaged in the region. The EU is Latin America's second trade partner overall, after the US. We are also the biggest investor in the region. Our stock of foreign direct investment there is larger than our stocks in Russia, China, and India combined. And by the way, Mexico features very high in comparison to other Latin American countries in both cases. But we are interested in taking the next step. We want to strengthen our bonds and we think Mexico is the right partner to help us do this. Mexico plays an important role in our wish to step up cooperation and relations with Latin America. It can be one of our ports of entrance to an even more beneficial bi-regional relationship.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major transactions and acquisitions of KUFPEC in recent years and how would you describe the company's position today?</h4><p>KUFPEC is firmly heading towards its 2030 strategy of reaching 200,000 boepd compared to its current 70,000 boepd production, increasing its reserve base to 650 million barrels and increasing its operatorship to 20% by the year 2030.  KUFPEC is confident of being a valuable subsidiary to Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) providing its sister companies such as Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) and Kuwait Gulf Oil Company (KGOC) a significant role in upstream technology transfer, best practice initiatives and Exploration &amp; Production know-how.  KUFPEC entered two very promising and large projects in 2014 toward realizing the 2030 strategy.  The first was a doubling of our equity stake in the Wheatstone LNG project in Australia.  This transaction will further add to our material production, expecting to receive the first gas in 2017.  Furthermore, the Wheatstone project is a strategic element not only for KUFPEC but also its parent company KPC, providing a priority status for KPC to be supplied with Wheatstone LNG if required, and meeting at least 10% of KPC's energy needs in the long term.  KUFPEC's second large transaction of 2014 involved entering a joint venture with Chevron in the Kaybob region of the Duvernay shale play in Alberta, Canada.  This large transaction provides KUFPEC with substantial material production for decades to come, adding an estimated 25% of our overall production by 2030, and thereby securing the future of KUFPEC.  Additionally, the Kaybob (Duvernay) project will develop KUFPEC's know-how with opportunities for the transfer of technology, assisting Kuwait's extremely rich and yet to be assessed unconventional energy resources in the future.  Our employees will have the valuable opportunity to work directly with the operator and transfer their newly acquired knowledge back to Kuwait.</p><h4>What role does acquisition and exploration play in your investment strategy moving forward?</h4><p>We have recently executed a number of acquisitions for assets in the development stage, and we will probably also make more acquisitions of projects in the production stage in 2015. However, all along the process, we will always focus our investments in exploration, because that is the most profitable investment that we can make. We have entered into exploration projects to that end, most notably the Paharpur block in Pakistan, which will be KUFPEC's second operated asset in the country. More than 40% of our production comes from Pakistan, where we have been present since 1987, having invested over $1 billion to make Pakistan a core business center for KUFPEC.</p><h4>How has the drop in oil prices impacted your operations?</h4><p>The price collapse we witnessed at the end of 2014 caused serious repercussions for KUFPEC's balance sheet.  Having said that, it is with pride that I report achieving a net profit of $40 million, surpassing our entire peer group who had all shown losses for 2014 due to oil prices remaining low.  We are in the “new norm" in price terms for the foreseeable future, and a quick snap back to higher prices such as the $100 we saw in 2014 is unexpected for the time being.  But with the price of oil down, costs have also deflated, creating an opportunity to execute our strategy by entering new acquisitions and core business opportunities in the coming years.</p><h4>What is your approach to investing in human capital, and particularly attracting Kuwaiti employees to join KUFPEC?</h4><p>KUFPEC's most valuable investment is its people, its employees.  Our successful investment is due to our competent, qualified and successful team.  KUFPEC heavily invests in developing professional career paths for our younger employees, and encourages its people to spend time working for KUFPEC in our offices and operations.  The opportunity to develop and grow our human capital is necessary since KUFPEC will ultimately be running more and more projects that we will be operate in the near future.  The Kuwait oil sector has always been an attractive employer and the industry of choice for young Kuwaitis, not only for petroleum related engineers, but also for those with financial and legal backgrounds as well.  Such employees are driven to work internationally and are bi-lingual.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>2016 will be an extremely busy year for KUFPEC, with the final progress for completion of the Wheatstone project leading the way.  We expect also to increase our production level, with more operatorship activities.  We will do all of this by first developing and empowering our employees to solidify KUFPEC as a partner of choice in the International E &amp; P business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Beirut Life benefit from the relationship with Bank of Beirut?</h4><p>It has become internationally acknowledged that banks no longer confine themselves to traditional banking products, but rather have evolved into financial institutions providing financial products and services. This includes a broad range of banking, insurance, investment, and financial advisory and planning services, and any combination thereof. Each of these facilities requires its respective professionals and experts. Yet banking and insurance are complementary services, since bankers are risk averse, while insurers are risk takers. Bankers accomplish their analysis of the finances and the current ability of clients to meet their obligations, and transfer all, or part of the unforeseen risk to us to evaluate and manage. Therefore, in order to become providers of a complete line of financial products and services, we combined efforts to design the products needed to satisfy our clients' needs, and convert our branches into a one-stop-shopping place for financial products and services. For us, Bank of Beirut comprises a captive client and their customers are our largest target market. Their physical locations and branches are our best channels of distribution. We see synergy as a situation where one plus one yields more than two, and with Bank of Beirut we experience synergy at its best. Naturally, this edge benefits ourselves and our clients, who benefit from our lower costs leading to products and services that are fairly priced.</p><h4>What does Beirut Life add to the Lebanese insurance sector as a newly established company?</h4><p>We believe that competition is the only route to perfection. We have a vision of becoming providers of specialty life insurance products, thus driving other companies to compete with us to the ultimate benefit of our customers. We aim to enhance the awareness of our market base on the importance of planning and protection against the financial impacts of life's unfortunate events and their resulting trauma. We also aim to tackle our customers' priorities by offering the most appropriate solution. All this will be coupled with the proper education, which will feature and emphasize the qualities of each product, as well as its target and limitations, if any. Only then will the client learn how to compare and contrast for optimum selection. In addition, our ability to physically reach a wider market through bancassurance will certainly help the industry gain new loyal clients and contribute positively to the size of the national portfolio. </p><h4>What is Beirut Life's product portfolio and target market?</h4><p>As a life insurance company, our target market is theoretically any individual eligible for and in need of a life insurance contract. However, we believe that product innovation is key, and that not all customers share the same needs. When analyzing consumer behavior in general, we notice that a client buys a product only if they clearly establish the need for it. In contrast, a successful producer is one capable of creating a need or highlighting it, and then developing a product to satisfy that need. To accomplish that, we have performed thorough market segmentation and considered each segment as a target market in itself. We constituted a focus group for each segment, made up of individuals belonging to the segment itself and asked them about their major concerns regarding their future financial or personal wellbeing. Based on their responses, we designed products to alleviate or ease their concerns. In connection, we realized that people tend to reject the concept of life insurance because it ultimately denotes “death," and that consequently they will not personally witness any benefit. We changed our concept and developed products from which a client will collect the benefits while alive, and use the proceeds to enhance his life and wellbeing. Our product portfolio includes, in addition to the conventional life insurance products, solutions that address the needs of male and female clients individually. It includes solutions for customers who look forward to starting their own business, or buying the house of their dreams, but who lack the financial means to do so. Our portfolio includes products that combine physical protection and financial planning to allow the insured and/or his family reach a stability level, at which they can meet all their financial obligations. </p><h4>What steps does Beirut Life follow to promote insurance awareness in Lebanon and the region?</h4><p>Although awareness is not a variable that can be measured numerically, other indicators may be used to depict its magnitude. Once we realize that an average citizen of Ireland spends 35% of their income on insurance products and that of England spends 25%, while an average Lebanese citizen spends only 1% on insurance, we will simply conclude that awareness among other constraints is inadequate. Moreover, most people fear the unknown, or more specifically, things that they cannot comprehend. In this context, we have to admit that an insurance contract and its fine prints is a document that is hard to grasp and consequently can generate ambiguity. At Beirut Life, one of our objectives is to contribute to the process of building customer awareness and invest to gear up and enhance the image of insurance in Lebanon. To accomplish that, we intend to play three major roles while assuming our duties as insurers. We intend to be educators, distributors, and fair claims payers. Each of these roles will have an obligation towards our customers, which will ultimately lead to more awareness, trust, and confidence.</p><h4>What is your main focus, as well as expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our philosophy at Bank of Beirut group is to identify challenges sooner than others and find the right solution before our competitors. Despite all the political and economical turmoil and instability around us, we remain optimistic. We believe that with each situation clients' needs might change, but they will never disappear. Their spending might diminish, but on the other hand their savings might also increase. It is up to us to shift our focus in parallel with the customers' priorities at different stages and try to satisfy them. During periods of stability, we focus on the stability factor and offer products that will maintain financial and economic stability for families, such as saving plans and life and disability plans. During periods of instability, we focus on the risks connected therewith, such as war and terrorism, and promote these covers. In times of economic difficulties lending increases, and we focus on this change to promote credit life contracts. Although we are confident that better days are to come to this part of the world, we will keep our focus on our major roles as educators, distributors, and fair claim payers and will proceed with our strategy in product innovation to offer our clients state of the art products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Education was one of the top priorities at the recent Summit of the Americas. How would you assess the results achieved during this international event?</h4><p>Equity and prosperity were the main themes of the summit, and to achieve either education is vital. A common region-wide education agenda was established at the Summit. The agenda prioritizes the continued further education of professors and teachers, improvements in early-years education (0-3 years olds), capacity building in science, math, and technology curricula, and increasing the quality and inclusiveness of education. It is hoped that these steps will develop talent and build innovation and creativity into our youth. In Panama, we are planning to invest in a number of technological colleges, in order to develop the technical skills of engineers and technicians. Our region-wide agenda was presented to the presidents of the respective states, and it was agreed that regional-cooperation through common programs and projects would shape the educational milieu of the coming years. After the Summit of the Americas, we arranged a follow-up region-wide education conference, the Summit of Prosperity and Education, where we invited the directors and presidents of universities, as well as regional political leaders. Establishing a common research-area and increasing the mobility of professors and students were the main outcomes.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the current status of the education sector in Panama?</h4><p>President Juan Carlos Varela has outlined that education should be a government priority. The targets and goals we have are very specific. First, we want to increase the number of preschool aged children in education. We are below the Latin American average: the average pre-school attendance rate in Latin American is about 72% and in Panama it is an unjustifiable 66%. We also want to increase the intermediary attendance rate. Currently, more than one-third of high school age students leave before completion, unprepared for the work force. Juvenile delinquency is a persistent problem in Panama, which is an important factor in the high dropout rate. In both cases, one of the strategies is to increase the number of schools. There is much infrastructure that needs to be developed. We also want to increase the number of in-school hours from 5 to 6, or 7. We also want schools to be more attractive to youngsters. We will invest in sports facilities and cultural and musical activities. Another challenge we have is giving our students who finish high school other opportunities aside from university to be successful in life. That is where our plan to invest in technological institutes comes into play. </p><h4>What is the importance of creating a strong synergy between higher education and the labor market to stimulate entrepreneurial skills among Panamanian students?</h4><p>Our Ministry and the Ministry of Labor have a number of joint projects in place, for example the ENADE, which is our institute for informal training. We also collaborate with technological colleges and universities in order to develop strategies to meet the requirements of the labor market. We have started investing in technical institutes. These colleges provide an alternative to university, and teach specific practical skills needed in the workforce. The private sector will contribute to the development of the curriculum. We are looking into models to follow, such as the technical institutes in Singapore. 70% of the curricula will be technical and practical and the remaining 30% will be personal and life skills. The private sector identified to us some of the key challenges to proficiency in the workforce. These included personal and language skills, in both Spanish and English. The institutes will teach in both Spanish and English, and prepare students to find a well-paying job. It is hoped that it will be no longer necessary for companies to source talent from abroad, as the Panamanian workforce becomes competent across a wide range of highly skilled roles.</p><h4>What is the Ministry of Education's strategy to introduce a bilingual education system in Panama?</h4><p>A complete, bilingual system will probably take 12 years to be fully set in place. We will start with primary and elementary schools. We are planning to change the elementary school curriculum, with some classes delivered in English and others in Spanish. We plan to do this is by preparing our elementary school teachers to become bilingual. We will have a one-year training program in English for our teachers. They will have four months of intensive English preparation in Panama, then, they will be sent to English speaking countries, mainly the US, but also England, and Canada. There, they will take part in a four-month English immersion program. Lastly, they will have four months of training in the classroom with a tutor in order to practice both their English and scientific skills. We expect to start the program by 2016 in private schools where it is hoped that 1,800 teaching staff will register for the program. We also have a program for professors of English, who will spend eight weeks on the English immersion program in an English-speaking country. The immersion program is tailored to teaching English as a foreign language. It is important for us to improve English language skills across all levels of education. Previously, professors had emphasized grammar, reading and spelling skills, but not speaking. We are hoping that the new programs will aid the development of the English oral communication skills of our students. Communication skills are the most important to have when entering the workforce.</p><h4>How will you work to make Panama an intellectual destination, attracting students and talent from around the Latin American region?</h4><p>Panama is the City of Knowledge. It is the hub of international airlines, telecommunications, financial companies, and banking centers; however, higher education has been a challenging aspect of development. Having the capacity to attract international students and faculty is a key objective for us. We have been improving the quality of our higher education system for the past five years. We will continue our efforts, and hope to have a flourishing higher-education sector going forward.</p><h4>What are the key objectives that you would like to achieve by the end of 2015?</h4><p>Maintaining the infrastructure of our institutions, increasing in-school hours, and investment in technical institutes and the bilingual skills of our students are the government priorities for education in 2015. We hope to see the first technical institute and the bilingual pilot schools up and running by the end of this year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the activities of the CMA evolved since the inception of the authority in 2010?</h4><p>The initial four years were challenging for the authority. The CMA came in to regulate a market that had been in place for at least 30 years since the establishment of Kuwait Stock Exchange. That role was previously given to a Market Committee headed by the Minister of Trade and Commerce, which did not reflect proper governance or match best global market practices. The CMA has separated the regulator from the market itself. Over the last four years, the CMA has been busy issuing the by-laws, building capacity and organizational structure, and recruiting young talented Kuwaitis to serve within the CMA. It takes time for a regulator to really see the full picture based on what the law has actually asked the market to do. Moving into our second four-year term, we started by amending 65 articles out of the 164 in the original law passed by the national assembly. These amendments have given the CMA the strength the power and the tools to meet international standards. We have very challenging tasks ahead. One of the most important tasks is joining the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). The second is to upgrade the Kuwaiti market to emerging market status. This will be very important for the economy and the market and will reflect the long and deep history of the Kuwait Stock Exchange and trading within the country. We are putting all of our efforts and resources forward to make sure that the market will be upgraded; this is our target.</p><h4>What are some of your regulatory focuses to make sure that Kuwait is moving toward that upgrade?</h4><p>First of all, we need to work very closely with the three main entities within the market: the Kuwait Clearing Company, the newly established Kuwait Bourse Company, and the brokerage firms. We are restructuring the role of these three entities in order to meet the international standards and prerequisites for the Kuwait market to be upgraded. We are working together to make sure there is a clear line of authorities and responsibilities, and that there is transparency, full disclosure, efficiency, and competitiveness in the market. The region is very competitive, and we would like to make sure that Kuwait Stock Exchange maintains its historical status. At the same time, we cannot work on this target without consulting and working closely with other regulatory authorities in Kuwait, mainly the Central Bank of Kuwait and the Ministry of Trade and Commerce. We have signed MoUs with both of them to make sure that there is synergy between the three regulatory bodies and the flows between us are efficient and professional.</p><h4>What have been some of the major changes in regulations of the stock market over the past year relative to foreign investors?</h4><p>With the new amendments to the law published in May 2015, the Kuwait Stock Exchange has been privatized. The Kuwait Bourse Company has been established—a first for the Kuwaiti economy. This opens the door for foreign international operators to have a stake of up to 44%. This will serve our interests in upgrading the market by bringing the best know-how into Kuwait and inviting partnerships with the most reputable international operators. We want to encourage foreign investors to come and to stay in Kuwait. By offering up to 44%, we hope international operators will have the incentive to run companies here long term. Second, the new amendment has exempted foreign investors from any taxes; dividends will have no tax nor will there be a capital gains tax. These two factors are addressing our target to promote the market to international investors.</p><h4>From a regulatory perspective, what is the difference between a conventional bond and a sukuk bond, and how can a company become eligible to issue a sukuk?</h4><p>We are working on this issue on two parallel fronts. We are in the final stage of issuing the bonds as well as sukuk regulations. Because they are different products, there is a market for each. Bonds are like any other fixed income product in any other market, while sukuk is subject to sharia principles. However, there are also differences within the sharia principles based on the sharia advisory boards. To come up with a benchmark, we have our own sharia advisory board within the CMA. The proposal for the sukuk has been sent to the board to get their final approval. By the end of 2015 it seems we will be able to issue the bond regulations. Having said that, there will be no effective market for the bonds, nor will there be an effective debt market if we cannot encourage the government to issue sovereign bonds, so we are encouraging them to do so.</p><h4>What activity has the CMA had in terms of licensing investment funds to operate in Kuwait?</h4><p>The crisis in 2008 changed the entire scene. Investors are looking into their investments very carefully, and in calculating the risk they have become very conservative. At the CMA we have no restrictions as long as investors are meeting requirements. Regulation is one part of the equation, but the market itself is a different thing. We are encouraging the establishment of investment funds, and since the CMA was established there have been at least 20 newly established funds, both local and international.</p><h4>What framework does the CMA have in place in order to protect both retail and institutional investors?</h4><p>The best way to protect investors is to educate them at an early stage on the laws, by-laws, and requirements. For that we have conducted ongoing weekly workshops. In these meetings different departments of the CMA present on an open floor and engage in discussions on different topics related to the market and the stock change. Raising awareness is 50% of the task of protecting investors. We maintain an open dialogue and explain the role the CMA plays, which minimizes the risk of violating the laws or the by-laws. The CMA is leading the effort to restructure the capital markets but everyone's participation is needed. The only way for investors to have an active role is to know exactly what is required from them.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the level of compliance you are seeing with the CMA's regulations?</h4><p>It is good and, in some areas, excellent. We have seen full compliance in disclosure requirements, listing and delisting, and licensing requirements. We will be finalizing the corporate governance code hopefully by the end of June 2015. This was one of the debatable issues a year ago and was postponed until June 2016 as we made revisions. We are also expecting very high compliance with this regulation.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the CMA in 2016?</h4><p>By 2016 we would like to have the corporate governance code finalized, as well as the bonds and sukuk regulations, and the market maker regulations. We would like to enter 2016 by upgrading the financial brokerage firms that are working in Kuwait to international standards. They have been asked to raise their capital to 10 million by the end of 2016. We plan to restructure the post trade model as well. We would like to see the newly created Kuwait Bourse Company start taking the lead and running their stock exchange. Lastly, we would like to become members of IOSCO and begin dialogues with international organizations to form strategic partnerships in terms of training and capacity building for the CMA.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the contribution that DP World makes to the economy?</h4><p>DP World is a vital component of Dubai's economy, contributing to the success achieved thanks to the vision of our leaders. Together with our partners we are contributing greatly to the development of our country both now and for future generations. HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, and those who came before him have set us on a journey to becoming the fourth largest port operator in the world today, with more than 65 marine terminals across six continents. The ports industry is a vital economic pillar. It supports a country's growth and prosperity. With its modern and efficient ports, Dubai has established an unrivalled position as a maritime hub for the region and our flagship Jebel Ali terminal provides gateway access to a market of more than 2 billion people. Our geographical advantage is complemented by a determination to innovate to meet the present and future needs of our customers. As Dubai prepares to handle the cargo required for Expo 2020, we are favorably positioned to impact world trade. Our acquisition of one of the world's largest free zones, Jafza, adjacent to our Jebel Ali port and within 45 minutes driving distance from Dubai World Central, will further enhance Dubai's position and integrate our services for business. Given Jafza's contribution to Dubai's GDP stood at around 21% in 2013, we believe the combination of free zone services and a world class port under one roof will be a key feature for Dubai's success in the future. The details of our operations at Jebel Ali underline our contribution to the country. In 2014, our UAE region handled a record 15 million containers, double-digit growth of 11.8% compared to the previous year. Capacity for an additional 2 million containers came on stream in the third quarter of 2014, providing the resources we need to achieve further volume growth. Capacity for a further 2 million containers is expected to come on line in the second half of 2015, taking total Jebel Ali capacity to 19 million TEUs. Looking ahead, the connection of Etihad Rail to Jebel Ali Port in the near future will result in a multi-modal supply chain that seamlessly links sea, road-rail, and air through the Dubai Logistics Corridor (DLC), making it a premier gateway for the region and the entire Middle East.</p><h4>How do you see the strategy of DP World in the build up to World Expo 2020 and beyond?</h4><p>DP World is a major player in supporting the success of this event and we are focusing on making sure we have the infrastructure in place to support the anticipated increase in trade flows by expanding capacity at our flagship Jebel Ali Port. In addition to the capacity expansions at Jebel Ali Terminal 3, we have the infrastructure in place for Terminal 4, which gives us the flexibility to roll out more capacity in line with market demand. Working closely with our customers is integral to our strategy and we also look forward to helping Dubai and the UAE host Expo 2020.</p><p class="quote">"We know from experience what modern infrastructure can do for economies."</p><h4>How will DP World's strategy and operations coincide with the Dubai 2021 Vision?</h4><p>Being a major supporter of Dubai and the UAE's economy, we are aligning ourselves with the vision to make Dubai one of the world's smartest cities. Jebel Ali's new container Terminal 3 will be the most technologically advanced terminal in the region once completed, featuring 19 of the world's largest and most modern quay cranes. The Dubai Trade electronic portal provides integrated electronic services that connect a wide range of trade and logistics providers and key government agencies, including Dubai Customs, within a single electronic window. Meanwhile, the integrated Dubai Logistics Corridor ensures that Customs, DP World (Jebel Ali Port), and Dubai Trade present the gateway of choice to the Middle East.</p><h4>How do you think that DP World acts as a partner for development of countries throughout Africa, India, Europe, and the Middle East?</h4><p>We know from experience what modern infrastructure can do for economies, helping to unlock potential and connect traders with world markets, supporting and driving growth. Ports are gateways to world trade and we invest for the long term, contributing to economic growth. We believe there needs to be more private sector and government investment around PPPs, a model we have pursued around the world. At DP World, we have invested over $6 billion over the last five years adding capacity and upgrading our infrastructure in countries around the world and becoming a major employer. For example, studies show some 36,000 direct and indirect jobs will be created by the development of our London Gateway terminal in the UK. Since taking over management of Dakar, Senegal, in 2008 we have made a major contribution to Senegal's economy with our development of the terminal and the local community. This includes creating more than 200 jobs for local Senegalese people, with specialized training given to all terminal employees, expanding their skills, and bringing operational efficiencies in line with our global standards. Our expansions there have raised capacity from less than 300,000 TEUs to more than 600,000 TEUs and DP World Dakar today handles around one-third more volumes than it did four years ago, benefiting both the trade and Senegal's economy. Meanwhile, our terminal in Callao, Peru is the largest and most efficient container terminal on South America's Pacific coast and the busiest terminal in the Port there. It is also one of the most productive terminals in the whole of South America. We officially opened the facility in 2011 and in our first year of operation throughput growth at Callao was 22%. It grew a further 22% the following year, proof that the capacity increase provided by DP World was quickly translated into growth opportunities, and a major factor in the increase of Peru's international trade. To date the cargo value handled by DP World Callao represents around 10% to 12% of total Peruvian GDP. DP World Callao serves both the importers and exporters of Peru, but importantly it acts as a gateway to trade across the wider region, which naturally benefits the Peruvian economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of UNESCO's recently launched #unite4heritage campaign in Lebanon, in terms of raising awareness and increasing protection of diversity and cultural heritage threatened by violence and sectarian discourse?</h4><p><span></span>In May 2015, I visited Lebanon and seized the opportunity to launch the #unite4heritage campaign in the National Museum of Beirut, which is a symbol of the greatness of this region and its diversity. In reaction to sectarian propaganda, this campaign uses the power of social media to create a global movement to support the protection of cultural heritage. To fight violent extremism, we must stand together and show that all cultures are linked, while explaining the value of heritage and resisting all forms of hatred. UNESCO relies on Lebanon to take this campaign forward with its unique social fabric and uncompromising defense of freedom of expression and with its committed and educated young people. Lebanon has already proven its commitment to peace by receiving hundreds of thousands of refugees as neighboring conflicts wreak social and economic havoc, and has also played a vital role in the fight against the illicit traffic of cultural property.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to strengthen the work of the UNESCO Office in Beirut?</h4><p>UNESCO has a large network of partners and donors that are called upon to provide voluntary contributions aimed at enhancing its work on the ground and broadening the scope of the projects' impacts. In the context of the Syrian crisis, and in line with the Lebanese government strategy, UNESCO is engaged in supporting youth, schools, and teachers in Lebanon. We have recently launched a new project, “Enhancing Access to Secondary Education and Quality Results for Youth Affected by the Syria Crisis (EASE initiative)," as part of UNESCO's new strategy called “Bridging Learning Gaps for Youth," focusing on accelerating access to quality education for young people, and strengthening education systems. Concretely, UNESCO aims to facilitate access to education to a significant number of youth affected by the crisis, while at the same time developing the capacities of education institutions to accommodate more students and to provide quality education services. By collaborating with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, UNESCO Beirut Office will support tuition for more than 1,500 secondary education students that will also benefit of preparatory and remedial classes. At the same time, teachers and administrators will benefit from capacity development activities with a focus on psychosocial support, inclusive education, and ICT in education. In collaboration with the Ministry of Education in Lebanon, UNESCO Beirut Office has also been implementing the Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) to reintegrate out of school children in Lebanon. In the context of the UNESCO Regional Project on Cultural Dialogue funded by Saudi Arabia, the Beirut Office has implemented several capacity building activities, including the coaching of certified trainers on dialogue skills, and developing a credit-based University Course now adopted in six Lebanese universities. UNESCO-Beirut Office and The Council for Development and Reconstruction signed an agreement to provide advisory services and high-level technical assistance to the Directorate General of Antiquities at the Ministry of Culture. UNESCO will monitor the execution of archaeological works in the World Heritage sites of Tyr and Baalbek, respecting their outstanding universal values, integrity, and authenticity. In the same context, prioritizing youth concerns is a key objective for UNESCO in Lebanon. UNESCO is integrating youth priorities in all its programs, and is trying to build an effective partnership with them.</p><h4>What activities and events will be launched in Lebanon in the framework of the organization's 70th anniversary?</h4><p>The celebration of UNESCO's 70th anniversary will honor the organization's achievements and actions throughout the world to strengthen the foundations for lasting peace and sustainable development, through education, culture, sciences, information, and communication. It will offer a great opportunity to reflect on the past and imagine ways in which UNESCO can make a difference in the future. In order to celebrate UNESCO's 70th anniversary, the Lebanese National Commission is organizing a series of activities in December. An international conference on "Safeguarding heritage and cultural diversity in times of crisis" will be organized at the UNESCO Palace in Beirut along with a series of events taking place at the closing ceremony. Students of UNESCO associated schools will present a show featuring folkloric dances from all five continents and songs illustrating the values of UNESCO. There will be an exhibition of drawings around the theme of "Describing UNESCO," while a competition will invite university students to produce a documentary about the Organization. Other initiatives include a painting seminar on the themes and values of UNESCO and a culinary festival.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Dubai's economic performance in 2014?</h4><p>Dubai has changed dramatically over the last three decades. I was here in the 1980s and it was totally different. Since then, it's become a major business center with a more diversified economy. It obviously has a strategic location. Its growing trade and tourism have helped Dubai become one of the top-five fastest growing cities in the world. In about 300 world cities in the recently released 2014 annual report, Dubai posted a 4.5% GDP growth and a 4.7% employment growth. Its high-quality infrastructure is well maintained, and the Emirate survives any challenges presented by the global economy. It had its downturn a few years ago, but the growth is expected to continue rising above the current level in the coming years and will be driven by both the government and the private sectors.</p><h4>How would you describe the national launch of the UAE chartered accountant certification?</h4><p>That launch was on the March 19, 2014 where the heads of major audit associations and accounting professionals launched this new joint task force to help forge better relationships. It's the first of its kind here in the UAE. The heads of seven major auditing associations and accounting professional bodies resolved unanimously to create a joint action task force to set up this chartered accounting certification. We hope it will create more credibility and awareness of financials. It will be sharing knowledge of key issues of accounting and financials both in the UAE and globally.  It will also implement a national qualification called “UAE Chartered Accounting." It will collaborate on research and policy creating for local and global financial issues, and will be a great stepping stone for knowledge-sharing by accounts.</p><h4>What about the application of the IFRS? In what ways will this create an environment that will prevent the risks that happened in the 2008 crisis?</h4><p>When the country announced plans to adopt IFRS, it knew what the locals would say. They referred to a number of benefits, mostly to do with equity markets. It is not surprising that academics have looked to equity markets to assess the extent to which the values have materialized from this IFRS. The evidence can be fairly characterized as mixed, partly because of the difference in samples. They have a wide use of proxies for the same underlying, but unobservable, idea. IFRS can be a little bit complex, but they are trying to make it as simple as possible. IFRS had many consequences, both for the valuation of equities and for the equity market more generally. Although there will always be winners and losers because of the change in accounting standards, because of the distributing effects, some consequences are regarded by some companies and investors as unbalanced.</p><h4>How would you describe Merali's role in the development of sustainable business practices throughout the UAE?</h4><p>Our motto is “plan with us." Our mission is to help our clients to excel with a professional, yet individualistic approach. The work ethic of the firm is about hard work, honesty, and trust. The firm has grown to its current position through organic growth. The success of the firm's growth has always been its commitment to treating clients as individuals. We may grow in size and statue, but the personal relationship between our clients remains paramount. We aim to add value to our clients by providing them solutions that suit their requirements. Our goal is to serve the needs of today's clients, whether private or public or listed with overseas operations, and help them achieve their vision.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe your product offering and their respective market shares?</h4><p>We have Nissan, Renault, and Infiniti. Nissan's offering covers 90% of the market, starting from the segment B of small or subcompact cars, to the large and luxury segment. With Infiniti we have 57% of the market, and we still have to expand the lineup for Renault. We anticipate that Infiniti sales will triple growth, because Infiniti's strategy is to produce more passenger car models as well as SUVs. Going beyond four or five years, China will play a significant role in the market.</p><h4>What is the AWR's main customer base?</h4><p>Through our offering we have an extremely wide client base. Our customers looking for quality and peace of mind buy the smaller cars, and those that prefer adventures in the desert buy the Patrol or one of our SUVs. For luxury, we have the Infiniti models. We specialize in light commercial vehicles that sell mainly to the SMEs and construction companies. Our leasing company has a fleet of around 5,000 units, which caters to different types of companies on the market. </p><h4>Considering the fierce competition among automobile retailers in Dubai, how do you differentiate yourself from your competitors?</h4><p>In a market with great leaders, we have the opportunity to compete with the best. We are growing faster than the market and improving our market share in two ways; firstly through our product, which has to meet the expectations of the customer in terms of style, quality, and technology. Secondly, we run the business using the latest and best processes in the world. We also invest in customer service training. Through all of these elements, we are able to maintain our status as the No. 1 company in terms of quality awards. We were the only private company in the UAE to be awarded the Palladium Hall of Fame award, and we were the first UAE automotive distributor to win the Dubai Quality Award.</p><h4>How does AWR build trust with its future clients?</h4><p>It is important to note that our customers are buying cars here, whereas in mature markets, they are still leasing cars. Buying a car is like buying a home, and the customer has to feel that they have selected the right partner. Today our job is not simply to sell the car; we work on communicating with customers in a personal way in order to build long-term and friendly relationships based on trust. </p><h4>Can you expand on your strategy to turn first-time car buyers into long-term customers?</h4><p>We have strategies to sell to three types of customers—single adults buying first cars, those buying replacement cars, and married adults buying family cars. In terms of selling first cars to new customers, we work on clear communication and advertising. If we have built their trust and confidence, those customers buying replacement cars or additional family cars will choose us. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the automobile industry in the next few years?</h4><p>Our expectations are high for the coming six years. Dubai is still a center for family tourism and a business hub, despite the oil price drop. The Dubai 2021 vision inspires our company, and our pillars of growth match those of Dubai's. We are aligned with Dubai. We anticipate opportunities for positive growth; we know our market and know how to overcome upcoming challenges.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkish Airlines has been named “Best Airline in Europe," “Best Airline in Southern Europe," “Best Business Class Onboard Catering," and was awarded “Best Business Class Lounge Dining" at the 2014 Skytrax World Airline Awards. To what do you attribute this success?</h4><p>This relates to the strategy and philosophy that the company has embedded in itself for the past decade by expanding its network and increasing its frequencies worldwide. Furthermore, by establishing affiliate companies like catering company Turkish DOCO, the company has gained the reputation of having the best gourmet cuisine. Turkish Airlines tries on daily basis to provide better services to its customers and exceed customer expectations, which contributes notably to overall success.</p><h4>Turkish Airlines is a European airline with the highest number of originating destinations in the Middle East. What factors differentiate your airline from the Middle East carriers?</h4><p>Due to the geostrategic position of Istanbul, a city that is within reach of major cities in Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and Northern Africa in just two to four hours. Turkish Airlines naturally gains a major advantage in respect to other carriers in the Middle East.</p><h4>What are some of the opportunities and challenges you encounter in the Lebanese market?</h4><p>While the exemption of the visa regime between Turkey and Lebanon has boosted the traffic between the two countries, regional instability has dented incoming traffic to Lebanon.</p><p class="quote">"Every year Turkish Airlines announces new destinations and ranks number one in terms of national destinations."</p><h4>In 2014, the total number of passengers carried by Turkish Airlines rose 13.3% to 54.7 million passengers. What destinations have enjoyed the greatest popularity and how would you assess Beirut's performance?</h4><p>Every year Turkish Airlines announces new destinations and ranks number one in terms of national destinations. For the past few years the Lebanese market has enjoyed services provided to Sao Paulo, Los Angeles, and Montreal with Turkish Airlines. With three daily flights, Turkish Airlines' Beirut office provides its passengers with minimum connection time and a wide network choice that has gained a solid reputation in the Lebanese market.</p><h4>What strategies do you implement to remain competitive in the Lebanese market, and is Turkish Airlines undertaking any initiatives aimed at increasing the interest in Lebanon as a tourist destination?</h4><p>Turkish Airlines conducts many advertisement campaigns in the Lebanese market to increase its brand awareness. Furthermore, Turkish Airlines organizes Fam Trips to various destinations in Turkey and abroad for its agents and corporate customers, in which they have the chance to explore new destinations for their customers. Unfortunately, due to the unstable situation in the region that is affecting Lebanon, incoming traffic has decreased. However, as the situation improves, Turkish Airlines will take the initiative in promoting Lebanon as a tourist destination.</p><h4>Which new routes or regions is Turkish Airlines prioritizing as part of its expansion strategy?</h4><p>Turkish Airlines is planning further growth in Africa in 2015 with at least six new destinations. We already have the largest network in Africa among foreign carriers, overtaking Air France and Emirates, having added a staggering 25 African destinations over the past three years. By the end of 2015, Turkish Airlines will have at least 45 destinations in its African network across 30 countries. North Africa continues to account for most of its African capacity but Turkish Airlines also has established a large presence in East, Central, and West Africa. Turkish Airlines is able to enter relatively thin underserved African markets by offering a myriad of connections to Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Narrow-body aircraft have been the driver of the African expansion strategy as it has used 737-900ERs to open up destinations as far as seven hours from Istanbul.</p><h4>How will the opening of Istanbul's third airport impact Turkish Airlines' operations?</h4><p>Istanbul's new airport, due to its enormous capacity will enable Turkish Airlines to achieve better time schedules and connections. The new airport is expected to host more than 150 million passengers from which Turkish Airlines CEO Dr. Kotil expects to host 70 million passengers in its first year of operation on the start date of the project October 29, 2017. The New Airport will be the new gateway to the world, offering fresh horizons for our passengers.</p><h4>What is your main focus for the year ahead as far as the Lebanese market is concerned?</h4><p>For Lebanon's market we are seeking to enlarge all our flights with wider aircraft to provide extra capacity for our passengers and provide them with a unique service experience on our new wide-bodied aircrafts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Paris Gallery Group work towards understanding the customer better and ensuring their satisfaction in Dubai's highly competitive luxury retail sector?</h4><p>Customer satisfaction is one of the most challenging and demanding areas for all service providers. In the luxury segment of the market where we operate, expectations are even higher. We follow our customers closely on the floor to learn about their needs and how we may or may not be meeting them. We conduct research through an internal team using the services of an external agency. We regularly host focus groups and take corrective actions when needed to fix elements that can improve our service, which could be individual sales teams or supervisors, the services and products available, promotions, or the ambiance of the shop. Last year we made intensive changes to enhance the ambiance in our stores and improve our services. We pay close attention to the floor, the lighting, and the flow, the merchandising and list of products, our employees and their interaction with customers and understanding of different cultures, and our customers' expectations when they walk into Paris Gallery stores. We launched a loyalty program in January 2014 to help us understand our customers' preferences, habits, and behavior, thus allowing us to be better prepared to interact with and serve them. The program has attracted over 300,000 members. We have also firmly established our presence on different social media platforms. We utilize customer input and reply to comments, positive and negative, and if something does not fit our customers' needs, we remove it from our portfolio.</p><h4>How would you describe your overall international expansion strategy?</h4><p>We have a presence in many locations across the region, and our strategy has not changed. We want to be the pioneers in countries in which other retail companies are hesitant to move. We have made progress towards opening our new store in Oman, and we are close to opening in Baghdad and Baku. In Morocco, we are studying the market and looking for the right strategic partner. Many shopping malls are being built in this area, and we hope that the momentum of these positive changes will somehow be amplified. In Egypt, when the situation was unclear after the elections a few years ago, quite a few real estate developments happened, which helped the luxury retail business. Huge shopping malls in Cairo plus many new projects increased the purchasing power of the population, which primed the environment for others to do business. Many companies had not foreseen this, and failed to gain an early presence. We are talking with many new shopping mall managements and developers, and Egypt is an integral part of our expansion plans as it is the country with the most potential in the region. Looking beyond the region, our ambition is to have businesses in London, Paris, or Milan; we are just looking for the right opportunities.</p><h4>In which ways are you attracting foreign companies to enter into strategic partnerships with Paris Gallery Group in the UAE and beyond?</h4><p>We are always on the lookout for strong and reliable partners. In the case of foreign companies, we explain to them how the UAE, and Dubai in particular, could become a good platform for their businesses. The experience I have had with potential partners is that many aspects of the services available here are unknown to them. We educate them and give them tours occasionally so that they can see for themselves how beneficial a partnership can be. Some companies already have ambitions to be in Dubai because it is the capital of luxury retail.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the landmarks and achievements of the Oberoi Hotel?</h4><p>The Oberoi is a luxury five-star brand that started 87 years ago. The Oberoi group is present in India, Bali, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The Oberoi, Dubai is our first milestone here in the UAE and officially opened on November 4th, 2013. Since then we have been recognized as Middle East's Leading Luxury City Hotel by the World Travel Awards for two consecutive years and Best New Business Hotel by Readers of Business Traveller Middle East in 2014, and what really puts a smile on my face is the number one position we have been awarded in service by ReviewPro, which ranks your hotel based on an aggregate of reviews from social media websites like TripAdvisor, Booking.com, and other similar platforms.</p><h4>What were the factors that contributed to these achievements?</h4><p>The hotel is extremely well designed and has one of the largest rooms in the city, expansive meeting venues, and panoramic views of the Burj Khalifa and Downtown Dubai skyline. But the real key to our success is our team. Our service is the secret of our success, and that is with any successful hospitality business. At Oberoi Hotels and Resorts, we invest a lot in our colleagues and follow a rigorous recruitment process. We have our own hospitality management school, The Oberoi Center for Learning and Development, which was established in 1966 in New Delhi. Most of the group's team members are trained there. Additionally, the group has a legacy of caring for the communities and leverages our people, our brands, our relationships, and our global reach because we are uniquely equipped to help our associates and guests create a better world to experience. Environmental stewardship and social responsibility are core to the way the Oberoi Group does business We care about our associates, guests, owners, and communities, and commit to doing the right thing for all our stakeholders. For every guest that enters our hotel, we try to discretely find out their preferences. We aim to completely personalize our service. Every team member in the hotel is empowered to take decisions in order to deliver exceptional levels of service to guests at all times.</p><h4>Since the opening of The Oberoi in Dubai, how would you describe your customer base?</h4><p>Middle East and Europe are our key source market. India undoubtedly remains strong given our brand presence across the peninsula. We have a strong network of sales offices across the globe. Weekend travel is from neighboring Emirates. </p><h4>How would you assess the level of competition for hotels in Dubai?</h4><p>I believe the level of competition here in Dubai is very healthy. There is a clear difference between luxury five-star properties and three- and four-star hotels, which all complement each other to position Dubai on global tourism and commercial maps. I am very happy that several great hospitality brands have opened here.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We aim to be the hotel of choice for those visiting Dubai and to have a comfortable stay and an enjoyable time in Dubai. Since opening we have maintained our positioning of being amongst the top 5 on TripAdvisor out of 481 hotels in Dubai, by guest reviews. We aim to build on what we have achieved over the last two years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Al-Habtoor Motors most notable achievements? </h4><p>We have hit record sales rates and growth in our product lines. We are punching well above our weight because we have great products and a fantastic team. BMI predicted 12% growth in the automotive industry in 2014. AHM achieved 38% YoY growth for Mitsubishi and Mitsubishi Fuso—the highest enjoyed by any Japanese manufacturer in the year. We hold about 50% market share of all Mitsubishi cars sold in the GCC for 2014. AHM is also recognized as No. 1 dealer in the GCC and in the forefront of the global automotive industry. We represent some of the best-known brands in the industry; Bentley, McLaren, Bugatti, Mitsubishi, Mitsubishi Fuso Trucks and Buses, and our new Chinese brands JAC and Chery. Our company is unique in that our products range from ultra-luxury cars to budget vehicles. </p><h4>What new markets would Al-Habtoor like to move into?  </h4><p>The most exciting markets are the GCC and Middle East, in general; markets we know very well. In the words of our Chairman, Mr. Khalaf Ahmad Al Habtoor, “We like to invest in what we know." We would also consider expansion into Europe and other markets. In November last year we opened the world's largest Mitsubishi 3S facility, with a total area of 230,000 square feet. On top of that, we have developed a tire and battery business brand called SpeedFit in collaboration with a major supermarket chain; we are in the process of developing fast-fit clinics in the supermarket parking lots, where the customer can receive vehicle service while they shop. We have been acquiring new aftermarket brands against stiff competition, and we recently became the UAE distributor for Lukoil automotive oils and lubricants.</p><h4>What differentiates Al-Habtoor from its competitors in terms of customer service and after sales? </h4><p>Last year, we put more emphasis on customer care. We launched our new customer charter to all employees, called 'Miles of Smiles.' It is based on five pillars: relationship, safety, investment, time, and feedback. We have moved our logistics operations to Dubai Industrial City (DIC), a 6 million square foot state-of the-art service facility. It is the largest workshop, storage, and parts distribution center in the world, offering first-class facilities to provide customers with the best service possible.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2015 and the next few years?</h4><p>In 2015 we will take our Bentley's franchise to another level; this will be helped by the arrival of the brand new Bentley SUV hitting the market in the first quarter of 2016. It is called the 'Bentayga,' and we have already taken deposits for 174 units. There will be over 18 Bentley products available by 2017. Our volume business and Prestige division are growing. Construction is underway on the 'World of Bentley' on Sheikh Zayed Road, a new Bentley landmark in the UAE and the first and largest of Bentley's global iconic showrooms. This state-of-the-art facility, one of 10 worldwide, is due for completion at the end of 2015 to early 2016. It will be an iconic landmark for the region. </p><h4>How do you think the auto industry will evolve over the next couple of years? </h4><p>In 2015, the auto industry is predicted to grow by 9.6% and 7.8% in 2016; however, we aim to surpass that with 21% growth. Oil prices are falling, making fuel, transportation, and logistics more affordable, meaning that people will generally have more disposable income. The dollar has also been strong against the yen, which has been a big plus for the region. There is considerable investment going into the market ahead of Expo 2020. With more governance and corporate responsibility, and in line with the government's long-term vision, UAE-based businesses are getting stronger and leading the region. Good sale growth is expected to continue for the next few years, and the UAE offers positive growth potential both in volume and high-end vehicle segments. Consumer spending is expected to continue in the short to medium-term, and AHM must be prepared if we are going to bring about returns.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The year's figures also revealed significant increases in hotel establishment revenues (up 9.8%), guest nights (up 7.4%), and average length of stay (up from 3.78 to 3.84 days). The growth in revenue is particularly notable considering the 9.2% increase in available rooms. Overall, figures indicate that our hospitality industry is in a healthy state and, most importantly, that growth is sustainable. The emirate's top ten hotel guest source markets remained almost unchanged in 2014, with China registering the largest growth (a 24.9% YoY rise in hotel guests), with India and the UK also showing significant increases, growing by 12.2% and 11.3% respectively. The devaluation of the Russian ruble resulted in a general global drop in the number of Russian overseas travellers, though Dubai was able to offset the decline with increases in guests from East Africa and CIS countries. In 2014, Emirates and Flydubai opened up new routes and expanded capacity on existing ones. At the end of the year, Dubai International surpassed London Heathrow to become the world's busiest airport for international passengers—an achievement that is all the more remarkable given that the airport underwent an upgrade project that resulted in an 80-day runway closure over the summer. Dubai made significant progress in further diversifying its hotel sector, increasing development of three- and four-star properties, as well as a number of five-star properties. In 2014, a range of attractions opened, such as The Beach at JBR and Jumeirah Corniche. Dubai has also added to its festival calendar with the launch of Dubai Food Festival and RedFest.</p><h4>What are the primary source countries of visitors?</h4><p>Dubai benefits from its strategic position between East and West, and its source markets are spread widely across the world. A key focus for us in 2015 is attracting first-time visitors from emerging markets, as well as new and repeat visitors from our established markets such as Saudi Arabia and India. Dubai is leveraging its geographic location to become a business and tourism hub for emerging markets in Africa and CIS countries. We expect to see increased visitor numbers, driven by the recent launch and upgrades of Flydubai and Emirates routes to these regions, as well as Emirates' plan to increase operations in Africa by over 40% over the next decade. Recent legislation in the UAE is also making it easier for tourists to visit. In March 2014, a UAE federal ruling exempted citizens of 13 EU member states from requiring pre-entry visas. This has already contributed to a 17% increase in hotel guests from these countries, and we expect this trend to continue.</p><h4>What projects or developments will drive tourism market growth going forward?</h4><p>In 2014 a range of new projects was announced, including the Dubai Parks &amp; Resorts' plan to build three theme parks, with the first phase ready in 2016. The project will go towards realizing our goal of transforming Dubai into one of the world's leading family destinations. It will be accompanied by other upcoming projects such as Dubai Safari Project, Wire World Meydan Adventure Park, IMG Worlds of Adventure, and the recently announced Dubai Historical District. Besides hotel openings in 2015 and beyond, development of Dubai's events calendar will also foster progress. We will soon be announcing the addition of a new festival modelled after the Dubai Shopping Festival. Closely linked to this is the continued rollout of DTCM's new e-Ticketing platform, which aims to expand event ticket distribution channels, enable more in-depth analysis of the events industry, and ensure customer protection and satisfaction.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>For long-term growth and to achieve our Tourism Vision for 2020 targets, we need to increase the number of hotel rooms in Dubai, while balancing the planned increase in supply with demand. We need to ensure that Dubai maintains its high occupancy rates and avoids room rates that are too high or low. We are continuing to work closely with our hotel and other partners to guarantee that Dubai remains an attractive destination for every type of traveller, while aiming to foster growth from emerging markets and diversify Dubai's source markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most pressing needs that currently divide the higher education sector, and what is American University's strategy to close that gap?</h4><p>With the announcement of World EXPO 2020, Dubai has some ambitious plans indeed. The vision of the leaders in Dubai is always to be number one. At AUE we support the national agenda by assessing the market needs and developing the required academic program. We have established highly active advisory boards of people from the industry who advise academics on the demands of the market. These boards support the objectives of the program, making it more relevant to the market and enhancing graduates' employability. In other words, they help us in the development and improvement of our current programs by teaching our graduates the skills they need. The challenge is to strategically form the kind of programs that will help our graduates compete in the market. We need to get away from the concept that universities only concentrate on theory. A university should bridge the gap between theory and practice. At this university, we have also added a third dimension of soft skills. Graduates with knowledge, experience, and skills should be initiative takers. When a student graduates, he or she should have a solid conceptual framework plus the right skills and experience. They should be creative, critical, and persuasive communicators. In summary, we are identifying market demand on a yearly basis to offer programs that really meet those demands.</p><h4>How does this strategy work day to day?</h4><p>The university intends to provide the the students a taste of the real world from day one of their joining through experiential learning. The teaching pedagogy and the program delivery incorporates lab sessions, field trips, and mandatory participation in extensive seminars and workshops. However, we are also noticing that the onsite training for some students is not very useful. For example, law students were sent to Dubai court to complete internships. They were not involved with real cases because they were not trusted with confidential matters. Instead, they observed and did menial tasks. The students were not given on-the-job training, so we started offering the internship in two parts, internally and externally. At AUE we have established a mock court. We signed an agreement with Dubai court and many renowned legal firms. We choose closed cases and remove the names of the parties. Students take the cases, then present and defend them in simulated conditions against a real prosecutor. As you know, the law in this country is in Arabic, and we also offer courses to improve public speaking and pronunciation. </p><h4>What are some of AUE's programs that employ a critical-thinking based approach with students?</h4><p>We offer unique programs that are in high demand in the market, such as digital forensics, used to solve cyber crimes; network security; and Information Technology Management (ITM), useful to counter the issue of people's lack of skills to manage IT resources. We also offer a Master's degree in Diplomacy and another in International Relations, the first of its kind in the region. Most of these graduates assume high profile leading postions. We have Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Security and Strategic Studies, which is unique in nature and not offered commonly. We work hard to deliver quality programs; this will keep us in the market. Quality is necessary for survival. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>Our goal over the coming year is to continue to strive to be one of the top universitites through offering quality, unique, multi-disciplinary programs. In addition, we want to contribute to society through the pursuit of education, learning, training, and research.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Education is Happiness]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[education-is-happiness]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the education-related obligations a government must fulfill?</h4><p>Education is a foundational part of the duties of any government. Education is a right and it should be available to the entire population like air or water. It is the absolute fundamental job of a government to provide broad access to education. In fact, if the government does a good job of fostering education, this positively affects a lot of the other things that they care about. Take economic prosperity, for example. If you have a well-educated population then they will go and find jobs and innovate. In particular, if you teach how to innovate, a good education system can be the basis of a prosperous society as well. Education leads to happiness. It is also the root of public health. Many of today's health issues correlate with education or lack there of, so any investment in education by a government can be effectively leveraged because it will pay back 10 fold as an investment.</p><h4>What are some of the key strategies that developing economies should be employing in order to facilitate investment in education?</h4><p>The developed world has centuries worth of history developing an education system and developing content, particularly in the US, where the education system at the tertiary level is very strong. In developing countries, the higher education system needs a lot of work. In India, for example, there are many universities opening up but they do not have enough teachers. In the Middle East, many people are graduating, but when they search for jobs, there are skills gaps. One approach to addressing all of these issues in developing countries is to do what India did, which was to skip the land-line generation and go straight to wireless, cellular technology in the communications area. I think developing countries can apply the same tactic to their education systems, where they invest in online learning. Today's online learning is high quality, and is a very effective investment where the government can invest in devices and bandwidths for its people, and then provide education online. In the UAE in particular, the connectivity is remarkable, whether it is wireless, cellular, or broadband. They could easily make online content available and then through nonprofits like edX, where we have free content on our site from some of the best universities in the world like MIT and Harvard, content can be made available to an entire nation very effectively through licensing or other means.</p><h4>In what ways do you see both private companies, non-profits, and the government working together to form a comprehensive approach to educational development?</h4><p>The key to these partnerships is public-private partnerships, and I can give you an example. EdX has already partnered with Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Labor, and we launched a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform in partnership with them. They used the open edX platform to launch their national platform infrastructure for online education. Similarly in Jordan, the Queen Rania Foundation launched Edraak, an education initiative of the Queen Rania Foundation for Education and Development. We would be delighted to partner with the UAE to create a similar online infrastructure. It is very inexpensive in comparison to all the other investments the government might make and it can be effectively leveraged on a massive scale.</p><h4>How does edX play a role in assisting the government to fill the skill gaps in the ever-evolving labor market?</h4><p>It is the job of the government to create foundational infrastructure. For example, in regards to transportation, governments will create highway systems and then private industry will drive the trucks to deliver goods around the country. Similarly, the government can create a national infrastructure for online education by using a platform like open edX, and then private companies can leverage this online infrastructure to create content for it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Emaar Hospitality's primary focus?</h4><p>Emaar Hospitality Group fulfils a key function in the integrated community development approach of global property developer Emaar Properties PJSC. The primary focus of Emaar Hospitality Group is to create, develop, and manage prime hospitality and leisure assets within Emaar's developments not only in the UAE, but in key global markets. These assets play a significant role in adding to the lifestyle choices of resident and visitors. Over the years, we have developed several iconic hotel brands in Dubai including our flagship The Address Hotels + Resorts in addition to Vida Hotels and Resorts, as well as Arabian Ranches Golf Club, Dubai Polo &amp; Equestrian Club, Dubai Marina Yacht Club, and serviced residences. We also manage Emaar's portfolio in Dubai and other markets such as Turkey, Egypt, and Nigeria. We are expanding our capabilities to develop and operate new hotel concepts; currently, we are rolling out a new hotel brand for the joint venture between Emaar Properties and Meraas Holding. In Nigeria, The Address Hotels + Resorts is managing the first phase of residential and hospitality development in the Abuja Centenary City, developed by a private investment and real estate development company. </p><h4>What will the brands of Vida Hotels and Resorts and others add to the portfolio of Emaar Hospitality?</h4><p>With each of our hotel brands, we have a very niche and distinctive positioning. For example, The Address Hotels and Resorts is a five-star premium brand, and with Vida Hotels and Resorts we offer lifestyle boutique hotels that appeal to the new generation of tech-savvy youth and entrepreneurs. Vida Hotels and Resorts is also managing our upcoming property Manzil Downtown Dubai. Manzil offers a stylized hub with an engaging service based on Arab hospitality assuring memorable experiences for the urban traveller. Drawing inspiration from both Dubai's heritage and its remarkable leaps of achievement, the properties serve as smart, tech-savvy, social, and cultural hubs for international explorers. Ultimately, we aim to deliver refreshing, innovative, stylish, and exquisite experiences for our guests across different touch-points. </p><h4>What is Emaar's growth strategy over the next two years?</h4><p>Our growth strategy is to further consolidate our presence in Dubai's hospitality sector with a diverse portfolio of elegant lifestyle properties, as well as explore management contracts in fast-growing international markets. In Dubai, we complement the Tourism Vision 2020 announced by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, to welcome over 20 million annual visitors by the turn of the decade. Our development strategy will also support the preparations for the World Expo 2020.</p><h4>There is a lot of news lately regarding three- and four-star hotel chains like Starwood and Marriot developing hotels in Dubai. How will these affect the hospitality industry?</h4><p>With the city serving as a strategic hub, only four hours away by flight to over 2.5 billion people, developing a diverse hospitality sector that offers varied choices for visitors will contribute to the robust growth of the sector and the economy as a whole. The development pipeline of the value segment no doubt holds tremendous potential and will complement the portfolio of five-star and ultra-luxury hotels. In fact, we are creating our own niche in the value sector through our new hotel brands. </p><h4>Some hotel brands are shifting from single unit hotels to hotels based around entertainment areas. How is this industry evolving in Dubai?</h4><p>Location is of strategic importance for the success of a hotel brand and individual properties. Each of The Address Hotels and Resorts five properties in Dubai is located in unique lifestyle destinations that offer more than the “hotel experience" to guests. For example, The Address Downtown Dubai is located centrally in “The Centre of Now," next door to Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. This trend is now taking further roots in Dubai with several new hotels being part of dynamic locations that offer easy access to a wide range of leisure and entertainment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the dynamic between the traditional Jumeirah Hotels brand and the new Venu brand?</h4><p>Stay Different, the original Jumeirah brand, has always been the foundation of the Group, which we are continuing to develop regionally and internationally. Venu, our newest hotel brand, is a contemporary lifestyle brand aimed at competing within the lucrative lifestyle segment. We are more flexible on room size with the Venu brand depending on the style and feel of the hotel; we would consider, for example, a room size of 32-35sqm for this brand. Jumeirah hotels usually have a 50sqm minimum room requirement. The target audience for the Venu brand is also slightly different, though not necessarily younger or more budget-conscious than that of Stay Different; the two brands complement each other. </p><h4>What is the strategy behind your food and beverage division?</h4><p>Our dedicated food and beverage division, which is essentially a separate company, is composed of 32 restaurants located in our hotels in Dubai. They rent space within our hotels and operate outlets as standalone restaurants. We wanted to give our hotel guests the feel of dining at a restaurant that is not part of a hotel operation. We offer them exceptional cuisine, a dedicated service team, as well as a distinctive concept and theme unique to that particular restaurant. We have a large portfolio of brands—the Noodle House being the most widespread—and we are continuing to expand the franchise.</p><h4>Regional and international expansion is of high importance to the Jumeirah Group, which now has representation throughout North Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. Which international markets present the greatest opportunity for growth?</h4><p>Asia continues to be a very interesting source of business for potential hotel development. There are still opportunities to expand our Venu portfolio in China, and we are not yet present in Beijing, Dalian, or Tianjin. We would like to open another hotel in Shanghai in addition to the already successful Jumeirah Himalayas Hotel. Likewise, Vietnam and Cambodia have good potential; we already have a resort under development in Bali, and Indonesia offers attractive opportunities. We aim to be in Malaysia as well. The Middle East is of prime importance, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia. There is great potential in Africa, especially for Venu. We have already signed an MoU for a project in Angola, and we are looking at South Africa and West Africa. In East Africa, there are opportunities in places such as Kenya and the Seychelles, in addition to Mauritius, in which there is already a Jumeirah resort under development.</p><h4>Considering the expected influx of three- and four-star hotel investments, how do you see Dubai's hotel industry evolving over the next couple of years?</h4><p>Any mature market needs to have a complete range of products in terms of the styles and types of hotels. As Dubai expands and develops its tourism products, including theme parks and other activities for families, a budget hotel may suit visitors' needs better. With the growth in numbers of travellers coming to Dubai, there will be a great need for more affordable hotel options. Dubai has always maintained a very high-quality, high-class image, and it will continue to do so in its budget offerings.</p><h4>Dubai has lofty targets for the buildup to the World Expo 2020; however, there is also a lot of concern for 2021. What are the industry's expectations given the climate right now?</h4><p>We are feeling confident given the status of Dubai's current hotel development pipeline. In addition to hotels, we are also taking into account the number of serviced apartments coming online. In order to sustain an organic growth pattern, we have set a target to achieve 20 million visitors prior to the World Expo 2020. We also expect there will be a considerable demand increase coming out of 2020. We do not anticipate having to turn guests away, but hotels will be at capacity with roughly 25 million people coming per year. Dubai's tourism market already has strength and depth, and it will be able to continue its evolution and growth subsequent to 2020. In addition, the continued growth and expansion of the Emirates airline will support this. Having said this, the industry cannot be complacent, and we will work hard to promote Dubai and continue stimulating demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[some-much-needed-rr]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does DHCC build a sustainable model for healthcare in Dubai?</h4><p>In 2002, during the launch of DHCC, our founder HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, said, “The growth and development of any successful economy depends heavily on the health of its citizens." In harmony with this early—and realistic—outlook, DHCC has expanded healthcare capacity and improved healthcare quality. Over the past 12 years, we have increased specialties and addressed capacity gaps in a regulated environment. We have increased the number of training programs for medical education, and we are facilitating much-needed research into regional health issues. In tangible terms, DHCC is today recognized as the world's largest healthcare free zone, occupying 27 million sqft. In 2014, we recorded 1.2 million patient visits, and our healthcare community has 4,500 healthcare professionals, 90 specialties, and 320 clinical and non-clinical facilities. In March 2015, we announced plans to build water-facing rehabilitation and wellness facilities covering 3.3 million sqft. Our Phase II expansion implements our founding vision, and is in line with the UAE Vision 2021 and Dubai Plan 2021. Phase II will build DHCC's position as an internationally recognized location of choice for quality healthcare and wellness, medical education, and research. </p><h4>How would you describe the role that healthcare plays in the growth of the UAE?</h4><p>Economic stability and citizens' wellbeing are linked in quantifiable ways. Healthcare is one of the pillars of the UAE's economic growth, offering a great deal of opportunity for investment and economic diversification. An increasing and aging population, increasing income levels, insurance penetration, and incidence of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and obesity, are driving the demand for healthcare and pushing costs upwards. To cope, the healthcare model has to build a strong foundation of soft and hard infrastructure to sustain growth. Dubai is building its reputation as the preferred healthcare investment destination and reversing the trend of outbound medical tourism. And while the DHCC is enabling better access to high quality healthcare, the rollout of compulsory healthcare insurance will boost the sector overall.</p><h4>What regulations has DHCC implemented to further invest in the development of the healthcare industry?</h4><p>Attracting investment, a skilled workforce, and patients requires a strong, comprehensive regulatory framework comprising tools such as accreditation and quality standards. Without this framework expansion would be at the cost of quality. Regulation and licensing of all healthcare professionals and healthcare operators together with the handling of any complaints arising from the provision of clinical services is overseen and handled by the DHCC Authority, the governing body and regulator of DHCC. In January 2015, DHCC added 34 countries to its licensing framework for its healthcare and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) professionals, totaling 63 countries. DHCC also introduced a policy for visiting physicians to ensure that only physicians with high qualifications and competencies in their respective clinical areas can practice, and in 2014, we introduced an independent appeals board. To drive quality in healthcare delivery, apart from regulations, medical education avenues from certification and training to academic programs are required.</p><h4>How important is developing and furthering local talent and research?</h4><p>Education is a key pillar supporting our nation's sustainable growth and knowledge-based economy. The Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences (MBR-UMHS), DHCC's first medical university, will help develop a sustainable workforce in the UAE and the region. The Hamdan Bin Mohammed College of Dental Medicine is the first college established under the MBR-UMHS, and has six postgraduate programs, accredited by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MoHESR) in collaboration with the UK-based Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd). As of January 2015, 60 residents have enrolled. The second is the College of Medicine for undergraduate medical students, which will receive its first students in September 2016. DHCC entities such as the Khalaf Ahmad Al Habtoor Medical Simulation Center continue to develop technical and non-technical skills, have trained close to 3,000 multidisciplinary healthcare professionals to date. In Phase II, we have the Swiss International Scientific School Dubai, the first UAE-based private school to offer multi-lingual education.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	How would you evaluate the performance of the IPO of Amanat Holdings?
</h4><p>
	The IPO of Amanat Holdings was established at the end of 2014, a year that brought an upbeat trend and a lot of optimism in the capital markets, and in the region as a whole. To that extent, it was the right time to launch a company the size and profile of Amanat into the market. After we were approved for listing in 3Q2014, we pursued that opportunity. The Amanat IPO was 10 times over-subscribed, which is a sign of the confidence and faith from the investment community and our backers in the company. Amanat is an investment company that only makes promises it can fulfill.
</p><h4>
	How did the impact of the oil price drop affect the trading value of Amanat Holdings post IPO?
</h4><p>
	The price drop was not foreseen by anyone. Given the dependence upon oil in this part of the world, sentiment has further exceeded the reality of what implications this will have; whether that price adjustment is short term or longer term, the sentiment has surpassed the potential implications. As a result, the capital markets have had weak performance. We have witnessed around 35-40% contraction from the pre-oil adjustment to where we stand today in terms of the stock market as a whole. Anything of that magnitude is somehow deemed a crisis, and so in relative terms, the share price of Amanat Holdings has dropped to below the original IPO value, covering between a 10-15% discount. Now, obviously, any negative performance is something that we do not want to see, but relative to overall performance, our share price has outperformed the market.
</p><h4>
	What acquisitions is Amanat considering, and how do they fit into the company's long-term objectives?
</h4><p>
	In the strategy document of our prospectus, it states that Amanat's strategy will have a significant emphasis on acquisitions; around 70% of our capital goes to what we define as platform companies. This remains very much our approach. We anticipate announcing one or two investments in 2Q this year, based on current progress. At this time we are quite optimistic that this is achievable. We are choosing the best opportunities we see in the market, and there are actually more deals than we can accommodate. It is really about selecting the ones that fit in terms of profile and appeal.
</p><h4>
	How does Amanat Holdings' overall strategy reflect the current investment environment within the GCC?
</h4><p>
	We are fortunate that Amanat Holding was a company that was built from the bottom up. It was a strategy to test on the market and one based on transactable opportunities we could see on the ground; Amanat was created to be the conduit to facilitate those transactions. Our management team comes from a private equity-model background, which is a medium-term partnership model. The team migrated to an outfit like Amanat because the health and education sectors seek long-term partners. Amanat is a company where shareholders have the option to buy or sell, reduce, or increase their ownership at will. No one else in the market can offer this, which gives Amanat access to businesses that would not conventionally entertain private equity capital.
</p><h4>
	What are your expectations for the coming year?
</h4><p>
	The current landscape is promising both in terms of supply/demand dynamics, and by the availability to good candidate investment companies. As it stands, the coming three years will be a compelling time for Amanat to deploy its capital in building a quality portfolio. On the back of this, Amanat can move from a phase of active deployment, to a phase of business development for its portfolio companies. Our first phase of investing is through partnering with champion companies. Once we have established these partnerships, the next phase of capital deployment will involve funding the expansion opportunities of partners, both locally and in neighboring markets.

		<title><![CDATA[A STRONG PORTFOLIO]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-strong-portfolio]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of GulfDrug over the past year?</h4><p>We have had some good results, and business has picked up since last year's major growth in retail pharmacies. Many hospitals are being built, or undergoing expansions, as the government has been investing more in infrastructure. GulfDrug has been able to sync up with these positive developments. Being in the healthcare sector, we always have to be able to service the current and growing needs of the economy. </p><h4>How has GulfDrug's portfolio evolved in line with last year's growth?</h4><p>One of the major portfolios that we have streamlined with GulfDrug over the past two years has been imaging; we sell CT scanners, MRIs, and ultrasound machines from Toshiba. We have been able to place these within many private and public hospital projects. We work with a company called Carestream, which is the former Kodak, that provides larger solutions for clients to meet imaging requirements. We have expanded our portfolio for disposable and invasive products, and we have launched new products in the gastro and IVF segment. In addition to pharmaceuticals, many cutting-edge oncology products from Pfizer have come out, and major pharmaceutical players are developing more niche products for the harder-to-treat diseases.</p><h4>How important is innovation for a company like GulfDrug?</h4><p>Innovation comes from new and better products. In terms of distribution, it is important to be able to smoothly introduce these and upgrade products. With the CRM module and other tools we introduced in 2013, we can better track our interactions with customers. Considering our expanding portfolio, this is important for each product. We value internal innovation in regard to tools and technologies and managing new challenges with our current products. </p><h4>How has the introduction of compulsory health insurance impacted your operations?</h4><p>It was an important missing piece of the puzzle to offering sustainable healthcare services in the UAE. Prior to this development, only a small percentage of people had access to the best hospitals and medicines. People were moving from the Emirate to seek healthcare elsewhere, and as such, the UAE was losing economic productivity. More of the middle class, the driving engine of the economy, are now covered. As a result of the new system, healthcare business volumes have grown, the long-term viability of hospitals has increased, and the sector has become more sustainable. We have seen growth in treatments and the utilization of pharmaceuticals, which has motivated the companies that own the hospitals to expand. </p><h4>What potential does Dubai hold to become a world medical hub, and how can GulfDrug contribute to this goal?</h4><p>As is usually the case in Dubai, or the UAE, the issue is not  one of building construction or creating the infrastructure. The challenge will be to attract high-quality doctors. When it comes to sophisticated medical treatment, patients will go where the quality doctors are. Work volumes for doctors have increased with the new insurance system, giving them more reason to be here; thus the number of medical tourists coming to Dubai will grow. With this in mind, and with governmental support, Dubai can become a hub; everything indicates that we are moving in this direction. The investment environment has improved dramatically over the past two years, and hospitals are competing on price and quality. On our part, GulfDrug has continued to provide a solid portfolio in many segments; hence, we stand to benefit from an upsurge in the sector by servicing in specialized areas, such as gastro, dialysis, and intensive care. We are also filling needs in terms of imaging and hospital equipment. </p><h4>How would you evaluate your financial performance for 2014, and what are your expectations for 2015?</h4><p>In terms of volume, growth has been recorded in the double digits. There is a high level of financial confidence in this sector because payments are reliable. Insurance guarantees payments to hospitals, thus hospitals are able to pay the suppliers and their doctors. The government has been continually reducing the margins for distributors and reducing the prices of medications. Hence, the drive of the UAE is to standardize and continue reducing prices, which presents a challenge for providers as costs increase. We have managed our growth carefully.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>At last year's WEF Saudi German Hospital was awarded the Global Growth Award. What impact does this have on the objectives of Saudi German Hospital going forward?</h4><p>International recognition from the WEF always gives a positive push. International recognition by a platform such as the WEF gives reassurance that we are on the right track. Our group vision 28 years ago was to establish a successful healthcare organization, and we began by building hospitals in cities throughout the GCC. To expand in the healthcare industry is complicated, and successful implementation is very difficult. Considering SGH's aggressive rate of expansion, recognition is therefore rewarding and will only propel our efforts forward.</p><h4>What is the objective of SGH here in Dubai?</h4><p>After establishing ourselves in Yemen, we expanded to Dubai with the same objectives; it was a strategic move. We want SGH in Dubai to be a successful part of the Group and also to be part of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum's vision for healthcare within the Emirate itself. Dubai is a healthy environment for investment with much potential. We have given a tremendous level of importance to developing our hospitals from scratch, and we have a unique vision for how we will grow in Dubai. Phase I of our establishment is complete; a 300-bed tertiary hospital. Our long-term plan is to create a Saudi German Healthcare City in Dubai, which will consist of a general hospital, main hospital, and six sub-specialty hospitals, along with a medical tower. We are already in Phase II of our plan, which includes adding three specialty hospitals. Our hope is to have the Phase II completed by World Expo 2020.</p><h4>In Dubai's competitive healthcare landscape, what strategic advantage does Saudi German Hospital possess?</h4><p>Of course it is very difficult to enter a market that is already saturated. We have had to prove ourselves in a very short amount of time in order to capture and keep a customer segment; this has been a driving factor for establishing our reputation. To enter a market already dominated by private and public-sector players and establish ourselves, we had to put a tremendous amount of energy into building a management team and a base of skilled, world-class physicians. We used this combination of talent and experience to identify market needs and work closely with government regulators and players. We feel that we are all partners in the development of a world-class healthcare city.</p><h4>How does SGH see medical tourism as an opportunity for growth?</h4><p>The UAE in itself represents a great opportunity for growth. Due to our reputation and expertise, we are able to attract what we call domestic medical tourists, meaning those living in other Emirates who travel to our hospital for treatment. Within this segment of customers, we are able to attract referrals from other hospitals within the UAE whose patients need advanced or specialized procedures. With the growing population of Emiratis travelling abroad, we have also seen an influx of what we call reverse medical tourists; those patients returning from abroad to have medical operations done here or continue their treatment plans. Finally, we see a tremendous opportunity in the traditional medical tourism segment coming from the GCC, Africa, and Asia.</p><h4>Recently the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) imposed a price-cap on the increased cost of healthcare services at 4.22%. Looking forward, how will this affect operations at SGH?</h4><p>We understand the rationale behind the DHA's decision. However, we want to underscore the importance of two-way communication between hospitals and the authorities, to ensure that the price-cap is implemented in a way that benefits everyone. Insurance companies and other players as well will be affected. Due to the recent announcement of these regulations, the healthcare investment climate has chilled slightly because investors are concerned about their returns; the same goes for SGH. While there are many concerns about these regulations, ultimately we are confident that through free-flowing communication between all industry stakeholders, we can ensure that the sector continues to be both profitable and socially beneficial.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main benefits and advantages for investors wanting to invest in the area?</h4><p><span></span>Al Zorah was established by a joint venture between the government of Ajman and Solidere International. The government brought the free zones and Solidere brought all its expertise in making cities. After these master plans, the investors are going to enjoy both Ajman as an emerging Emirate and Al Zorah as an integrated project, also emerging as a community with a good lifestyle and a lot of attributes that investors like. Apart from starting a business and getting the reputation and residency associated with that as a free zone area, you can get a package deal as a free zone area and all the properties. The mixed-use aspect is catering to many investors. There are land investors that can build their own projects. Also, Al Zorah makes a lot of sense business wise. It is masterfully crafted, so it is something that will sustain itself over time. It's not something that you just come in and come out of; real estate is about value creation. As time passes, the value will become higher and higher.</p><h4>What kind of investors are investing in Al Zorah?</h4><p>We started with the big investors interested in buying land to develop. Now, we are offering villas in a limited number with the best scenery, like on the Gulf. In Phase II, we will offer apartments by the beach or around the marine and townhouses on the Gulf. This is a free zone, so the profile of the investors is people who are looking to come to Al Zorah to have 100% ownership over the land. Once a business is established, you get residency. The Al Zorah Free Zone Authority issues trade licenses, in that respect. Once you get your trade license, you can get residency and bring in employees and enjoy zero taxation. From a business point of view, it's not just that the quality is amazing, but also that it makes so much sense because of zero taxation, and because it's an easy place to establish a business and operate. Investors that work with us are more worried about value than anything else, so we create the right value for their money and we are committed to continuing this job at the right place so we don't overdo or underdo it. We want to present value for people. We have done it elsewhere in the world. That's why here we don't over build; we have just the right amount. If things slow down in the future, I think Al Zorah will be in the right position to sustain the changes in the market.</p><h4>What is the current status of the master plan?</h4><p>The master plan is well advanced and Phase I should be completed by the beginning of 2016. It will include all of the main infrastructure, while an 18-hole golf course, villas, two five-star resorts on the beach, and four marinas have already been completed. One of the marinas will be ready to receive boats during Phase I. The best part of this project is the nature. We have natural mango trees that are second to none. You can bring your kids and go kayaking. You can see pelicans and 52 species of birds. You are in touch with nature. That's a big asset that doesn't exist in many places in the UAE.</p><h4>What are your future plans of expansion?</h4><p>We build places for life. We are really passionate about our business. In the last 25 years we have taken the business from Lebanon and made it international. Apart from the locations we are already in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Lebanon, we are now looking into three new international destinations. Our investors like those destinations and they are very promising. We are now very strong regionally and we will become more international in the coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the strategy behind Danube Group entering the property development market, and what is your strategy going forward?</h4><p><span></span>Going into development was simply following the evolution of the company. It has given us an edge over the other competitors. We always work in places where we have good synergy as we become a developer. The brand name was already there. After Dubai won the right to host Expo 2020, the market stabilized unlike before, so we felt that this was a great time to begin developing. Looking forward, I want to go cautiously and not do too many projects at one time. I want to take one project at a time, sell that project, consolidate, and move forward. That's what we've been doing in the last two projects. We bought some land, created a mass development, offered it in the market, sold it, and then went for the next property.</p><h4>How would you describe the theme of your developments along with the customer segments you are targeting?</h4><p>We are always targeting the middle-income market of people with salaries of around $6,800. We never go for luxury. This middle-income bracket should be able to afford our projects, and there is also a vacuum in that segment.</p><h4>How will the brand of Danube's property development arm evolve over the years?</h4><p>Emaar and DAMAC are good brands and have developed and done well in the past. After them, in my segment, there is not a single branded company that is available in the market. For example, the property that I recently sold, Glitz, was selling for $245/sqf, but my competition, which is a bigger brand, could sell the same thing at $340/sqf. They are able to get that higher price, but I am targeting the mid-segment market. In the mid-segment market, I cannot see any other brand that is evolving around us and therefore, we have a strong advantage in the market. We have a good reputation and credibility in the market. People know that we have been here for the last 20 years, and have been a building materials company for years.</p><h4>How does that reflect the market trends in the UAE as a whole?</h4><p>At the moment, the market is a little slow compared to what we saw last year. The market went up after the Expo 2020 decision, then after Ramadan it dropped off. Property values fell, especially in the luxury segment, but it's starting to pick up again and we can see some movement now. Hopefully it should go up. In the long term, I believe that growth of 15% to 20% can be expected in the years to come.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the real estate market in Dubai going forward?</h4><p>There is definitely going to be demand for real estate in this market because of the number of people migrating to Dubai. Also, rentals have gone up by 50% in the past six months. This shows that there is a shortage of supply of real estate in the market. Not many developments are coming onto the market. There are some buildings, but that does not really satisfy the demand in the market. I predict that in the next three or four years, the market will be busy for real estate.</p><h4>What does your success say about Dubai and the UAE as an investment climate?</h4><p>Dubai is always a land of opportunity. If you are doing your business in the right way and have the right product to offer in the market, Dubai will provide you that opportunity. For example, we have been in Jebel Ali for many years. For any problem, we just have to walk into the CEO's office, explain our problem, and they will find a solution for us. They do not make you feel like you are a private company. They let you work freely and allow you to grow within the country. That is part of our business plan in the Middle East and other places also, so the way Dubai helps business people is impressive. That is the reason for our success in this country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Freightworks provides integration of various transportation modes such as sea, air, and road freight, as well as diversified logistics services. Which of these areas represents more relevance in terms of profit for the company?</h4><p><span></span>Traditionally, Freightworks has been an airfreight company primarily because of where we are—situated adjacent to the airport. Our focus has shifted significantly from being an airfreight import company to more on air and sea-freight exports because our customers require additional solutions to suit their supply chains. Of course, this country is also very much a transshipment point. You have the Far East, the Middle East, and transshipments into Europe and Africa as well. We also see many companies coming in now looking for other regional or global distribution capability out of the Middle East. Of course, Dubai is clearly in a prime location for this particular operation.</p><h4><span></span>What are you doing to develop sea-freight business?</h4><p>We have developed a five-year strategic plan on the growth and expansion of our footprint as Freightworks. Africa plays a major role, as does the Middle East, as well as some overseas locations in the Far East, Europe, and North America. We are looking at establishing Freightworks branches overseas, which will enable us to capture the opportunities that come from there and beyond into Africa and other markets.</p><h4>What would you describe as the main strengths that differentiate Freightworks from its competitors?</h4><p>We provide our customers with operational excellence, which we believe is the cornerstone of all service providers, and we deliver bespoke solutions to complex requirements in any given supply chain. Because of the structure we have within the company, we are capable of looking after our customers in a way that not all of our competitors can. We are set up with nine service delivery teams. Within each of those teams we have sales, customer service, sea freight, air freight, team leadership, and customs people, who can deliver a one-stop shop, which our customers appreciate.</p><h4>You have a network of established partnerships. How important are these for developing the business?</h4><p>We are members of the World Air Cargo Organisation (WACO). This organization was originally established to create a network of independent forwarding companies, and we are the representatives of this organization in the UAE. The principle of connecting independent freight forwarders is now distributed throughout the world. WACO just reached 100 member countries. We can reach all corners of the world as it is right now. I believe the future is going to move much more in the direction of smaller, more agile and capable companies, rather than toward larger multinational companies. This is exactly where customer service and customer experience really comes in. We deliver that, but not all multinationals can.</p><h4>What are your expectations for how you will finish the year?</h4><p>We will finish strongly, and will be posting our third consecutive year of growth. We have had significant accumulated growth over the past three and a half years. What we have done differently since I started with the company is we have generated some leadership within business growth areas—sales and business development. We have tripled our sales force to really get out into the market. If you look at the growth numbers that similarly sized companies, or even larger companies in the UAE post, ours are unmatched. We are reporting excellent growth, and we are satisfied that we can continue this trend. Having said that, we are not getting complacent because there are still many business opportunities out there that we can pursue. We are pursuing some really interesting challenges right now. Things are looking positive. We need to see how Dubai develops. However, there are going to be numerous exciting opportunities within the next two to four years.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of competition between logistics companies here in Dubai?</h4><p>There is a lot of competition. I have heard numbers of anywhere from 3,000 to 6,000 registered freight-forwarding logistics companies, all the way from single-person briefcase operations, through to multinationals. This means that you can try to compete on the price, which is certainly what we are doing, but at the end of the day retaining the customer is linked much more to the customer's experience rather than the cost at any given time. We are also looking at expansion, acquiring new warehouses or additional space, and value-added services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the overall objective of Kanoo Group going forward?</h4><p><span></span>Our main concern as a business is to make profit, obviously. I am a business; I am not a charity. However, the point of making money is to safeguard and benefit the people working within the organization. At the end of the day, that is the important thing to focus on. I am only as good as my front people that are interacting with my customers. Therefore, I should ensure that they have a good, safe, and flourishing environment. When that happens, they will be the best ambassadors for the company. The second part is philosophical in that we want to give back to the community. This has nothing to do with public relations. For us, it is important to ensure the community benefits us, and I actually want to make sure that the people within my organization's communities are served as well. The happier they are, the easier their lives and the better they get the job done. It is as simple as that.</p><h4>What room do you see for opportunity in the industrial sector?</h4><p>As a business, the tendency we have is to look toward “dirty business," as in things to do with oil and grime. Not a lot of people go for it because it's not a “sexy" business, but it is lucrative if you are willing to put in the time and energy. As a family, that is what we tend to move toward. I can't see my family moving into IT, healthcare, or education, because there are many players trying to get into that market. When I see many people move toward a certain industry that is when I want out. I tend to go to businesses most people want to avoid.</p><h4>How does the Kanoo Group implement corporate governance practices in order to be a partner of choice for multinational investors?</h4><p>We have had concepts of governance since the 1960s. We also do perpetual, ongoing auditing. For the longest time, we have also had a separate legal department. My uncle decided that if he was going to compete with the large multinationals from the UK in the 1960s, he might as well have an in-house equivalent. Therefore, he brought in professional managers to do that and we created these splits for governance. This is something we have been doing for a long time and is nothing new for us.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Kanoo Group in the near term?</h4><p>We are focused on whatever economy we are in, be it Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, or Qatar. The question mark is not on the economical point of view, but the political. I am not worried about the internal politics in the region. I am more concerned with IS. I am interested to see what happens with it and how it will affect us, and the same goes for Syria and Yemen. I am also interested to see what happens between the US and Iran. All of this will either be positive or negative. There will be an immediate positive affect if something good happens between Iran and the US, a huge inflow of cash will come from Iran into Dubai. That is an immediate positive thing. The not so positive thing is that Iran might then start trying to influence the rest of the Gulf. That could be positive or negative, but these are the unknowns for us as a business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact will the $2.6 billion acquisition of Jebel Ali Free Zone have on DP World's growth?</h4><p><span></span>The transaction was a unique opportunity to acquire a strategically located asset integral to Jebel Ali's continued success as the leading gateway port in the Middle East region. EZW has stable recurring revenues, healthy margins and strong cash generation delivered by an attractive business model.  There are significant opportunities for growth from EZW and Jebel Ali Free Zone from increasing occupancy, increasing lease rates and developing new investment properties—underpinned by the continued growth of Dubai as a trading and logistics hub. </p><h4><span></span>DP World recently announced it plans to double its investments this year of up to $1.9 Billion in capacity upgrades in the Jebel Ali port.  What is the strategy behind this decision?</h4><p>The $850m Container Terminal 3 (T3) is operating with a capacity of 2 million TEUs. Once fully operational this year, T3 will add a further 2 million TEU capacity to serve customers at the state-of-the-art facility.  It is considered as one of the world's most modern container terminal adding further capacity to the port enabling it to handle as many as 10 of the new generation Ultra Large Container Ships (ULCS) at the same time.  The terminal features 19 of the world's largest and most modern quay cranes remotely operated from a sophisticated control room off the quayside largely by Emirati nationals, including females, who will also make up the majority of the 50 Automated Rail Mounted Gantry crane (ARMG) operations team.  The sophisticated cranes along with latest technology, smart mobile applications, a 100% electronic transaction facility and an advanced Gate Automation system, all contribute to a cost effective terminal as part of the supply chain.</p><h4>What key capacity upgrades will be completed and what impact will they have on DP World's operations?</h4><p>The UAE delivered another strong performance handling 15.2 million TEU in 2014, representing growth of 11.8% for the year.  Terminal 3 at Jebel Ali became operational in the third quarter, adding 2 million TEU and alleviating capacity constraint. A further 2 million capacity is expected to come on line in 2H2015.</p><h4>How will DP World use the Jebel Ali acquisition to integrate its supply chain services via the Dubai Logistics Corridor and Dubai World Central?</h4><p><span></span>The acquisition of EZW (Jebel Ali Free Zone) is consistent with our strategy of providing port-centric integrated logistics solutions at key gateway locations, such as Jebel Ali. Jebel Ali is the gateway to Middle East, Africa and Indian subcontinent. It is universally marketed as the model for port-centric integrated logistics solutions combining traditional port operations with free zones, intermodal logistic facilities, customs and other services.  Ranked among the top ten container ports worldwide, Jebel Ali Port plays the role of a premier gateway for over 90 weekly services connecting the region to over 140 ports worldwide. The poly-functional terminal facilities are spread over 20km of quayside featuring 23 container berths and 78 quay cranes, geared to handle next generation vessels.  Jebel Ali Port is an integrated multi-modal hub, offering sea, air and land connectivity complemented by logistics facilities which include coolport, container freight station and warehousing.</p><h4>How will this contribute to the continued success of Dubai as an international leader of port services and trade?</h4><p>The integration of DP World and EZW will reinforce our leadership in the high-growth Middle East region and enhance our integrated port and logistics offering to customers by optimizing investment. It is a compelling strategic move that will allow us to co-ordinate planned expansion, deliver an improved customer proposition, accelerate growth and enhance shareholder value.  Jebel Ali is the heart of an integrated multi-modal hub, including Jebel Ali Free Zone, Dubai World Central, Dubai Industrial City and Dubai World Central (Al Maktoum Airport). This unique platform offers sea, air and land connectivity complemented by logistics facilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most important projects that the DMCA has embarked upon over the last year, and what were their impacts on the sector as a whole?</h4><p><span></span>We have had several key milestones in 2014 in line with the objectives of the Dubai Maritime Sector Strategy (MSS), which was established to organize, develop, and promote the local maritime sector and strengthen the Emirate's position as a world-class global maritime hub. DMCA made significant progress toward improving maritime infrastructure and introducing new regulations and legislations to ensure the highest levels of operational efficiency and safety within local waters in accordance with the best international practices. Last year's achievements helped strengthen Dubai's competitive advantage at the regional and international levels. In 2014, DMCA launched the Emirates Maritime Arbitration Centre (EMAC) under the guidance of HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council. EMAC is a pioneering initiative in the Middle East aimed at addressing and resolving maritime disputes via deliberations based on legal frameworks and set maritime regulatory guidelines and standards. </p><h4>How will the recently established cooperation between Dubai Chamber's DIAC and the Emirates Maritime Arbitration Center enhance dispute resolution procedures for the maritime sector in the Middle East?</h4><p>The partnership between the two organizations is highly crucial. Both share a common vision of contributing to Dubai's economic development and promoting the Emirate as one of the world's leading investment destinations. The new agreement forms a nucleus for future cooperation between Dubai Chamber's Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC) and the Emirates Maritime Arbitration Center, a first-of-its-kind initiative that aims to settle maritime disputes in the Middle East. Disputes are resolved in accordance with independent legal and regulatory measures in line with the maritime sector's strategic goals of improving, organizing, and enhancing Dubai's competitiveness as a first-class global maritime hub. The maritime sector is an important pillar of Dubai's economic growth as it directly supports the competitiveness of Dubai and its strategic location as well as its status as one of the top transshipment hubs in the world. This latest agreement will lead to a new phase of cooperation between the two parties and will take the maritime sector a step closer to making Dubai a first-class global maritime center. Under the new strategic partnership, the two sides agreed to enhance channels for transferring knowledge and exchanging information as well as beginning their bilateral cooperation in arbitration. They will also coordinate in building the maritime sector's human resources capacity by jointly organizing interactive workshops and training courses, attending regional and international meetings, and conducting official visits. The partnership aims to contribute to enhancing Dubai's presence on the global economic map.</p><h4>How is DMCA implementing technology as part of Dubai's smart government initiative?</h4><p>We will continue to develop more creative ideas to enhance the maritime sector's competitiveness through the Maritime Innovation Center to further support the Dubai Innovation Strategy, which aims to make the Emirate the world's most innovative city. The Smart Marine Services Platform aims to build an informational and procedural interactive base by designing, developing, and maintaining a cutting-edge and smart system for maritime licensing and registration services. It will provide several channels offering services that meet the requirements and expectations of the government. DMCA will adopt the best international practices, the highest standards, and the latest smart technologies to ensure easy access to an integrated portfolio of high-quality services through various smart channels. This initiative represents a strong impetus toward improved performance. It will also advance DMCA's contributions toward achieving the strategic objectives of Dubai Plan 2021 to build a proactive, innovative, and smart government that guarantees the welfare of all members of society.</p><h4>How does the strategy of DMCA play into the Dubai 2021 Vision?</h4><p>Our numerous consecutive achievements have complemented efforts to develop a regulatory framework to create a conducive and sustainable maritime environment that responds proactively to rapid changes, keeps pace with emerging trends, and attracts leading regional and global investors. We will continue to come up with new leading initiatives in cooperation with our strategic partners. We aspire to organize, develop, and promote the local maritime sector and strengthen Dubai's strategic position on the global maritime map. These goals are in line with the vision of Dubai 2021 of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Peruvian hydrocarbon sector has seen major changes over the past decade, with more than 10 times as much investment in E&amp;P in 2014 than in 2004. What role did Perupetro play in this process and what's the current state of investment in E&amp;P in Peru?</h4><p>Perupetro is the state agency in charge of promoting the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons. We have increased the number of contracts we have in Peru from 2003 to 67 contracts for exploration and exploitation, 24 of which are exclusively for exploitation, and the remainder for exploration. Unfortunately, production of oil is currently at around 70,000 bpd. We should ideally undertake 20-30 exploration drills per year, but we currently have only 10-12. Here we are facing delays, and waiting for approval from environmental studies and for social programs. As a result, a significant portion of our contracts are delayed, idle, or awaiting approval. Investment currently stands at about $1 billion per year, which is less than the ideal amount. Investment needs to increase, as do the number of contracts. We are calling for new tenders to attract more investors for exploration and exploitation in Peru. We have 26 blocks in the jungle, six blocks offshore, and an exploitation contract that will finish in August (block 192, which includes current block 1AB). We need to replace the operator in that block. We have called for two bidding rounds, one for seven blocks in the jungle (part of the 26 mentioned blocks) for exploration activities and the other for block 192. </p><h4>How have falling petroleum prices affected investment? </h4><p>Many investors want to postpone the dates they have committed to for exploration. This is because it is difficult for them to get money from their financial backers, and this has become our main problem now. These conditions undermine the tenders that we are going to call in the upcoming months, because it will be difficult for us to attract companies for investment. Most of them are reducing investment in exploration, not just in Peru, but throughout the world. Our job now is to convince them to come to Peru. To achieve this we are promoting the investment in some of the under explored sedimentary basins in our country, which will encourage companies to undertake medium- and long-term exploration projects. Right now prices are around $60. Many companies have asked us for help to continue their operations. Some companies might even stop their work in Peru. Meanwhile, exploration in the jungle is expensive, and different from the exploration on the coast. While drilling a well on the coast can cost $5 million or less, in the jungle it could cost $100 million for one well.</p><h4>Given Peru's natural gas resources, do you see potential for Peru to become a major LNG exporter?</h4><p>We are already exporting about 600 million cubic feet per day, and producing about 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. There are large reserves in Peru, and the possibilities of finding more natural gas are very high. There is a block in the jungle of Madre de Dios basin, where we expect to have reserves close to Camisea project. The natural gas is one of our strengths, and can often be used as a substitute for oil. For example, 50% of power generation in Peru is with natural gas, and the other 50% is hydroelectric. Before the use of natural gas, we used to generate with diesel, which was costly. </p><h4>Is Peruvian LNG competitive in the international market at current prices?</h4><p>Yes, we are competitive sending our LNG to international markets. For example, if we export to Europe, which uses the UK National Balancing Point (NBP) reference system or Asia where they use the Japan Korea Gas Marker (JKM) reference, we will get better prices.</p><h4>One of the major challenges for investors in Peru is obtaining the social license to operate. What do you do to facilitate that process?</h4><p>We have introduced the process of prior consultation, which is consultation that needs to be done before hydrocarbon exploration can commence. The government has also recently made a commitment to invest in education, security, health, and other services for communities near hydrocarbon extraction sites.</p><h4>What are your goals for E&amp;P in Peru?</h4><p>We are planning to have between 20-30 exploration drills per year soon and reach between 50 and 60 exploration drills per year in the medium and long term, instead of the current 10-12. That is the only way for us to discover new reserves, and it will mean that we are going to have more production. Our demand is about 200,000 bpd, and we produce only 70,000 right now. Natural gas will help in this effort, but is not enough to meet demand. We need to increase oil production.</p><h4>What makes Peru a good destination for E&amp;P investors?</h4><p>Our law contracts mean that only the signing parties can change contracts. The contract cannot be changed by legal amendment. That is important because the investors can be confident in the long-term viability of their projects. This also means that there is stability, legal continuity, and free movement of capital. This law is important for all sectors, not only hydrocarbons. Pro Inversión has its own promotion law, and it uses that law for a broad spectrum of projects.</p><h4>Where do you hope to see the production of oil and gas in Peru by 2020?</h4><p>That depends on the price. If prices hold at below $50 per barrel, it will be difficult for us to increase production, but if the prices rise to $75 or more per barrel, we have the potential to reach more than 100,000 bpd and increase our actual production by 40%. But what we aim for is 200,000 bpd.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your major achievements over the past 10 years?</h4><p><span></span>Around 10 years ago, we came to Dubai for the Palm Jumeirah, Villas-Garden Homes project. I still remember that when I looked at the master plan of Palm Jumeirah I felt it was like a dream, which really attracted me. By 2007, we had finished 65% villas on the Palm Jumeirah successfully. From there, we started to take large and more complex orders like Sheikh Khalifa Specialist Hospital and the Doha Tower in Qatar, which is considered one of the highest-quality construction projects in the world as the winning project of Best Tall Building Worldwide. And we are also delighted to see our involvement in Abu Dhabi New Airport Project as main contractor in the infrastructure and specialist in the steel structure and mechanical package. So far, we have completed over $4.3 billion in projects across the region and involved in the Viceroy Hotel project, which is our first instance as a developer in the region. We have been actively participating in GCC railway projects and major airport projects such as in Abu Dhabi and Kuwait. Hopefully, we will be able to participate in Dubai's Al Maktoum Airport as well. We believe that as China State Construction, with its proven track record of 40 airports around the world, we have a better chance to ensure the quality and timely handing of megaprojects. </p><h4>What is the importance of your partnership with SKAI Holding?</h4><p>It has certainly been a milestone. For our company, it is a transition to start investing in the Middle East, although it is nothing new to us as China State Construction, one of the biggest development and investment companies in the Chinese market. To further diversify our business, it is important to shift our focus more toward development and investment. We take the Viceroy Hotel as the first step and we believe in the partnership with SKAI Holding.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the construction sector in the lead up to Expo 2020?</h4><p>The Expo 2020 will definitely provide contractors with more opportunities. The government will increase its budget to further complete and improve infrastructure. Compared with the neighboring countries in the GCC, Dubai probably has the best infrastructure. Nevertheless, the population is increasing rapidly. Rapid population growth has created pressure on the existing infrastructure. With the Expo 2020 attracting tens of millions of visitors, infrastructure will become extremely crucial to Dubai. We have noticed that the authorities are also building more theme parks and other leisure facilities. Of course, Expo 2020 itself is a project similar to one we experienced in Shanghai at Expo 2010, where we have built dozen of pavilions for various countries. Also, we believe Expo 2020 will bring positive to the image of Dubai and bring more business opportunities in the hospitality sector.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the investment climate in Dubai over the next year or two?</h4><p>We will all feel the effect of falling crude oil prices. Concern over its impact on the UAE will always be there, as it is one of the major oil-supplying countries. However, I don't think it will have a major impact on the country's spending. Dubai has not depended on oil for many years. After it further improves its infrastructure and assumes new projects to be built, we will see the market grow. The property market was really booming in 2013 and made Dubai one of the world leading property markets. However, it has stabilized in 2014, which I read as a positive message for long-term, sustainable growth. Consolidation is always required if prices increase too quickly. Generally, it is good to see that Dubai is recovering from the last financial crisis and coming back on the right track. In the coming one to two years, we should see something more positive, especially with the improvement of the business environment in Iran, which I believe will probably bring in more business opportunities to the UAE.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the significance of the Middle East to Serco's global operations?</h4><p><span></span>Serco is a global public service provider, and we focus on five key pillars across the world; justice and immigration, defense, transport, citizen services, and health. These services are across four key regions: North America, the UK and Europe, the Middle East, and Australia and New Zealand. We are well established in the region, and are present in five countries here in the Middle East, namely the UAE, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Qatar. We have about 4,000 employees working for us at the moment with a diverse workforce of some 54 different nationalities. Within the global strategy of Serco, the Middle East remains a key pillar for the company's global growth. Here in the Middle East, we are focused on rail transport and aviation, which makes up about 80% of our business. We are the leading rail operator here in the Middle East, and we operate and maintain the iconic Dubai Metro, the Al Sufouh Tram System, and Palm Jumeirah Monorail. Only recently, we signed an additional contract for the operation and maintenance of Emaar's downtown trolley. Beyond these borders, we signed a new contract with Saudi Arabian Rail for the operation of the huge railroad that runs from Ras Al Khaimah in the northeast of Saudi all the way to Dammam. That rail network there is, of course, tying into a much broader network in Qatar, and eventually all the way down to Oman. Basically, if it runs on rails in this part of the world, Serco either operates and maintains it on behalf of distinguished clients or is keen to do so.</p><h4>What impact will the drop in oil prices have on Serco's operations in the Middle East?</h4><p>I do feel that we are somewhat isolated from them. We are not involved in any capital development projects; we are operating and maintaining previously constructed facilities. Having said that, if the government's budget is cut, it still has to service the public in terms of transportation and healthcare. Those are unlikely to be cut because of low oil prices. The work we have to do is unaffected because the nature of our work is service orientation, not capital development. If our contracts or services were dependent on new facilities being built, then it would impact us directly, but the nature of our contracts at the moment are not going that way. For that reason, we are not particularly concerned about the impact of oil prices on our portfolio or our growth prospects.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are continuing to pursue opportunities in all of our five key sectors, and we are continuing to be a superb provider of customer service to our customers around the region. We will continue to demonstrate that we are the best for business in our sector by doing four specific things: competing and winning good business, focusing on the markets that we know, differentiating customer value propositions, and by carefully managing risk. We will execute what we do brilliantly by being prepared, focused on safety, on operational excellence, and delivering as advertised with a lean and simple organizational structure and efficient, high-quality services. We also have to be a place that people are proud to work, not just our international staff but also our Emiratis. We want to be seen as an organization chosen by talented people. Finally, we also must look to continue our success in profitability and sustainability. We have to be financially robust long term, delivering value to our shareholders with growing revenues and margins, but with appropriate risk-adjusted returns on capital. That is the strategy that we are setting up to deliver, and I think it is a bright future for Serco in this part of the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors contributed to your growth in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>If you look at the growth of Al-Futtaim Logistics, we have moved both vertically and horizontally. In terms of our vertical growth, our fashion design services and solutions have expanded considerably. One solution we have developed for our customers ensures that their products do not stay in storage for a long time. The retailer orders the product, which is shipped out immediately to the store as soon as it arrives at the loading dock. With the assistance of advanced technology and software, we can reduce storage time through the ways that we configure the variables involved. This has been one of the major successes of 2014, and we expect the fashion design line of the business to grow from here. In this case, we add value to the services that we provide to the customer by developing an understanding of their real needs.</p><h4>How do you adapt your solutions to customers working in different countries?</h4><p>Customers in different countries naturally have different requirements, which can present a challenge when you have shipments travelling to different regions of the world. For example, we have many customers shipping from Europe to the Middle East that require labels in Arabic, for which we have developed internal systems to simplify much of the process for the customer. Our solutions meet the principal's, the customer's, and the relevant government's requirements, as well as those of the end consumer. We aim to add value for all customers, whatever their requirements, by not only providing solutions, but by understanding the available technology and applying it to their needs.</p><h4>Recently Al-Futtaim Logistics opened a 50,000sqm warehouse, distribution, and office facility, which includes a 30,000sqm distribution center for your home delivery fleet. What has the impact of these developments been on your business?</h4><p>These two developments were a part of our 2014 strategy, and we made these moves to meet our customers' requirements in the fast moving retail division. Customers are looking for solutions dedicated to minimizing handling problems. These facilities have given our customers an advantage in a market in which lead times of over 10 days for delivery are not unusual, whereas in reality we know that customers want no more than three days. Once you learn what the customer wants, you have to find new supply chain and logistics solutions to make it happen, which is what we have done. We have fine-tuned our operational efficiency to increase productivity, and we deliver on time to satisfy customers. These days, the end consumer is more vocal about their requirements, meaning that our customers, the retail companies, understand more clearly what they need to do to address them. We take our responsibility seriously to listen and to respond, and to go much further than simply delivering products, but to give them the best solution to fit their needs.</p><h4>How do you accommodate customers from a wide range of industries?</h4><p>Whatever goods you are transporting, the customer wants to reduce the lead-time from the manufacturer to the end recipient. Each product sector has different service requirements. In the automotive industry you can store a car for a number of days, for example, but whereas the fashion industry operates seasonally, you cannot keep winter clothes for the summer. You have to look at all scenarios, and for each one you have to understand the product and the customer's demands in order to meet their requirements. A team of experts within our management team reviews every aspect. By selecting our products and methods, they control and adapt each solution to make sure that all possible scenarios are considered and prepared for.</p><h4>Al-Futtaim Logistics is the leading automotive logistics service provider in the UAE, and serves a range of other industry solutions such as retail, industrial, and project cargo. How do you see this dynamic going forward?</h4><p>During 2014, we expanded our verticals in the fashion and home delivery sectors, and are now looking at market movements closely as we plan our expansion into food and other sectors. We foresee positive trends in the next few years leading up to Expo 2020 in the UAE. As an organization, we are well positioned in terms of starting sizeable projects and our expansion into new verticals.</p><h4>What is Al-Futtaim Logistics' regional expansion strategy going forward?</h4><p>We are looking for expansion and business growth as we expand geographically from our home market into new markets in the MENA region, including Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, East and North Africa, and Egypt.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the key to taking NAS from having one airline client in Kuwait to its current position in emerging markets across the MENA region?</h4><p>To build a company you have to really focus on delivering value to your customer. We did that by providing a high quality of service and being very disciplined in regards to our costs. We have been able to meet our clients' targets at reasonable prices. In 2003 we started business in Kuwait with one customer, KLM. We were focused initially on passenger services, and then expanded into route services with cargo, lounges, meet and assist, an aviation training center, aviation security, and finally, terminal management. Geographically, Kuwait was our base, and in 2008, we expanded to India with a ground handling company and eight airports. In 2009 we launched operations in Bombay, at one of the largest airports in Asia, in partnership with Celebi, a Turkish ground handling company. In 2009, we started in Kigali. In 2012, we did Sharm El Sheikh and expanded to Abu Dhabi, and in 2013 we started managing the Sheikh Saad terminal. In 2014 we won a tender in Afghanistan, and also opened a VIP terminal in Abu Dhabi. This year we are hoping to launch operations in Cí´te d'Ivoire. We have been aggressive in our approach to expansion to meet fast-growing demand.</p><p class="quote">"Aviation plays a crucial role in the economy."</p><h4>What role does NAS play in facilitating business and economic development in emerging economies?</h4><p>Aviation plays a crucial role in the economy, and there are two sides to what we do; the passenger side and the cargo side. The passenger side is designed for airlines that need services based on safety, security, and cost effectiveness. Business travel supports local businesses expand and locate overseas customers or suppliers. The reverse is also true with international companies that want to do business in emerging markets. On the cargo side we are supporting emerging markets, farmers, and producers by providing efficient importing and exporting.</p><h4>NAS was named Best Ground Handler in emerging markets three times. How has NAS achieved this, and what is the significance of this recognition for the company?</h4><p>Quality is key. Airlines know NAS to be a reliable partner whom they can trust to provide the best quality of service in the country. The award has boosted morale in the company over the years because it recognizes the hard, and often repetitive work that people do within their defined, specific areas of expertise. It is rare for people to appreciate the job that these people do, and our employees appreciate the positive reinforcement.</p><h4>What new heights are you aiming to reach in the future, and what are your targets for 2016 specifically?</h4><p>Our vision is to become the aviation service provider of choice in emerging markets. We will continue our aggressive growth primarily in Africa, and to a large extent in the Middle East and Central Asia as well. We aspire to having one to two major wins and three to four small ones every year. In 2016 we will sustain our focus on quality, safety, and security. We will continue our investment growth and continue to hire qualified individuals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you consider as some of the top achievements in 2013 and 2014 that have helped shape Dubai World Central (DWC) into what it is today?</h4><p><span></span>In 2013-14, DWC achieved several significant milestones in support of its objective of becoming a self-sustained urban destination. These were driven by key developments relevant to our project, including the commencement of the first commercial flight to Al Maktoum International Airport in October 2013, the announcement of Dubai winning the bid to host Expo 2020, and the expansion plan of Al Maktoum Airport, sanctioned by a $32 billion fund. The significance of these mean that DWC has focused on accelerating the development of infrastructure around the airport, anchoring its aviation and logistics offering both in terms of facilities and attracting partners, increasing the tenants in its free zones, beginning projects in the hospitality sector, and signing agreements with industry players. We also signed an agreement with Emaar to develop the DWC Golf high-end luxury residential area. All of this demonstrates our commitment to creating an optimal ecosystem that caters to the needs of the people and businesses that visit DWC or make it their home.</p><h4>DWC is building a new city within a city. What is the rationale behind this?</h4><p>DWC is not so much a new city within a city, but rather an extension of what Dubai is today and how it will look tomorrow. DWC has been designed and is seeking to create an urban ecosystem that aligns with the Dubai Strategic Plan 2021. In that same spirit, we are putting the people and businesses at the heart of our development. For businesses, this means ensuring connectivity and speed by channels like our single customs bonded logistics corridor. Businesses will also benefit from the ease of doing business to support their expansion and growth in the UAE and region through a comprehensive ecosystem and free zone offering. For individuals, DWC represents a development that is community driven around residential offerings that will integrate retail, community centers, education, and healthcare. This is ultimately about creating a city of tomorrow that will empower people and businesses to grow and prosper.</p><h4>What opportunities for investment will DWC create?</h4><p>There are a number of key drivers that will create investment opportunities. Al Maktoum International Airport alone creates a massive opportunity from a passenger and cargo flow perspective. The airport, when complete, will facilitate an additional 16 million tons of cargo and over 200 million passengers per year. This obviously comes with a significant dividend. Second, by hosting World Expo 2020, there will be an increased need for hospitality, retail, business, and residential services for the 25 million expected incoming visitors. Estimates indicate that the economic impact generated by the Expo between now and 2021 will be approximately $26.5 billion. Furthermore, over the next six years more than 275,000 jobs are estimated to be created in and around the UAE to service the Expo. Third, with the completion of DWC, this area is expected to support a population close to 1 million people. It naturally follows that this will attract considerable investments across its various offerings, including residential, commercial, aviation, logistics, retail, healthcare, and education.</p><h4>What will the focus be until 2020 and beyond?</h4><p>Our focus is on delivering and ensuring that the development of the DWC ecosystem meets high benchmarks. We work closely with our partners to optimize Dubai's significant investments in major land transportation projects to boost public transport usage through more advanced, connected bus, tram, metro, and regional rail options. Ultimately, we are working on creating the city of tomorrow that will ensure high quality of life, preservation of resources, and an environment that allows us to live and work more efficiently.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors led to the 50% rise in Xerox Emirates' channel partner business in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>We approach the market at two primary segments: launch enterprises and SMEs. It's very difficult for a company to cover the SME segment, which in many markets generally represents 40-50% of the market value for IT and the area that we are in. You need to find a way to get your product to this market. Our current channel strategy is the result of us understanding where customers choose to buy. Many SME customers choose to buy from channel partners, so it was a logical choice for us to try to create a robust channel strategy again. In doing this, we created a good value proposition. Our strategy was not to over distribute, but to make sure we cover the market. That program rolled out in mid-2013 and we made good progress in that year. In 2014, the growth was a fairly decent number, so we were happy with that. Apart from the value proposition, clearly the market is more active than it was a few years ago. I'd say that the period after the crisis in 2008 and 2009, a lot of capital purchases were put off, so now there is a certain amount of reaping the reward of customers being careful. That has obviously given us an opportunity. We are far from being where we would like to be in terms of market reach, so I think there is plenty of similar growth in the coming years.</p><h4>What are your plans for the expansion of these partnerships?</h4><p>It's expansion of the partners that we have. If you are not going to have a policy of over-distribution, then you want to focus your expansion on the quality of the partners. We would be looking to invest in the existing partners and helping them to grow. The only ingredient you need to make that strategy successful is an aligned, mutual benefit. They have to want to grow so that there is no misalignment. That is often what happens in channel strategies that go wrong; there is a difference in the ambition of the partners versus the vendor. So, inevitably, when you want to grow, your partner might have a different agenda. Aligned partners are very important and they are not that difficult to find, but we have been very selective about choosing our partners.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for continued growth?</h4><p>There are opportunities everywhere. The evolution of our value proposition to customers has changed dramatically in the last five years and we are now offering a lot of services, mainly around document work flows and so on. Obviously, we have our traditional technology business as well. The role of a multi-functional device in customers is changing dramatically as well. It's not just a printer; it's also a portal to the digital world. I think this is still early days, but it's definitely a trend that's developing. In the context of pure document management and work flows, we are offering “next generation managed print services," which is adding applications and process streamlining to help customers not just print less, but also have smarter work processes. As a result of the acquisition of ACS five years ago, a business process outsourcing company, we've developed quite a broad range of services. One extreme will be transportation solutions, where we are doing towing systems and smart parking. For smart city initiatives, there is something we are working on to provide clever technology to improve the mall so that people can drive around less to find a parking space. Mobile devices will allow them to see where parking spaces are. In the Dubai Mall there is an archaic light system, but you need directions to tell you how to get there. There's also on- and off-street parking management. That goes even to large complexes where security needs to manage the flow of vehicles and the access of vehicles into large complexes, like construction sites or huge hotels. There are many solutions there. In the US, we are processing parking fines, speeding fines, and similar car incidents. We also have solutions for banking, HR, and insurance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see smart technology and the internet transforming how governments operate in this day and age?</h4><p>I think it changes how the government operates in two ways. Firstly, it's creating new means of governance. That means new ways to interact with people, for example. People can deal with the government by email, telephone, fax, and so on, and so these new technologies allow citizens to get things done faster and more efficiently, and in the future there will be other innovations in communication modes. Secondly, technology creates and facilitates the ability to collaborate, as we see in things like Wikipedia, and governments can use these technologies in the same way so that people can participate directly in areas of government. Examples include New York, where if you see a pothole that needs being filled, say, you can let the authorities know about it. It's at the point where the very structure of government and its institutions can be changed, with those institutions also benefiting from the effects of these new technologies.</p><h4>How important do you think it is for developing governments to invest in e-government initiatives?</h4><p>There are opportunities and there are challenges. The opportunity is that developing countries might not have very much in place, so you don't have much of a legacy system, which means you can install a modern system off the bat. The challenge is that when you have fewer resources your tendency is to just get something that works in place, no matter how basic or elementary. It would take a great amount of wisdom for a cash-strapped government to decide to build something really well, but it's possible, and there is that opportunity.</p><h4>What role do you think the private sector plays as a development partner for governments?</h4><p>The government's role is to set up new territories in which the markets can be set up. It can help establish a market, guarantee a market, and maybe even direct a market by suggesting or mandating decisions about where it wants to go. There can be partnerships with markets and the private sector can help a government overcome markets' short attention span and give them more of a long-term focus. If the government and the market compete then the markets are going to be winning, so the government's role should be to complement the market and facilitate an environment in which the market can succeed. So it is more a matter of creating new places for the markets to work.</p><h4>What role do you think governments like Dubai can take as leaders of innovation and strategy when it comes to ICT development?</h4><p>One of the things we've seen, and which places like Dubai have shown us, is that cities are the main units of prosperity. You can measure levels of prosperity and wealth a lot more accurately and truly based on the city you live in rather than the country. Cities are far more relevant, and they are the main unit for innovation and progress. I think there's a lot more chance to have a smart city than a smart country. So it makes sense that Dubai has been doing this as a city, and I think every city has its own answer as to how it can and will make itself smart. After all, if you're not a smart city in 2015, then you're no city at all. Every city has to find a way to become a smart city somehow.</p><h4>How do you think governments can ensure that the citizenry is protected when it comes to utilizing these new technologies?</h4><p>I think symmetrical accountability is crucial. Governments must have third-party accountability, and citizens have to have access to the information about them so they can verify that it's correct. Ultimately, citizens have to be able to hold the government accountable, while also getting a direct and obvious benefit from whatever is being compiled. If you make accountability symmetrical so that citizens can in turn watch who is watching them, if it is made accountable to a third party, and if you make the benefits clear and direct, it will work well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Emirates Transport work with other government entities toward the overall development of the UAE?</h4><p>Emirates Transport was established 34 years ago as a federal government corporation specializing in the provision of transport, rental, and auto maintenance services. From the start, the corporation adopted strategic investment plans that complement the overall development plans in the UAE, and support the aspirations and visions of the state, such as of the UAE Vision 2021. Emirates Transport implements these plans through key strategic and community partnerships with government ministries and agencies, at federal and local levels, as well as companies from the private sector. Some of these major partnerships are in the oil and gas sector, as well as companies in the sectors of transport, tourism, support services, and facilities management. Within this scope, the corporation has signed more than 50 MoUs with public and private sector entities, and lists some 430 clients who benefit from 38 services. It is important to emphasize that such initiatives are prepared, developed, and implemented in coordination and cooperation with the strategic partners of the corporation, the most important of which are the Ministry of the Interior, Abu Dhabi Education Council, and the Ministry of Education.</p><h4>What significant contributions is Emirates Transport making to the economic development of the UAE?</h4><p>Over recent years, the economy of the UAE has become highly diversified with a rapid increase in businesses operating in the country. And for a commercial federal entity, such as Emirates Transport, change was not only necessary, it was inevitable. Many services were added to the portfolio of ET, including commercial transport and rentals, luxury transport, logistics, petroleum transport, facility management, security, transport technology, motorcycle and valet parking, and the conversion of vehicles to natural gas. The corporation grew drastically to become more than just a school transport service provider, and as our organization developed so did our level of quality. Emirates Transport's own culture and roots are connected with its founding vision of providing quality service at competitive prices, and this has helped us to become a leading organization in the sector.</p><h4>How does Emirates Transport employ technology as part of the UAE Smart Government initiatives?</h4><p>As part of the UAE federal government, Emirates Transport is keen on consistently incorporating the Smart Government initiative into its projects, paving the road for superior service delivery to clients and the general public. Emirates Transport has developed a subsidiary company called Emirates Transport Technology Solutions (ETTS), which looks after designing, deploying, and operating transport technology solutions to serve key transport service providers across all operational domains: land, rail, aviation, and maritime. Among the core services offered by ETTS is the School Transport Asset Reporting System (STARS), which delivers a full command and control and communication platform to school bus operators. In addition, the company offers Emirates Asset Surveillance and Tracking (EAST), which provides a control and communications platform to all vehicle operators and fixed asset owners based upon traditional GPS tracking without video surveillance. ETTS also caters to R&amp;D efforts in the transport technology field in order to provide better ways of doing business and consistently making EAST compatible with the Smart Government initiative and its innovative transport projects.</p><h4>What significant transport projects or partnerships do you envision in the next five years?</h4><p>Emirates Transport is always on the lookout for any project or initiative that can enhance the transport sector in the state and its own services. We are constantly improving and developing the services we provide to the school, government, and private sectors, introducing new technology and green solutions to achieve the best possible services while meeting environmental objectives. Over the past couple of years, we have launched a number of environmentally friendly projects, including the CNG Vehicle Conversion Centre, the Tyre Retreading Unit, and the Dry Car Wash Unit, and we plan to expand these projects and introduce similar initiatives in the near future. As one of the major transport companies in the UAE, and the region, Emirates Transport is looking forward to collaborating with different public and private sector establishments to contribute to the development of the sustainable transportation environment in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the top achievements for DMCC during 2014?</h4><p>One of the greatest achievements for the DMCC was maintaining a fast-paced momentum. We have stayed hungry, and open to attracting new businesses. We have become a strong magnet for SMEs and now business incubators with the recently announced AstroLabs tech incubator. As far as diamonds and gold go, it is business as usual. The DMCC, with more than 1,000 diamond companies in our Almas Tower alone, has propelled Dubai into position among the top three diamond centers in the world. The same is true for gold. DMCC has helped Dubai become one of the leading gold trading hubs in the world. Something of equal importance to all this is our information technology transformation project that is at the forefront of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai's e-government initiative. Two years ago, we provided a fully online portal for our members where they can do all of their services online, whether registering a businesses, applying for visas, and pretty much all matters.</p><h4>One of the large projects for DMCC is the Burj 2020 project. What impact do you think that will have on the overall operations of DMCC and Dubai furthering themselves as international trading hubs?</h4><p>How people view DMCC is different today than it was five years ago. The contrast is even starker when you look back 13 years to our inception in 2002. It is an influential community. I understand there is much conservatism in the market from other areas; however, entities that come to DMCC will never go to another area. The client that comes here is completely different. The fact that we registered between 6,000 and 7,000 companies in the last four years, which was when the world was still reeling from the global recession, is key. I do not get why we need to slow down. We are doing our best to provide a custom-made facility for our members. We asked members what we could provide that was not available. They want their top clients to be here. In that respect, I still feel that the multinational entities have not been serviced 100%. We have not pushed enough to attract them.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will be opening One JLT. It is a building with over 27,000 sqm of leasable area. Some may feel there is too much office space coming, but for me, the more offices, the better. The more companies we service, the better it is for DMCC. The unveiling of the Burj 2020 District is exciting. Putting in a nice target for the next decade would be interesting for me. Conservatively speaking, people expect us to reach 16,000 businesses. I would like to push that to 20,000. We are at more than 10,000 today. I would like the focus to be on doubling it. If we cannot get to it, at least I would have the satisfaction that we tried our best. I do not think it is completely unreasonable. The office space is available, and the appetite is there.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main achievements of recent years?</h4><p>The acquisition of Palm District Cooling was certainly one of our main achievements last year. The acquisition helped us to expand our operating zone, increase our domain, and improve the landscape of district cooling areas in Dubai. Through this acquisition, we now have representation in almost every major project in Dubai. When you look at the way Dubai is developing, we have very strong representation throughout the tourism and leisure market, shopping malls, and healthcare facilities. Of course the acquisition provided a boost to our market share and it also saw us increasing our net profit by 65%. Our revenue grew to AED1.5 billion in 2014, a growth of 76% over the previous year, thus solidifying us as one of the real blue-chip companies in terms of size and market share.</p><h4>What is the significance of the MoU you signed with Johnson Controls?</h4><p>If you look at the district cooling industry, any leader in any industry should have initiatives and responsibilities when it comes to participating in R&amp;D. Part of our commitment to the district cooling industry is that we signed an agreement with Johnson Controls in the US to develop a cooling tower so that applications can be used in water cooling and air cooling to save energy. Saving energy is not just Empower's theme; it is a global theme. Everyone wants to save energy and have green buildings. By collaborating with the leading manufacturers in the world, it gives us the privilege to associate with them and it gives us an advantage in sharing a new technology that we are building for the Emirates.</p><h4>How does Empower play a role in developing a green economy for Dubai and the UAE?</h4><p>District cooling is one of the main pillars of green buildings. District cooling is a new air conditioning technology that supplies cool air through an environmentally friendly application by using chilled water. District cooling is the main pillar of any green economy. Moreover, building owners are beginning to understand that the green aspect of green buildings isn't simply the building materials, but involves the overall operational efficiency during construction and after completion. Construction only lasts a short time when you consider the overall lifespan of a building.</p><h4>How do you see Empower evolving in the future?</h4><p>If everything goes according to plan, this market will give us the opportunity to double our capacity by 2018. The US, Canada, and Mexico have a total district cooling capacity of 650,000 tons. Empower, as just one company, has more than 1 million tons. The entire continent of North America only has 650,000, and we alone in Dubai have more than 1 million. If I double that to more than 2 million, it will mean a huge amount of business. It's really an opportunity for the manufacturers to develop their industry toward green products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE is one of the most well connected countries in the world for broadband internet access but also has a relatively high cost. How would you describe the dynamic between broadband penetration, performance, and cost?</h4><p>The UAE's fiber broadband networks are very advanced and very fast by international standards. Such networks are expensive to build and maintain. Despite this, prices of broadband services in the UAE are not unreasonably high. They are low by Arab standards and similar to prices in other GCC countries. Furthermore, broadband services are generally purchased as a bundle with other fixed-line services. The price of fixed-line services are very low in the UAE by international standards. This needs to be taken into account when considering the price of broadband. Broadband penetration levels in the UAE are relatively high. Around 90% of households have an internet connection.</p><h4>What are your expectations with TRA rolling out its Triple Play Services?</h4><p>During 2015, we expect that bitstream will be launched. We would expect the resulting competition to exert downward pressure on prices for fixed-line services including triple play bundles. Given licensees will need to work harder both to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers, we might also see increased activity in terms of time limited promotions, better quality services, increased focus on delivering excellence in customer service, and the emergence of increasingly innovative product structures as licensees seek to differentiate their services. The TRA will need to be vigilant in ensuring that the operators continue to compete fairly once bitstream is implemented. To facilitate this, the TRA has a comprehensive competition safeguards regulatory framework aimed at preventing anticompetitive conduct from occurring. The TRA will also monitor bitstream carefully to ensure that consumers switching from one operator to another are switched efficiently, effectively, and without undue delay.</p><h4>What is the role that TRA plays in Dubai becoming the capital of the Islamic economy?</h4><p>Without high-quality, high-speed, and reliable ICT services, businesses will not choose to establish a presence in Dubai. Therefore, the TRA and the UAE's licensed operators have been working very hard to establish an ICT environment that meets or exceeds the expectations of businesses. Indeed, the TRA sees the UAE as a global leading country in ICT. In the second half of 2013, the TRA undertook an intensive survey of businesses in the UAE focusing on business usage of ICT services in order to better understand business perceptions on their usage of, and demands for, ICT services. This survey revealed that 93% of respondents were either satisfied or extremely satisfied with their fixed line services, 91% were either satisfied or extremely satisfied with their fixed internet services, and 93% were either satisfied or extremely satisfied with their mobile services. Overall, the TRA is very proud of the achievements of the sector to date; the telecommunications networks in the UAE are among the fastest and most modern in the world and prices are reasonable by international standards. This will undoubtedly contribute to the UAE being a leading capital within the Islamic World. On March 5th, 2015, the Dubai Smart City initiative was launched. As part of this strategy, the public will be able to engage with government departments and undertake government services using their smartphones.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Al Islami performed over the last year?</h4><p>It is the second year since Dubai was named the capital of the Islamic economy. This is a hot topic everywhere we go and we see it getting even hotter day by day. I am happy to announce our business is growing and our company was used as a case study in January 2015 at Harvard as we presented our case for the agri-business school there. It is amazing to see how well the halal industry was received. More than 200 senior figures attended our agri-business course and they were highly engaged in the topic and what we believe in, which is Al Islami's mission to become a leading brand in halal food.</p><h4>How would you describe your growth strategy?</h4><p>We are taking some major steps. There are a lot of discussions going on with different parties and many of them want to be part of what we are doing, including global companies, international companies, and different investment firms. We are looking to develop in phases, first in the UAE, then the GCC, the wider Middle East, and then globally. These are the steps that we are taking right now, gradually.</p><h4>How is customer segmentation  defined for Al Islami Foods?</h4><p>In the UAE and other GCC countries, Al Islami is considered one of the premium brands in the market. Our pricing is a bit more expensive than the other brands as a result of the quality that we are trying to maintain, including everything from packaging to merchandising to distribution and R&amp;D. We try to create a gap between us and our competitors. We are strong compared to our competitors in the halal segment. There are people who compete with us in the chicken segment, but for halal products we are ahead. There will always be consumer segmentation to a certain extent, as a minority want to go the extra mile to check that something is indeed halal, instead of simply believing the government.</p><h4>Where do you see the opportunity going forward?</h4><p>We are looking to educate our consumers as to why we are better. We aim to really convert the masses. We are not just selling food, we are selling the philosophy that our founder embedded into our products. We want to show the bright side of Islam, as the media often shows the negative side. If you ask this number of Muslims what they see in the media about their religion, it is not positive. We are trying to give them an alternative, and it is about future, brightness, and accepting others.</p><h4>How would you describe your vision and the evolution of what halal foods internationally?</h4><p>I believe in consumer rights. At the end of the day, the consumers have rights. And they have to be educated to be able to use their rights. Halal standardizations are different in each part of the world. Turkey says it has real halal, as does Saudi Arabia and Dubai. There is no way we can get a unified standard to make everybody happy. We need to give the consumer the right education for them to decide what to eat. Islam will accept anyone as long as the person believes in it. In Islam, there are people who have to do it by the book, and then there are the people that are more neutral a they just believe. These are individual differences that we cannot standardize. We have variation, which is acceptable, like any religion. We have to give the consumers their right to decide what they want. At the same time, it has to be written on the packaging. Anyone can write “halal," but we explain what our process was. There are many kinds of processes, and the consumer should be able to choose. If they want to eat machine-slaughtered chickens, then that is ok, and if they want to eat hand-slaughtered chickens then that is ok too. They should have the right to know and choose on their own. Most companies do not want to say how it was produced, so they just write “halal." I think the day will come when the consumers demand the right to know.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Recently, Ducab broke ground on a $59 million new factory in Abu Dhabi. What kind of opportunity will this create for Ducab moving forward?</h4><p>The factory will produce aluminum, and it gives us several strands of opportunity. First of all it is going to be cost effective for the aluminum world, and we are going to be associated with the world's single largest smelter. We will be taking hot metal and casting directly from that as well as specific alloy cables. We see a slow substitution of copper for aluminum in the cable business, which is what is happening elsewhere in the world. We also have a root in the market already through our existing copper cable customers. Almost all of our existing copper customers buy aluminum as well; therefore, we can go to our existing customers and offer them additionals product. It is a new business widening the market and addressing the fact that aluminum is growing in the Middle East. We are going to be substituting quite substantial imports of aluminum into the Middle East through our factory.</p><h4>Ducab also recently bought the UK-based AEI cables company. How will this acquisition positively affect export sales and domestic sales?</h4><p>The AEI acquisition was all about opportunity. It was a small business but a specialized one. It makes niche cable products, and we are proud to be supplying cables for the UK Royal Navy's aircraft carriers and for the submarine and underground programs. We are supplying specialty cables, and each of these specialty niches has to be custom designed and meet approvals. They also want to see track records, and what AEI has given us are many more pages to our catalog of items that are already approved and have a proven track record that would have taken us years to develop. It also has its own compounding experience and plant where it manufactures the special rubber compounds used in these cables. It brought a lot of knowledge and experience, and we will continue to produce in the UK as well as in Abu Dhabi. It provides many opportunities to start selling cables that otherwise would have been imported, and it also allows us to enter other markets, such as rail. We now offer a full line of railroad products.</p><h4>How would you describe your domestic and international growth strategy in moving forward?</h4><p>We want to first of all continue growing as the Middle East is growing. We want to capitalize on the growth we are getting and are seeing in the UAE and the GCC. Therefore, we will maintain our market share in the UAE and growing our market share in the GCC. That is geographically the range of the expansion we want to continue domestically. You have to start at home, and we have seen tremendous growth in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. In Saudi Arabia, we are a lot smaller and see a tremendous opportunity for growth there. We are seeing an opportunity for taking even a small market share, which is huge because the Saudi market is quite large and still growing. The other strand to our growth strategy is not only expanding geographically, but also in our product lines, which is where AEI fits in. We want to have a broader product range, and this ties into what is happening elsewhere in the GCC in expanding outside of oil and gas. Industrial applications need industrial cables, and now we are able to offer the kinds of cables to meet those needs now as we did with railways. This will give us more opportunities to get into niche markets outside of construction.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which of Schneider Electric's business segments has the most importance in Dubai and the UAE?</h4><p>We have seven targeted segments that bring us the strongest growth and where there is a strong differentiation in our offer to our customers. The first is oil and gas, where we have a dedicated team to follow the sector from the beginning of pre-fitting to the installation of our equipment in the field. The second one is water infrastructure. We provide not only the electricity needed to treat the water and run the desalination and wastewater plants, but also all the software needed to monitor these plants. The third segment is energy, and we focus on delivering equipment for electrical solutions and smart grid software that allows the utility providers to manage their energy supplies in the most efficient way possible. The fourth segment is real estate, especially hotels. There are many hotels in Dubai and across the UAE, and authorities are planning to expand the tourism industry. The fifth segment is healthcare, and the sixth is data centers. More and more data is needed all the time, and this is where we can provide a full turnkey data center for storing and securing data. The last segment is the smart city concept itself. The point at the country level is to make all the component parts communicate together to have a layer of data control that manages the data, the water, and the grid as one.</p><h4>What is the potential for Dubai to become a smart city and how can Schneider Electric contribute to this goal?</h4><p>Dubai is already a smart city to some extent, and there is a major focus moving on to the next level. Data and public services can be accessed through your smartphone, and for every public entity we do business with currently, such smart services are being rolled out. We provide a lot of training to these entities. Schneider Electric is well recognized in this field globally. We are one of the top three companies worldwide in terms of creating smart cities, along with Cisco and IBM. </p><h4>Dubai is developing an integrated energy strategy to improve its energy matrix by 2030. What are the main challenges that Dubai has to face in this sector?</h4><p>The smart grid is something that Dubai should embrace, and we have high-level workshops with Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and other authorities to work toward this. Demand is clearly rising in the Dubai energy sector, and there are several initiatives by the Dubai government to try to control this. One is being carried out by DEWA. It has a department called Etihad Energy Services (Etihad ESCO), which specializes in doing energy saving work on existing buildings. They encourage the private sector to save energy by retro-fitting their buildings with better technology that will allow their buildings to consume less. This is the demand side of the issue, where we can decrease the consumption of energy through existing infrastructure. Schneider Electric is the main provider of this type of technology for these buildings. In every country and city, there are certain seasons of greater consumption. It is important to monitor this consumption by data so that we can adapt production in real time. In the UAE, there is certainly some progress needed on smart grid implementation, and this is one of DEWA's main priorities at the moment. We need to be able to produce just enough energy in accordance with what customers need in real time, while not overproducing and creating more of a carbon footprint.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you sum up the successes of RTA in the past year?</h4><p><span></span>We had a number of successes last year, such as the inauguration of Dubai Tram on November 11th, which was rolled out on schedule. I am proud to say that public transport use topped 502 million passengers in 2014, with a 12.6% increase compared with 446 million in 2013. The public transport network in Dubai has become essential for serving the mobility and access needs of people across the Emirate. Our roads and transportation system underpins the framework of the city and supports the growth and development of Dubai. In supporting and contributing to the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to transform Dubai into a smart city, RTA has developed a smart city program and launched several mobile applications with all its 173 public services being available on smartphones. RTA is focused on sustainability as part of its contribution to supporting Dubai's transformation into a sustainable city. During 2014 RTA has carried out 32 energy conservation initiatives and eight green economy support initiatives. These initiatives are expected to achieve savings of about $4.63 million and to cover various RTA sectors and agencies. Other projects include the commencement of the Integrated Transportation Information Center (ITIC), which is a central management hub for the enormous volume of data available through the different RTA transportation systems. RTA has also commenced work on the Enterprise Command Control Center project, known as EC3, which will monitor, coordinate, and manage all transportation systems in Dubai in coordination with the emergency services.</p><h4>How important is the PPP model to the success of RTA?</h4><p>One of the strategic goals of the RTA is to promote the concept of partnering with the private sector to create transport infrastructure. This offers RTA the opportunity to focus on economic and social infrastructure programs while enabling the private sector to implement projects and incorporate the world's best practices and innovations. Private sector involvement in RTA projects is not new. The RTA has implemented projects through private sector partnerships, and is planning to increase the involvement of the private sector going forward by implementing new medium to large projects. The RTA is preparing a PPP strategic plan that will include implementing a number of PPP projects. These include private sector participation in new projects such as bridges, roads, parking, bus stations, transit-oriented development (TOD), and marine services and infrastructure.</p><h4>With Dubai's Smart City initiative high on the government's agenda, how does RTA utilize technology and Smart Services to increase its capacity?</h4><p>RTA already is a major user and developer of new technologies. It is committed to investing in new, smart technology as part of its contribution to making Dubai the world's smartest city. Technologies such as the cloud, the Internet of Everything, data analytics, social networking, mobile, and other systems are being developed to this end. The RTA launched several smart applications in 2014, including the Smart Parking, Smart Drive, Smart Salik, Wojhati, the Smart Taxi, Drivers and Licensing, Public Transport, and the Corporate Services apps, with a total of 173 smart services launched as part of these programs. These applications allow customers to access RTA services from anywhere at any time, and to deliver a superior user experience.</p><h4>How important do you think additional investment in the transport sector is to Dubai's aspirations of being a leading international transport and logistics hub?</h4><p>In general, highly connected transport networks contribute significantly to increased levels of development, increased property values, as well as to the quality and vibrancy of a city. Our studies showed that the development and operation of the Dubai Metro system has led to a notable increase in the value of land and properties around the metro stations, ranging from 7-34%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does DEWA play in Dubai today?</h4><p>DEWA plays a major role in supporting Dubai's economic, social, and environmental development. Obviously, electricity and water are the key enablers of the economy in any country. This is why DEWA is fully aligned to the Dubai Plan 2021 and the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030. Both of these strategies are working to develop and diversify Dubai's energy economy, with a clear focus on sustainability and innovation, as demonstrated in our vision to become a sustainable and innovative world-class utility. DEWA is investing over $12 billion over the next five years on water and electricity infrastructure, renewable energy, smart grids, and transmission and distribution networks.</p><h4>DEWA has awarded a contract to build a new 400kV substation for the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. What is the significance of this for the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030 to diversify the energy mix by 2030?</h4><p>The Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park is one of the largest renewable energy projects in the region. It will cover an area of 40 sqkm and generate 3,000 MW of clean energy when completed in 2030. The project supports the Green Economy for Sustainable Development initiative launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai, and is led by the directives of His Highness to enhance R&amp;D in renewable energy. The Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030 aims to diversify the energy mix by 2030 to include 15% from solar power by 2030, in addition to reducing energy demand by 30%.  DEWA awarded the $123 million contract in the third quarter of 2014 to build a 400kV substation to integrate power from the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum solar park. The gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) substation will enhance transmission capacity, boost power supplies, and strengthen the reliability of the grid. The 200 MW second phase of the solar park in Seih Al Dahal, near Dubai, is scheduled to commence production in 2017.</p><h4>According to some experts, Dubai Expo 2020 will result in a growth in electricity demand of 4-6% per year. How is DEWA planning to face this growth of electricity demand?</h4><p>In line with the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, we have a clear strategy to support Dubai's efforts to host Expo 2020. Our strategy is fully aligned with the theme of World Expo 2020, which is “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future," and the three sub-themes of sustainability, mobility, and opportunity. We are committed to fulfilling the promise of His Highness to host the best Expo the world has ever seen. DEWA is working hard to achieve this by focusing on preparing a distinguished infrastructure for energy that meets all the requirements for the sustainable development of Dubai. Expo 2020 is an opportunity to demonstrate to the world our competencies in the utility sector. DEWA is looking carefully at electricity demand growth and has a long-term plan in place to increase generation capacity and transmission infrastructure to manage future demand. The current system reserve margin is comfortable, with significant capacity demands also taken into consideration, especially in solar and clean coal, to achieve the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030 to diversify Dubai's energy mix. We intend to use solar energy to produce electricity as a way to reduce the impact on the environment while also meeting the goals of the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030. Around 7% of Dubai's total power output will be derived from solar power by 2020 and 15% by 2030. Over $707 million has been allocated to support electricity, water, and renewable energy infrastructure for Expo 2020. Projects include production, transmission, distribution, and smart grids. We are doing all of this so that Dubai will host the best Expo the world has ever seen.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AXA Insurance won in 2014, for the 5th consecutive year, Insurer of the Year at the MENA Insurance Awards, and was also awarded the prestigious Banker's Middle East product award for 2013 for the 'Best SME Product.' What is the significance of these two achievements?</h4><p>These awards speak about our consistency to deliver world-class insurance products and services in the MENA region. The selection of AXA Gulf as the Insurer of the Year recognized its commitment to customers, innovation and consistent delivery of high quality coverage, product diversity, technical expertise, leadership and a strong, persistent financial performance. The insurance industry has evolved over the years, and the need of the hour is to deliver the best insurance product customized to suit individual needs, in every sector. To have won the prestigious Insurer of the Year honour at the MENA Insurance Awards for five consecutive years speaks volumes about our company's strategy and comprehensive product portfolio as well as our reputation to deliver consistent first-class services. In this fiercely competitive sector, this is indeed a great achievement for us. Last but not the least, these awards recognize the work delivered by each and every AXA employee in the region, and I thank everyone for making this happen. Those awards reinforce our goal to become the preferred insurer across various markets and categories. Finally, it also reinforces the trust that distributors and clients have in the brand. This is gives us a 360-degree view of what we are doing and how we are perceived in the market as a whole.</p><h4>How important are SMEs to the client portfolio of AXA Gulf?</h4><p>Almost every business starts as an SME and progressively grows larger, so it is natural for us to be rooted and connected to SMEs, because they constitute the future of the economy. SMEs add a lot of innovation and energy to the economy, and their success gives a good measuring stick of the dynamism of the economy as a whole. It is important for us to be well connected to this part of the economy to understand what is going on. According to Dubai SME, an agency of the Department of Economic Development, SMEs represent 95% of companies in Dubai, contribute to 40% of the Emirate's GDP and employs 42% of its workforce. This reflects the critical role that this sector plays in achieving and nurturing the overall development across diverse economic sectors. We have created a dedicated SME unit, the objective of which is to educate SME owners on risks through a specialized team of experts. This team will meet business owners in their offices and analyze their specific requirements to provide adequate prevention and protection measures. Finally, the team will regularly follow up with SME customers and monitor the evolution of their businesses to continuously verify their insurance needs. In addition, AXA in the Gulf will enhance the support to SMEs during their first year and beyond, and this is will be achieved through a new dedicated hotline that business owners can access for advice and information.</p><h4>As one of the preferred insurers chosen to be part of the Dubai Heath Authority (DHA)'s mandatory health insurance initiative, what role do you think that this initiative will play in the development of Dubai?</h4><p>Probably what is more important for me than the economic impact is the social impact of the DHA initiative. I see this as the real role of an insurance company and the insurance sector. You cannot develop the global economy of a country without providing the right level of protection to the citizens. There are many people that are not able to afford treatment locally. This means that either they will not get the treatment at all, or they will wait until they return to their home country, which might be every year or two, to get treatment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Wisdom Received]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[wisdom-received]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize your success in Dubai?</h4><p>Our success in Dubai is clearly because of HH Sheikh Mohammad's vision. He liberated the government offices and made Dubai an attractive place to work, live, and invest. We have approached Dubai with a holistic rather than a fragmented solution. Putting all of that together has really energized Dubai. It was always a hub in the region, but we have managed to grow it onto a much larger scale. It has been a bit of a rollercoaster at times, but the Emirate's economy is open to the world. This is a result of it being an open economy, and we have developed the agility and ability so that when we suffer a global shock, so we know we are capable of bouncing back. If you look at the UAE or Dubai stock markets in 2013, we have bounced back better than any other exchange. That resilience is in the economy. That is what makes Dubai a dynamic place.</p><h4>How has Mashreq Bank played a role in making Dubai's economy more resilient following the financial crisis?</h4><p>As the oldest bank in the country, we have enjoyed witnessing the progress of the economy and the challenges faced by the Emirate over time. Mashreq has always believed in Dubai's direction, and we have always continued supporting our clients during the difficult times. We have never stopped doing business, and our clients have long histories of operating in the country. We believed they would overcome these challenges, and they did. Mashreq's success is because of our customers' success and the overall strength of the economy.</p><h4>Where are the next steps for the bank?</h4><p>We are aiming to create a better customer experience. At the end of the day, most banks will offer the same products and services. What will differentiate the banks is the experience that the customer goes through when they do their banking transactions. And this experience cannot be copied overnight. If the customer has a great experience, word of mouth and advertising will encourage more customers to come to us, be they retail, SME, or corporate clients. People will know that we mean business.</p><h4>How would you describe Dubai's role as a leading city worldwide today?</h4><p>Dubai has been recognized as one of the leading cities in the world. If you look on the airlines side, Dubai's airport is by far now the largest airport in terms of international passengers. If you look at Dubai's ports, we are the third largest transshipment port in the world. We have established ourselves quickly as a prominent hub for business. If you look at regional offices for multinationals, there is no choice for them but Dubai. From Morocco to Oman, the only logical place is Dubai. The free trade zones will attract people to set up their businesses, and we've also tried to focus on a sector-based approach. We try to promote the finance sector with DIFC, while for media we have Dubai Media City, and a host of other free zones to allow people ownership and a place to set up their factories. Basically, we adapt our free trade zones to a sector focus and in line with the sector's regulations in order to make the investment climate friendly and conducive to business.</p><h4>What is your vision on the HH Sheikh Mohammed's goal to make Dubai the capital of the Islamic economy?</h4><p>It is achievable. We have the market and the know-how here. We are bringing all the segments together as a product, including banking, takaful, and food. We are looking at what it will take, for example, to gain certification for halal food. Anyone can claim it, but we want to make an authenticated Islamic center for certification of halal products. We think it's achievable. We have a track record. When we set our eyes on something, we tend to achieve it. Whatever we have said, we have been able to achieve it and compete on an international scale.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the Al Etihad Credit Bureau on the financial industry?</h4><p>A credit bureau is long overdue. We have done a lot of things here in the UAE except the credit bureau. Finally, we have it. I think it will slow down lending by banks because people will discover how much has been borrowed or over borrowed. Long term, it will protect everyone—borrowers, banks, and the economy—from a crisis. We will be doing proper lending, particularly on the retail and SME side.</p><h4>What is your outlook in the coming year?</h4><p>I am pretty optimistic. We now have a strong currency that is linked to the dollar, which makes it even better for our economy. It may impact some tourists, but our tourist numbers YoY are growing. Because of the infrastructure, the environment, the logistics, and the legal system we have in Dubai, it is one of the most attractive destinations in the region. There is no other city that can compete with us. Everything is available here, and the Emirate boasts strong infrastructure and lifestyle options. You can send your kids to Russian, French, Japanese, or Korean schools, and the range of entertainment and sports options is unrivaled. That kind of diversity is difficult to find in other cities. With regard to the turmoil in the region, we can say that we have gotten used to it. We navigate our country through these geopolitical obstacles and leverage our strengths to come out on top. There is no safer destination for investment than the UAE and Dubai. Countries that are blighted by conflict often see their businesses moving and starting again in Dubai. Many firms from around the Arab world have moved their headquarters to Dubai.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main developments in the financial sector in Dubai over the past year?</h4><p>The past 12 months have been momentous at DFM. We have seen encouraging trading activity, while the DFM's General Index was up by 12% by year-end 2014. Despite the fact that this growth falls short of the wonderful performance of the index in 2013 when it jumped more than 107%, it indicates the resilience of DFM as it managed to keep its momentum after going through two periods of sharp decline during the year. Daily average trading value has increased up 136.7% to $441 million compared to $174 million during 2013. These indicators are the result of growing demand by investors as they increasingly recognize the opportunities available on the market as well as the strong expansion of Dubai's economic sectors. It also reflects the integrity of the market infrastructure in line with international best practices.  In 2014, we have seen a revival of IPO activity with four IPOs listed on DFM by Marka, EMAAR Malls, Amanat as well as Dubai Parks &amp; Resorts. Other listings are on the horizon. These developments indicate a resurgence in this sector, which will have an enormous effect on DFM as many companies are well prepared to take the same route, based on our communication with them and as a direct outcome of our extensive efforts over the past years to educate private and family businesses on the benefits and requirements of the capital markets as part of preparations for the post IPO and listing environment. In fact, what has been achieved is the outcome of years of hard work to implement DFM's sustainable growth strategy. This aims to cope with international best practices and the evolving needs of our growing investor base locally and internationally, provide investors and issuers with value-added services, and diversify investment opportunities through attracting new listings of companies operating in dynamic and rapidly growing economic sectors. DFM has implemented several enhancements and introduced numerous financial instruments and mechanisms such as market making, ETFs, securities lending &amp; borrowing (SLB), direct market access (DMA), rights issues, covered warrants, and the pre-closing session. The year 2014 has also seen an increased pace in our efforts to realize the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, to position Dubai as the capital of the Islamic economy. The DFM published its “Standard for Issuing, Acquiring, and Trading Sukuk" as a first-of-its-kind comprehensive standard that provides issuers and investors the necessary framework and further promotes growth in the Islamic finance sector as one of the main pillars of the initiative. DFM's steady efforts to encourage issuers to list their sukuk on Dubai exchanges have played a pivotal role driving the total value of sukuk listed on the Dubai capital markets up to more than $25 billion compared to $9 billion before the launch of the initiative in early 2013.</p><h4>With the sharp drop in oil prices, investors have been broadly selling off stock throughout the Middle East, creating stock value drops of up to 6.5%. What is your expectation for the financial markets in the Middle East in the next year?</h4><p>Without jumping into predictions on market performance or investor sentiment, we believe that the outlook is encouraging in light of the macroeconomic indicators and the favorable business environment. As far as DFM is concerned, we believe that its remarkable performance is well founded based on the strong performance of the UAE economy and the buoyant outlook for Dubai over the coming years with the well-deserved success of its Expo 2020 hosting bid. Moreover, we believe that having new companies from multiple and dynamic economic sectors on board, the diversifying of liquidity sources, and a healthier balance between retail and institutional investors will play a crucial role in sustaining market activity and restraining volatility. From a wider regional perspective, we think that the regional financial markets in general are currently in a very healthy position on the back of robust economic activity and strong corporate earnings.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Within the core business of creating tailored payment solutions, where lies the greatest opportunity for growth for Network International?</h4><p>Network International has a deep commitment to continuously innovate and build on the customer value proposition. With the growing popularity and use of smartphones, we see the biggest potential around mobile devices and e-commerce as customers demand ingenious and convenient payment technologies that also offer the highest level of security. Another area that has great implications for the UAE payments sector is financial inclusion. Through our partnership with Emirates Identity Authority, we aim to play a pivotal role in launching the UAE's first smart wallet using the Emirates ID card. We have already demonstrated the use of Emirates ID cards in mainstream financial applications. The addition of a smart wallet will provide a further boost to the UAE's goal of achieving greater financial inclusion in the country.</p><h4>How will international partnerships, like the one recently struck with PayPal, play a role in the development of e-commerce within the Middle East?</h4><p>As the leading provider of payment solutions in the MENA, one of our strategic objectives at Network International is to enable the growth of e-commerce across the region through developing speedy and secure payment solutions. Our partnership with PayPal empowers UAE-based merchants and start-ups by providing safer and quicker access to cash payments as local merchants with an online presence can now receive cash in AED from their PayPal accounts directly to any bank in the UAE. To provide you some perspective, up until recently merchants in the UAE could only withdraw funds in dollars from their Pay Pal account via a credit card, regardless of the currency of the transaction. This process could take at least seven days, and of course was also subject to currency conversion charges. This was in addition to various applicable fees. The only other public option was to have a US bank account, which only a handful of merchants in the UAE have. Moreover, we have also recently launched Network Online (NeO), a sophisticated online payment gateway that is expected to provide a substantial boost to e-commerce in the UAE. With NeO, merchants will have access to a mobile and e-commerce payment solution that includes industry-leading security protocols and fraud monitoring capabilities. It includes the added security layer of tokenization, the replacement of sensitive data with a unique identifier that cannot be mathematically reversed, to render payment card data meaningless to hackers.</p><h4>What are your company's expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Although the global economy is at a crucial juncture today and facing strong and complex cross currents, things are looking brighter in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, especially in the UAE, thanks to heavy government spending and robust private sectors. The level of optimism and positive market sentiments in the UAE have certainly helped Network International make significant progress in recent years, enabling us to stay true to our commitment to our partners and customers. With the wider move toward a smart economy, this is a very exciting time for the payments sector in the UAE. In 2014, we processed more than 550 million transactions, amounting to $22.6 billion in acquiring volume, and had several instances of over 100 transactions per second. While these numbers are indeed impressive, we believe that we can offer even more to the industry, which is why we continue to invest in our core assets, namely intellectual capital and technology. With the roll out of our world-class Network One platform, we will soon be capable of processing several thousand transactions a second, making us an extremely valuable partner for merchants in the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the top two achievements by TECOM Investments over the last two years?</h4><p>We have achieved a considerable amount over that period of time. Our business performance has been strong. We've launched new initiatives and concepts, partnered with a number of leading companies and authorities, supported numerous business partners and nurtured creative talents, and we've received a number of awards for our work within the creative industries. But, if I have to pick just two achievements, it would be the TECOM Investments' role in helping to deliver to Dubai's Innovation Strategy and the launch of Dubai Design District, d3, in June 2013, and its subsequent selection as the pilot greenfield development site for Dubai's Smart City initiative. TECOM Investments pioneered the development of Dubai's knowledge economy, the catalyst being the inauguration of Dubai Internet City in 1999; sixteen years later we have established 11 business communities fostering the growth of over 4,650 business partners operating across six industry sectors. By carefully leveraging and enhancing these communities we will be creating the necessary platforms and comprehensive eco-system to provide the next logical step in the city's sustainable economic development. We are already a frontrunner in the government's innovation strategy, and have announced a number of multi-million dirham initiatives to help deliver this, including a new Innovation Hub in Dubai Internet City, which will be a thriving 1.6 million sqf. business development offering companies across the technology, new media, smart education and sciences sectors world-class facilities and services and state-of-the-art infrastructure, and a Creative Community within d3, which will act as an incubator for emerging local designers and artists. We will also introduce wellness facilities across our business communities, as well as a start-up fund to stimulate innovation, and incubators similar to Dubai Internet City in five innovation centers across all sectors. When we announced we would be building a dedicated destination for design and creativity, the response from the region's creative industry was overwhelming. Not long after its public announcement, d3 was honored by being selected as the greenfield development site for Dubai's Smart City initiative. Since then, strategic partnerships with the telecoms operator du, the energy and water provider DEWA, the Road and Transport Authority, Dubai Police, and Dubai Municipality, alongside a number of leading private sector companies, have been formed to help turn this goal into reality. </p><h4>How would you describe TECOM's innovation strategy going forward?</h4><p>Across the Emirate our pioneering business communities are bursting with creative energy. We are proud to be providing a home to over 4,650 business partners, representing a total workforce in excess of 74,000. Our plans for the future are ambitious, and innovation is at the core of our strategy. We have new strategic targets for the next 10 years, which includes growing the number of knowledge and creative workers within our communities, as well as the total number of business partners. Our innovation strategy will help us to achieve these targets and is based on six pillars: developing sustainable smart infrastructure; making business easier; attracting the right talent and investment human capital; supporting the development and growth of start-ups; fostering dynamic industry ecosystems; and activating a vibrant community. The combined total investment allocated toward our new innovation-focused initiatives is $1.23 billion. This will fund the development of infrastructure for d3's Creative Community, Dubai Internet City's Innovation Hub, incubator, and creative spaces in all of our communities, and it will stimulate start-ups and entrepreneurs through the creation of our  start-up fund and competition. We are making good progress against our strategy already.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of Dubai Customs' recent achievements?</h4><p>Dubai Customs has sought to continually improve its business performance across all areas of customs work to serve the country's economy through further trade facilitation. To that end, we have improved our personnel capacities and put in place the latest technologies and systems that expedite processes while securing the community against the entry of prohibited substances. The UAE was ranked third worldwide and first in the MENA region in the Efficiency of Customs Procedures Index from the latest Global Competitiveness Report 2014-15 issued by the World Economic Forum. This is an important recognition for us which adds to many other local, national and international excellence accolades to our name. In 2014, DC achieved high satisfaction scores among our customers (91.2%), employees (86%), suppliers (84%), partners (86%), and above all the community (90%). These satisfaction figures are the result of our longstanding commitment to spreading happiness among all our stakeholders, in line with the vision and “Happiness Meter" initiative of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai.</p><h4>What role has Dubai Customs played as a trade facilitator?</h4><p>The efficient customs facilitation provided by Dubai Customs has supported the growth of Dubai's foreign trade with all parts of the world. Dubai has become a hotspot of international trade due to the efficiency of customs services and advanced logistics infrastructure, which brings traders and investors who choose Dubai as their favorite destination real added value and increasing business returns. Subsequently, over the last decade, Dubai's foreign trade has experienced a five-time growth from AED252 billion in 2003 to 1.331 trillion in 2014.</p><h4>How is the integration of Dubai Customs into the 2015 GCC Customs Union progressing?</h4><p>Dubai Customs has kept pace with the ongoing advancement on the path to full implementation of the GCC Customs Union by 2015, by rigorously applying all relevant resolutions and legislation and reinforcing its relationships with Customs authorities in Gulf countries toward the removal of all barriers to a prosperous inter-regional trade. </p><h4>How does Dubai Customs utilize technology to continue to be a worldwide leader in its field?</h4><p>Dubai Customs has never ceased investing in technology development and innovation, as we believe it is the only way we can continue carrying out our mission efficiently as a cross-border trade facilitator and protector of society. Some of the major innovations made by DC in the past few years include the "Mirsal 2" system, which stands as a quantum leap in customs work today because of the huge potential and new technologies it utilizes, as well as its unique integration of various customs procedures in one single electronic platform, in addition to the “Risk Engine" tool, and the advanced x-ray container scanning system and device. This strong base of technology earned our customs practices and business processes world-class recognition, including an international commendation by the 2013 WCO Columbus Diagnostic Mission Report, which praised our experience as a leading model for other Customs Administrations worldwide.</p><h4>What challenges does Dubai Customs face in the future?</h4><p>We face mega challenges; however, we tend to turn them into opportunities. Striking the right balance between effective control measures and customs compliance on the one hand, and trade facilitation on the other hand, is the foremost challenge we face, as it is linked to Dubai Customs' fundamental mission of sustaining economic development through compliance, facilitation, and security enforcement.</p><h4>What initiatives are being put in place for World Expo 2020?<br></h4><p>We are committed to deliver a perfect and extraordinary exhibition experience to the world, by putting in place superior customs services and facilitations for the mega exposition, including the launch of a smart channel dedicated especially for potential exhibitors to streamline and expedite cargo clearance through a 24/7 automated customs clearance system. In addition, exhibitors can benefit from the pre-clearance feature prior to the actual arrival of goods. Dubai Customs will offer further facilitations to Expo 2020, including temporary admission of goods using ATA Carnet System, Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) program, the B2G integrated electronic channel for clearing several consignments in a single transaction, e-Freight for an automated exchange of air fright documents, alongside other facilitation systems, such as e-Inspection, Cargo Reconciliation, and Claim and Refund e-Services?</p><h4>What does the future hold for Dubai Customs?</h4><p>Dubai Customs' future goals are determined based on UAE Vision 2021 and Dubai Plan 2021. Our strategic plan is in line with the directives of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE President, to mark 2015 as the “Year of Innovation" in the country in order to stimulate creativity and mobilize resources across all sectors, further placing the UAE among the leading nations worldwide in terms of innovation. Dubai Customs views this nationwide move with utmost attention in pursuance of its strategic vision—to be the leading customs administration in the world supporting legitimate trade. Studied plans are put in place to unleash the spirit of innovation and creativity among DC employees. This helps reinforce customs processes with new innovations to boost DC's performance and the UAE's economic growth. We plan to continue being a global leader in four areas: human capital, technology, knowledge, and security.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the role that Network International has played as a partner in the development of the payment service industry of the UAE?</h4><p>The vision behind Network International was to create a homegrown company with expert capabilities to service the growing demands of the financial sector in the UAE and beyond. With a strong management team, in-house expertise, and by leveraging next-generation technology, Network International has carved a niche for itself as an innovator in the payments arena within a short space of time. The company has been instrumental in transforming the payments sector in the UAE by providing the infrastructure for this industry to flourish. We are today the largest payments processor and acquirer in MENA, and the second largest in the MEA region. In addition to payments processing, nearly 60 banks across 27 countries in the MEA region use Network International for credit card issuer processing. We also offer end-to-end ATM services to several major banks in the region.</p><h4>What role does innovation play in the creation of successful products and services to meet the needs of the market?</h4><p>Our strategic growth plan and roadmap revolve around innovation. This may not just be in the form of a new product or technology, but rather about adapting a technology that works well elsewhere and bringing it first to market. When it comes to payment innovation in particular, it could be about rethinking the business model, processes, product, or the way in which interaction with customers and potential customers takes place. Our aim is to be, in every sense, the leading innovative payments service provider in the emerging economies.</p><h4>What challenges do you foresee Network International facing as it continues to expand throughout the MENA region?</h4><p>As far as Network International is concerned, we have been able to effectively leverage our excellent performance and reputation in the UAE to tap into key markets across the region. Of course, as we pursue our aggressive growth and expansion strategy we do have to overcome our share of challenges, for instance, making the necessary adjustments based on the various regulatory frameworks in different countries. However, thanks to our world-class infrastructure and highly skilled and experienced manpower, we have been able to maintain our leadership position in almost all of the markets we are present in.</p><h4>What is Network International's growth strategy going forward?</h4><p>Our vision for the mid to long-term is for Network International to become the leading provider of innovative payment solutions across the Middle East and entire Africa region. This top-line goal underlines our growth strategy. In terms of geographical expansion, while in the UAE and most of the Middle East we have been going from strength to strength, we have also been steadily building our presence in the high-potential Sub-Saharan and North Africa markets. On a day-to-day basis, the company is focused on addressing client needs through a proactive approach, aligned with the delivery of consistent, high-quality service. Simultaneously, we will continue to develop world-class products through R&amp;D, while never missing an opportunity to expand into new business lines.</p><h4>How do you see the payment solutions industry evolving in the Middle East over the years to come?</h4><p>Solutions providers like us are keenly focused on creating the right infrastructure and platforms to enable these digital solutions. Payments migrate based upon customer convenience, from cash and checks that were physically handed over, and now to online payments. We have already moved to the next stage, where physical access to a computer is needless and customers have the option of on-the-go payments solutions via their smart devices. Identifying these next-generation payment trends and leveraging technology to increase customer convenience will shape the future of the payments industry. We will also see increasing innovation and new technologies offered to customers at the point of delivery rather than at the point of sale.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the history of Chedid Re in Dubai and the UAE?</h4><p>For Chedid Re, the UAE is of great importance. It is a very dynamic and competitive market which makes it extremely challenging. At Chedid Re we see these parameters as very exciting and we tune our team mind accordingly. Therefore, we understand that to be successful we had to always anticipate our clients' needs before it becomes obvious. On the other hand, since we are based in Lebanon we have the luxury of cost advantage where you can attract competent and committed human resources at relatively acceptable packages that give us a competitive edge.</p><h4>What is the main focus of business for Chedid Re in the UAE?</h4><p>The way we are structured as a company, we offer a complete solutions to our partners. We have two operations, the treaty operation and the facultative operations. Within both operations we service all lines of business through a team of expertise that provide a first class quality service. The major chunk of our UAE Facultative portfolio is property business because of the volatility of results and the market cycle is soft, insurance companies tend to cede the risk to reinsurers. Property business is an area of primary focus since we are aware that although, the premiums on the primary side are rising because of compulsory medical insurance, the reinsurance premiums are reduced, and the cessions are being decreased over the years. Mainly this is because of motor and medical business being retained. Having said that, over recent years we have seen considerable restructuring as far as the treaties are concerned, and the treaty reinsurers have imposed certain restrictions. This has affected primarily the property business hence the reason why we see this as an area for potential growth for facultative reinsurers.</p><h4>How would you describe your growth strategy for the UAE market?</h4><p>Our growth strategy relies on the areas with unexploited opportunity, especially regarding the restrictions imposed by the reinsurers on the businesses shared between the insurance companies. Previously many mid-sized businesses and SMEs were not routed to the open market because that business used to be shared between the insurance companies locally. However, now with the restrictions imposed by treaty reinsurers, they cannot carry on with such arrangement. Consequently, we are seeing a great deal of growth in the SME business as a result of the new applicable restrictions. We have to keep in mind that although the primary market is growing by double digits every year, the reinsurance market is shrinking because this premium is being retained, meaning that many proportional arrangements are shifting to excess of loss arrangements. A lot of premiums on the top-side are being retained by the companies, the potential growth lies in the business which used to be shared between the players, and this is what we are currently focusing on.</p><h4>Recently the UAE Insurance Authority announced new regulations that are expected to squeeze out small brokerage and advisory firms that have limited capital bases. How do you see these new regulations impacting the insurance industry in the UAE?</h4><p>Introducing regulatory frameworks is always encouraging for professionals. Although we still believe they are not stringent enough. At least, however, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and we look at it positively. People like us always have an impetus to be operating in a regulated environment in order to close doors on unregulated business dealings. In an unregulated market, a broker that pays far less in compliance does not have to take into consideration the cost that I am incurring to comply; and this is also true in many other areas. We have an internal self-regulation in terms quality of reinsurers, policies and procedures. In an unregulated environment this would put us at a disadvantage; therefore for us at Chedid Re, we would encourage regulators to incorporate more stringent requirements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai Chamber organized the Africa Global Business Forum 2014, which brought government and business leaders together from the UAE, the Middle East, and Africa.  What significance did this have on connecting these dynamic regions?</h4><p>Dubai has done business with Africa for a long time and Africa has always been an important business and trading partner with the Emirates. Dubai Chamber has been working hard to enhance trade and commercial ties across the continent for a number of years. With the hosting of the annual Africa Global Business Forum we see an extended opportunity to review Africa's diverse business cultures and explore some of the opportunities for establishing joint partnerships with Dubai's private sector. Last year's Forum provided an insight into investment prospects across Africa and Dubai's position as an ideal partner. The impressive line-up of local, regional, and international speakers discussed areas in relation to trade, finance, logistics, agro-business, and tourism and provided tips on building successful corporate partnerships with regional economic trading blocs. As the Forum brought Africa and the world to Dubai, the spotlight will fall on Dubai's status as an East meets West destination and a world-class hub for major global events, exhibitions, and conferences. As a high-level networking event, AGBF also highlighted the Emirate's accessible corporate climate, unconditional government support to foreign investors, as well as its advanced infrastructural, banking, and financial services. Dubai Chamber's commitment to the African region does not end with the Forum, but will be further strengthened with new initiatives and enhanced bilateral relations, which both sides will endeavour to make a success of while leading to the economic prosperity of our respective regions, including the opening of several Dubai Chamber branch offices to drive two-way business and investment.</p><h4>What role do e-commerce and smart services play in the advancement of both the private and public sector business climate?</h4><p>Embracing online technology is something that all modern businesses need to do to stay competitive today. The UAE accounts for about 60% of the share of e-commerce in the region. Today, traders know the importance of operating a modern business as well as having an online presence, which gives maximum exposure to their products 24/7. Also, the ability to spend online has created a profound advanced effect on the broader economy while improving the efficiency and availability of products without the need to build extensive networks of physical stores. Dubai Chamber offers many of its services online and has also an exclusive agreement with Alibaba for the MENA region that offers its members elite benefits to help them increase export opportunities and facilitate trade through e-commerce. Dubai Chamber's partnership with Alibaba.com seeks to apply the concept of smart trade in line with the strategy of transforming Dubai into a Smart City, recommended by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai. Alibaba.com has 36 million registered users from more than 240 countries and regions and showcases 2.8 million supplier storefronts. Dubai Chamber and Alibaba.com signed an MoU to launch the MENA portal  Dubaichamber.com/alibaba, two years ago. Earlier this year, Dubai Chamber signed MoUs with Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah, and Fujairah Chambers of Commerce to grant portal access and exclusive benefits to its members. The portal has various tiers of membership including verified membership, which has reached 12,000 Dubai Chamber members, and trusted membership. Trusted members receive an accredited digital certificate issued by Dubai Chamber that they can upload on their e-profile to enhance reputation and increase exposure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ras Al Khaimah National Insurance Company (RAK Insurance) has been present in the UAE for almost 40 years. What are some of the recent milestones that the company has achieved this year?</h4><p><span></span>In terms of what we have achieved this year, there are clearly a couple of highlights. We were selected as one of the seven participating insurers for Dubai's mandatory health insurance scheme, which is a significant achievement for us as an organization. Another milestone going into 2015 was the planned majority share acquisition by National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah (RAK Bank). The UAE is a highly competitive market with over 60 insurers. Having a partner like RAK Bank will add value to RAK Insurance, allowing us to increase distribution capability and affording us the opportunity to move into new markets and offer new products. The third milestone this year has been to introduce a new online distribution channel. Clients will be able to go online and buy a range of insurance products and obtain valuable service offerings.  On top of that, we have been going through a transitional period as an organization. We set a new strategy for the company in 2013, which runs through to 2017.</p><h4>What are the main focuses in terms of products?</h4><p><span></span>As a company, we are a composite insurer, which means that we sell both life, medical, and general insurance products to corporate and retail clients. Moving into 2015 and beyond, we will be looking to expand our footprint in the retail sector. In that respect, our product range will become more focused, specific to each and every need of a client, with an eye on simplifying the structure and pricing of the products. We are also making it easier for clients to shop for products.</p><h4>How would you describe the main pillars of your growth strategy, and how it will impact RAK Insurance?</h4><p><span></span>The initial focus has been on adopting a multi-channel approach to distribution. We are working closely with brokers, looking at bancassurance, corporate, retail, and e-commerce, as well as building for the first time, our own direct sales force. We are beginning a multi-channel of distribution, repackaging or restructuring our product offerings, and making it easier for a client not only to buy the product, but for them to understand what they are buying. We went through a complete transformation in terms of our brand in May 2013. Our brand was the starting point because we want to be seen as a different insurer, appealing to a more affluent sector of the market.</p><h4>What impact do you believe mandatory health insurance will have on the health insurance industry as a whole?</h4><p><span></span>As the population in Dubai continually increases, especially within the expatriate population, the need for health insurance is becoming more and more a necessity, not only from an employee's perspective, but also from the perspectives of employers and the government. I think the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) has done a good job in developing the initial structure and putting in place what will be a world-class healthcare offering. The DHA and the Participating Insurers will now learn and adjust accordingly.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the insurance industry going forward?</h4><p><span></span>I believe there is continuing opportunity and optimism in the foreseeable future, but again, as I mentioned, pricing is becoming a challenge, as well as profitability for some companies. I believe regulation has a major part to play as the insurance industry moves forward and becomes more mature. Unlike Saudi Arabia, which is well regulated by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, the regulator in UAE is working through a number of challenges that the sector faces. Although there is significant market opportunity, I believe competition is very strong, while pricing is weak, and there is over capacity in the market as well. Companies that want to succeed will have to deliver better quality products and better quality services, and they are going to have to become much more consumer focused than they have been in the past.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Dubai's overall economic performance in 2014?</h4><p>We expect about 4% GDP growth for the whole year. This is a good performance given the unfavorable international environment, particularly in EU and emerging market economies, including China. The sharp drop in the price of oil has had an impact on tourism and related activities compared to the same period of 2013, yet the number of tourists has increased by about 5.5%, which is higher than the growth in international tourism. In addition, foreign trade has been affected to some extent by the sharp rise in import duties on gold bullion and jewelry in India, a major trade partner for Dubai. Manufacturing performed well with more than 6.5% growth value added. Another sector that experienced a strong rebound is construction and real estate with more than 3.5% growth value added, against less than 2% in 2013 and negative rates in earlier years. Transportation was also a vibrant sector, particularly air transportation where Emirates airline continued its stellar performance with more than 13% increase in passenger numbers between 2013 and 2014. Against this good performance, we should also factor new inflationary pressures that Dubai experienced in 2014, with the consumer price index rising over 4.2% by the end of the year after several years of quasi price stability, essentially due to rising housing cost. </p><h4>What ongoing government projects or initiatives will have the most profound impact on Dubai's ability to attract investment going forward?</h4><p>The largest megaproject by far is the Mohammed Bin Rashid City, a multi-billion dollar mixed-use development with the main components expected to be complete by 2019. It will include a park, larger than London's Hyde Park, with a capacity to host more than 35 million visitors annually. This park will also accommodate 100 new hotels. A second component will be a large retail space and a new shopping mall—the largest in the world—designed as an extended retail street network. A third component is a cultural district with a large area for art galleries, expected to be the largest of its kind in the MENA region. In addition, 1,500 luxury villas featuring Arab and Mediterranean design will surround the green heart of the city. The Expo 2020 site is another multi-billion project that Dubai is committed to complete a year ahead of the event. Extending over 438 ha, it will include 180 pavilions and an underground rail network. In addition, Dubai's metro network will be expanded and connected to the Expo site. Other transportation and logistics projects, such as an additional metro line and the expansion of Dubai World Central, are also to be carried out in phases and completed before 2020.</p><h4>How is Dubai's economy positioned to endure the decline in the price of oil? </h4><p>The direct effects of the sharp drop in the price of oil since the last quarter of 2014 are limited, as oil accounts for less than 2% of Dubai's GDP and less than 12% of total government revenue. The indirect effects may have stronger repercussions on Dubai's economy. On the positive side, economic activities that are energy-intensive, such as air transportation, will benefit from the drop in oil prices. Emirates airline, for instance, is expecting a sharp rise in profits for the year 2014-15, partly due to favorable trends in energy cost, which accounts for more than 30% of total cost. DEWA, the electricity and water company, may be another beneficiary of the drop in energy prices. As for tourism and related activities, on the one hand, the purchasing power of oil-importing countries will be higher and travelling cheaper, while the flows of tourists from oil-exporting countries may slow down. In addition, recent trends in exchange rates may slow down tourism, particularly from euro zone countries. The drop in oil prices may also influence investment in real estate, as a large number of investors are expatriates such as those from Saudi Arabia and Russia. However, this impact may be salutary for Dubai's economy, as it will reduce speculation and cool down the real estate market. The best way to shield Dubai from the negative repercussions is diversification, which has been the foundation of the city's development. As Dubai's economy has displayed a great deal of resilience to other external shocks, it continues to seize opportunities for further diversification and stabilization.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>At the end of 2014, there was talk from a number of OPEC Member Countries that it is not in the interest of the Organization to cut production regardless of how low prices may fall. What are your expectations of long-term output for OPEC Members?</h4><p>There is no doubt that OPEC Member Countries will remain central to the world's long-term oil supply. Members hold over 80% of the world's proven crude oil reserves and in our World Oil Outlook (WOO) 2014, total OPEC liquids supply is expected to increase by almost 15 million bpd by 2040, from around 35 million bpd today to just under 50 million bpd. Over the same period, non-OPEC liquids supply is only expected to increase by around 5 million bpd. In addition, OPEC Member Countries are also generally the lowest cost producers, so economically it makes sense to produce this oil.</p><h4>What role is the UAE currently playing in OPEC's current policy objectives?</h4><p>Every OPEC Member Country is important to the Organization. In terms of the UAE, it has of course hosted a number of OPEC Ministerial Conferences, seen its Ministers sit as OPEC Conference President on many occasions, and afforded OPEC a Secretary General in the 1980s. It has also provided staff to the Secretariat and continues to be actively involved in the Organization's meetings and activities. We respect and appreciate the UAE's support and input.</p><h4>The UAE has vowed to continually increase production in the next three years, what is the viability of this given the given the state of the market?</h4><p>With OPEC expected to supply the majority of the additional liquids in the long term, member countries will obviously need to make investments. I am sure the UAE is analyzing the market, both current and future, and making any investment decisions based upon this. Moreover, with most of the 20 million bpd oil demand increase by 2040 expected in Asia, the UAE is ideally positioned geographically to meet the rising oil demand of this region.</p><h4>How has the UAE positioned itself through economic diversification to withstand fluctuations in oil prices?</h4><p>All OPEC members recognize the importance of looking to other sources of income, and of course, economic diversification is vital. The UAE is currently pursuing its 2021 Vision, which aims to place innovation, research, science, and technology at the centre of a knowledge-based competitive economy. It is evident there is a focus on increasing investment, both local and foreign, in industrial and other export-oriented sectors, such satellite and telecommunications, the aviation sector, with the UAE's two main airlines, Emirates and Etihad, and in clean energy with the Masdar Initiative. Tourism too is playing a major role in the economic diversification of the UAE, with the country now a top tourist destination with many world-class hotels. The UAE is clearly planning for its future through its economic diversification objectives and is well placed to withstand fluctuating oil prices. Although, as with any oil producer, it would obviously prefer to see the oil market in balance, with stable prices that are acceptable to both producers and consumers.</p><h4>Given the decline in Chinese demand and the increasing diversification of energy supplies, what markets do you expect will be vital to OPEC over the next decade?</h4><p>There has been some weakness in Chinese demand, although this should be put in some perspective. Chinese oil demand is still expanding YoY, and as I already mentioned, the Asian region will be the main hub for oil demand growth in the years ahead. In terms of energy supplies, in our WOO 2014 we see growth for all energies in the next five to 10 years, and in the years thereafter. Of course, there are varying growth rates for energies, but it is clear that fossil fuels with remain central to the energy mix for the foreseeable future, with oil, gas and coal all expected to have shares in the energy mix of between 25-27% by 2035. So to sum up, oil will remain central to the world's energy needs and Asia will be the biggest growth market for OPEC's oil supplies in the coming decades.</p>]]></richbody0content>

What is the significance of this award to MetLife?</h4><p>We are pleased that MetLife was recognized as the Life Insurance Company of the Year in the Middle East. This is an important recognition from our industry peers, particularly as the award focuses on excellence. The award citation “Putting customers first, embracing best standards, making things easier, and succeeding together" are the values behind MetLife's Life Insurance Company of the Year Award, capturing the essence of who we are as a company.

MetLife has been a pioneer of life insurance in the Middle East and Africa for more than 60 years and this recognition validates our strategy and reinforces our leadership position in the region.</p><h4>A recent E&amp;Y report suggested that, in the Middle East, technology is going to shape the way insurance markets operate. How is MetLife implementing technology to continue its growth throughout the Middle East?</h4><p>Technology plays a vital role in helping the industry drive growth, improve efficiency, and boost service delivery for customers as well as lower operating costs.

MetLife is making a significant investment in technology in order to operate as efficiently and effectively as possible and to enhance the customer experience. We have clear objectives to break down geographic and organizational boundaries and take a global view to leverage scale, simplify how we operate, and create a differentiated customer experience. We've focused on innovation in products, distribution, and services, including digital communications, such as SMS and email, and the launch of online portals, as well as the optimization of back-end processes. We were first to launch an e-claims service here in the Gulf, an online claims application process designed by MetLife so that medical providers and claim administrators can undertake a range of claims-related functions online, easily and conveniently. It's made an instant impact and helped us to reduce significantly the time taken for pre-approvals, claims receipt, and processing. Technological advances such as e-claims provide the foundation for achieving our customer-centric objectives and ensure that the experiences provided to all customers are of the highest standard.</p><h4>One of the visions of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum is to lead Dubai to the point of being the Islamic economy capital of the world. How is MetLife positioned to embrace Islamic finance?</h4><p>The UAE is a dynamic market and we continue looking at takaful as a potential opportunity. In 2014 we conducted a preliminary analysis for the further assessment of the existing opportunities in the region, given the growth potential experienced in recent years in Islamic insurance. One of the benefits of being a global business is that we can draw on our Islamic insurance experience in other parts of the world, such as our joint venture with a leading Malaysian bank.</p><h4>How do you think recent legislation increasing capital adequacy requirements for insurance companies will affect the market?</h4><p>We do not think the new capital framework introduced by the Insurance Authority will disproportionally affect smaller firms. Smaller firms write less volume of business and their capital requirements will be proportionate to that. What is important is that the new rules mean that all companies in the market will have to abide by the same rules. In our view, this creates a level playing field and ensures companies that serve customers are adequately capitalized. In the long run, this is good for the development of the insurance market and ultimately good for the consumer. This is particularly important for the life insurance industry, where policies are designed for the long term.</p><h4>Can you comment on the Dubai Health Authority's first phase of mandatory health insurance cover, which began at the end of October 2014?</h4><p>MetLife has been operating in the UAE insurance market for more than 50 years, and we were pleased to be able to put our substantial experience at the disposal of Dubai Health Authority when it was formulating the new law. MetLife was one of only seven insurance companies to be granted Participating Insurer (PI) status by the Dubai Health Authority. Under the new law, which makes health insurance mandatory for all residents by 2016 in Dubai, we can provide basic health insurance benefits to employees with salaries under $1,088 per month. Dubai Health Authority estimates that around 2 million people fall into this low salary band bracket. We plan to play a leading role by leveraging our distribution reach and creating new and enhanced products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the bilateral relationship between the UAE and Colombia?</h4><p>Colombia and the UAE established diplomatic relations in 1976. In recent years, both countries have opened embassies in their respective capitals and this, together with high-level visits, has strengthened our bilateral relationship. I have met the Minister of Foreign Affairs, HH Sheikh Abdullah, on several occasions, in Colombia, in the UAE, and at the UN, and we have discussed different bilateral political and economic issues. We have also signed several agreements and MOUs that provide concrete actions and roadmaps for different sectors in both countries. The UAE co-sponsored the Colombian initiative on sustainable development goals (SDGs) that ended up being the most concrete result of the UN Conference Rio+20. The SDGs are now the basic framework for the UN's post-2015 development agenda and will replace and give enhanced continuation to the Millennium Development Goals. Similarly, Colombia was the first country in the world to support Dubai's bid to host the World Expo in 2020.</p><h4>In what areas are Colombia and the UAE strengthening ties?</h4><p>Despite geographical distance, the two countries have shown great political will to strengthen ties in areas such as trade, investment, energy, education, culture, and sport. Since the opening of the Embassy of Colombia in Abu Dhabi in 2012, exports from Colombia to the UAE have increased from $5 million to $100 million over the past year. Although this is still a modest figure, it shows the great opportunities that all exporting sectors have identified, and I am convinced that in trade and investment we can do many things together.</p><h4>How does the recent UAE visa exemption for Colombian diplomatic and official passport holders bring the two countries closer together?</h4><p>My visit to the UAE last November within the framework of the Sir Bani Yas Forum was a great opportunity to once again meet with the Foreign Minister. We reviewed the bilateral agenda and undertook three agreements: one to establish a mechanism for political consultations; another on a Joint Committee on Bilateral Cooperation; and a third on visa exemptions for holders of Diplomatic, Official, and Special passports. All visa-free mechanisms facilitate contact between nationals of different countries. In the future, we hope to establish a visa-free system similar to those we have set up with other countries. In 2011, Colombia eliminated tourist and short-visit visas for UAE citizens.</p><h4>How important is it to attract investment from the UAE and what areas are particularly attractive?</h4><p>Colombia is one of the most attractive countries in Latin America for foreign investment, and the figures speak for themselves. FDI increased from $6.758 billion in 2010 to $16.2 billion in 2013. According to the World Bank 2014 Doing Business report, Colombia is one of the most business-friendly and reforming countries in Latin America. The Colombian government is committed to offering incentives to boost investment, investor stability, and, most importantly, legal stability. In Colombia there are specific sectors that attract the attention of foreign investors, namely mining, energy, infrastructure, communications technologies, agriculture, industry, and tourism. Colombia is a new emerging economy determined to become the most educated and developed in Latin America over the coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the reforms made in the local business environment in the UAE?</h4><p>The UAE is the best performer in the Arab world in the Doing Business 2015 rankings. This strong performance is a direct result of consistent reforms to the business and investment climate in the country. Actually, the UAE is ranked 22nd in the 2015 overall ease of doing business table, but is also among the top 10 most improved performers in the world in the areas measured by the Doing Business survey. For the period covered in the last report, the UAE implemented several reforms that resulted in an improved business regulatory environment. Firstly, in the area of registering property, the country has made property transfers easier by introducing new service centers and a standard contract for property transactions. In the area of getting credit, the UAE improved access to credit information by starting to exchange credit information with a utility. Thirdly, the UAE strengthened minority investor protections by introducing additional approval requirements and greater disclosure requirements for related-party transactions at the stock exchange.</p><h4>What factors lend to the UAE's distinction in the World Bank's Doing Business report?</h4><p>Trading across borders continues to improve in the UAE. Many measures have been implemented over the past few years. The UAE made trading across borders easier through adding greater capacity at the container terminal in Dubai, eliminating the requirement for a terminal handling receipt, and improvements in the banking sector reducing the cost of trade finance products. It streamlined document preparation and reduced the time to trade with the launch of Dubai Customs' comprehensive new customs system, Mirsal 2. Accordingly, exporting only requires three documents, and takes seven days on average. The cost to export is $665 per container. Similarly, imports require five documents and take about a week. The cost of importing a container is about $625. These impressive achievements are the result of concerted reforms and significant investments to improve the trading system. The UAE has made significant improvements in other areas measured by the Doing Business Report as well. The country is ranked fourth globally in dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, and registering property, and is the best country in the world in terms of payment of taxes. These gains in the business climate make the UAE a favorite destination to do business.</p><h4>What issues do you expect to be at the forefront in regards to further improving the business climate and competitiveness of the Emirates?</h4><p>Three areas require more reforms to realize even greater improvements in the UAE business climate and its ranking. Firstly, the time it takes to enforce contracts could be improved. Secondly, resolving insolvency requires more reforms to improve the legal framework, cost, time, and recovery rates. And lastly, getting credit could be facilitated further, by building on recent gains in legal rights and by expanding the coverage of the credit bureau and credit registry. The World Bank will partner with the UAE through a new effort to promote competition and further improve the business environment in individual Emirates. As you know, Dubai represents the UAE in the annual global Doing Business Report that compares 189 economies globally. The new subnational project will go beyond Dubai to measure business regulations and their enforcement in other Emirates by benchmarking business regulations and their implementation across selected locations and comparing them among themselves, as well as with over 180 economies benchmarked by the annual global Doing Business Report. The project will identify regulatory constraints, provide national and international good practice examples, and recommend actions for reform in the areas measured. It will provide a strategic policy tool to the federal and local authorities to advance the regulatory reform agenda at the subnational level in the areas measured.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the contribution that DP World makes to the economy?</h4><p>DP World is a vital component of Dubai's economy, contributing to the success achieved thanks to the vision of our leaders. Together with our partners we are contributing greatly to the development of our country both now and for future generations. HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, and those who came before him have set us on a journey to becoming the fourth largest port operator in the world today, with more than 65 marine terminals across six continents. The ports industry is a vital economic pillar. It supports a country's growth and prosperity. With its modern and efficient ports, Dubai has established an unrivalled position as a maritime hub for the region and our flagship Jebel Ali terminal provides gateway access to a market of more than 2 billion people. Our geographical advantage is complemented by a determination to innovate to meet the present and future needs of our customers. As Dubai prepares to handle the cargo required for Expo 2020, we are favorably positioned to impact world trade. Our acquisition of one of the world's largest free zones, Jafza, adjacent to our Jebel Ali port and within 45 minutes driving distance from Dubai World Central, will further enhance Dubai's position and integrate our services for business. Given Jafza's contribution to Dubai's GDP stood at around 21% in 2013, we believe the combination of free zone services and a world class port under one roof will be a key feature for Dubai's success in the future. The details of our operations at Jebel Ali underline our contribution to the country. In 2014, our UAE region handled a record 15 million containers, double-digit growth of 11.8% compared to the previous year. Capacity for an additional 2 million containers came on stream in the third quarter of 2014, providing the resources we need to achieve further volume growth. Capacity for a further 2 million containers is expected to come on line in the second half of 2015, taking total Jebel Ali capacity to 19 million TEUs. Looking ahead, the connection of Etihad Rail to Jebel Ali Port in the near future will result in a multi-modal supply chain that seamlessly links sea, road-rail, and air through the Dubai Logistics Corridor (DLC), making it a premier gateway for the region and the entire Middle East.</p><h4>How do you see the strategy of DP World in the build up to World Expo 2020 and beyond?</h4><p>DP World is a major player in supporting the success of this event and we are focusing on making sure we have the infrastructure in place to support the anticipated increase in trade flows by expanding capacity at our flagship Jebel Ali Port. In addition to the capacity expansions at Jebel Ali Terminal 3, we have the infrastructure in place for Terminal 4, which gives us the flexibility to roll out more capacity in line with market demand. Working closely with our customers is integral to our strategy and we also look forward to helping Dubai and the UAE host Expo 2020.</p><h4><br>How will DP World's strategy and operations coincide with the Dubai 2021 Vision?</h4><p>Being a major supporter of Dubai and the UAE's economy, we are aligning ourselves with the vision to make Dubai one of the world's smartest cities. Jebel Ali's new container Terminal 3 will be the most technologically advanced terminal in the region once completed, featuring 19 of the world's largest and most modern quay cranes. The Dubai Trade electronic portal provides integrated electronic services that connect a wide range of trade and logistics providers and key government agencies, including Dubai Customs, within a single electronic window. Meanwhile, the integrated Dubai Logistics Corridor ensures that Customs, DP World (Jebel Ali Port), and Dubai Trade present the gateway of choice to the Middle East.</p><h4>How do you think that DP World acts as a partner for development of countries throughout Africa, India, Europe, and the Middle East?</h4><p>We know from experience what modern infrastructure can do for economies, helping to unlock potential and connect traders with world markets, supporting and driving growth. Ports are gateways to world trade and we invest for the long term, contributing to economic growth. We believe there needs to be more private sector and government investment around PPPs, a model we have pursued around the world. At DP World, we have invested over $6 billion over the last five years adding capacity and upgrading our infrastructure in countries around the world and becoming a major employer. For example, studies show some 36,000 direct and indirect jobs will be created by the development of our London Gateway terminal in the UK. Since taking over management of Dakar, Senegal, in 2008 we have made a major contribution to Senegal's economy with our development of the terminal and the local community. This includes creating more than 200 jobs for local Senegalese people, with specialized training given to all terminal employees, expanding their skills, and bringing operational efficiencies in line with our global standards. Our expansions there have raised capacity from less than 300,000 TEUs to more than 600,000 TEUs and DP World Dakar today handles around one-third more volumes than it did four years ago, benefiting both the trade and Senegal's economy. Meanwhile, our terminal in Callao, Peru is the largest and most efficient container terminal on South America's Pacific coast and the busiest terminal in the Port there. It is also one of the most productive terminals in the whole of South America. We officially opened the facility in 2011 and in our first year of operation throughput growth at Callao was 22%. It grew a further 22% the following year, proof that the capacity increase provided by DP World was quickly translated into growth opportunities, and a major factor in the increase of Peru's international trade. To date the cargo value handled by DP World Callao represents around 10% to 12% of total Peruvian GDP. DP World Callao serves both the importers and exporters of Peru, but importantly it acts as a gateway to trade across the wider region, which naturally benefits the Peruvian economy.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the impact of major urbanization developments across Panama over the past few years?</h4><p>
	Panama has been growing both within Latin America and globally as an attractive destination for investors and people looking to reside. We have a population of around four million people and the domestic real estate market is still far short of its true economic potential. The construction sector in Panama is growing on the back of large projects; however, our challenge has to do with planning better urban development and having a longer-term vision. Our capital, for example, is currently congested with traffic, necessitating several projects such as the metro line, urban reorganization, and the development of suburban cities. We are keen to divert congestion and traffic away from the capital. Meanwhile, over the past few years there have been important retail, commercial and housing projects. For example, we have developed several social housing projects and provided economic support to people of reduced economic means.
</p><h4>What is Panama's current housing deficit?</h4><p>
	When we took over, the housing deficit was 142,000 units. These numbers represent a cruel reality; namely that housing was not a priority for previous administrations. In stark contrast, we have made social housing a top priority. The Ministry has duly developed several programs to give access to housing and build new units. For example, in 2015 the Ministry is set to tender and build 15,000 new housing units.
</p><p class="quote">
	The Ministr<strong></strong>y has duly developed several programs to give access to housing and build new units.
</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the development plans the government has for Colón?</h4><p>
	Colón is located at the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal. The reality is that Panama City is a developing city that attracts people and investment. Colón, however, has been left behind and has lacked investment in infrastructure, both socially and economically. Commercially speaking, however, Colón is the second most important city in Panama, and in terms of population, the third. It needs a clear push for development. Housing programs and investment in infrastructure are at the heart of our efforts to develop the city. We will build 5,000 new housing units in the short-term. This will be accompanied by recreation and sport infrastructure. We will also invest in public service infrastructure such as water, electrical energy infrastructure, and the like. Colón is a city with a long history that has long been forgotten by previous administrations. The city has lost its attractiveness, but we want to transform it into a destination for both national and foreign tourists. For example, we will improve road infrastructure networks in and out of the city. This city has potential and we want to modernize it and take action, as there are areas in the city that face a dire need for improvement.
</p><h4>What other areas of the country are included in the Ministry's top priorities for the next few years?</h4><p>
	The government's “Roof of Hope" program initiated action with the expectation of helping 5,000 families gain access to housing every year. The program also works on securing drinking water and other basic services, and reducing the housing deficit by targeting the most vulnerable communities of the country. By December 2014, as many as 3,600 families had benefited from this program. This was only few months after setting up the project. We also developed programs to secure the reintegration of former gang leaders and members into society. Overall, our top priority areas are those for high risk and vulnerable communities.
</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2015?</h4><p>
	Among our goals are ensuring that the urban reorganization project is tendered and approved, so we can start construction. The Ministry wants to reach 5,000 families in 2015 within the “Roofs of Hope" program, and 10,000 by 2016. We also want to continue the tendering process for the construction of 12,000 housing units nationwide.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the key developments of the past year that have increased the attractiveness of Dubai as an investment destination?</h4><p>Dubai launched a number of initiatives in 2014 as part of its continuing campaign to enhance the attractiveness of the Emirate as a competitive hub and destination in which people from all over the world could live and do business. While many of these initiatives formed part of an ongoing infrastructure expansion, many others were aimed at integrating progressive and sustainable policies in line with international best practices and the country's general emphasis on innovation. From an FDI perspective, there were four particular initiatives that stood out. The first was the launch of a new innovation program by TECOM, with an overall investment of $1.23 billion. The fund is planned to support the Dubai Internet City and the newly-launched Dubai Design District (D3). Dubai Internet City's innovation hub will provide 1.6 million sqf of dedicated space to around 15,000 creative workers, while the Dubai Design District will provide an inspiring and dynamic destination of over 1 million sqf for emerging designers and artists, thereby attracting designers and entrepreneurs to set up in Dubai as a gateway to the region. Second, the launch of the MENA's first Google for Entrepreneurs Tech Hub at AstroLabs Dubai, is intended welcome tech entrepreneurs from across the globe seeking to access high-growth emerging markets. The hub is meant to boost innovation and entrepreneurship in Dubai in the IT sector. Third, the Smart City initiative, aimed at transforming Dubai into one of the smartest cities in the world, one in which end-users will have access to innovative services. The initiative will allow 24/7 access to government services remotely, which in turn will improve ease of doing business in the city. Fourth, the Dubai 2021 plan, with focus on the human aspect of Dubai's growth. The plan will help position the Emirate as a preferred investment destination with a substantial human capital capable of leading Dubai into the future. In addition to these new initiatives, significant milestones have been achieved toward improving cooperation between the public and private sectors, in order to enhance Dubai's appeal as a business hub. The doubling of the capacity of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park to 200 MW, combined with the commissioning of the Dubai Tram project, were milestones in Dubai's ongoing efforts to improve energy security and infrastructure. The year has also allowed the real estate sector to stabilize after improved regulations addressed investor concerns and financial markets bounced back, indicating maturity and an improved confidence in Dubai's business environment.</p><h4>How do you expect the establishment of the Al Etihad Credit Bureau to impact investment within Dubai?</h4><p>Collecting credit data about individuals and companies is vital for improving transparency, as well as helping lending institutions make informed decisions and encouraging them to finance bigger projects and individuals. This will result in further stimulation to the economy. The credit bureau will also allow the monitoring and regulation of lending practices, which will help organize and add stability to the financial sector.</p><h4>It was recently announced that Dubai is to build a $1 billion financial zone in the heart of downtown. What does this say about the Emirate's commitment to providing the facilities and infrastructure necessary to become a leading global financial hub?</h4><p>The joint venture between Dubai's sovereign wealth fund (the Investment Corporation of Dubai), and the Canadian Asset manager Brookfield is a vote of confidence in the stability of the sector, and anticipates future financial growth. The new development will provide world-class operating space for multinational companies that want to capitalize on the anticipated growth prospects associated with Expo 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Netherlands strengthening its trade relationship with the UAE?</h4><p>One could say that we want to strengthen our relationship with the more traditionally important sectors of the economy; however,  we are also interested in the strategy of the Emirates to diversify its economy and to look for innovation. What I find interesting is that the authorities look for innovation within the traditional oil and gas sector, but they are also looking to invest in renewable energy. Investing in renewables is about investing in the hardware and technology, yet also in investing in changing the mindset of the people. When you are as resource rich as the Emirates, the first challenge is to acknowledge that you need diversification in order to keep up a strong economy for the longer term, which Dubai did.</p><h4>How would you describe the opportunity for further collaboration between the Netherlands and the UAE in the agriculture sector?</h4><p>We are the second largest exporter of agricultural goods on a global scale. Of course, we have strong ties to the Emirates in that sector, but there are still many opportunities in the areas of fresh fruits, for example, and other places where we have not really explored the market enough to take all the opportunities. Here is a well-developed market with a strong demand for quality products and also the logistics are well organized, which makes an excellent market for our fresh fruits and vegetables.</p><h4>Is the UAE important as a place to offset the effects of the EU sanctions on Russia concerning agricultural products?</h4><p>Yes. Regardless of the sanctions, we are always looking for new markets and opportunities for deepening our relationships with international markets. Our agricultural market has felt some impact, albeit minimal, from the sanctions. The agricultural sector has managed to look for new markets, meaning all in all the numbers game is still good. Obviously, the UAE represents a good opportunity for us for future collaboration. In October 2015, there will be a trade mission with agricultural companies coming here, and I believe that would be a good moment for Dutch companies to look into more specific opportunities here as well as to team up with businesses already present here.</p><h4>What opportunities exist for collaboration with the UAE in the distribution and development of international humanitarian aid?</h4><p>It is right to say that the UAE is one of the key players on the humanitarian development front. Actually, in 2014, it ranked first in the world, which is a wonderful achievement and I am glad that it is interested to work with us and continue its successes along the lines of trilateral cooperation. I believe the days of the concept of a donor-recipient paradigm are more or less over. We want to look at how we can work together using a new model. For the Emirates and us to work in a third country would be interesting; for example, we could work together in Africa, Asia, or even the Pacific. Equally important to trilateral cooperation is knowledge exchange. A new kid on the block always sees new things that you don't see. And so, we invited the UAE to give its perspective on how The Netherlands is doing and I think that's the way we should proceed. The humanitarian efforts that it is making in the region are also appreciated and we work with them through the UN channel, which is best positioned to coordinate humanitarian operations. It is good to know what the others are doing, looking at the gaps, and not doubling efforts. We want to continue to work with the UAE, the UN, and other key donors to achieve our humanitarian aid objectives.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the philosophy behind Expo 2020's motto of “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future?"</h4><p><span></span>This represents the essence of the World Expo, of our generation, and of our nation's aspirations—the powerful spirit of partnership and collaboration that has been the driver of UAE's success in paving new paths for development and innovation. The theme carries a special meaning for Dubai, a historical hub of connectivity for the region and globally. Originally known as Al Wasl, Arabic for “the connection" or “intersection point," Dubai has evolved from a regional trading center into a diverse and progressive economic, social, and environmental leader regionally and globally. We are living in an age where long-term solutions to global problems must be resolved by global sharing. The 21st-century trends and transformations, such as population growth, urbanization, and new technologies are converging. These can be the source of major concerns, but also of exceptional future opportunities. Our greatest responsibility in the coming decade is to develop partnerships that can inspire us to shape a better future.</p><h4>What are the main features that Expo 2020 will introduce compared with previous Expos?</h4><p><span></span>Every World Expo has unique offerings, and through their theme and subthemes introduce and address timely and relevant global challenges. The Expo 2020 Dubai, the first World Fair in the Middle East, Northern Africa, and Southern Asia, will offer a theme that centers on developing partnerships that can inspire our global insight and ability to shape a better future. Our three subthemes: opportunity, mobility, and sustainability, are our interconnected drivers of progress that can provide the prism through which we can examine, connect, and address the changes we are experiencing today but haven't addressed collectively in previous World Expos. In addition, Expo 2020 is expected to attract 25 million unique visits, 70% of which will be international visits—the first time in World Expo history that international visitors will exceed domestic visitors. Likewise, Expo 2020, which will be open from October 2020 to April 2021, is the first Expo to operate during this seasonal period and will be the first Expo to offer one pavilion per country, encouraging and financially supporting the inclusion of eligible developing and low-income nations to foster inclusive, high-quality participation from around the world.</p><h4>What will be the impact of Expo 2020 on FDI and trade?</h4><p><span></span>Expo 2020 Dubai will provide an environment for global entrepreneurs to explore progressive and realistic ideas and build smart and sustainable relationships. The Expo 2020 Dubai theme “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future" represents the very essence of the World Expo. It is a deep commitment to encourage collaboration, partnerships, and innovative paths to address our local, regional, and global challenges—economic, social, and environmental. As the first World Expo in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia region, the Expo theme is both timely and opportune, as we are living in an age where long-term solutions to problems can only be resolved through collective problem solving. For the international business community, which is becoming more connected and interdependent, Expo 2020 Dubai is an opportunity to form partnerships that are key to building emerging markets and communities, and ensuring future generations have the tools to learn and grow.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that the government face in the medium term?</h4><p><span></span>The infrastructural and operational investment required by a nation to host large-scale international events are often offset by their ability to generate widespread and lasting economic value for the local resident community. To this end, Dubai Expo 2020 is focused on achieving a similar objective with net value outweighing the costs incurred in delivering the event, and ultimately creating long-term benefits as part of a well-planned economic legacy. We are working to ensure that the investments made by Dubai and every participant, as well as the revenue from international visitors, will directly contribute to the UAE economy. We are confident this will have a positive effect on the adjacent industries that are linked to the delivery of goods and services needed to meet the rise in demand. We expect that, with the growth across various sectors, there should be a natural spike in jobs created within the local economy, increasing the income levels of the people, and encouraging higher domestic consumption.</p><h4>What strengths should Dubai demonstrate during Expo 2020?</h4><p><span></span>Dubai's strength lies in our ability to attract 25 million unique visitors, of which 70% are international, to our city for Expo 2020. These visitors will experience the diversity of our tourism options, the 200 nationalities living and working in Dubai, and understand why Dubai is ranked amongst the world's top ten cities for international visitors. We want to showcase our world-class travel facilities, how our infrastructure is built for connectivity, and how the UAE has leveraged our hotel, hospitality, and airline assets, together with our presence in the worlds of sport, leisure, and tourism, to make Dubai a world-class destination for global travelers—both business and leisure. We want visitors and residents to witness a productive mega-event like Expo 2020 and leave knowing that Dubai is a hub for leaders, thinkers, international events, trade shows, art, culture, and leisure, and that the people and the business community of Dubai represent the world's best in class.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The UAE has shown dynamism in modernizing its government while preserving rich traditions. I also applaud the Emirati government for helping to advance progress on climate change and renewable energy. We are in a time of international turmoil. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to take a terrible toll on individuals while undermining prospects for long-term peace and stability. The Arab world faces many other security threats, from instability in Libya and Yemen to the threat of Da'esh in Syria and Iraq. We have all been appalled by the recent upsurge in terrorism and violent extremism. I have repeatedly condemned the repugnant and cowardly behavior of those committing atrocious acts against innocent civilians.</p><p><span></span>The challenges facing governments are not only on the emergency front. People around the world are calling as never before for greater transparency, accountability, and democracy. Those that answer these calls will be strong. Leaders who place themselves above the law and their people put their own governments at risk of collapse. Corrupt, abusive, and exclusive public institutions breed hopelessness that leads to unrest and instability. True stability demands trusted institutions that deliver for people equally. Efficiency in government is more than a matter of smooth functioning—it demands public institutions that truly serve the common good.</p><p><span></span>I commend HH Sheikh Al Maktoum and the Cabinet for declaring 2015 as the Year of Innovation. For the UN and the world, this is a year to take transformative steps toward a more sustainable, equitable, and peaceful world. We are the first generation that can end poverty and maybe the last that can avert the worst impacts of climate change. People need effective governments to achieve our ambitious plans for a more sustainable future.</p><p><span></span>There are three important events this year: the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in July; the Special Summit on Sustainable Development in New York in September; and the Climate Change Conference in Paris in December. The success of these plans will depend on accountable and transparent governments that engage people in decisions affecting them. Civil society groups often stand for issues that communities care about most; human rights, basic services, and justice. I am proud to have intensified the UN's cooperation with these groups and I count on governments to give them a meaningful say in national policy making. States should also involve more citizens in co-designing solutions to development challenges. IT can allow people to help set priorities.</p><p><span></span>The UN harnessed this power through our MyWorld global survey on peoples' concerns. More than 7 million individuals have responded by stating their aspirations and hopes for a better future. When governments open their books to the public, they earn trust. And that is critical to building stronger communities and states. Businesses also have great influence. The private sector can serve the public interest with creativity and innovation. States should reward corporations that are socially responsible.</p><p><span></span>The UN Global Compact is helping governments understand that sustainable investments generate public benefits. I have seen successful government activities around the world; from e-governance in northern Europe to youth mobilizations in southern Africa. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, but there are universal principles that should guide every country. To establish accountability, we need the rule of law and equal access to justice for all people. All societies must actively fight corruption and bribery. People respect governments that punish dishonest officials for their crimes. IT can drive progress, but only when there is an open and free environment that encourages civic engagement and constructive criticism. Improving government is not just a matter of efficiency, it is essential to equity, justice, and stability. I welcome initiatives to cut red tape, lower costs, and fight fraud. We are doing this at the UN. Since my first day in office as Secretary General of the United Nations, I have insisted on transparency and accountability. We are creating a more modern, dynamic, and responsive UN that earns even greater public trust. I am the first Secretary General to publically disclose my financial assets, and I have asked all senior officials across the UN to be just as open.</p>]]></richbody0content>

How do you assess bilateral relations between Ghana and the Emirate of Dubai?</h4><p>We have an excellent relationship with the UAE, especially with Dubai, and we have a Consul General in the Emirate. We have had a diplomatic presence there for the last five years. In addition, we have seen a considerable amount of business between Ghana and Dubai already, and Emirates is one of the most popular airlines that crosses the skies from Accra to not only Dubai, but the whole Far East, as well as other parts in the Middle East and Asia. There are also a large number of Ghanaian businesses that have opened representation offices in Dubai and vice versa. The Dubai Chamber is going to open an office in Accra, which is something positive that will take this relationship forward in a faster manner. I would say things are going well, and I hope that our relationship continues to develop.</p><h4>Which specific sectors have the most potential for growth between the two countries?</h4><p>The sectors where we see growth have always been in the areas of trading, financial services, and infrastructure development.</p><h4>What are the strengths that Dubai holds for Ghanaian investors?</h4><p>The strengths of Dubai for our investment community are numerous. Dubai has always been seen as a hub. It is a in convenient location between the East and Ghana, because a number of the businesses that have been established in Dubai also do business with the Far East and Asia. However, they have their offices located in Dubai because it offers easy access in terms of connectivity in moving from one location to the other. This has considerably helped business between Dubai, Ghana, and wherever else in Asia and the Middle East that our companies have operations. </p><h4>What are your expectations for Ghana regarding the Expo 2020?</h4><p>I am sure we will have a fantastic display, and I believe people will find our stand beautiful. Yet, more importantly I hope it creates the right kind of connectivity and helps to strengthen the relationship between Dubai and Ghana. I hope that it especially appeals to businesses and people working out of Dubai and Ghana.</p><h4>What are the conclusions you draw from the Africa Global Business Forum hosted in Dubai in October 2013?</h4><p>I believe it was a great forum, and extremely helpful. I also came last year to a similar forum, and this time it was smaller. This makes the forum more effective, and I expect that the people attending will be able to build relationships that will make them want to come here, as well as encourage the business community from Dubai to continue to interact with Ghana.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the bilateral relationship between Iraq and the UAE?</h4><p>The relationship between Iraq and the UAE extends to the first days of Declaration of the Independence and Union of the UAE in 1971, as this announcement forms the emergence of a young state under the name of the “United Arab Emirates" and under the banner of the late HH Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. Since then, this bilateral relationship has formed into a comfortable and positive development for the Iraqi people. Iraqis look at the Emiratis as brothers and stand alongside them on issues, conflicts, and problems that have been raised about their national sovereignty over some UAE islands. These fraternal efforts represent a good omen for both the Iraqi and the UAE peoples. In addition, our Emirati brothers were always first to support the Iraqi people in a lot of problems and tribulations we faced. I would also like to emphasize that despite some politically motivated recklessness that has tried to disturb the relationship between the two countries; these external actors cannot diminish the relationship between our two countries. All in all, the UAE and Iraq is a fraternal relationship based on mutual respect and historical linkages that encourages us to classify this relationship as first class.</p><h4>What are the key areas of opportunity to further strengthen this relationship?</h4><p>There is no doubt that the economic aspect of trade and investment could be considered as the first opportunity to stimulate, promote, and develop this relationship. We recognize the importance in solidifying a positive and mutually beneficial relationship between the two countries as they both represent economic importance to the region as a whole. In addition to this, Iraq possesses not only substantial material wealth; however, a tremendous amount of human capital. Our two governments concluded many decades ago that the reconstruction of Iraq begins in the fields of housing and infrastructure. There are other opportunities, which complement the exchange of scientific and cultural experiences and areas of sport and tourism, art and so on.</p><h4>How do you see the UAE playing a role in the security of the region?</h4><p>Actually, the UAE has attained good cumulative expertise in security fields, which helps to open other prospects through which it can perform its duties at the regional level. Similarly, the UAE also plays a role in the diplomatic framework regarding the security of this region due to the considerable amount of tension and presence of different threats. On an international level, the UAE is an active participant in the international coalition against terrorism and extremism. These factors have enabled the UAE to play an important security role for deployment of stability and limit the threat of terrorism and extremism.</p><h4>What role does a unified Iraq play in developing long-term and lasting peace in the Middle East?</h4><p>There is no doubt that a unified and safe Iraq reflects a positive impact on the region as a whole. Conversely, there are risks that threaten the entire region as a result of the situation happening in Iraq recently. We are confident that today Iraq is fighting terrorism on behalf of the nation and for all humanity. In light of this, it is necessary to unite the Arab and international efforts to provide an appropriate support for Iraq to flush out this terrorism. By supporting Iraq's security and military institutions as well as strengthening the bonds of brotherhood among its people, Iraq will be able to establish its vital role and come back as a positive and basic player in the security of the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>CyberSecurity Malaysia was established as an agency under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI). What is the importance of cyber security in today's digital age, and what role can the cyber security industry play in Malaysia's development?</h4><p><span></span>The role of CyberSecurity Malaysia is to provide specialized services to ensure the security and safety of Malaysia's cyber space. It is part of our contribution toward supporting Malaysia in becoming a digital and high-income nation driven by a digital economy. Our focus, as reflected in the National Cyber Security Policy (NCSP), is on the protection of the Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII), which governments, businesses, and citizens are highly reliant on. CNII enables the nation to function and acquire critical services. In today's global and highly competitive market place, any disruptions to the CNII, including data loss, damage, cyber attacks, and other cyber crimes, can cause anxiety and significantly impact Malaysia's economic competitiveness. Perpetrators can access information systems, or use other electronic means to launch cyber attacks against critical information infrastructure, such as financial, energy, transportation, and government operations. The online banking system and electrical distribution grid can be crippled by shutting down the control systems. Cyber attacks can sabotage airport traffic control systems and government operations can be disrupted by an attack on the national network services. This underscores the strategic role of CyberSecurity Malaysia in driving the economy to further growth by ensuring infrastructure and digital assets are safeguarded against cyber security threats.</p><h4>What are some of MOSTI's initiatives to promote the development of biotechnology?</h4><p>MOSTI has introduced a cluster concept to implement the National Biotechnology Policy, an initiative coordinated by the National Biotechnology Division (BIOTEK). Each cluster member provides services and facilities to support programs under the National Biotechnology Policy. These clusters provide services and facilities encompassing technology, incentives, support, awareness, talent pool, scientific discoveries, translational research, and access to industry and the capital markets. MOSTI also launched the Commercialization Year initiative in 2014 to provide the opportunity for entrepreneurs in the technology sector to commercialize their R&amp;D products. The objectives of the Commercialization Year included targeting at least 60 R&amp;D generated products for commercialization every year; providing a comprehensive commercialization platform, and addressing issues such as low product commercialization uptake. MOSTI met its target of commercializing 65 R&amp;D products in 2014. In supporting the development of biotechnology in Malaysia, MOSTI provides funds for related research. </p><h4>What is being done to develop and retain talent in science, technology, and innovation (STI)?</h4><p>MOSTI has always recognized the importance of human capital development to achieve not only its organizational goal, but also more importantly its contribution to the national vision. At MOSTI, we have a dedicated program called the Human Capital Development for Science, Technology &amp; Innovation (HCD STI Programme), which provides training grants to enhance competency and develop the technical expertise of our STI talent. MOSTI is the only ministry allocated with this special fund for specialized training in technical areas on top of the normal budget for generic training. This fund enables MOSTI's employees, especially those in technical service to pursue specific training within the scope of their work. Modes of implementation vary from sending people to attend certified courses to training at highly reputable research institutes, both local and overseas. We also bring in world-renowned experts to conduct customized training at respective agencies. Often, these training courses also result in a strong network between MOSTI and its agencies with international R&amp;D institutions and regulatory bodies, leading to research collaboration, as well as knowledge and technology transfer. Through this HCD STI Programme, MOSTI has been able to nurture and enhance high-performing local experts, retain them, and simultaneously gain advanced knowledge from global experts.</p><h4>What is being done to boost interest in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and how soon do you think the desired 60:40 ratio for STEM-to-non-STEM ratio will be achieved?</h4><p>In 2010, the ratio was 25:75, and has increased to the current 42-58 STEM-to-non-STEM ratio. This shows that collective moves by the government have thus far registered change; however, much work has to be done to achieve the desired target ratio of 60:40. The supply of human resources has never been inclined toward science and technology, despite the policy introduced by the Higher Education Planning Committee in 1967. Out of a 15 million total workforce to be achieved in 2020, about 1 million (or 6%) belongs to the S&amp;T domain and half of that at 500,000 is expected to represent the skilled worker group. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this is the quantity of human resources in STI with tertiary education, from which a portion may be involved in R&amp;D and pursuing PhD studies. Through MyBrain15, 60,000 PhDs are expected to be generated by this cohort by 2023. In encouraging the full utilization of MyBrain15, the age limit of MyBrain15 sponsorship has been lifted since 2012. Lukewarm interest in science among young people is largely blamed on the school system, the curriculum for teaching science, a seemingly unattractive career path, or a lack of monetary incentives. The Ministry noted that it is important to foster interest among young people, and, thus, fun and engaging activities such as the National Science Challenge are organized by the Academy of Sciences Malaysia (ASM), an agency under the MOSTI umbrella that is also one of the strategies behind ensuring that students appreciate the need for science and technology. Such efforts in strategic cooperation with the Ministry of Education and ExxonMobil are expected to enable more students to choose STEM-related subjects in university and eventually contribute to the desired target of a 60:40 STEM-to-non-STEM ratio.</p><h4>What role will STI play in advancing Malaysia's human capital and socio-economic development?</h4><p>In order to meet global and local STI challenges, Malaysians must be equipped with STEM knowledge to meet the increasing demand for engineers, healthcare workers, scientists, computer programmers, actuaries, and other related professions. The government has also shifted its focus to emerging technologies, such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, and advanced manufacturing, as well as expanding existing STI based sectors such as oil and gas, energy, palm oil, agriculture, ICT, and electrical and electronic engineering as per the country's New Key Economic Areas (NKEAs). The Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) in Malaysia, which has identified 12 National Key Economic Areas (NKEAs), is covering two such areas related to the technology and innovation sector, namely electronic and electrical engineering, as well as communications, content, and infrastructure. The electronic and electrical sector is one of the crucial areas of development, with Malaysia enjoying traditional strength in electronics manufacturing, as recognized by major multinational companies. The sector accounts for $10.3 billion, or 6% of GNI and $70 billion, or 40%, of total exports. It also provides approximately 522,000 jobs for skilled and semi-skilled workers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The LVG is a diversified real estate broker involved in many different activities. What is the history of the company?</h4><p>LVG was registered in 2004. This June will mark the 11th anniversary of our operation as a professional realty company. The company was started from my live-in office on the mainland, and within the first three months of my practice LVG had generated a turnover of roughly $50,000 thanks to a few excellent clients. My modest room then became a full-time office.</p><h4>Facilities management is a line of LVG that has become lucrative. How do you leverage this in Nigeria?</h4><p>LVG oversees the cleaning of our properties using our own cleaning company called Tommy Clean Enterprise. We are property managers, and our buildings have character and look attractive to appeal to the public. When one tenant moves out, another should be able to come in with no complaints. That is where Maintenance Plus comes in; it is the Facilities Management arm of the group. Maintenance Plus is the second highest earning subsidiary of the group today and is now running independently under its own professional management. We are also in the process of starting a security company, because all luxury properties in Nigeria have security, and we provide total service and protection to our customers. We currently have over 120 guards, but will have employed additional staff by the time we launch new properties. LVG wants to be the company that people associate first with property in Nigeria.</p><h4>There have been huge developments in the luxury property market over the past five years. What are some of the notable growth trends to have occurred since 2010? </h4><p>The trend has been quite phenomenal. Luxury property especially bloomed in Lagos between 2005 and 2008. The main oil producers in the south, including Port Harcourt and Warri, and most of the international oil companies, are concentrated in this region. When foreign nationals began moving to Lagos, they required quality accommodation. The few places available, while developed by visionary developers, were insufficeint. People quickly saw the gap. Tenants were leasing property for as much as $130,000 per annum, or more than $10,000 per month. This is a good income anywhere in the world, and people began to see the importance of the luxury property world. LVG used a reputable architect who has contributed to the real estate market, specifically in Lagos. In Abuja, the capital city, most of the wealthier people conduct business with the government and need good offices, so people have begun to build good properties there as well. The real estate market is also affected by infrastructure. When there are well-maintained roads, quality amenities, and beautiful golf clubs, people begin to see the need for better homes. The market has improved tremendously over the past five years, and it can only get better.</p><p class="quote">"I have not seen a better country to invest in than Nigeria."</p><h4>What do you see in terms of demand for real estate in Nigeria from international investors?</h4><p>From my personal experience in real estate returns on investment, I have not seen a better country to invest in than Nigeria. Some of our clients look for properties in Dubai, South Africa, and London, despite the fact that economic stablity is lacking. This is not to devalue real estate in Dubai, but we are speaking frankly: the real estate in Nigeria provides far stronger returns, as high as 15%. We have companies investing regularly, especially the promoters of Eko Atlantic,  Eko Pearl, YF, UPDC, and so on. We routinely give developers in advanced economies a run for their money.</p><h4>What are your expectations through 2015 and 2016?</h4><p>The future of LVG in 2015 is looking bright. As long as we remain professional with our integrity intact, and as long as we invest in the right people, we are confident. Real estate in Nigeria, especially Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt is looking as good, if not better, than most other countries in the world. We are proud to be working in this industry, and I am doing what I do passionately—selling properties to people, leasing properties, and networking.</p>]]></richbody0content>

One will work at the national level given the importance of the market, and the other on the international front. This is in order to centralize our operations to meet the coming challenges in an unstable regional environment. Furthermore, the restructuring includes the appointment of a corporate secretary who will ensure that corporate governance is being implemented now that we have the financial systems in place. As a result of our adoption of corporate governance that we did in consultation with IFC, we have established committees that also include external stakeholders and advisors. We will also be recruiting a CFO in the near future. To ensure that succession planning is set in place, we have a created a family office, headed by an external party, to be ready for the fourth generation. Moreover, we believe that restructuring in such a way sends a positive message to all our stakeholders that will guarantee that Malia Group continues to grow and expand. Furthermore, the restructuring includes a new strategy based on full transparency, and we are planning for an IPO in the near future depending on regional and international factors. It was postponed from 2016 due to the security and the political situation in the region and will be dependent on the situation in the region.</p><h4>Looking forward to Malia Group's regional and international midterm future, from where do you anticipate the core revenue streams originating?</h4><p>We believe in investing during times of uncertainty, and that opportunities present themselves as uncertainty peaks. We act as pioneers in different markets and are present where others do not yet have the vision to be. But it's important to properly assess the risks and react to uncertainty in a well-studied manner and with a long-term strategy. The Middle East is undergoing a period of acute turmoil, particularly in the geostrategic areas between the Levant and Iran and in territories in North Africa. There is a near collapse of the old world order and the weakening of the central government in favor of factional rule. This is very similar to what happened in Lebanon. I mention this because, at Malia Group, we have established a system that can actually thrive during times of crisis as we did in the 1970s and onwards. Moreover, we have also continued to invest in Iraq, despite the security and currency challenges faced by the country. This is because we believe that we should smartly invest where there are real and present opportunities. We have recently invested in our pharmaceutical manufacturing business for a presence in Saudi Arabia, and we continue to expand our ICT operations in the GCC and North Africa and have other plans in the pipeline. </p><h4>What are your main focus and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have a three-year plan that essentially includes investment in Lebanon in our pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, Pharmaline, whereby we will be working on the third extension of the plant. And, we're working in technology through MaliaTec, which has become one of the leading mobility, automation, and solutions providers. With MaliaTec, we will continue to expand in terms of brands and products, as well as by territory. Since we are partners and representatives of Honeywell, one of the largest technology suppliers of mobile solutions, we are now expanding our cooperation in different markets. And now we are looking to do the same in certain African markets. MaliaTec is based in Beirut, but has branches in Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, and Algeria. Also, on the regional level, which for us is the Gulf market, we are developing Pharmaline Saudi Arabia. We have already signed the agreement for a long-term 20-year lease in King Abdullah City. We believe that it will be operational in 18-24 months. In parallel, Pharmaline's R&amp;D Department is developing a lot of products specifically for the Gulf market. As for Iraq, we have three exciting new projects under construction, including a new long-stay hotel under the Arjaan by Rotana brand in Erbil, and Magma Square, a Courtyard in Suleimania that includes restaurants, movie theatres, and shops, and a logistics company in Erbil. Our aim is to renew the growth of investment over the coming years. We are ever keen to invest, despite regional uncertainty. We need to reengineer our means of doing business to enjoy greater security for the future, while sustaining growth.</p><h4>Malia Group has been involved in the industrial production of personal care for 60 years. What challenges and respective opportunities have you encountered while building an enterprise in the Lebanese market?</h4><p>In the beginning, we focused on personal care in health and beauty but now we are in many other sectors as well. In the personal care business, the challenge today is to develop new formulations and new products, and to perform in a way that the market can absorb them. Over the coming weeks, we will launch a new hair dye for the younger generation, which has an easy-to-use concept. We also continuously reformulate our shampoo formulas and styling gels according to generational trends. This is what basically makes us successful both locally and regionally. Now we are moving outside the region. We are looking to export Cosmaline, our in-house personal care brand, in Africa. Angola is one of our targets and the second target is Nigeria. Africa has a specific trend different from those in the Levant and the Gulf. For instance, in the Gulf there is no high demand for hairspray or styling gel. The highest demand is for shampoos, skin creams, and hand creams. We have to focus on an African range of products. In order to do so, our R&amp;D department works to create new formulas that cater to a diverse clientele across numerous markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Smooth Affair]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-smooth-affair]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the importance for Ecuador's economy of the trade agreement with the EU?</h4><p>Negotiating the agreement became a smooth affair once a common consensus had been reached; yet there are always processes that require implementation to fully appraise the final form. The EU, in 2015, extended commercial preferences for Ecuador to access the EU market. This was highly significant and we believe that the advantages of such an agreement benefit both Ecuadorian and EU companies. Europe is a substantial market and we see the agreement as the stability and long-term vision that Ecuador's productive sector requires in order to grow and develop closer ties with the EU. This agreement also helps in the government's efforts toward the diversification of the economy and markets of operation, thereby helping Ecuadorian companies to broaden their horizons and further expand their internationalization. Europe has traditionally been our main export market for non-oil products; however, we perceive broader opportunities to capitalize on going forward.</p><h4>How does this agreement fit into the objectives of the Ministry to generate an inclusive development model?</h4><p>Europe is a highly important market for fair trade and organic products, a niche in which Ecuador already plays an important role, but has much more yet to offer. At the same time, I believe that Europe can provide an answer to the intangible value of our products.</p><h4>In your opinion, what is the impact of the government's decision to implement a safeguard tariff on imports of 2,800 products for a period of 15 months to protect the balance of payments?</h4><p>This measure has the objective to influence in the kinds of products Ecuador imports. This technical action was developed in accordance with the framework provided by the World Trade Organization (WTO), whom we expect to fully validate it shortly. This is a temporary decision aimed at taking action in a context in which Ecuador has the inability to make a correction of the value of its national currency. We, in this case, need to take similar action to that of devaluing ones own currency, for example. I think this measure has a rather low impact on the productive apparatus of the country and the main raw materials we import.</p><h4>What actions does the Ministry take to boost exports?</h4><p>Non-traditional exports have positively increased over the past seven years at an average annual rate of 14%. This has resulted from several incentives and efforts from public authorities that include wider financial tools, tax incentives, and export support, among others. Our efforts have run in parallel to those of Pro Ecuador and its extensive network of offices across the world.</p><h4>Commerce, at $48 million, was the economic sector in which investment flow expanded the most in 2014. How does the Ministry work to further increase investment flow in Ecuador?</h4><p>Traditionally, Ecuador has not been a destination for FDI. However, we have increased the benefits available and attractiveness of the country through tax and other incentives. We have also worked to increase the competitiveness of Ecuador's economy by such measures as eliminating bureaucratic barriers in order to establish companies and setting preferential credit lines. All of these actions fit within the country's legal framework. Overall, we are interested in foreign investment both in quantitative and qualitative terms. </p><h4>What are the main objectives the Ministry has lined up in terms of trade and other such agreements for 2015?</h4><p>1H2015 threw highly interesting figures into the mix; we are one of the very few regional countries in which non-oil exports have not decreased. This is vital when taking into account the complex international situation. In 2015, we will strengthen efforts and actions to diversify products, services, and markets. We will also ramp up our efforts to better articulate commercial and public policies. And meanwhile, we expect to maintain the level of exports observed in 2014, which would be a significant achievement. Overall, I think that the economic situation of Ecuador has yet to further improve; currency savings will increase as we decrease oil derivative imports, for example, to generate electrical energy. I think exports of non-oil products will considerably increase in the near future thanks to commercial agreements as well as the revocation of other types of barriers at the local level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does PIC play in Kuwait's oil industry and overall economy?</h4><p>We are the petrochemical industry arm of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), one of eight subsidiary companies of the corporation. The subsidiary companies operate both in upstream exploration and the production of oil and gas, as well as further downstream petrochemical refinement all the way to direct sales of gasoline to consumers. PIC makes significant contributions to Kuwait's economy, through our own operations and through the operations of our nine joint ventures. Currently, 70% of the petrochemical products in the PIC portfolio are produced in Kuwait. The main chemical products include fertilizers, olefins, and aromatics. As one of the KPC's downstream subsidiaries, we use feedstock such as ethane and naphtha to make olefins and aromatics. These petrochemical products are used even further downstream in markets as diverse as agriculture, textiles, plastics, paints, cosmetics, transportation, and many other areas. Including our joint ventures, we have operations in five countries, and we are looking to expand to India, China, and the US. These joint ventures are key to our growth strategy, enabling us to diversify our product offers and leading to expansion into global markets. PIC now has a marketing presence in nearly every region of the world. Take EQUATE as an example of the scale and reach of our joint ventures. EQUATE is a joint venture with PIC, The Dow Chemical Company, Boubyan Petrochemical Company, and Qurain Petrochemical Industries Company. Its world-scale manufacturing facility produces almost 5 million tons of petrochemicals such as polyethylene, ethylene, and ethylene glycol per year, which are sold throughout the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Europe.</p><h4>Where are the key markets for your products around the world?</h4><p>Asia is our biggest market, and demand for our products is at its highest in India and China. We export urea fertilizer to North America and South America. Demand is also increasing in Europe, especially in Turkey. We also have sales operations in North Africa, Egypt, and Morocco.</p><h4>What are your major projects currently under development?</h4><p>The major projects on the horizon for PIC in Kuwait are Olefins III and Aromatics II, which will be integrated with the Al-Zour refinery. We are currently at the pre-feasibility stage of this project. Internationally, PIC is exploring projects in India, the US, China, South Korea, and Bahrain.</p><h4>What is the outlook for the long-term demand of petrochemical products?</h4><p>Over the coming decades, petrochemicals will continue to play a significant role in meeting the demand for consumer products among a growing middle class. The majority of this demand growth will be in the developing world, and our location in the Middle East positions us well to serve fast-growing markets in Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe. More and more, we also are seeing petrochemicals play a vital role in achieving sustainability goals. For instance, plastics are being used to replace components in cars traditionally made from steel. Plastics make cars lighter, and lighter cars tend to require less fuel. PIC is on a journey to become a global player in petrochemicals. We will continue to invest in petrochemical growth, as we also continue to seek ways to make our operations more environmentally sound.</p><h4>Are you investing in R&amp;D?</h4><p>PIC primarily engages in R&amp;D through its joint ventures. When developing a new business or plant, we favor JVswith companies that have considerable R&amp;D experience. It is important to us that, when we enter agreements with companies, we include clauses about possible future collaboration on R&amp;D innovation. We also participate in KPC-sponsored R&amp;D activities. For example, we sit on the KPC Solar Energy committee. We hope to contribute to the Kuwaiti objective to have 15% of domestic energy consumption come from renewable energy.</p><h4>How are you investing in Kuwait? What areas do you see as having high returns for PIC in Kuwait?</h4><p>Part of the mission of KPC and PIC is to add value to Kuwaiti hydrocarbons. For example, gas or naphtha as a feedstock may be worth $800/ton. If we convert that feedstock into petrochemicals, its worth can increase nearly threefold. Our Kuwaiti operations specialize in olefins, aromatics, and fertilizer. As stated earlier, we are investing in two major projects, Olefins III and Aromatics II. Integrating these facilities with the Al-Zour refinery is in a prefeasibility study stage. This is a collaborative effort with KNPC. We anticipate this operation will add approximately 2 million tons a year to our output.</p><h4>What impact will this integrated complex have on the economy once it's finished?</h4><p>The first impact will be on job creation, and not just within our direct pool of employees, but also across the supply chain. KNPC is building a 600,000bbl refinery, which is hugely significant. We want to ensure that we add value to that operation. It's interesting to note that for every job created in the petrochemicals sector, approximately 4.8 additional jobs are created in other sectors of the economy.</p><h4>How does PIC contribute to the community and environment in Kuwait?</h4><p>PIC makes significant contributions to both our communities and to protecting the environment. As environmental, social, and economic challenges in our world grow, the definition of business performance is expanding. At PIC, we understand that financial results are not the sole consideration. A commitment to ensuring the long-term sustainability of our company, community, and country is also essential. From a community perspective, PIC adds employment opportunities in Kuwait. We also sponsor initiatives in collaboration with other businesses and universities in Kuwait to help foster the next generation of leaders. These include scientific research competitions to develop the future engineers to mentoring projects for young entrepreneurs. And certainly, the environment is a priority of ours. In 2013, PIC launched the 2017 PIC Sustainability Goals. Among these ambitious five-year goals are objectives to reduce energy and water use, and greenhouse gas emissions, which can contribute to climate change. We have also been working to increase environmental awareness amongst the public. Our largest community initiative is the Kuwait Green Wall. This project was founded by PIC, Kuwait Energy, and the Environmental Voluntary Foundation, whose organization, Kuwait Oasis, manages the project. Additional partners who have joined the project include Kuwait Environment Protection Authority, the Kuwait Ministry of Interior, Nathan's Famous, and VIVA Telecom. Over a 10-year period, the project will plant 315,000 trees along 420m of the Kuwaiti border. PIC arranges day trips twice a year for PIC employees and students to plant the trees. It has been popular with the students, who feel they are making a difference. We hope their involvement in the Green Wall will increase their environmental awareness for the future as well as bring environmental benefits to Kuwait such as improved air quality, mitigation of airborne sand, and increased biodiversity in the areas of plantings. Many of PIC's senior leaders, including myself, have helped plant trees. Another environmental project we are involved in is a beach cleanup, again with local NGOs and students.</p><h4>What are your expectations for PIC in 2016?</h4><p>We want to become a major, global player in the petrochemical industry. We will continue to pursue our growth strategy built on strategic partnerships. We also aim to achieve the maximum market share for our products and encourage downstream industrial growth. With KPC, we are planning to develop a value park in Kuwait to encourage the establishment of smaller entrepreneurial factories and small- and medium—sized enterprises (SMEs). We hope our involvement with the value park will encourage small companies to create products such as clothes and plastics used in our daily lives. It is hoped this will add further value to Kuwaiti hydrocarbons.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Pirelli's worldwide revenue has risen by 6.8% compared to 2014. How has the market in Mexico contributed to that increase?</h4><p><span></span>Pirelli México has contributed more than its fair share to that increase. We posted excellent results last year both in terms of the commercial and manufacturing operations, and 2014 exceeded our expectations. We continue to expand our in-country manufacturing capacity and by 2017 we expect to be producing at a rate of 5 to 6 million tires per year in Mexico.</p><h4>What percentage of your production do you export to the US and Canada? </h4><p>The volumes may differ because many cars exported already have our tires on them. About 80% of our production is exported. The math is still the same as last year, if you think of the NAFTA zone in terms of GDP with the US being 80% of the zone, Canada being 10%, and Mexico being 10%, and that is pretty much how our business operates.</p><h4>How are you benefiting from Mexico's rise in automotive manufacturing?</h4><p>We enjoy the advantage of knowing that there are more of our global customers coming. We know that by 2020 Mexico will produce some 2 million more cars than it does today, which means we will need a significantly larger volumes of tires to meet those manufacturers' demands. Mexico has numerous free trade agreements, which makes it convenient to sell cars to a wide range of international markets.</p><h4>Have you signed any agreements with the new automotive manufacturers entering the market, on the strength of your strong relationship with other brands like Audi and Volkswagen?</h4><p>We already supply the Volkswagen group, and we have a strong relationship with Audi worldwide, so it makes sense to continue that relationship here in Mexico. In addition, we already supply BMW, Chrysler, Ford, Lincoln, and Mercedes-Benz from this factory.</p><h4>With the arrival of Goodyear, what are your views on competition and the replacement market?</h4><p>The replacement market will continue modernizing. Today, much of the replacement market in Mexico is still in small rim diameter tires, but that will change as consumer buy new cars that are equipped with more premium tires, which is our strength. The arrival of new tire manufacturing plants in Mexico does not mean new competition because all of these companies were already importing tires for sale here. In fact, Mexico does not manufacture enough tires to meet local demand.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the premium market segment?</h4><p>Growth of the premium market worldwide, and in Mexico in particular, is outpacing the rest of the market, which is positive for us, being our main focus. For us it represents natural growth, and we also like to refer to it as a higher technology market because it is the market where our technological leadership clearly differentiates us from other tire manufacturers, which in turn creates customer loyalty.</p><h4>What innovations have you have brought into the premium market in 2014?</h4><p>Tire development is an evolutionary process, and there are often no visible changes. Tires remain round and black. That being said, the evolution we are seeing today is internal, and it comes in the form of materials and compound formulation. The most difficult part is the process technology. It is relatively easy to develop something in the laboratory, but much harder to take that laboratory experiment and repeat it on an industrial scale. In our case it would involve annual production in excess of 60 million tires. High technology with a quality-control system in place ensures that the tires we produce perform exactly as designed. Our factory in Mexico enjoys numerous benefits that are derived from being the newest facility in the group. We have received the funding to install cutting edge technology. In addition, we have advanced, state-of-the-art laboratories for extensive R&amp;D work.</p><h4>How do you think Mexican SMEs are benefiting from investment in Mexico?</h4><p>Any time a major enterprise enters a market with world-class quality control, technology, and auditing systems, it obliges local companies to meet their standards, which has a positive effect. At Pirelli, we audit our suppliers to make sure they are performing at our high standards, and to make sure they remain socially responsible enterprises. We will not do business with suppliers who do not meet our standards. The added benefit of local suppliers is the shorter the supply line with less logistical risks for the involved materials. If you measure our presence in total, we are within the 30% range of local suppliers and actively seeking more. In fact, it is a main charge I have given to the purchasing team.</p><h4>What opportunities has Formula One brought to Pirelli and the country itself?</h4><p>For the country, it clearly creates the opportunity for Mexico to showcase itself to the rest of the world. For us it will be an opportunity to further differentiate ourselves from competitor tire brands in Mexico, since we will be the only tire brand at the track. And since this will be the first F1 race held here in 23 years, even those who are not major fans will likely watch the race and see our tires in action. We will be supplying all tires to all participating teams. We will have extensive track signage to maximize our visibility; this will all be topped off with a celebrity attendance. We will also be staging certain local promotions typical of a major race. And there will be at least one, if not two, Mexican drivers participating in the race.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Pirelli for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will increase production by more than 50% versus 2014 and will also realize double-digit growth in our commercial business, with market share gains in both the original equipment and replacement markets. In addition, Formula One will clearly have a positive impact on our business, which we will benefit from in the years to come.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the company's background story?</h4><p><span></span>Tzanetatos Inc. is one of the largest distributors of mass consumption products in Panama with two in-house brands and other highly recognized imported brands. For over 50 years, Tzanetatos Inc. has engaged in the distribution of the leading brands from several segments; food, personal care, cosmetics, household, and automotive, meeting consumers' diverse expectations. Over the years we have also diversified our activities to reduce our dependence on any particular market.</p><h4>How does the company support the development of the retail sector in Panama?</h4><p>Our two branches give us nationwide coverage for all product types. We also have a plant that produces cheese, butter, margarine, mayonnaise, mustard, sauces, and other condiments. We have installed state-of-the-art machinery for both production and packaging. Overall, our offering is unique in this country; no one else can offer consumers the same quality and variety. This indicates how much we contribute to the development of the retail sector. At the same time, we serve some of the largest clients in Panama. For example, we provide margarine to Unilever and are the local sector leaders. </p><h4>What is the scale of your distribution network?</h4><p>The company has national coverage, supplying the various distribution channels such as supermarkets (100%), wholesale (95%), pharmacies (95%), and food service (95%). The company has its own fleet of 125 vehicles. </p><h4>How has the company diversified its business activity?</h4><p>Diversification has been a means of growing our business activity and curbing overdependence on any single economic sector. An example of this is, when, a few years ago, we entered the construction sector. We built a seven-hectare shopping mall and three office buildings, two of which are about to be completed, with construction of the third to commence shortly. We also developed a free trade zone (FTZ) that will host investors from diverse fields, and will include an assembly plant. </p><h4>What are some of the most demanded products within your portfolio?</h4><p>We have a wide range of products from several segments such as food, personal care, cosmetics, home, automotive, beverages, and spirits. In the personal care segment, we have body care products, products for babies, medicaments, and others. In short, we are the leading company in the sector. Some of the brands we represent are Disney, Lorenz, Quilmes, Isabel, Barbie, Academie, Hormel Foods, Hot Wheels, McCormick, Revlon, Samsung, and Surex. One of our goals is to provide products at more competitive prices, since supermarkets have strict requirements. We are open to establishing new partnerships with international brands in order to further build our portfolio and/or develop joint projects in sectors such as construction or logistics. Our company is looking to develop a maritime port with another partner, which would put us in a stronger position as a distributor.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2015?</h4><p>We will open two new centers in order to improve our coverage and distribution network, offering products at more competitive prices. We will also develop other types of projects beyond our main business activities. I anticipate the construction sector playing an increasing role in our overall business activity.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the downturn in mineral prices and the slowdown in economic growth in Peru affected the strength of the financial sector?</h4><p>The financial sector remains robust and structurally sound; there is good growth, high liquidity, and ample provisioning and capital. The one place where there is a bit of a hiccup is perhaps debt and we have just a slight weakness in terms of indicators. Because of dynamic provisioning over the years, we have required banks to set aside provisions that they can now use. The quality of lending decisions, and the sophistication of operators, have also risen. Now, in some segments there has been increased competition. For instance, the municipal credit institutions segments are a very important part of our system because they are regional and Peru's development is moving toward decentralization. One major future development is mobile banking. There are 30 million cell phones in Peru. Despite this high level of mobile penetration, only 2% of Peruvian people use mobile phones to do financial transactions. In this sense, a big commercial project called Modelo Peru is underway in order to facilitate low-cost services to the mass market in collaboration with banks, cajas, and other financial service providers. On this platform, everyone will have access to the same mobile banking system, whether Banco Credito, which is a large institution, or the smallest Caja Rural, or the Caja Municipal. This is a level playing field that we are proud of, and we are probably the first country in the world to implement it in this way in order to provide basic financial services to the majority of Peruvians. Five years from now access will have become much improved. It is hard to even imagine how the nature of transactions and probably the pricing in the market will change.<br></p><h4>Going forward, how will you address the lack of competition in the private pension system (AFP) in light of the lack of participation at the previous tender?</h4><p><span></span>We have had seen encouraging participation in the bidding itself. Prices have fallen again, which is how you actually gauge the issue; it doesn't really matter how many participate. In this case, the goal of the reform was fulfilled in every bidding we have had. In the first bidding there was a new entrant in the market, which made a market of five pension managers. Unfortunately, one of the institutions was sold during this period (due to a global corporate decision), but fortunately that did not generate the degree of concentration it could have generated as it was split into two parts. Despite that, there is probably room for a new entrant in the subsequent rounds. Another issue concerns insurance premiums, which are not part of the same bidding process, but are a part of the cost. The competitive nature of the insurance component has gone sky high through their biddings with many companies entering the market, which is a complete success. The one area where we remain unhappy concerns the coverage of workers remaining excluded. Within two or three years there might be another occasion to see if they can be brought in someway.</p><h4>Peru lags behind the regional average in insurance coverage. How will regulatory policy assist penetration?</h4><p>Peru saw a new insurance contract law legislated in 2012. Before then, the insurance industry was regulated under the commercial code of 1902, whereby the law was over a century overdue for reform. When I took office and attended my first meeting of insurance regulators, I met with insurance companies that kept saying they didn't know how to enter Peru as the legislation seemed rather unusual. That was a polite term for 'outdated.' Therefore, we amended it with the latest legislation. We had three to four companies entering the market over the last year. Today, the market is more competitive and offers better products, but remains in development, and will have matured within a year or two. The same is true for micro-insurance. It is all going to change if we can continue growing at 5-6%, then the insurance market will be unrecognizable five years from now. There is no question of its future growth.<br></p><h4>What is your outlook for the devaluation of the sol and how are you ensuring that de-dollarization proceeds at a rapid rate up until that point?</h4><p><span></span>The move to the Nuevo Sol will continue and will probably be promoted by those keen to borrow in Nuevos Soles. Others will hold onto dollars in terms of saving. There will probably be some adjustment of interest rates, and there might be more use of foreign markets for hedging purposes. Small fluctuations in foreign exchange are ok because they get absorbed in the natural production in the sales process. Large devaluations tend to distract people from their production and consumption decisions and push them into short-term speculative moves, which in net terms is negative for the economy. Smooth, predictable changes are preferable, and the central bank has done this very well. We have increased financial inclusion by 47% over the past five years (1.8 million people) in what has been a major effort by the industry and its regulator. We effectively determined not to impose any barrier that could curb the development of the market. We, therefore, regard ourselves rather as the guardians of fair play. There is a consumer protection agency in place in the market, but our role is to make sure the financial system is systemically fair.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where in Mozambique are your business centers located, and what services do you offer?</h4><p><span></span>At this stage we have facilities in Pemba and Beira as well as at five different locations in Maputo.</p><p><span></span>We are also looking to enter Nacala, Tete, and Nampula within the next two years due to the expected growth driven potential of major gas finds there. In terms of services, we offer a complete package for an office including reception, internet, and furniture. The concept is that we offer a “plug-in" office, meaning that the client arrives and can get to work right away, which decreases risk. For example, a new client in Mozambique might grow briskly at first, yet have a project that does not ultimately succeed. If the client were to choose a more traditional solution, it would not be as easy as it would have involved a longer-term commitment. Our price policy, then, is based on competing with the traditional solution. We also make it easier because we have the services and manage the entire office, whereby it is easier for a client to deal with one invoice, instead of many.</p><h4><span></span>How many clients do you work with at the moment?</h4><p><span></span>We have around 120 clients in total. We have a number of business centers that are currently at capacity, while space remains in others. In Maputo we are at about 80% capacity.</p><h4><span></span>What is the profile of your clients?</h4><p><span></span>Usually, we have international companies that are starting operations in Mozambique, although we also accommodate three chambers of commerce. Portugal, Kenya, Nigeria, Dubai, Japan, and Brazil are some of the most common nationalities that we cater to. It is slower for local companies, the main reason being the limited number of local companies starting out in Mozambique. We have made a considerable effort to increase the number of local startups at our business centers through partnerships with the Ministry of Science and Technology and IPEME.</p><h4><span></span>How would you characterize BPartner's role in facilitating business networking in the country?</h4><p><span></span>It is all about service, and we have frequently organized networking opportunities through what we like to call “Business Strengths with Drinks" events. Over the past two years we have invited several known Mozambican business figures to address our events, and meanwhile, networking naturally occurs within business centers.</p><h4><span></span>What are some of the main characteristics that set you apart from your competitors?</h4><p><span></span>Our greatest advantage is our provision of national representation. A client of ours can use our private offices in Beira if expanding from Maputo and has several meeting rooms available for use. There are also work stations, or even a private office, which can be used for a specific period of time. That is definitely an advantage for us, because in Mozambique having a relational market means being present. When pursuing a client in Pemba, one of the first things they will ask you is where your local office is located. </p><h4><span></span>What can the government do to support entrepreneurship in this new era?</h4><p><span></span>One of the greatest weaknesses for startups in Mozambique is finance—this is not an issue for an international company and obtaining financing from outside Mozambique at a rate of 3%. But a Mozambican company can only obtain financing from within the country itself at a high rate of 21%. If you have a good project, there are a lot of commercial banks available, but due to prevailing rates this remains a weakness.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of a virtual office? </h4><p><span></span>A virtual office means that you do not have a designated office space. We provide everything from a secretary to a meeting room, and depending on the package, you have certain hours of work station time, or a private office if required. Some people do a large portion of their work beyond the office. For instance a salesman who does not need an office all of the time, because he is out visiting clients everyday may on occasion need to receive clients, or use a meeting room.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Market Value]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[market-value]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the peculiarities of the Mozambican market and the most common concerns of a foreign company interested in entering the country?</h4><p>When entering any market the most important aspect is access to local knowledge, detailed information and quality advice so as to correctly assess the potential for success of a venture into the country and limit risk. There are a number of sources that can be tackled for that purpose, such as international financial institutions, commercial banks and professional services firms. Although business culture is somehow difficult, with a different legal system, Mozambique is quite a secure and investor friendly environment, as long as the proper “homework" is done and the Mozambicans are not taken for granted.<br>How would you assess the current level of foreign interest in the country and what needs to be done, by the public and private sectors, to create new incentives and improve the environment for foreign investors?<br>The level of investment continues to reach new records for the Southern Africa region. I believe that from a Mozambican perspective the incentives have to be broad based and not only for foreign investors. The first indicator in terms of whether a country is ready for foreign investment is thriving local businesses that are adding value to the economy. Mozambique has to honor the contracts it has made in the past in order to incentivize foreign investment, but more than that, it has to level the playing field in such a way that national and foreign business can compete with integrity, thereby becoming a global example. The rules have to be complied with by all, and must be the same for all. If this is adhered to, everyone benefits, be they foreign or national interests.</p><h4>What regulatory changes are we likely to see over the medium term in Mozambique? </h4><p>The regulations Mozambique is expected to approve over the coming months include the first Transfer Pricing regulation, which will permit the creation of greater value companies resident in Mozambique in inter-firm commercial relations. The value added tax code is also under review. We also foresee that the tax benefits that today exist for foreign and national investors will gradually subside and probably create an environment conducive to reviewing the tax rates for all. Our corporate tax rate at 32% and VAT at 17% are quite high for the region. Probably the new tax reform will help the formal, until the informal sector of the economy is gradually absorbed by the formal and tax paying economy. </p><h4>How would you describe the role of SMEs in Mozambique and how can Deloitte assist the development of a more efficient SMEs structure? </h4><p><span></span>Of the total number of companies operating in Mozambique 98% are SMEs, although they merely contribute 20% of GDP. SMEs are the backbone of the Mozambican economy and are far more labour intensive than large companies. SMEs employ most of the working population in the country, creating self-employment and third-party employment, and are the only source of endogenous growth, which is the most robust form of sustainable long-term growth for the economy. Even in turbulent times, when commodity prices decline, or political risks increase and FDI falls, SMEs remain in business. </p><p><span></span>Additionally, SME production reduces the need for imports, whereby Mozambican income stays in the country to stimulate the supply side (more production) instead of going abroad. </p><p><span></span>However, SMEs face a tougher business environment than micro and large enterprises as:</p><p>- They do not qualify for some of the tax and regulatory provisions of the micro enterprises, despite creating more employment;</p><p>- They do not get the exemptions and benefits of mega-projects;<br>- They are more vulnerable to red tape than large corporations as they lack the financial and networking capacity to “fast-track" administrative processes.<br>At Deloitte we understand the “inner workings" of SMEs as we serve a large base of clients in this segment across all our business areas from auditing, accounting, tax and strategy, to operations, innovation, technology, human resources and financial advisory. <br>We help our clients consolidate their operations, become more competitive and efficient, and grow their business, generating profit and creating more employment.<br>We also facilitate investment into these companies as we have a wide global network and contacts with international companies.</p><h4>How would you describe Deloitte's role in the socioeconomic development of the country?</h4><p>We believe we add considerable value locally both from a business and human capital perspective. We serve a variety of companies, from market entrants to small companies, large multinationals and public companies. <br>Deloitte, as the largest professional services firm in the world, understands how to make SMEs more competitive vis-í -vis regional and international enterprises. <br>Over the past few years we have been serving SMEs in Mozambique through linkages and supplier development programmes with donors and business associations, capacity building activities, improving value chains and identifying markets, preparing bankable business plans for SMEs and supporting our SME clients access finance.</p><p>By helping SMEs to become more competitive and generate more value they will contribute with more taxes to the government and generate greater employment opportunities for Mozambicans. In this manner the government becomes less aid-dependent and Mozambicans enjoy greater economic sovereignty than when relying on “financial hand-outs" from other countries.</p><p>By linking enterprises from different sectors (as we deal with SMEs from all sectors: financial, natural resources, infrastructure, etc.) we also create “space for business opportunity" and collaboration. For example, we assist SMEs with bankable business plans so they can convert their business ideas into financing from financial institutions.</p><p>As recipients and custodians of a wealth of business information we also act as a market development force for the country, advising the Government and Business Associations on how to reduce the incidence of market failures, informational asymmetries and other constraints than inhibit local (endogenous) economic growth. <br>As a global company we practice global quality standards, which are much needed by SMEs to be able to serve large corporations in the extractive and industry sectors (and therefore realize market opportunities).<br>We also employ a large labour base of Mozambicans—95% of our workforce is local—and invest in their development. The skills and knowledge that our professionals gain from Deloitte gives them the ability to be successful in any business environment and face any business challenge. </p><p>We believe that our contribution is significant in developing successful entrepreneurs and providing the market a solid and skilled workforce.</p><h4>What is your 10-year outlook on Deloitte in Mozambique?</h4><p>Deloitte will become the undisputed leader in quality professional services in Mozambique, as we are in the rest of the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Culture in Mozambique now falls under the remit of the Ministry of Tourism. How are you taking advantage of this opportunity?</h4><p>Mozambique is blessed with incredibly diverse natural resources, and levels of conservation rank among the best in the region, offering the country great potential as a tourism destination.</p><p><span></span>The impressive cultural background of the country presents another element of differentiation, and when combined with the unmatched hospitality of the Mozambican people and the combination of tropical beach tourism along the country's immense coast of approximately 2,700km, make Mozambique a unique choice. The promotion of the cultural practices and knowledge of the national communities will also be reinforced by the fusion of culture and tourism under the same ministry. Mozambique has a privileged location and a diversified climate makes the country attractive. In addition to this, borders shared with Tanzania, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Zambia mean that it is a well-connected nation. The diversity of touristic attractions, from beaches and conservation areas to culture and history combines to attract a broad spectrum of tourists. Good hospitality and security are also factors which make Mozambique a strong choice as a tourism destination. </p><h4><span></span>What are the key strategies being implemented over the coming five years to promote the tourism industry in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>We have to incentivize the creation of basic infrastructure to support the tourism industry, particularly airports, border control posts, roads, and energy, water, and telecommunications utilities. We will also invest in the necessary human resources, particularly in the hotel and tourism sectors, and focus on developing opportunities for young professionals and women in an attempt to stimulate local tourism. In addition, we will have to create hotel-schools to ensure the improvement of service quality and to enable the growth of the business environment. We must also incentivize the growth of air connections, an area that is still considered a serious barrier to the development of tourism on the African continent, given the limited choice of connections between regional countries. In addition, we have to enhance the financial system through an integrated platform that will enable the monitoring of foreign payments in tourism transactions. Overall, we need to do a better job of integrating the numerous contributing elements of the sector, creating better conditions for the industry to flourish and provide more jobs. Furthermore, the sector requires fuller commercialization, by promoting arts and culture as an integral part of the national touristic offering, and by instituting a tax for the promotion and development of tourism.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the tourism sector's contribution to GDP?</h4><p><span></span>The performance of the tourism sector in Mozambique is measured through the analysis of the performance of key indicators such as international arrivals, revenue from international tourism, the volume of investment, and national bed capacity. Between 2010 and 2014, these indicators registered some growth as the result of the diffusion and promotion of investment opportunities and the identification of tourism zones, as well as because of concessions for gambling activities in casinos and the overall development of the business environment and the national tourism offering. In order for us to be able to understand the tourism sector's real contribution to the country's GDP, the “tourism satellite account" was created by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) to measure the real contribution of tourism to GDP. Mozambique has had an experimental satellite account since 2013, and we expect to have a definitive one in place by 2016. We are working in collaboration with the National Statistics Institute to achieve this objective. We estimate the contribution of tourism to GDP at around 5.6%. Our National Accounts only take the revenue generated by hotels and restaurants into consideration when assessing the sector's contribution to the economy.</p><h4>How would you describe the potential of MICE tourism in the country?</h4><p><span></span>Any country's visibility lies in its culture and in the efforts of the government to promote it. Mozambique remains an unexplored market, but nevertheless real estate for the tourism sector is being developed effectively, and a five-star development is currently under construction adjacent to the Joaquim Chissano International Conference Center, along with several facilities with considerable capacity. There is also a five-star hotel in central Beira called the Golden Peacock, while we should also mention developments in Tete and Cabo Delgado at Pemba Beach.</p><h4>How would you describe the significance of the touristic sector as a catalyst for employment creation and socioeconomic growth?</h4><p><span></span>The government of Mozambique has defined tourism as one of the strategic sectors that will contribute to socio-economic development. The sector requires the utilization of skilled and un-skilled labor, representing an excellent opportunity for the rapid creation of numerous direct and indirect positions, subsequently contributing to poverty alleviation and increased wealth.</p><h4>What is your strategy for collaboration with Ministry of Transport and Communication to increase the number of locally operating airlines?</h4><p><span></span>The connectivity issue not only affects Mozambique, but is also felt by other countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. The improvement of air connections is reliant on political stability, air safety, available airport infrastructure, and governmental reforms related to taxation and airline standards. The sovereignty of our national airspace is also an issue to be considered. Public-private partnerships will play a crucial role in the development of this area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key strategies of INATUR for the coming years to promote the tourism sector in Mozambique?</h4><p>We have selected specific markets, and raised the quality of services, promoting our sunny beaches, the diversified and rich fauna and flora, historic and cultural experience and other Mozambican attractions. We are keen to continue our tourism promotion activities in the UK, Portugal (due to our historical ties), Germany, and China, where we cannot afford to miss such a major market, as well as Spain and South Africa. Doubtless, we will be supplementing our efforts with those that target new markets, such as Japan, France, Middle East, India, Russia, and Brazil, where we attended a travel show in Sío Paulo. In order to do that, we attend travel shows and host fact-finding trips for journalists and writers. Meanwhile, we continue our efforts in the domestic market, by promoting Descubra Moçambique, Feira Internacional do Turismo and the thematic festivals across the country.</p><h4>What is the contribution of the tourism sector to GDP?</h4><p>Tourism contributes 5.6% to GDP, but we are positive that within five years the figure can reach 8% to 9%.</p><h4>What are Mozambique's competitive advantages as a tourism destination?</h4><p>Mozambique's unique selling proposition is the combination of beaches, cultural and wildlife offerings. Mozambique also has a strong historical element that includes the Portuguese, Chinese, Dutch, Arabs, and Bantu tribes. Our cuisine itself is reminiscent of that of Arabian, Asian and other cultures. Our past is also reflected in our dance and music. Mozambique is also one of the safest places in Southern Africa. Vasco da Gama, when arriving to a warm welcome, called Mozambique 'terra da boa gente,' which means the 'land of good people.' Centuries ago, one of the first African samurais in Japan was from Mozambique.</p><h4>How do you characterize the potential of Mozambique for MICE tourism?</h4><p>Mozambique has many hotels, the occupancy rate of which is a surprising 70% plus. We believe that oil and gas are secondary to tourism, and this suggests a wonderful future to the country. Oil and gas are not mass employers, in contrast to tourism, which creates many jobs. Leisure tourism, meanwhile, is not confined to the beaches, but also entails safari and wildlife experiences. We are opening many more national parks, some of which are doing rather well. The world is changing its perception of safaris: they are no longer just about just spotting the Big Five, as people are coming to see local flora and fauna in general.</p><h4>What is your assessment of human resource quality in the tourism sector? What should be improved?</h4><p>We have two elements: marketing and human resource development, as we need to train more local staff in tourism and hospitality management skills. Toward this goal, we collaborate with several training schools and universities. We run short-term courses around the country, in eight provinces. In 2014, we were able to train more than 990 people. We are keen to establish a Kapulana Hotel schools. At the moment, we have small hotels called Hotel Kapulana, and are switching to Kapulana Hotel Schools to train staff. In small villages, finding accommodation is not easy. Instead of having 10-14 rooms, the Kapulana Hotel School has 46 to 50 rooms, with a more attractive architectural design. We have based our human resources strategy on the performance of these hotel schools for the next four to six years, with the goal of placing 2,000 to 3,000 professionals per annum in the tourism market.</p><h4>What are the most urgent infrastructure and transportation projects?</h4><p>I hope to see the development of marinas along the coast that could catalyze developments in the cruise business, as we have 2,700km of coastline. We are working on this at the moment with a number of European and American cruise companies. Unfortunately, the lingering threat of Somali pirates dampens the process. Another area I would like to see improvement in is the road network, for convenient access to beaches and islands. The third required improvement is the construction of additional Kapulana Hotel Schools. And moreover, if you want to see mobility in Mozambique, you need to invest in transport.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Universidade Politécnica evolved during its 20 years in education?</h4><p><span></span>Universidade Politécnica benefited from the 1993 law permitting private sector entities to enter the higher education sector, which came into effect on September 13th, 1995. Our first intake was 165 students, and initially we did not have our own building, but partnered with LAM, where we would made five scholarships available in exchange for use of their building. Today, our student body exceeds 7,000. Over the past 20 years, we have expanded geographically from Maputo to Zambezia, Quelimane, Nampula, Nacala, Tete, and Xai Xai. We also have a distance-learning program. In 2004, we opened the first blocks of the 14,000sqm university, which feature two blocks for graduate programs, a rectory, a block housing the central library and our Foundation (FUNDE), a block for the Mozambique Business School, one for the professional technical education and general secondary education, one housing the gym, and another housing the student leisure club.</p><h4>How is the role of women changing in the education system?</h4><p><span></span>Most of our programs have more women than men, and indeed, former President Guebuza's daughters studied at our institution. There is a movement to promote higher education among women, and a number of corporations also provide higher education for gifted women who would not otherwise have the financial means to study. This movement has borne fruit in that many women have subsequently assumed high positions in international companies.</p><h4>To what extent is the university leveraging ICT to extend its services beyond the traditional lecture hall through online learning?</h4><p><span></span>The national energy deficit has curbed the uptake of online technology and distance learning. We made an agreement with UNIUBE, the University of Uberaba in Brazil that specializes in enabling distance learning in its home country, covering remote areas such as Amazonas and Mato Grosso. Rather than online education, it relies on distance learning through classic media such as telephony, printed materials, and strategically-located teachers. We have relied on these methods since starting our program in 2007. Last year, 800 students entered this program, whereby distance learning accounts for roughly 10% to 11% of our overall student body.</p><h4>What are the most important international partnerships of Universidade Politécnica and what strategies do you pursue to increase cooperation with other institutions?</h4><p><span></span>International partnerships have always been our initial strategy. As national pioneers in private education we needed a solid strategy, taking inspiration from other universities abroad. This is why we have internationalized our teaching staff and post-graduate component. We have agreements with PUC-Minas in Brazil, the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil, the Federal Fluminense University in Brazil, PUC-Rio in Brazil, the Lisbon University Institute (ISCTE) in Portugal, the University of Coimbra in Portugal, the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, and the University of Lecce in Italy. With these universities we have established graduation, exchange, and Master's and PhD programs. As part of the arrangement graduates become qualified from both institutions. We have also hosted prominent figures on special occasions to address our institution. Among those figures are Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former President of Brazil and former Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Gutierrez.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[down-to-a-science]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of your university over the past 18 years?</h4><p>ISCTEM was launched 18 years ago, in 1996. We started with four courses with less than 200 students at that time. Today, we have around 16 courses, Master's and PhD programs, as well as short-term courses across diverse fields. Our main focus is on courses that correspond to the needs of the market, based on which we develop our programs. Mozambique is experiencing growth in the industries of petroleum, gas, coal, and other main areas in which international companies are interested. It is important that, locally, we have the capacity to take part in related projects by training local staff. Our institution pioneered in petroleum gas management Master's programs in Mozambique. In the future, we will offer other courses on this. We are in contact with some universities all over the world to create programs that can be taught by local and international teachers in this field. We have academic staff coming on board to offer programs on informatics engineering, pharmacy, dentistry, and even for this course on petroleum gas management that we recently opened. I am aware of the need to reinforce the staff body by bringing on board other schools that already have a history of working in key fields. We started with a preliminary approach to Canada, India, and Brazil and will move forward until we create the optimum balance of academics and scientists that are interested in this. Locally, we are also in a process of discussing and involving the National Institute of Petroleum. Furthermore, I see the university as a universal area of debate, and the sciences, after all, are universal. We need to involve more brains, skills, and vision to improve our offering. As I mentioned earlier, we were also the pioneer of courses in Dentistry and Pharmacy, where originally most of our partners were from Portugal. We forged links with companies offering internships to our students and to also canvass their thoughts on gaps in educational provision that we could fill. We have a school of Architecture and one of Law that has been producing successful lawyers for more than 14 years. Currently we have a PhD course in Law that was developed together with the University of Lisbon in Portugal. We have a Biomedical Science School, which offers courses in Pharmacy, Dentistry, and Medicine. We also have a course of Social Sciences and an ISCTEM Business School that offers courses in Companies Management, Insurance, Marketing, Tourism Management, Human Resource Management, and Applied Management. They are designed as a matrix that facilitates exchange of contents among the various programs. </p><h4>What role are universities playing in the country for socioeconomic development?</h4><p>The universities might have the critical mass that could produce very independent thinking. But thinking is not enough; we need to act. It is important that companies and society at large also take part in such debates. However, the university holds the principle responsibility in terms of doing research to see what the market lacks and bringing about scientific solutions. Universities can empower people and teach them to deal with problems. Universities should encourage people to play a role. The main barrier to that is adequate facilities, which require investment. The ISCTEM also supports the socioeconomic development of the country by collaborating with the government. For example, we have signed an MoU with the Council of Maputo to allow our health students to go freely to visit families.</p><h4>What are the objectives of the university for 2015?</h4><p>My target is to make the Geology and Mines Engineering, Petroleum Gas program, and the Biomedical Science School more robust. The other challenge we have is to open two more post-graduate programs, one PhD in Public Health and another MSc in Nutrition and Food Security.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the Ministry's priorities for the next five years?</h4><p>Our fundamental objectives are to facilitate and broaden the citizen's access to public health services, to reduce waiting times, and to develop the quality of service. We will also be better equipping the healthcare institutions and broadening their scope of operation, as well as providing improved working conditions for SNS officials. Meanwhile, the management of healthcare facilities will be rendered more efficient, with an emphasis on prophylactic measures of treatment in order to promote community health.</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of public-private partnerships in Mozambique's health industry?</h4><p>A PPP is an instrument of vital importance to strengthen intervention of the sector for the health benefit of the entire Mozambican population. The action of the State in the promotion of healthcare in communities is based upon the assumption that a healthier population is a determining factor in national development, as well as being more productive and aware of its civic responsibilities. Building on the last point, it is crucial that the public sector, as well as the private sector and the civil society, can contribute, each one of them in its own way, to the vitality of the national health, contributing in this way to the common objective to develop human capital and add to the people's empowerment. My view is that the PPP model has worked successfully in the health sector, and we realize that there is still much potential to be explored to bolster the existing partnership for a greater level of complementarity, cooperation, and synergy. This can only benefit all stakeholders, in particular with the population dependent on the Mozambican public health system.</p><h4>What is your strategy for attracting national and foreign investment to the health sector?</h4><p>In the first place, we recognize that the right to healthcare is enshrined in the constitution. Secondly, I would stress that the country has policies and a healthcare strategy in place that underpin the strategic objectives, priorities, and relevant actions to promote the health of all citizens. Consequently, the necessary resources must be provided to meet the task of improving public health. In doing this we recognize that we lack the resources to undertake this responsibility alone, whereby cooperation among the private sector, civil society, and relevant cooperation partners, makes the vital difference. In formulating public policies the Ministry is working to rationalize its resources, and deploy them transparently and effectively. And in so doing we aim to supply those services of most pressing need for the general public.</p><h4>What emphasis do you place on R&amp;D?</h4><p>Naturally enough, the Ministry's activities, and my mandate specifically, rest on the pillars of science, technology, and innovation. We believe that fundamental decisions on the future of Mozambique's healthcare cannot be made without the contribution of universities and research centers. We will continue to bolster the connection between science and technology, and the concrete reality of the day-to-day life in the healthcare arena. Universities and centers of knowledge are key to securing cost-effective solutions. We intend to strengthen the partnerships with institutions engaged in health-related research in the SADC region, and the wider world; we have had had successful experiences in doing so. A case in point is our vital research into malaria. Once again, the role of private and civil institutions in that domain can bring added value, as well as expede the decision-making process and provide creative responses to market signals. </p><h4>How will you address the shortage of health industry professionals in the country?</h4><p>Mozambique's health sector today is far better equipped and staffed than it was 25 years ago. Our government is training staff, both medical and technical, who are contributing to broaden the citizen's access to vital health services. These healthcare workers have a diversity of experience ranging from the private sector to NGOs. Another key component to underline is the improvement in the working conditions of healthcare professionals, and the provision of other benefits to these essential workers. The government is currently working to implement the Medical Statutes that guarantee working conditions that motivate all of our staff within the National Healthcare System.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the status of the eucalyptus program and the factory plan to produce pulp in Mozambique?</h4><p>The project started immediately after approval, and one of the most challenging aspects was finding the right material to grow here in Mozambique, in addition to obtaining the license for such a large-scale project. It took some years to find the genetic material most suited to our geography and climate, and which is most resistant to the diseases found here. Of course, all of this necessitates a lengthy process of environmental and social impact assessment, and today we are awaiting a license from the government in order to proceed further. Having undertaken a number of trials we farm about 3,000 ha of plantation in different parts of the DUAT—a Mozambican land use agreement—that we manage. Our next step will be to increase the scale of our plantations, once officially licensed. The next step is to build a mill to produce pulp for paper, and also to produce energy. The project will become self-sufficient in terms of energy supply, and with the biomass we use to produce the pulp; we will generate sufficient surplus energy to feed into the grid. We expect a surplus of around 70MW, which amounts to around 10% of the total electrical energy consumption in Mozambique. Therefore, it will make a huge contribution to the energy needs of the country, while also helping stabilize the grid and improve the quality of electricity supply nationwide. The mill is expected to be operational by 2023, with a capacity of 1.5 million tons. It will practically double our group's pulp production capacity in Portugal, currently at about 1.4 million tons. The total estimated cost of the project by 2025 is around $2.3 billion, although this is likely to rise. The pulp we produce is planned for export, mainly for the Asian markets, especially China and India, but also for the US and European markets. All in all, we expect to contribute $1 billion to Mozambique's overall annual exports, and to see the creation of around 7,000 jobs in forestry and a further 500 at the factory itself. We are looking for partners with which to share the risk and also strengthen the sustainability of the project. We signed an agreement with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) on December 2015 in Washington, D.C., and that institution will shortly purchase the first lot of shares. </p><h4>How significant is Africa for the group in terms of sales?</h4><p>When you look at demographic and economic figures and forecasts, Africa is sure to become a bigger and more prosperous market in the future, and we will be well positioned to supply the market as it grows. After all, our investment here is a strategic one, and one we expect to significantly further our international scope and operations. But in the short term, we are concentrating on the Asian markets, which are huge for us. </p><h4>Portucel has won various awards, including Best European Company for 2013. What underpins your company's success?</h4><p>We have excellent and highly skilled human resources, and extremely high-quality assets. We have a good species in Eucalyptus Globulus, which has enabled us to make products of high quality, which in turn is why our Navigator brand is the most sold product in its segment worldwide. Therefore, it is a combination of human resources, quality assets, and exceptional raw materials, as well as excellent management. </p><h4>How do you assess the potential of Mozambique in terms of drawing foreign investors to the country, and investing in major, long-term projects such as this one?</h4><p>There are certainly risks that need to be assessed and evaluated, as with any investment. But the opportunity is there; otherwise, we would not have undertaken such a huge investment. That being said, you have to take the risks into close consideration and weigh the two against each other. We find that the balance tips on the side of optimism and opportunity in Mozambique. But you have to work hard, do your homework, and not expect an entirely smooth process, or overnight returns.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the production of agricultural products and livestock evolved in the Beira Corridor since the establishment of the Beira Agricultural Growth Corridor (BAGC) in 2010?</h4><p>Agricultural production tends to go through cycles, depending on the nature of the seasons. But having said that, we have noticed a general increase in the level of productivity in terms of yields per hectare, especially at the level of smallholder farming. This is due to a slight increase in the use of improved seeds and chemicals, which roughly translates into a 15% rise in yields over this period.</p><h4>How is BAGCP collaborating with financial entities to improve small-scale farmers' access to credit?</h4><p>Banks are able, to some extent, to meet demand for seasonal and short-term investment finance, but when it comes to long-term finance, they have yet to figure out a way to provide financing windows that can be helpful to farmers and other agribusiness investors. We continue talking with them and other entities about the need for longer-term capital that will enable investments in long-term productive assets such as irrigation, fruits, and animal breeding stock. And additionally, addressing the issue of irrigation and irrigation infrastructure is paramount for the rapid growth of agriculture in the corridor.</p><h4>What products offer the greatest potential for the next few years in the Beira Corridor?</h4><p>The Beira Corridor is lucky in that it can support almost anything that one may want to produce. However, what has been coming through is fruit, such as lychees and avocados, which offer big opportunities. Right now, there are some large companies that want to undertake a major venture in lychee production. The livestock value chain is also producing opportunities, such as feed and processing facilities, and we have been talking to certain potential investors. Beef cattle, dairy, and poultry are clear focus areas, while horticulture is also important. Traditionally, rice is a significant crop in the Lower Zambezi and Sofala; the country continues to import almost all of its rice need, and, therefore, rice investments remain relevant. The challenge now is to produce it at competitively low cost.</p><h4>What needs to be done to promote exports from the Beira Corridor? </h4><p>First of all, agriculture within the corridor needs to improve its competitiveness. We need to reduce the costs of production for commodities such as fertilizer and livestock feed. The country is heavily dependent on imports and these come in two forms: finished products and raw materials. And because we are importing, we are also importing costs, which impacts our competitiveness. We have been discussing ways to reduce costs with the fertilizer industry by lowering taxes and improving on logistics. Part of this is the need to improve roads and other elements of transport infrastructure. Meanwhile, the financing of local businesses is a pressing matter in need of urgent attention, as inadequate financing is a major constraint on the ability of local businesses to grow through investment.</p><h4>How would you characterize the relationship between agriculture and mining in the Beira Corridor?</h4><p>The opportunities that the mining sector can provide, especially to support food production, are great. At present, neighboring countries produce the food consumed by the employees of mining companies. While the mining companies see this as a procurement problem, our institution, the Beira Agricultural Growth Corridor (BAGC), considers that long-term development of agriculture in the region would be a valuable solution. The BAGC is forging links between mining and agriculture by structuring demand and developing supply chains involving local producers. The mining companies' need for food gives local farmers a nearby market, especially during the construction phase. The role of the BAGC is to create incentives for local sourcing, and to develop core investment in local agricultural development.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the Beira Development Corridor Summit?</h4><p>The event will raise issues and take stock of where we are now, developments in the world of agriculture, and information on new programs that might prove helpful. It also builds consensus on priorities for investment areas. Investors can leave with better knowledge of the corridor, and information about where they can invest tomorrow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges for the Ministry of Education and Human Development for the next five years?</h4><p>
	We are tasked with nothing less than building a country. There can be no development without universal education and a collaboration between between those who “know how to think" and those who “know what to do." In this light, we cannot lightly accept the reality that there are not enough schools for those who want to study. We are short of classrooms, equipment and learning materials, which must be remedied. Our teachers, who are the basis of society and of a future based on knowledge, tolerance, respect, and development, need to see their professional careers recognized as being among the core professions in civil society. We need also to guarantee the effective management of schools, and the active intervention of parents. Our ambition is to launch the “Club of the Friends of Education" and invite entities such as companies, banks, artists, and religious organizations to contribute to the development of basic and high schooling, in a concept that we call “Solidary Education." There is no progress while our children are unable to read, write, and express themselves effectively.
</p><h4>
	How do you expect the literacy ratio in Mozambique to evolve?
</h4><p>
	Literacy can be achieved by providing adequate resources to schools and by galvanizing society to comprehend the value of education. We still have a high illiteracy rate, but it is destined to drop. The previous government had the goal of helping 1 million people into literacy, and the milestone was almost achieved. Once again, this is a responsibility that belongs to us all. This year we will ensure that the new intake of teachers, as well as those with experience, come fully to grips with the basics of both teaching and nurturing children.</p><h4>How would you describe the existing education infrastructure in Mozambique and what investments are necessary to fulfill your medium term goals?</h4><p>
	As in many countries, infrastructure inevitably has its shortfalls. Yet the idea is simple; to build more schools, be better equipped, and provide students a nurturing environment conducive to development and growth. In 2015, we will integrate more than 8,000 new teachers into the school system. Senior teachers have the responsibility of administering, controlling, and implementing policy stipulated by the Ministry, with the support of Provincial Directors. This year has commenced with the de-centralization of budgets and reallocation of some of these to schools. This will enable schools to establish the necessary autonomy to establish basic operational principles. We will rigorously and effectively control the resources for maximum effectiveness.</p><h4>How would you characterize the significance of education and human development to ensure long-term good governance and political stability? </h4><p>
	Governance and politics require qualified professionals to implement policies and create an environment of confidence that is credible to investors. Companies, government, universities, and schools reflect the quality of their human resources, and it is easy to see why human capital is the engine of an organization. In Mozambique, there is a lack of skilled people across many fields, but especially in the areas of engineering and the sciences, and we require an urgent closing of this gap. While the majority of the developed countries have a plan for professional teaching, in Mozambique we still face an insufficient number of skilled professionals. We need policies that focus on the planning and investment in skilled labor in the long-term or in other words a planned investment in education. The educational system should provide an opportunity for people to become fuller citizens to the benefit of the nation at large.</p><h4>What are the main investment opportunities in the education sector for foreign investors? </h4><p>
	The pitfalls of the education system are perfectly clear. We welcome investments in schools to develop professional education, universities, and research centers that want to focus on the disciplines of natural sciences and engineering, mainly in the emerging areas of oil and gas. We also want to focus on the first few years of childhood and in the special schooling for students with special requirements. It is necessary to understand Mozambique's reality and to evaluate the need for relevant investment, although I would say that there are plenty of opportunities for investment.</p><h4>What are the main objectives you would like to achieve during your tenure?</h4><p>
	I would like to see a reduction in the number of students who abandon education, thereby turning their back on the development of their country and of greater freedom. It is also important to make schooling more appealing to youth by exploring the local curriculum and instilling the importance of a solid education. We also want to underline the dignity of teaching as a career, as a fundamentally important status within society, and to promote the idea of thinking, rationalizing, and doing. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Construa's geographical spread in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>Our annual group revenue is roughly $100 million. We are currently considered to be the largest single builders' merchant in the country, and have 20 outlets nationwide including the provinces of Maputo, Gaza, Sofala, Tete, Manica, Inhambane, and Zambezia. Over the next year and a half we will open a further five in the north of the country where we still do not have a major presence.</p><h4><span></span>What key strategies have you set for Construa for the next five years?</h4><p><span></span>We ultimately want to be listed on the stock exchange, which to date has seen only limited development. The stock exchange has been around for some years but remains rather illiquid. Yet I believe that as more investors pursuing projects enter the nation, participation will increase among local entities. From what I have understood, it is the government's intention for companies to release stock for trading on the stock exchange to generate capital that would enable local companies to participate in future ventures.</p><h4><span></span>How is Construa taking advantage of the construction boom in the country?</h4><p><span></span>We sell building materials, but also offer technical services where we design and manufacture roofing structures for housing or office complexes. That is to say, we design solutions and manufacture them for construction contractors.</p><h4><span></span>What is Construa's commitment to the recycling of construction materials?</h4><p><span></span>We recycle scrap metals and manufacture these into rebar used in concrete foundations and columns. We have five factories, where we manufacture steel, roof tiles, cement tile adhesive, and our own paint.</p><h4><span></span>What are your strategies to set yourself apart from your competitors?</h4><p><span></span>We focus on cost and quality. We have built ourselves over the years to the extent where we benefit from economies of scale. What we do is offer the best quality for the best price. We represent and co-represent certain leading global brands, and Mozambicans are particularly brand-conscious. We import globally from an array of countries, and we also support local manufacture where we can. For example, we are the largest retail distributor for Mozambique's primary cement manufacturer.</p><h4><span></span>How would you describe Construa's commitment to quality?</h4><p><span></span>We make sure to provide high-quality products and services. All of our factories have laboratories where our materials are tested. I actually employ the local engineering authority to audit my chemists to assure the best quality. My chemists and laboratory technicians give me the results of their work, whereupon once a week the engineering laboratory of Mozambique will take samples for testing. Our local engineering authority's laboratory is EU compliant.</p><h4>What are the specific challenges for the construction sector in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>We need to improve our infrastructure, transport, and logistics capacity, and distances are a problem too. Construction materials are generally of a heavy, bulky nature. It seems everyone in Mozambique sells on parity, and that pushes up the costs tremendously, in terms of logistics, customs clearing, and so forth. All of these add huge costs because of the time it takes to clear goods.</p><h4>How would you describe the business environment of Mozambique to potential international investors? </h4><p><span></span>Anyone who does invest here should give a lot of slack to people on the ground and believe in them. I have seen businesses fail here because they have tried to run them from a foreign boardroom.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Construa in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>Construa has always been a good brand in Mozambique, and if you ask people here, they know Construa. But we need to grow further. So, by the time we manage to list, if it ever happens, I do believe there are a lot of local people who would be eager to buy stock in our business. People have seen our operation grow nationwide, having begun from a modest office. They have also seen the factories expand and developed trust in our business. We are a Mozambican company.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Mozambique for Mota-Engil's overall strategy in Africa?</h4><p><span></span>Mota-Engil África is currently operating in the 11 countries of Angola, Mozambique, South Africa, Cape Verde, Sío Tomé and Prí­ncipe, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Ghana, Uganda, and Malawi, having also recently been awarded its largest contract to date; a project in Cameroon worth $3.5 billion regarding the construction of 580km of railway and a deep-water port. This project reiterates Mota-Engil's capacity in the development of integrated solutions and is currently on the stage of finalizing its financing process. We have been present in Mozambique for over 20 years and the country is an important component of Mota-Engil África's growth strategy. Currently Mota-Engil África has a footprint in pretty much all provinces of Mozambique. Furthermore, we have also participated in the construction of the Nacala Corridor in Malawi, which is an excellent example of our technical capacity with regard to projects of such dimension. This year, Mota-Engil África Mozambique, has obtained certification for the design and construction of engineering, infrastructure and building projects, in accordance with ISO 9001:2008—Quality Control Systems, from the Bureau Veritas Certification.</p><h4>What are the main infrastructure projects of Mota-Engil in Mozambique beyond Maputo?</h4><p><span></span>In general, our infrastructure projects are located beyond Maputo. We are working on a range of projects from roads and railways, to bridges and ports, which involve challenging logistics. For example, we have just finished the Bridge Base Kassuende over the Zambezi River (Tete), which will enable the circulation of people and goods between Mozambique and its neighboring countries. We are also concluding the rehabilitation of a 228km long road, which will link Chimoio to the “Espungabera" border. This road will foster the development of the Manica Province and will have a major impact on the national economy in general. Alongside this, we are also involved in railway projects such as the “Sena line," for which our contribution was of vital importance in the logistical challenge of coal transportation. Furthermore, we are involved in the rehabilitation of the Cuamba-Lichinga railway and on the second phase of construction of the road between Milange and Mocuba. We are also involved in several other infrastructure projects that aim to support the future oil and gas activities in Cabo Delgado.</p><h4>What are the main real estate projects of Mota-Engil in the country?</h4><p><span></span>Apart from projects that we already have in development, we will soon start two joint ventures of around $50 million. We are executing a flagship project at the center of Maputo—the Platinum Building for real estate developer Promovalor, a prestigious project that will be finished within a particularly short timeline of 20 months.</p><h4>What is your strategy to set yourself apart from your competitors?</h4><p><span></span>We do not believe in economic success if it is not coupled with technical success. Our size, best practices, and technology represent our huge potential. One of our steps towards differentiation was the recently obtained ISO 9001:2008 quality certification. In particular, due to the fact that we are the first civil engineering company in Mozambique to attain this qualification. Our unparalleled experience in the construction of ports and railways is one of the factors that differentiates us from our competitors, as well as our expertise in precast, concrete, dams, railways, roads, bridges, and civil construction. which are all well documented and available for consultation. Currently, we are investing in the development and training of our national co-workers with projects such as “Crescemos Juntos" (Growing Together) and “StartME — Mozambique". The “Crescemos Juntos" project is a tutorial project where our most experienced foreign co-workers take responsibility for developing core competencies of our local co-workers, build leadership skills, and increases the level of cultural awareness within our group. The StartME project is a program for young graduates, where 20 Mozambicans are currently enrolled in induction. Mota-Engil África Moçambique currently has over 2,000 co-workers and an installed capacity of 500 heavy-duty machines, allowing us a quick response and the fulfillment of deadlines in accordance with national necessities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has World Despachos developed its business since its establishment in 2012?</h4><p><span></span>The World Agíªncia de Despachos Aduaneiros e Serviço LDA is a Mozambican company, founded in 2012 by a Mozambican national, and has a large domestic footprint as well as international experience. Strength, trust and service quality are the main pillars of the company, and our primary objective is to create value for customers and other involved stakeholders. In order to achieve this, the company relies on the motivation and capacity of its technical staff, supported by a continuous and quality induction of its people and focused on the establishment of a relationship of trust, responding innovatively to the most complex challenges.</p><h4>In which regions do you operate today?</h4><p><span></span>The World Agíªncia with its staff of 14 is located at Maputo's international cargo terminal, and we support our customers in activities such as customs clearance, and procedures related to import and export. The technical capabilities of our staff ensure we have become a reference name in the sector.</p><h4>How do you incorporate innovation into your services?</h4><p><span></span>Our extensive experience in the processes of importing and exporting goods provides the company with the knowledge and expertise to execute a swift clearance process. It is the company's aim to have the clearance process concluded prior to the arrival of the goods to its point of entry, be it by land, sea, or air. World Agíªncia's client portfolio is testament to our ability to realize its objectives and overcome any challenges that may arise, assuring service excellence for the client, from the development of new solutions to the usage of the new MCNET system. Innovation is a tool that lends a competitive market, which underpins steady growth. The company systematically works to improve its services, offering a broad range of integrated solutions and a continuous commitment to competitiveness, quality and innovation. And as we continue to expand and reinforce our presence, we become more accessible to clients, while actively contributing to the development of Mozambique. The company relies on a qualified and multidisciplinary technical team and has installed sufficient capacity to address any query related to the customs clearance process. From our offices at the cargo terminal we mobilize our own transports and goods delivery service upon the customs clearance, wherever the client requires this service.</p><h4>What are the most common issues faced by companies when entering the Mozambican market?</h4><p><span></span>The lack of skilled workers remains a challenge, and the effort to develop the talent and technical skills can be frustrating if the competition poaches your staff. You need to preserve and also to be flexible and try new approaches.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What short-term priorities have you set for ECS?</h4><p><span></span>Over the next two years, given the demands of the market and our client base, the objective is to extend our operational footprint to all provincial capitals, including their respective districts to enable the delivery of the goods without the client needing to visit our head offices. Expresso Carga e Serviços has always embraced market challenges, and in this spirit and according to our motto “for you, we reach further," our services cater to foreign companies operating in Mozambique, and have a nationwide reach.</p><h4><span></span>What is your assessment of the potential for further growth of the national transport and logistics sector?</h4><p><span></span>Our evaluation of the transport and logistics sector is broadly is positive, as national development supports sector growth. Given the sector's development in Mozambique and our objective of expansion, for the next two years we will pursue partnerships with suitable foreign companies active in the sector.</p><h4><span></span>What are the comparative advantages of ECS over other international companies such as DHL, FedEx, or UPS?</h4><p><span></span>ECS was created with the objective of galvanizing the sector and further supporting the development of transport and cargo delivery in Mozambique. The advantages of ECS when compared to our competitors, is our total commitment to the cargo entrusted to us. We focus on pick up and door-to-door delivery within cities and districts, including at weekends and on bank holidays.</p><h4><span></span>What are the likely coming trends within Mozambique's transport and logistics industry?</h4><p><span></span>Operational efficiency tops the sector's agenda, with the two ends of the scale—demand and supply—and dedication to yielding the excellent results at the best prices, which will revitalize the sector.</p><h4><span></span>How would you characterize the importance of an efficient transport network for the successful development of the Mozambican economy?</h4><p><span></span>An efficient transport network for the development of the Mozambican economy is of great importance for the economic development of Mozambique mainly due to the positive spillovers that the sector creates. The infrastructure created by the investment on the transport sector fosters high economic activity. Mozambican businesses are increasingly confident in the improvement of the commercial environment. Their general optimism is driven by the changes introduced by the government aimed at improving it further by scrapping the rules regarding the minimum capital demand and bank deposits, and the approval of the new code on fiscal benefits. The changes also include the introduction by the government of the “simplified tax regime for small contributors" and the “simplified licensed regime," which enables the immediate issuing of licenses to operate a business.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the company over the coming decade?</h4><p><span></span>One of Expresso Carga e Serviços's core goals is to become internationally recognized over a 10-year horizon as the company of choice for any kind of cargo. We are keen also to establish lasting partnerships with companies operating in our sector around the globe to provide the most reliable cargo service for our long-term clientele.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When did Transitex arrive in Mozambique and how has it evolved since then?</h4><p><span></span>We were established in Mozambique in 2009, starting in Maputo, and over those five years, have already expanded to new branches in Beira and Nacala. Today we have three branches in Mozambique, and also have a presence on the main borders of the country.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Mozambican market for your company?</h4><p><span></span>It is highly important as Mozambique enjoys commercial relationships with Portugal, Spain, and Italy, where we have our offices. This enables us to offer our clients door-to-door services.</p><h4>What are your expansion and development plans?</h4><p><span></span>Our plan for 2015 is to open an office in Pemba because we already have some business and our own people present there. We would like to capitalize on the opportunities of the oil and gas industry, perhaps as an auxiliary company to render customs and related issues easier. We offer a full service from door-to-door. In Mozambique, we operate at all the ports and airports—Nacala, Nampula, Beira, Pemba, Quelimane, and Maputo.</p><h4>How would you describe the growth of the company over the past year?</h4><p><span></span>We are moving 2,500 TEUs a year, although the volume has been growing over the past years. In terms of airfreight, we grew 25% YoY and in sea freight, we 10%. In land transportation from South Africa, for example, we also grew 12%, and expect further growth. We are negotiating some new projects and anticipate sustained growth next year. We will be pursuing additional business from Zimbabwe, Malawi, and South Africa, using Mozambican ports (mainly Maputo and Beira) to ship those cargos to other countries. Also, we will be thinking about new warehousing in Nacala and elsewhere. Importing cargo will be crucial for 2015. We are trying to enter the fertilizer sector in Malawi. There is a huge amount of cargo coming through Mozambique and going to all those other countries that do not have direct connection to the ocean. We have been doing normal cargos, containers and projects, but next year, our main plan is to capitalize on geostrategic location to promote using Mozambican ports to put cargo into other countries. Mozambique will be used to improve the hinterland. Most of the cargo that goes to Zimbabwe and Malawi use Beira Port, so we need to capitalize on clients in Zimbabwe and Malawi and promote this port. There is much happening there.</p><h4>What are the main countries conducting international trade with Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>Those are South Africa, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and China. We have noticed considerable growth in the cargo from Italy and China and last year, we opened two offices in Italy and this year we will open a Shanghai office. </p><h4>What is your 10-year outlook for the future of the company?</h4><p><span></span>Transitex has grown, not just in Mozambique. We are trying to expand Transitex to some countries here in Africa and in South America. We are supposed to increase our business in Mozambique, and also globally, by at least 15% this year. It is hard work, but achievable. Currently, our overall African operations represent 25% of total global operations and we are aiming to lift this to 30% in 2015. We opened in Angola and we have a new branch manager there. We hope that we will grow very fast in Angola. We already have a number of business and partnerships established there.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the growth of CMC África Austral in Mozambique since your establishment?</h4><p><span></span>We started out in the late 1970s but have been here permanently since 1982. Since then, we have changed considerably, as indeed has Mozambique. We are adapting our company to the new Mozambique.</p><h4>CMC África Austral is also present in South Africa, Malawi, and Angola. What is the significance of Mozambique for the overall company strategy?</h4><p><span></span>As the global crisis particularly impacted Europe, especially Italy, the company's focus has shifted to overseas projects. Mozambique remains a key area for two reasons. One is historical, as CMC has been operating here for more than 30 years. The second reason we remain in Mozambique is that liquid natural gas (LNG) is coming online and the country is  experiencing economic development. We are operating in South Africa and have projects in Zambia, Malawi, Lesotho, and Angola. We are about to start in Kenya as well and exploring the market in Swaziland. Yet Mozambique is the key area for CMC and  remains highly important.</p><h4>What are the main projects of CMC África Austral in Mozambique right now?</h4><p><span></span>We have projects with an average value of $60 million and we expect to grow consistently by 50% over the next two or three years. Over the next three years, a lot of LNG-related processes are set to open up. Presently, the composition of our turnover is roughly as follows: 50% infrastructure, 30% quarries and batching plants, and 20% civil works, or buildings and real estate. For obvious reasons, most of the potential growth the company is going to experience will be in infrastructure. Amongst our main projects, we can mention the two roads, Montepuez-Ruaça and Lichinga-Litunde. Still, in the public sector, we will be working in Massingir for the rehabilitation of the dam's bottom outlet, and in Pemba we are building a stadium. It will not perhaps  be comparable to the Bernabeu or the San Siro ones, but it will be a good sports center, and a good way to establish our presence in Pemba. It is our intention to open an office in Pemba, to allow us to closely follow the tenders that will be coming out for the different projects in Pemba and Palma. In Matola we are building the new Coca-Cola factory and in Namialo the production of the sleepers for Vale is ongoing.</p><h4>What is the significance of the commercialization of construction materials that CMC África Austral in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>Around 30% of our business is construction material, meaning aggregates, ready-to-mix concrete and railway sleepers. Again, Palma and Pemba would be the main areas of interest for CMCAA together with other areas such as Nacala, Tete, Maputo, and Quelimane.</p><h4>In terms of industrial construction which companies are you working with besides Coca-Cola?</h4><p><span></span>Historically, we have mostly worked with public sector clients in Mozambique as most of our work was related to infrastructure. Yet today, with the LNG plants, Palma, the Pemba port, Vale, and Coca-Cola much of our future work will most likely be done for private clients.</p><h4>What role does CMC África Austral play in socioeconomic development?</h4><p><span></span>We have witnessed Mozambique grow and develop over the past 30 years. We also experienced the war here, and we have worked on infrastructure projects to help the country rebuild and grow. Over the past 20 years, we have employed on average between 2,500 and 4,000 Mozambicans. Today the figure is at almost 3,000 and is set to rise. I would say that this best exemplifies the modest social contribution we have made in Mozambique.</p><h4>What are your key priorities in Mozambique for the next five years?</h4><p><span></span>We want to register growth of 50% over the next three years and to include private projects in our portfolio. Underpinning this will be our focus on safety, and we are introducing safety systems to Mozambique that we have already deployed in other countries, such as South Africa. We are determined to raise safety standards in Mozambique to international standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-local-force]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company developed since it opened for business back in 2008?</h4><p><span></span>We are a 100% Mozambican company with two shareholders, namely myself and my brother. Since 2008 we have experienced gradual growth, which has proven to be a wise approach. We have provided international freight forwarding, logistics and transport services to a diversity of clients, including certain state enterprises such as FUNAE, MCT and EDM-Electricidade de Mocambique.</p><h4>What are your key strategies over the next two years?</h4><p><span></span>Our underlying objective is sustained growth. We have also been a logistics service provider for Movitel, having undertaken about 90% of its logistics services. We have recently purchased a fleet of large trucks and are set to expand it with four or five additional vehicles. We also undertake all customs clearance and transportation of materials for those mentioned and other main clients, which is a major challenge. Meanwhile, we have successfully finalized negotiations for the transportation of equipment to a gas plant in Ressano Garcia. Additionally, we provide all logistics and transportation services for one of our main clients, ELTEL NETWOKS, which is constructing a high voltage power line from Ressano Garcia to Morrumbene. We are still looking for new opportunities, but our core business is international freight forwarding, global logistics and transportation of any of non-prohibited cargo into and out of Mozambique, as well as in-transit cargo to and from Malawi, Zambia &amp; Zimbabwe via Beira and Cuchamano Border.</p><h4>How many TEUs are you moving a year?</h4><p><span></span>In 2011, the number was at 1,220 TEUs but in 2012 declined to around 800 TEUs. In 2013, we faced substantial losses due to instability in the central provinces of Mozambique, as a result of which we lost significant business, although in 2014, we saw recovery. I believe that we will reach 1.500  containers by the end of the year, while in 2015 the figure will likely double to 2,000 TEUs, mostly due to trans-clearance. For example, while overseas recently we secured a new contract for the transit clearance and transportation of goods in transit via Maputo, alone amounting to about 900 containers, and we have a further 500 to Mozambique to be handled shortly. This single project for the high voltage concession line alone is estimated at 700-800 TEUs, and for the same project we have handled about 150 TEUs already.</p><h4>What sectors do you work more extensively with?</h4><p><span></span>At the moment, we are aiming at local projects with the Mozambican government's Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT). This concerns the improvement of rice and maize production in Maputo Province, Mania Province, Sofala Province, Tete Province and Nampula Province. In general we consider the agriculture, mining, power and energy sectors to see the most prominent growth, naturally, aside from the oil and gas.</p><h4>Which are Mozambique's key trading partners?</h4><p><span></span>South Africa is the biggest in the region, while overseas China is one of the most prominent investors, in addition to India and Vietnam. In Europe, we trade with Portugal among other countries. Two or three French companies are active in the hydroelectric sector and we rank among their service providers. Meanwhile, we also work with Norway and Denmark.</p><h4>What is the potential for Mozambique to become an international hub in Southeast Africa?</h4><p><span></span>The recent discoveries of natural resources like the minerals in Tete, as well as the discoveries of gas and oil, as well as marble, heavy sands, Graphite and other minerals make Mozambique highly attractive, and one of the fastest-growing countries in the region. As long as there is political stability, we expect the economy to experience rapid growth.</p><h4>How would you describe Mozambique's business climate in terms of establishing a new company?</h4><p><span></span>Today's environment is better than when we established our company years ago. Related procedures have been simplified in the wake of extensive reforms the government has implemented to expedite company registration. The Ministry of Trade has been in regular contact with the private sector through the Confederation of Business Associations of Mozambique (CTA).</p><h4>What are your goals for the coming five years?</h4><p><span></span>If business goes according to plan, we intend to rank at least among Mozambique's top ten logistics companies. We plan to purchase around 10 trucks in 2015, which would ultimately reduce our costs and boost profitability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Quality Delivered]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[quality-delivered]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the result of the company's recent restructuring?</h4><p><span></span>In 2013, we were a group of companies operating under the Soares da Costa name, active in the areas of construction, concessions, real estate, and energy. In February 2014, we split the business such that today construction is under Soares da Costa, while the other businesses are under SDC. The main difference is that we have a new shareholder, namely Antonio Mosquito, who is engaged on the construction front. We run construction operations in Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Oman, Romania, and Sío Tomé and Prí­ncipe. Currently, we are focused on construction in Africa.</p><h4>What is the significance of Mozambique for Soares da Costa?</h4><p><span></span>In Africa, Angola is the main market, and Mozambique is in second place. This year we expect a turnover of around $100 million, historically the  strongest performance in Mozambique since the company arrived in 1981. We are now approximating the kind of turnover we see in Angola.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on your project in the Nacala Corridor?</h4><p><span></span>We have enlarged our contract with Vale from $30 million to $60 million. At the beginning of 2014, we were also awarded another construction contract in Nacala a Vella worth $13 million. Vale is our main client in Mozambique, and we are highly committed to the Nacala project. We expect the trains to be up and running through the Nacala Corridor by the end of this year. Our first contract with Vale was to construct new bridges and refurbish old ones. Thus far, we have completed about 50% to 60% of the project. By the end of this year, we expect to have completed about 85%.</p><h4>What is the status of your developments in Tete?</h4><p><span></span>We are close to completing two projects, one being a bridge over the Zambezi River. The bridge itself is already complete, and we are now working to develop access routes. By the end of October, we expect to have opened the new Armando Emí­lio Guebuza Bridge to traffic. Another project we recently undertook involved hooking a VIP Hotel, a Portuguese chain, in Tete up to the grid. The company is one of our most important clients. We have worked with them in Maputo, and we have another ongoing project in Beira.</p><h4>What is your strategy for distinguishing Soares da Costa from your competitors?</h4><p><span></span>We have two different types of business in Mozambique: civil construction, involving hotels, schools, hospitals, and housing; and infrastructure, involving dams, roads, and airports. We are the only company that can run such a wide range of projects, ranging from just $500,000 to $150 million in value. And that is because we have different teams for small and large projects. In our first project in Songo, a village near the Cahora Bassa dam, we built 50 houses for Hidroeléctrica Cahora Bassa, another one of our big clients. This was our fourth or fifth project with it and worth $15 million. The houses were for its technicians. By the end of this year, we expect to receive one or two more projects in Tete. To set ourselves apart from our competitors, we try to be the best among the best. We are a Portuguese company with Mozambican values. We currently have 1,000 employees in Mozambique and last year had 700 employees. Around 8-10% of our employees are expatriates and the rest are Mozambicans. We have board members, engineers, and foremen from Mozambique and run many trainings for Mozambicans. While our labor force is as good as that of other Portuguese and South African companies, our price is cheaper. Secondly, we deliver a good quality service in any work related to concrete or civil construction. We are recognized as one of the best companies in the market for house or office interiors, as well as construction. When construction is nearing completion we put in one or two expatriate foremen only to maintain a high quality level in detailing. We have all the right technologies, experience, and people from Portugal available for African projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide an overview of the operations of Tovisi in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>Tovisi is a construction company that has been operating in Mozambique since 2010. Work began proper in 2011 with a medium-sized energy project for EDM through Portuguese company EFACEC. Since then, we have experienced rapid growth and today have become one of the largest construction operations in Mozambique. The shareholders are 100% Portuguese, but ours is a Mozambican company nonetheless and headquartered locally. And while all construction and operations are in Mozambique, we are expanding to other African countries such as Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p><h4><span></span>What are your main achievements in the Gorongosa dam project?</h4><p><span></span>The Nhandale River Dam is a medium-sized dam located in central Mozambique, in Gorongosa. It was originally studied for water supply, but once we won the project, we transformed it and are now preparing the dam for future energy production connected to the national network as well. Additionally, the dam will bridge both sides of the river. This means that within the same cost at which we won the tender, we will be providing water, power, and transport infrastructure. Construction of this contract of around $10 million has now commenced. We expect to conclude all the works in September of 2015. We are the main contractors, but for the mechanical and electrical components, we will subcontract to other companies,. The project will employ over 200 workers onsite, but on a broader scale, around 10,000 locals stand to benefit from it. Meanwhile, local agriculture also stands to benefit from new water infrastructure that will meet the requirements of the industry.</p><h4>How would you describe your largest project, namely the headquarters of the Ministry of Natural Resources?</h4><p><span></span>We won the project in a public tender early last year. It is a comprehensive contract that includes the procurement of the plot, as well as the design and construction. The design stage, realized by our partner, the architect Ricardo Maia Moura, is now complete and I am confident that our scheme will come to be an architectural icon in Maputo. The project features a 15-story building with a 360-degree tower of glass that changes color. The concept involves a symbolic crystal with interior lighting, the color of which changes to represent the various minerals found in Mozambique, with yellow for lithium, red for ruby, and so on. The scheme will also feature a five-story car park. It depends on several things, but we expect to be able to open the building by the end of 2016. The contract was for $40 million.</p><h4>How do you differentiate yourselves from your competitors?</h4><p><span></span>We aim at differentiation by bringing better quality engineering to our schemes. In terms of our public works, our projects save the government money for investment in new schemes. The prime example of this may be seen in our work on the dam in Gorongosa. We initially had a design solely for the concrete wall and water supply, but later transformed it to increase the volume of retained water by fivefold, within the same budget. That is precisely what we mean by creating value engineering. Meanwhile, we have another major project in Beira, which is a youth resources center with an investment of around $4.5 million. We have already begun work on the three-year project. Being a public sector funded scheme, it is divided into three years. We have already met the targets for 2014, and in March we will start our pursuit of the targets for 2015 and 2016.</p><h4>What are your five-year targets for the Mozambican market?</h4><p><span></span>In terms of construction and real estate, we intend to see a certain measure of growth and will certainly maintain our construction project volume. That being said, we are also investing in other key sectors, such as agriculture and energy, having already established Tovisi Energy. We even have a new education-related project that we intend to start this year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the new Nacala International Airport infrastructure?</h4><p>The project cost was around $250 million. It had to be expanded as there were many adjustments made throughout the project, although the initial estimate was around $130-150 million. There were some substantial changes to the project; for example, while the initial scheme envisaged a rehabilitation of the existing railway, we had to build an entirely new scheme, which required massive investment. Also, we had to expand the facilities to make it a future hub. The inauguration took place on the December 13, 2014.</p><h4>What is your strategy regarding air transport agreements and MoUs to bring traffic into the airport?</h4><p><span></span>We are in talks to partner with certain huge brands. In handling, we will have one of the largest operations in the world and are considering three handling companies. In Maputo, we have the Mozambique Handling Services company (MHS) and are tendering to sell a 51% stake in it, as we want to bring in a strategic partner in order to ensure that we deliver international-standard service. Another strategic partnership will be made with a catering company. Today, the catering company is owned by the airport and Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique, but we have companies interested in a joint venture. We are also considering bringing in an airport operator to partner us in managing the airport as soon as there is a clear strategy and capacity to attract more airlines. We want a dedicated airport operator with a huge capacity to mobilize airlines to Nacala. Currently, we have secured almost 90% of personnel already trained to operate Nacala International Airport. Our company is 100% Mozambican with all Mozambican employees highly trained to international standards.</p><h4>From which countries will people be able to fly directly to Nacala?</h4><p><span></span>Initially, we have Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique securing domestic flights. We have also already secured South African Airlines flights to Nacala. We are quite certain, too, that Ethiopian Airlines and Kenyan Airways will operate flights. Kenyan Airlines is already flying to Nampula and will shift its flights to Nacala, and Ethiopian Airlines is already willing to fly to the north of Mozambique and will be open to flying to Nacala. There needs only to be an update of the bilateral agreement in order for them to fly there. Qatar airlines, TAP, and JAAL will also consider flying to Nacala given that bringing people to Maputo and then traveling two and a half hours to the north is impractical. We also have almost confirmed intentions from Lufthansa, Air France, and Emirates to fly to Mozambique. Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique is entering into a partnership with Air Austral from Reunion because many people from Reunion are also keen to invest in Nacala. The director of ENI Mozambique has shown clear interest in linking Nacala to Milan and Oporto. Also, from Anadarko we have heard that there is a need for flights from Houston to Mozambique. From 2015, there will be a large market linking Asia to Mozambique. Nacala Airport can handle aircraft such as Boeing 747s and 847s, and also Airbus 380s.</p><h4>What are the main competitive advantages of Nacala becoming the main hub on the east coast of Africa?</h4><p><span></span>Nacala has many natural advantages compared with other hubs. Dar es Salaam is very close to Nairobi. And from Nairobi to Nacala is two hours' flight, while Nacala to Johannesburg takes two and a half hours. Secondly, Nacala is located close to a future significant port on the east coast, which is a good combination for a successful hub. Nacala is closer than Nairobi to Singapore, Australia, and other countries, as Nairobi is inland and Nacala is on the coast. Mozambique stands to surpass the GDP of both Tanzania and Kenya over the next 15 years, which will be reflected in air travel statistics. Nacala is closer to the sea than Johannesburg and Nairobi, meaning more savings on fuel at departure and more luggage being carried on departures from Johannesburg and Nairobi. This region represents 120 million people and is growing at an average rate of 5%, while Tanzania and Kenya are at 7%. So as Africa reaches 2.3 billion people by 2050, the area will have almost doubled. In the short run we still need to grow capacity and connectivity in Nacala, and if we do so capacity will surpass that of Nairobi.</p><h4>How would you assess the expansion of the Pemba airport, which was inaugurated in March?</h4><p><span></span>We made a small investment of about $5 million on the runway and terminal to cope with the demand of the next four years, while concluding the plans and construction of the new Pemba Airport. We are at the design and feasibility study phase, and expect to submit proposals for study in 2015.</p><h4>What is your strategy for improving competitiveness among airlines and increasing the number of connections and companies operating in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>Mozambique is growing rapidly, and over the past 10 years international arrivals have grown from 400,000 to around 2.3 million. The airports along the coast are all focused on tourism. We are making airports viable. The government is working with Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique on expansion capable of offering connectivity. Additionally, the strategy for Nacala is to get people to come to Mozambique and from here fly elsewhere. One strategy is to offer rebates for airport fees and air navigation fees for shorter, or regional, flights. We are offering flights from Nacala to Pemba and Nacala to Nampula, for example, at a 50% rebate. That is one of the strategies to position the airport. But it could as easily be done somewhere else. For example, we are launching a tender for the concession of the three airports: Inhambane, Ponta do Ouro, and Bilene.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<title><![CDATA[What’s The Scoop?]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[whats-the-scoop]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Miramar's history in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>Inaugurated in 1999, TV Miramar has been operating on the market for 16 years as part of a communications network that includes Radio Miramar. Nowadays, TV Miramar is a popular communication channel known mainly for its innovative and differentiated character. It is an open signal channel available in all provincial capitals across Mozambique, as well as in Angola through TV Cabo. Miramar can be viewed through main pay television and in Southern Africa via satellite. It is a generalist channel offering a wide range of programs, and has been successful at aggregating and satisfying the needs of a diverse audience.</p><h4>What are some of the investment and development projects in progress at TV Miramar?</h4><p><span></span>At the moment, our focus has been the process of migrating from an analog to a digital signal. This requires a large investment guaranteeing not only the technical aspects of the system, but also the induction of our technicians. Digitalization will ultimately change the way the world watches TV. We have learned from the experiences of neighboring countries that the “digital migration" can be a difficult and lengthy process, although we are ready to face the challenge. We want to guarantee that our channel's differentiation prevails in all aspects linked to the migration. We are also working hard to provide comprehensive news coverage to the capitals and main provinces, and eventually the entire country. Currently, apart from Maputo, news coverage is only available in some of the provinces in the north and the center of the country.</p><h4>How have new social and interactive technologies shaped the way Miramar works?</h4><p><span></span>Social media has considerably changed the way that people consume TV and radio content. As smartphone usage has grown, people are now watching TV and simultaneously commenting on social media about what they see. Miramar has opted to join its viewers on social media, and today we are proud to be the TV station with the highest number of Facebook followers in Mozambique. We recently launched Web TV, enabling our viewers to watch Miramar TV and have access to the latest news in Mozambique, wherever they happen to be in the world. With the link to social media, viewers can also comment on our content and “share" the channel with their friends and followers.</p><h4>How has the profession of journalism been developing in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>Over the past couple of years, we have seen growth in media diversity. Big developments have been realized at the TV networks, as I mentioned, but also elsewhere. In journalism we are concerned with the quality of the product presented to the viewer, and are working to provide information of integrity backed by research and investigation. There are still many improvements to be made in the quality of Mozambican journalism, but we are on the right path.</p><h4>Do you feel confident in the new generation of journalists graduating from Mozambican universities?</h4><p><span></span>Miramar has been accepting interns, and these young journalists usually have a strong theoretical background, although they are not always knowledgeable about the realities of the market. There have certainly been educational developments in the field, but there is still much progress to be made, specifically in teaching practical skills to young professionals. We have not been meeting interns who are absolutely ready to work in the field upon completing their studies, but good efforts are being made with relatively good results if one considers that journalism is a fairly recent discipline in Mozambique.</p><h4>Currently, what are the main challenges journalism faces in Mozambique, and where do you see the industry in 10 years?</h4><p><span></span>Every line of work faces its obstacles, the most relevant for journalists being access to information. An issue of major importance is the centralization of the media. There are improvements to be made in the expansion of coverage in the rural districts. The vast majority of the media tends to concentrate in urban areas covering central themes, and consequently the outer districts are left with little to no news coverage. Despite significant improvements over the past couple of years, there is still a long way to go.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What priorities have you set for Notí­cias in Mozambique for the next two years?</h4><p>Notí­cias is now 89 years old, and was therefore established prior to independence. One of my main focuses is for Notí­cias to be the main opinion maker in our society in educating people, and consolidate our presence nationwide. We also plan to execute a social responsibility project with the government to promote newspaper reading in schools. </p><h4>How would you describe the growth of the newspaper over recent years?</h4><p>The newspaper is growing, and were it possible, I would send it to every household daily, free of charge. Not all Mozambicans have the money to buy a newspaper, but our website does provide the PDF version at no cost. Today, the use of of technology and communication is developing very rapidly not least with the platforms of Facebook, and Instagram, and Notí­cias is already involved in that. Notí­cias is already present on Facebook. There is a platform for newspapers, phones and iPad. I now see how many people read my article when I publish it, and how many people liked it or didn't. New technologies give us access to that type of information and allow us to make strategic management decisions according to feedback from readers. </p><h4>How has interaction with the readership changed journalism in Mozambique?</h4><p>It has changed considerably because journalism is not a solo experience, but dependent upon the needs and wants of readers. Fundamental to it all is the timely and accurate delivery of sourced facts. Meanwhile, we are currently building a studio dedicated to interviews that will appear on our website to bring our readers inside the newspaper.</p><h4>How would you describe the new generation of journalists coming up from the universities in Mozambique? </h4><p>At Notí­cias, we have people with 35 to 40 years of journalistic experience, who did not originally study journalism. On the other hand, we have the newcomers from the university, which together makes for the best of both worlds. Today Notí­cias employs 400 people, almost 150 of whom are journalists. It is my role to be open to newcomers with fresh ideas.</p><h4>What differentiates Notí­cias from other newspapers in the country? </h4><p>Firstly, we are committed to delivering the truth on which our readers can formulate their own ideas on what is happening in Mozambique. The 56 pages of our newspaper represent the country's information source. Secondly, we provide daily information for provinces. Not all newspapers can do this, and those who wish to be informed about the country in general turn to our paper.</p><h4>What is your vision for the company for the next ten years? </h4><p>Notí­cias is not an island, but a sector. Our objective in five, not 10 years, is to launch a TV channel that would ultimately become like the CNN or BBC of Mozambique.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has EXICTOS developed into its current form, and what are your priorities?</h4><p><span></span>EXICTOS began operating in Mozambique with an local office  in 2007. By that time we had around six banks working with our application and software including Millennium Bank, BCI, and certain other smaller players. Then we closed several deals with other banks and helped them undergo the experience of a takeover to become what they are today. We helped them grow and they did the same for us in actual fact. We realized through experience that we are not a service provider, but rather a partner for the banks. Being competitive requires solid products and distribution channels, such as debit cards, credit cards, internet banking, SMS banking, mobile banking, and other  systems. If you want to diversify and compete for clients you must have mobility within your system that allows the banks to create new products as the need arises. Exictos means excellence in consultancy, technology, outsourcing, and software. In the beginning we were seen as a software house. Now we are even providing management consultancy for certain clients. Our new application system is called Banka 3G, which is the core software for the banks, but we also have Financa, Portal Banka Plus and others.</p><h4>How have your available resources evolved in the past years?</h4><p><span></span>At the moment, as an international group, we have 450 employees and 21 people working in the company in Mozambique. We recruited seven more engineers in late 2014-early 2015. We will need more technicians and engineers with more experience. Our major leap in 2015 will be for a team dedicated to utilities. We have an established relationship with the utility companies in Mozambique. We will develop the Exictos Academy next year in order to train them to show our team to sell our products well, and to demonstrate to potential buyers how we can maximize the growth of their businesses. We do not want to be just your service provider, but also your partner in business.</p><h4>How would you assess the potential for further growth of your company over the next five years?</h4><p><span></span>The market is growing at such a rate that it is difficult to get hold of everything. Companies must define a strategy. For us, we have knowledge as well as the specific technologies. It is better for us to develop these specific technologies than to develop new products and engage in other specific jobs we are not used to doing.  We will sell what we have with our partners—products in insurance, ERPs (enterprise relationship products), and the CRMs. We want to develop consultancy management training, and we will open a training room at our facility shortly. At the moment we have a partnership with one of the hotels in town.</p><h4>What is EXICTOS's market share in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>It currently stands at 50%. We rank among the top 25 IT companies in Portugal and work predominantly with banks. We remain the top taxpayer on Madeira Island. The growth we have experienced as a group is quite rewarding for us, and our potential as a group is excellent. Our volume is growing very quickly. We hold 95% of the market in terms of the banks in Angola, for example. We expect to keep growing in client terms. We are working with eight banks at the moment in Mozambique and are starting on our ninth. We are growing at an impressive rate in terms of banks. 2015 will be a particularly good year for us; not only in terms of the upgrades, but also for the banks we are currently dealing with, and the new entities that are calling us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[waste-not-want-not]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the services of your business lines in social and environmental protection?</h4><p><span></span>AMB e Veritas started as a service provider in the quality arena in 2007, but rapidly evolved to provide services in environmental advisory, sustainability, climate change, and management of social projects. The team is comprised of consultants with a high degree of specialization in several environmental and social areas. To complement these services, AMB e Veritas regularly collaborates with the main universities in the country and with renowned experts. AMB e Veritas adheres to its sustainability and social responsibility policy through the transfer of knowledge to young Mozambican university alumni, by offering internships at the company. Our service strategy rests on effective and personalized delivery in a constantly changing society and market.</p><h4>Which sectors can benefit the most from your expertise in sustainability and environmental issues?</h4><p><span></span>The industrial sector is the one we work the closest with; there we help our clients expand their industrial assets, improve competencies, and translate the latest process technologies into workable design solutions. In mining, we support operations throughout the lifecycle of a mine, with expert environmental and sustainability advice and legal compliance work, from start-up of exploration through to rehabilitation plans for mine closures. In this particular sector, we provide environmental monitoring reporting back on the environmental impact of the mine. Energy is also an important sector for us. We have the ability to perform studies and deliver recommendations that help reduce energy consumption and deliver environmentally friendly energy projects, helping create a sustainable future with a smaller environmental footprint. Lastly, transportation is the most challenging sector of all. It involves all of our technical skills—from noise and air quality experts, social experts, resettlement teams, to biological experts.</p><h4>How would you describe the current use of non-hazardous waste in Mozambique, and what solutions can you offer for waste management?</h4><p><span></span>For many years, waste management was not a priority for national leaders. Yet today, with a developing economy, the major cities are concerned by the challenges presented in effectively disposing of waste. And landfills are not the only problem; informal garbage collectors who earn their living at the dumpsites are also a factor to consider. All waste management systems must take into consideration that when dumpsites are closed, these entrepreneurs lose a source of income. One waste management solution could be the creation of Industrial Ecological Parks, with the aim of developing the integrated management of non-hazardous waste. In this approach products or raw materials that can be sold or reused are produced, minimizing their referral to landfills or dumpsites.</p><h4>What are AMB e Veritas's key projects in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>The most challenging project we have participated in to date is the preparation and implementation of a resettlement plan for 1,700 families on a road project between Cuamba and Massangulo, under the supervision of the African Development Bank, where the management of public opinion was successfully achieved. Another interesting project was the environmental impact assessment of the FACIM real estate project in the heart of Maputo that will become an icon of the city. The tall buildings will require coordination not only with MICOA (Environmental Ministry), but also with the Civil Aviation Institute due to potential interference with flight paths. Last but not least, the environmental impact assessment of a 9,300 ha rice plantation and rice processing plant—undertaken with supervision from the International Finance Corporation (IFC)—was also a project where public opinion surrounding water issues had to be managed through a detailed water supply study indicating how, where, and when water would be utilized.</p><h4>What are your main investment and development projects for the near future?</h4><p><span></span>Our main investments are channeled toward developing the training component of the practice in areas related to safety, health, environment, and quality (SHEQ). We recently concluded an agreement to be the NOSA agent in Mozambique and will during 2015 be delivering on the vision of becoming the trainer of choice in Mozambique. In a country with the level of growth that Mozambique is experiencing, it is important that industry be prepared to face the challenges that SHEQ provides by training its employees in accident prevention, and pollution avoidance, and work to worldwide recognized quality standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Some of our flagship projects have been the driving license and motor vehicle system, the voters registration digital system, electronic solutions for the tax authorities, and the Single Electronic Window.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your flagship project, the Single Electronic Window, with MCNet, and its impact on the national economy?</h4><p><span></span>The concept was created in 2009 when the government was looking for companies that could provide services to help them collect external taxes. We were awarded the project and created a new company, Mozambique Community Network, SA-MCNet in 2010 for the design, implementation, finance and operation of the Single Electronic Windows. The product that we designed is a state of the art solution that helps the government to collect taxes from imports and exports in Mozambique. It is for us an honor and a challenge to be part of the team that assists the government execute one of its main challenges, the budget.</p><p><span></span>Since then we have managed all related processes. Mozambique has many challenges that we overcome to deploy the project, such as the quality of infrastructure, the human resources, and the change management process from paper to electronic system, to name but a few. One of our strategies to ensure that the project is successful was to invite the government to be part of the concession. In that sense, we partner with the government instead of merely providing them a service. We where pro-active in terms of business model; we not only offer a product, but bring them to understand its daily challenges in terms of both systems and management of the business itself. The main impact of the Electronic Single Window is increased efficiency in the collection of taxes, and that means that the government will be able to meet its budget targets. Obviously the rest will be the consequence: if the government meets its targets they will be able to build much-needed roads, schools, and hospitals, and provide other public services. These also assist the private sector, the private sector will benefit through the ease of accessing these services. Around 80% of all goods in Mozambique are imported, so without efficiency, prices will rise. Delays in the importation process, increases the logistics and operational costs, which mean that the final product will also be more costly.</p><h4>What are your plans to capitalize on the opportunities that are materializing from the huge international investments taking place in the country?</h4><p><span></span>We have good experience from working on Mozal, Vale and other big projects, so we want to capitalize this experience, by engaging in new partnerships with other organizations to prepare ourselves to be ready for new industries, especially in the oil and gas sector. Our strategy, in order to offer to our clients the best service on time and on budget is to partner with international companies with good records to acquire new knowledge and leverage on their experience.</p><h4>What are Escopil's goals for the coming five years in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>We are working to exceed our clients, partners and shareholders expectation, be relevant in the market, and be a trusted partner who understands the benefits of a win-win relationship. Thinking in this way allows us to understand our limitations and seek the best help. We are investing in knowledge and training for our staff and our partners, importing technology and equipment, improving our business processes and procedures, motivating ourselves and our partners, and constantly identifying areas of improvement to increase our preparedness as we look to the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the status of the drilling and exploration activities in Area 1?</h4><p>
	<span></span>We continued to have one rig active during 2014, both exploring our acreage in the Offshore Area 1 and delineating the incredible natural gas fields already discovered. Our exploration contract with the government of Mozambique began on February 1st, 2007, and when it expires on January 31st, 2015, we will have met all of the objectives we set out to achieve.  Since the first drillship arrived in November 2009, we have been drilling continuously and have discovered an estimated 50—70tcf of recoverable natural gas in the Offshore Area 1, which is extraordinary for deepwater exploration anywhere in the world. We continue to advance these world-class discoveries we have made here and are transitioning toward the development phase of this exciting LNG project. As we move ahead in 2015, we may drill some additional wells, although we won't need another contract for that—we have defined discovery areas inside Offshore Area 1, and have the right to continue appraising and developing those areas beyond the exploration period once we have an approved development plan. Just prior to the end of 2014, a Decree Law took an important step toward establishing a project-wide legal and contractual framework that is expected to deliver a level of stability enabling continued equity investments by the partnership and potential access to significant, limited recourse to project finance capital. We also have an approved environmental impact assessment for the onshore and offshore portions of the development, having completed the resettlement action plan for the Afungi site, which was submitted to the government prior to the end of 2014. Once approved, we will receive the environmental license for the project. The engineering design for both the offshore project and the onshore liquefaction facilities is nearing completion and we expect to be in a position to award those projects in the near future. Marketing is making good progress as we have more than 8 million tons per annum of non-binding LNG off-take agreements in place with customers in premium markets in the Pacific Basin, and we are working on financing packages to that end.
</p><h4>How would you describe the Palma Park investment?</h4><p>
	<span></span>We secured the land and have done some site improvements. It's mainly been a matter of geotechnical work to design the plant, including the offshore and near-shore approach of the pipeline routing and the marine facilities that we need to construct there, as well as a liquefaction facility. We have a fairly large camp today operated by about 150 people. We have approval to start building an airstrip and have focused on the resettlement activities and working with local communities and the government concerning the location of the resettlement sites and issues such as housing design. Our stakeholder engagement efforts in the region have progressed well as our team meets regularly with local villages and leaders to ensure we are openly communicating with the communities, listening to concerns and working to address any issues. We have also established training programs to ensure local communities share in the work opportunities and have the skills necessary to play a role in the development of this project.
</p><h4>What will the production capacity be in the early years?</h4><p>
	<span></span>Currently, the initial phase is for 10 million tons per annum of LNG production from two trains. That requires roughly 14tcf of gas to open the 20-year production life of the project. We can replicate that 3-4 times in size at least given the tremendous scale of resources discovered in Offshore Area 1.
</p><h4>What export markets are you targeting?</h4><p>
	<span></span>We are continuing to secure non-binding agreements in premium markets in the Far East—there is huge demand and growth potential. The substantial projected long-term growth in global demand will probably be focused on China and India in the near future.
</p><p>
	<span></span>As mentioned previously, we have non-binding HOAs for more than 8 million tons. They will be buying energy security for their nations for decades to come; the resources here are such that they can continue signing repeat contracts involving Mozambican LNG. The big players today are Qatar, Australia, and North America—mainly the US—and meanwhile, this project alone is expected to elevate Mozambique to the status of a major global player of notable potential.
</p><h4>How can Mozambique compete efficiently with those markets?</h4><p>
	<span></span>One of the first important steps was the new Decree Law—secondly come the related costs. We think that we have a cost-competitive project here, that competes well with any LNG project in the world. The Decree Law is expected to help with this. Looking at offshore, Anadarko is one of the top two or three most experienced deepwater developers in the world. The quality and production capacity, or deliverability, of the wells is such that a minimal number of wells will produce a significant volume of natural gas for the LNG facilities. The natural gas fields are close to shore, at around a 20-40 kilometers distance, whereby long pipelines are not necessary. The natural gas is high-quality, or sweet, meaning that is contains no H2S, and just minor traces of CO2, whereby the metallurgy is not exotic. This means that the design of the pipelines of the onshore facilities is simpler. Less pre-preparation of gas is required before it goes to the liquefaction plant, reducing costs. We consider the project cost-competitive and a premium asset, which we will send to premium markets, maintaining our cost-competitiveness. This differentiates us from our competitors. And, then there is the sheer scale of the project to consider.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>What role can Anadarko play in the socioeconomic development of Mozambique?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>Standard Bank's socioeconomic study of our project reveals that it will bring tremendous benefits to the country in terms of GDP, job growth, foreign investment and education, among others. The study found that we directly employ around 15,000 people, as construction requires a large workforce. In contrast, the operation of any oil and natural gas facility is not manpower-driven. It takes a high skill-level, but not many people. The EPC contractors will bring in 10,000 or so people, but the real benefits come in indirect and induced labor. The government has plans for power generation and other industrial projects that are directly tied to job growth and so on. The government is committed to maximizing project revenue for the benefit of the Mozambican state. We can help by developing this project and selling to premium markets—mainly in the Far East—paying our taxes to the Government and training Mozambicans to a high skill-level to work on these projects and in the industry as a whole. Our facility in Pemba has resulted in an incredible amount of new economic activity. The port set to be built there will bring in additional investment, and we will manage our drilling activities from there.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>When will the first cargo be ready for export?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>We are well advanced in marketing and have started on the financing, having encountered significant interest. Our project team is ready to move forward. The pace of development will largely be dependent upon continued alignment with the Government of Mozambique, and the speed at which the Government provides remaining permits and approvals.  We are confident that the progress made to date will provide momentum to continue moving this important project forward. The view in the marketplace is that it would genuinely increase the international credibility of Mozambique.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main investment and development plans for your operations in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>In Nigeria we are the leader in providing logistics services to the oil and gas industry. We manage three ports in Nigeria on behalf of the government, namely Onne, Warri, and Calabar ports. In Mozambique, we will be doing the same by operating a logistics base in Pemba in the Cabo Delgado province for the oil and gas industry. We will be supporting the developments which are taking place in Palma to prepare for the development of an LNG plant and for the natural gas to be loaded on vessels for export. In Palma, a 12-train plant will be constructed as part of a multi-billion dollar project. Because of the previous huge discoveries by Anadarko and ENI, the world is now looking at Mozambique's round of bids. The prospects are promising, thereby atracting foreign investors. Consequently, we will offer residential facilities in Palma as well as logistics services. The concept in Pemba, 250km south of Palma, will be similar to the one we have developed in Onne in Nigeria. It may take a couple of years before we reach the same size, but we have already received a concession of 12km by 60km, which is the entire bay of Pemba. Additionally we have acquired an island in the Quirimbas for the people that we will be based in Mozambique, to make life easier. It is important that the government of Mozambique enacts policies, especially on environmental laws.</p><h4>When will you begin construction of your base in Pemba?</h4><p><span></span>In Mozambique we are operating in a joint venture, through a public-private partnership (PPP) with ENH, Mozambique's national gas company. ENH will hold the 51% of the shares while Orlean Invest keeps 49%. The construction of the base starts in 2015, and will be a state-of-the-art development. We will establish a port and shore base, where oil and gas companies would be able to receive cargo. It will be enable companies to receive material such as cement, water, pipes, drilling equipment and drilling chemicals, be they liquid or mud form. The oil industry requires a high level of professionalism to support exploration and production, as well as technical services. We are currently undergoing the environmental impact assessment before project execution. We have clients who have shown keen interest in establishing a base as soon as the Port is ready for operations.</p><h4>What makes Orlean Invest the best company to manage Pemba?</h4><p><span></span>Although we are a small company in terms of associates, we have grown financially. Organisations with sufficient experience and expertise to develop multiple large-scale projects simultaneously, such as Orlean Invest, are rare. We are known for port management, and Pemba will be no exception. We have operated in Rwanda, been invited to open bases in Brazil and Croatia, and have further development plans in Angola.</p><h4>What will be the impact of this base in the north of Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>The socioeconomic impact is immeasurable. The north of the country will develop, thanks to the oil and gas industry, and we will support their operations with the same high standards that we have demonstrated in Nigeria since 1998.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of the Insurance Association in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>The Insurance Association was established in 2003. At the time, there were only five companies associated in the market, and few issues to discuss. Yet over the past three or four years, we have grown to 16 companies, around 10 of which are now members of the Association. We try to present a unified voice for the industry, and yet to date membership is not compulsory although we are working to see that becomes the case in 2015.</p><h4>What are Association's principle industry concerns?</h4><p><span></span>First of all, we would ideally like to see a representative of each company in the market. Secondly, the government is making important revisions to the national insurance legislation. The Association's main area of concern is the final shape of this legislation. From an international point of view, ours has only been a free market for the past 20 years, with legislation left dormant. Insurance legislation has seen two incarnations since 2000, and areas such as worker compensation and the market have regrettably taken separate paths. The Insurance Association has played a vital role in advising the government in aligning the legislation with the reality of the market. One of the issues in Mozambique is that the government does not create funds for compulsory insurance for areas such as worker's compensation or motor insurance. Legislation does stipulate certain types of mandatory insurance coverage, which is taken out from private sector companies, and we are not an endless supply of capital able to guarantee limitless liability. This is precisely where the Insurance Association comes into its own in terms of aligning the expectations of the law with the needs of the private sector. It is also a problem of fiscalization, as there is no reliable data on, say, the percentage of vehicles insured, despite this branch being mandatory.</p><h4>What are the Association's concerns regarding the major energy projects in the north?</h4><p><span></span>A document has been drafted by the supervisory institution in its capacity as consultant to the government, according to the findings of which the government is negotiating with major investors. Generally speaking, the major oil and gas investors want to retain the right to insurance coverage that circumvents the Mozambican system. The government has approached the Ministry of Finance as well as the Insurance Association. In our opinion, it is not only a question of the impact on our industry, but also about protecting our national interests—this is a matter of assets set to be built in this country, but insured elsewhere. It is a contentious issue, and the government needs to arrive at a legal solution. New gas regulations feature a two-point article on insurance where point A almost aligns with our outlook, while point B is a complete contradiction of that position. By accommodating both views neither becomes clearly stated. </p><h4>How do you expect insurance penetration to evolve in the coming years? </h4><p><span></span>Market penetration is at around 2%. We know that we may not yet be strong enough to retain the big risks of the big projects taking place in the country, but we have to start. With time, we can increase our potential. Meanwhile, although Mozambique's GDP is expected to grow by around 6-8%, the bulk of that derives from the major projects being rolled out. Naturally, if we are not involved, our average growth will be negatively impacted.</p><h4>What steps are necessary to raise national awareness of insurance?</h4><p><span></span>It is quite difficult to make people understand the necessity of insurance, and despite many years of work on this, our society lacks a culture of insurance. People forget that insurance is a key element of a growing economy, especially if assets, investments, and capitalare growing, and with them, the inherent risk of loss. Internationally, insurance companies work with reinsurers of sufficient financial weight to be able to mitigate risk. Pemba, for example, is a vital area for Mozambique, where projects seek out the coverage of strong companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Barclays recently embarked on a recapitalization process with an injection of an equivalent of $125 million in September 2014 with the express purpose of repositioning itself for growth, to take a lead role in Corporate Banking, Debt Capital MarketsA (DCM) and advisory mandates in key growth sectors, while growing its Retail franchise in Prestige and Premier Segments. Our goal is to become Mozambique's go-to bank. We aim to be a trusted partner in the economic development of the country and its people. On this journey, we intend to become the employer of choice in the banking sector and build a sustainable and profitable operation.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Mozambican market for Barclays' overall strategy in Africa and worldwide? </h4><p><span></span>Africa is one of the four pillars of Barclays' strategy, as outlined by our Chief Executive Antony Jenkins in May 2014. Barclays Africa Group Limited (BAGL) is the legal entity listed in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange that consolidates the business of Barclays in the continent. At 30 June 2014, we had a market capitalization of $136.9 billion. We operate in 12 countries and have 12 million customers, and total assets of $977.8 billion, 10,749 automated teller machines, 1,287 branches and more than 42,000 permanent employees. Barclays Africa has majority stakes in banks in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania (Barclays Bank Tanzania and National Bank of Commerce), Uganda, and Zambia. It also has representative offices in Namibia and Nigeria as well as bancassurance operations in Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, and Zambia. The creation of Barclays Africa Group gives us a strong competitive advantage. We offer our clients deep local knowledge and presence and the expertise and support of a global bank. As such, we have the ability to play a key role in empowering Africa by reducing the costs of doing business, by providing and enhancing access to the continent, and by being the bridge between local and global markets. Within the continent, Mozambique is one of the key markets for Barclays. It is amongst the countries in which the Group has invested the most in recent years and equally where it expects stronger growth. We believe that in the mid-term Barclays Mozambique can be among the largest businesses of Barclays Africa.</p><h4>How would you describe the business environment in the country for foreign investors?</h4><p><span></span>Mozambique is quickly improving in terms of its business environment and foreign investors have very clear regulations in place and a relatively straightforward process to become established in the country. Mozambique's proximity to South Africa is an important feature when it comes to sourcing inputs and hopefully in the future also as a market for export. The major ports of Mozambique are another important factor, with Maputo, Beira, Nacala, and Pemba being strategically located. The development of services to support your business (banking, legal firms, consulting, accounting and auditing, etc.) is also making life easier for investors. Those coming from abroad appreciate the fact that well-known brands like Barclays are present in Mozambique. The political and regulatory environment has been stable for several years now and despite some uncertainty that always surrounds the electoral periods, we believe that Mozambique offers a unique opportunity for investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<previewsummary><![CDATA[BHP Billiton has decided to focus on five business lines, and is withdrawing from aluminum. How will this impact the company?In August 2014 BHP Billiton announced its plans to demerge its aluminum, manganese, and nickel and silver businesses along with some of its coal assets.  Subject to board and shareholder approval, there would be a new company operating these assets under the name of South32, and Mozal will become quite a significant part of it. South32 will operate in five countries and be staffed by approximately 24,000 people. The business will then transition from a commodity-based structure into a regional-based entity, and Mozal will report to the African regional office located in Johannesburg. The new company will have a dedicated board and management team with a significant representation at the Johannesburg office, which will be greatly beneficial for Mozal.How would you describe the evolution of Mozal's contribution to GDP?Since the company was established in 2001, Mozal has continued to play a prominent role, contributing around 7% to GDP. We recently won an award from President Guebuza in recognition of this contribution. Currently, Mozal produces just below 570,000 tons per annum of primary aluminum ingot, with production entirely destined for export, mainly to Europe, the primary market for Mozal's metal output.What are your plans to support the domestic use of aluminum?There has been a spiking development in Mozambique's downstream industry. There was no other local market established until the development of Midal. We began delivering to Midal in October 2014 and once they ramp up their operations, we will be delivering 50,000 tons of metal per annum. Businesses can now be established downstream of Midal, creating an increased diversity of products in the downstream industry, while a unique service industry will also develop around Midal. I expect our relationship with Midal to be long term and sustainable for many years to come. The sizeable tonnage of aluminum that company will be receiving from us will be a major catalyst for the downstream industry.How would you categorize the significance of Mozal in other sectors?Mozal has played a significant role in infrastructure development, with road-access projects and a new port facility. For example, Mozal imports more than one million tons of alumina per annum through the port, which is then brought to the site by trucks. We also transport the entirety of our final product through the port, which is a considerable contribution to the transport industry.In addition to that, we continue to perform road maintenance even though it was not a part of our initial undertaking. We also direct around $2 million per annum toward our community work, some of which has gone into the construction of schools. To date we have built nine primary schools, a secondary school,  a technical school, and a maintainer-training center.What challenges do you foresee over the next ten years for Mozal?One major challenge will be electricity supply. We have managed to cope with this so far by working closely with ESKOM and focusing on our productivity and operational efficiency to get more out of the available infrastructure. We have made good progress and have implemented a system we call Maximum Technical Capability. The other challenge is with commodity prices. This has been a challenge over the recent period, although Mozal has been effective with regards to cost cutting, as we have been able to focus extensively on efficiency. We also pay considerable attention to skills. All of the potential development in the country and the exploitation of its resources will result in a great need for a skilled workforce, which will present a challenge for the entire industry. 6]]></previewsummary>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Autogás was created in 2008, but what was the motivation behind it and how has the company developed in the intervening years?</h4><p>Autogás was created by a group of Mozambican entrepreneurs following a study confirming that the use of natural gas for vehicles in Mozambique was a viable concern. It is a PPP that from the public sector features the Institute for the Management of State Holdings (IGEPE) and state-owned petroleum product distributor PETROMOC, and from the private sector a consortium called INDICO ENERGIA SA. The initial days of Autogás operations were challenging as people, unaware of the potential use of natural gas in vehicles, were reluctant to change. Only after several years of proven experience with private sector public transportation with the so-called “Xapas" vehicles, the public began to have faith in the project. The project has a tremendous impact on the national economy by rendering transportation cheaper for the general public, while helping to reduce pollution.</p><h4><span></span>What does the conversion of private commercial vehicle engines to natural gas utilization entail?</h4><p><span></span>The conversion of petrol vehicles to CNG is simple and is basically done by inserting a T connection in the inlet pipe of the engine. This connection allows the supply of natural gas or petrol controlled by a butterfly valve operated by a switch activated at the driver's discretion. By doing this the vehicle can run either on petrol or CNG, therefore allowing the vehicle to use CNG, while within the range of CNG filling stations, but continuing to run on petrol in other circumstances.</p><h4>What are the benefits of such a conversion?</h4><p><span></span>The immediate advantage of converting vehicles to CNG is paying only approximately 40% on fuel bills compared with petrol and enjoying between 50% to 60% savings. The advantages do not end there. Natural gas burns completely and therefore does not produce carbons that petrol or diesel engines do. This means that the maintenance periodicity on natural gas vehicles can be extended reducing the number of maintenance services over time and extending the life of the engine. Moreover, natural gas pollutes far less than other fuels. The savings on pollution are so high that certain cities today are only allowing natural gas vehicles in their public transport fleets to mitigate currently high pollution levels. In the case of Mozambique there is one extra reason for using natural gas, namely that as it is available and produced locally, by using CNG we are using our own fuel and substituting imported fuels with our own gas, which improves our economy by reducing the importation costs and ensuring greater control on fuel prices.</p><h4>How many natural gas vehicles are currently in operation in Mozambique and how do you expect the number to evolve over the next five years?</h4><p><span></span>The number of vehicles running on CNG in the cities of Maputo and Matola today is growing rapidly, and it is forecast that in 2020 approximately 30,000 vehicles will be using natural gas in Mozambique.</p><h4>How many filling stations does Autogás have? What are your strategies to expand the station network nationwide?</h4><p><span></span>Currently, Autogás has opened five CNG filling stations with a further 12 stations projected for the next five years. Mozambique has a fleet of about half a million vehicles, of which around 67% run in the greater Maputo area. It is, therefore, expectable that the focus of filling station network expansion will meet demand in this area and only then start gradually expanding throughout the rest of the country.</p><h4><br>What types of partnerships are you looking for to further develop this project?</h4><p><span></span>Autogás has achieved profitability with this project and is now looking to replicate the experience by expanding its filling station network to increase the business volume. This requires substantial investment and Autogás is seeking serious partners to share the opportunity. Affordable capital for investment is the main priority, but options for equipment leasing, or an optional share for strategic CNG equipment producers may also prove interesting.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2020?</h4><p><span></span>Autogás aims to continue introducing financially feasible natural gas filling stations that will supply over 300 million equivalent liters of natural gas in 2020.<span></span></p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the motivation behind creating Mozambique Previdente?</h4><p>Mozambique Previdente was created in 2012, and started operations in 2013. The basic idea was to provide better pensions to the public in general. We have our national social security schemes that provide just the basics. The idea was to create a private pension fund for those able to save and start investing in their own private pension fund schemes. We started the company with a shared capital of $800,000 in cash, and our total investment rose to around $1.5 million.</p><h4>How would you assess your first year of operations?</h4><p>We started strongly and in our first year we started managing three funds and have three more in the pipeline. We started managing assets on a base of almost $1.5 million and ended the year on asset growth of almost $1 million to $2.5 million. In 2014 we wanted to grow not only in asset terms, but in terms of client base, which we expanded by 50%. We are also now branching out in terms of companies, and today have private and semi-private companies. We expect to grow by at least 20% in 2015 in terms of client base. And in terms of assets, we want to start investing more in properties and infrastructure in the country.</p><h4>What is the profile of Previdente's main clients?</h4><p>Due to our shareholder structure we work more with state-owned enterprises. But one of the recent clients that we signed is a private sector entity. Our strategy is to first tackle the state-owned enterprises and then reach out to the general public. Emose is not only a shareholder but also our main partner. We provide all clients with a full range of pension fund schemes, in terms of defined benefit, defined contribution funds, and hybrid funds. We want to provide a complete range of benefits coupled with the pension funds, including medical, life insurance and funeral benefits. The law also allows us to put in home loans for the members of pension funds. We expect in 2015 to provide a more comprehensive range of products.</p><h4>What will be the impact of Previdente on the local capital markets?</h4><p>We expect to rank among the top ten players in the market. The law that allows the creation of pension funds also provides for investment maximum limitations, where for example, we can invest in government bonds up to 100%. This shows the direction that the government wants to take us in. We are now investing more in the money markets, but we expect to start investing in property very soon, once our asset value grows. And unlike other players,  we bear limited risk and have greater cash flow, and can look at a broad range of projects. The region hosts the Retirement Funds Africa, which is an entity that tries to regulate and instill best practices across the region. At one of the conference we attended, it was discussed that we as Pension Funds need to look a bit more into new companies (entrepreneurs, SMEs, etc.) and invest in them. This will boost the job creation and further promote the country development with new jobs.</p><h4>As a young company, how would you describe the environment for startups in the country?</h4><p>The situation has been improving year by year, but there are still challenges to overcome regarding legislation, as fiscal and financial regulation is demanding. Yet once the government appreciates the new business opportunities arising and new businesses being created, it may amend legislation to ease up the playing field. I expect the new government to encourage foreign investment, but also to put local content in place and have locals working hand in hand to develop these new resources. We need to have well-established platforms for transfer of knowledge from foreign companies to locals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is MHL's role in the improvement of Mozambique's transport and logistics infrastructure through the operations of Anfrena?</h4><p>MHL, through Anfrena, has been collecting road tax from foreign-registered vehicles entering Mozambique at all border posts, on behalf of the National Road Authority (ANE) and Fundos de Estradas. The funds are utilized by ANE for the maintenance of national highways. Anfrena promoted the idea of road maintenance being paid for by road users, rather than out of the national budget, and hence the conversion of arterial roads into toll roads with maintenance realized through toll road concessions. Thus, limited government resources can be better channeled to new road infrastructure, rather than maintenance. </p><h4>What are your strategies to increase the penetration of water systems throughout the country with Afrodrill?</h4><p>Providing adequate drinking water infrastructure was essential for the implementation of the government's post-civil war rural socio-economic development plan. More than scarcity of resources, successful implementation of the project in rural areas was a challenge since relevant companies were ill-equipped for rural areas. We saw an opportunity to establish our presence in those areas and integrate into the rural services supply chain. Afrodrill was created to cater to such requirements with permanent self-reliant base camps in key centers. Today Afrodrill is an essential element of the National Rural Water Development Program in planning and implementation, and accounts for over 50% of the program. </p><h4>How would you describe your rubber cultivation project and similar MHL ventures in agriculture?</h4><p>Since we have a strong rural presence through Afrodrill, expanding into agriculture was a naturally synergistic diversification. We acquired 10,000 acres of land in Lugela, Zambezia, and involved the Rubber Board of India to pioneer rubber cultivation in Mozambique. We have cleared and prepared an area of 1,000 acres and put in place an irrigation system and developed a nursery for 100,000 plants annually with the help of Jain irrigation of India. To balance cash flows, we are also experimenting with commercial cultivation of black pepper, turmeric, and ginger, and are developing a nursery based on tissue culture even though these crops are new to Mozambique, hence considered high risk. We are optimistic that it will open up new avenues for Mozambican farmers with high yielding crops and we can provide the technology and infrastructure.</p><h4>Which industries present the greatest potential for company growth and what are your strategies to achieve this?</h4><p>We perceive considerable potential in the engineering sector. Mozambique is moving fast into resources development, and port, road, and real-estate infrastructure has to keep pace. There are few Mozambique-based EPC contractors engaged in port terminal construction and petroleum downstream distribution infrastructure. We have created knowhow and skill levels and our team has already rehabilitated and expanded the handling capacity of the Matola Fuel Terminal from 1 million tons annually to 8 million tons. We have introduced LPG and bitumen terminals to Maputo and Beira Ports for the first time, to import LPG and bitumen via sea rather than through trucking from South Africa. We constructed pipelines and fuel storage tanks for Petromoc in Beira, the fuel terminal and storage tanks for Vale in Moatize, as well as LPG and bitumen storage tanks and heated pipeline in Maputo and Beira. Overall, we foresee a bright future for our engineering and EPC contracting operations in Mozambique's port and petroleum downstream infrastructure sector.</p><h4>How is the business climate, and what of foreign interest?</h4><p>The government of Mozambique, through the Center for Promotion of Investments has streamlined the compliance formalities for investors and government systems, which are by and large investor friendly. Since the country has vast resources in agriculture, fisheries, mining, tourism, and the services sector yet to be exploited, business opportunities exist in resources development for corporate and individual investors. Investors from Portugal, Brazil, and Asia are already taking this opportunity. </p><h4>What is your 10-year outlook for Mozambique?</h4><p>The coming decade will be critical for the development of Mozambique, since it is imperative for increased revenue from accelerated domestic output to reduce dependence on external contribution to its expenditure budget. Hence, the national plan for resource development and bringing more of the population into formal economic activity, as well as domestic production, has to be on track with adequate investment and human resources to ensure its success. Systems and people are in place to ensure success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key strategies of BCI in Mozambique for the next few years? </h4><p>One of our main goals for the next couple of years is to become one of the preferred banks in Mozambique. We are present in all market segments: corporate, private, and retail banking. We also aim to become a leading bank in the broader development of Mozambique, and not only as a commercial institution, but also as a bank with a key role in the bankarization process of rural areas, a bank that truly understands the needs of its Mozambican clients. Another key strategic objective is to grow and gain a competitive position within the market. Our last strategic plan was designed to run from 2007 to 2015, and has just been renewed. In 2014 we grew by around 33%, and reached more than 1 million clients?</p><h4>How would you assess your current penetration of rural areas? </h4><p>BCI has been closely involved in the bankarization process, for which the year of 2014 was quite significant. Since the middle of the year, we entered many unbanked districts around the country. There are still 60 such districts across the country. In general we tend to enter with a regular branch. A second initiative was the launching of mobile units, and now we have two of these operating in the provinces of Nampula and Tete. We have also expanded through the use of remote ATMs that can provide access to banking and liquidity in those areas. We are also developing mobile agents with the support of the central bank that will deliver services in other areas not being covered. We are therefore designing alternative means of creating solutions for clients in locations where we cannot, at least for now, open a traditional branch. We combine the use of mobile services that allow transactions to be done by phone, with an agent network. </p><h4>BCI has recently signed an agreement with CGD Group and Medical Doctor's Professional Association. What is your assessment of these partnerships?</h4><p>We have launched an agreement with CGD Group to develop a network between Mozambique, Angola, and South Africa. This will become increasingly important in the near future. The main purpose behind it is to develop relationships between those countries and for us to be present with matching objectives as a group that can support all needs. With Ordem dos Médicos de Moçambique (OrMM) we have developed special conditions for medical doctors. We are already doing this with other sectors.</p><h4>How is BCI capitalizing on the construction and real estate boom? </h4><p>We are mainly supplying the need for offices for new companies coming in and the needs of a very small part of society. One of the main areas that will develop in the near future is the real estate business. We have created a desk dedicated to real estate and infrastructure, a highly specific business.</p><h4>How will the entry of new players in the financial market affect your operations?</h4><p>There are new banks and insurance companies entering the market, which is a normal development, and we are well placed to address the competition. The financial market is highly concentrated in Mozambique, and such entrants are a natural part of its development. We are aiming for growth of 7-8% in 2015 and there is sufficient business to be had by all players. We are also the only bank present in the south and north, in what may be termed the extremes of the country. We opened 11 branches in December and in 2014 we opened 34 new branches. </p><h4>What is main factor behind your success? </h4><p>Hard work is the key factor, as we are utterly committed to our objectives and fulfilling our clients' needs. We are also innovative and dynamic, and will not rest on our laurels, but continue to cater to the banking needs of this enormous country. The people, companies, and institutions of Mozambique can count on BCI for the coming years in this development process.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Banco de Moçambique play to meet the demands of a resource rich economy?</h4><p>Macroeconomic management is a challenge in a country rich in natural resources. We propose better options regarding the use of assets derived from natural resource exploration and monitoring of external debt. We promote the balanced use of monetary and foreign exchange market instruments to ensure absorption of liquidity deriving from external resources inflows.  We want to see an increase in the participation of key enterprise sectors in the stock exchange, so we foster actions aimed at revitalizing the capital market. Additionally, through subsidized loans, the Banco de Moçambique facilitates increased productivity in sectors with high wealth and employment potential as well as supporting diversity in the economy by backing micro, small, and medium enterprises. We want to deepen risk-based supervision and Basel II principles and contribute to the creation of a private credit management information center.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the evolution of macroeconomic  and financial  indicators in Mozambique? </h4><p>Inflation has been low and under control. Though it increased to 2.95% in 2013 from 2.18% in 2012, it dropped to 1.1% in 2014. The Banco de Moçambique has been implementing an aggressive monetary policy, which maintains positive real reference interest rates contributing to a stable exchange rate and the constitution of international reserves. Last year the metical depreciated against the dollar by 5.5%, after 1.5% depreciation in 2013. Net international reserves are on the rise, increasing from $2.605 million in December 2012 to $2.882 million in December 2014, which represents four months of imports of goods and non-factor services. The GDP is not being subdued and has been growing at average rates greater than 7% over the past five years.</p><h4>From your recent visit to Beijing, how would you describe the possibilities for cooperation with the People's Bank of China? </h4><p>There is great potential to expand our cooperation with the People's Bank of China. Both banks signed a Memorandum of Understanding to promote mutual efforts in various domains, including banking and financial supervision, research in areas of mutual interest, and capacity building of staff in the banking sector. During the visit, our delegation held meetings with entrepreneurs from many business fields in China, who expressed their interest in cooperation between the two countries.</p><h4>What are Banco de Moçambique's strategies for improving accessibility to banking services in rural areas?</h4><p>The Mozambican Government and the Banco de Moçambique have taken a number of measures to increase access to financial services and products. We have updated the Law of Financial Institutions to work towards increasing the total number of financial institutions and to improve the classification system, especially for micro-bank and micro-finance operations. Since 2007 we have initiated various incentives to support the opening of institutions in districts deprived of bank representation, for example a lowering of the minimum capital. The Banco de Moçambique has become a member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. In a study on costs of financial intermediation, we found them to be high compared to countries in the region. To reverse the situation Banco de Moçambique adopted a notice in June 2009, which establishes a common nomenclature on commissions and bank charges and encourages better definition of policies and makes transparent costs and conditions underlying financial products and services, as well as a definition of a set of minimum free services. Since the beginning of the financial sector deepening program, the impact of these measures appears to be significant. From a group of 12 banks, 274 bank agencies, 83 micro-credit operators and territorial coverage of 34 districts in 2007, there were 18 banks, 572 bank agencies, 285 micro-credit operators and 69 districts covered by banking services in December 2014.</p><h4>Financial education is a key factor in the strategy for the development of Financial Sector 2013-22. How is the Banco de Moçambique acting to promote dissemination of knowledge and protect consumers?</h4><p>To respond to an increasing need in Mozambique for consumer protection population and for financial services and products in general, in October 2014 we launched the Banco de Moçambique Financial Education Program (PEFBM). The program will be implemented in two phases, 2014-16 and 2017-22. It will involve a number of strategic actions involving government entities, media partners, commercial banks and financial institutions, in general, as well as the national and international partners committed to this cause.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Pemba will play a strategic role in the development of the LNG project in Cabo Delgado. How will the city change to support this industry?</h4><p><span></span>Pemba is developing faster than ever, so we need to improve our infrastructure in order to address the resulting pressures. Investment in Pemba is needed for roads, hospitals, and other infrastructure. We are finishing our development plan for Pemba, and are excited about the changes that will occur over the coming decade. We know that the oil and gas industry will bring about some unexpected challenges, which is why we are trying to be as prepared as possible. Around $200 million is being invested in the port, and we are still in discussions about the new airport.</p><h4><span></span>What will be the impact of the Port of Pemba once finished for the city and the country at large?</h4><p><span></span>Ports represent a good opportunity for us, and for all investors, supporting smaller industries, and helping to develop the construction industry too. With all of the indirect effects the construction of the port will have, I believe the project will transform the city and the region. We have been working to attract more investors to build hotels and supermarkets, and we have a South African group that will start to build a huge mall here in April.</p><h4><span></span>What is your strategy for attracting such investors to Pemba?</h4><p><span></span>We are finishing our development plan and are trying to promote the city, while also helping investors to acquire land. We are working to provide better incentives because investors must be given solid reasons for investing in an area, and we are looking into reducing taxes, among other strategies.</p><h4><span></span>Last year Pemba was twinned with the Portuguese city of Sines. What can the two cities learn from each other? </h4><p><span></span>Sines was originally a small village, but expanded rapidly as a result of the oil boom. Pemba will be the same, as while it remains small, we can see how it will grow in the future. We can learn many things from Sines to avoid making mistakes that they may have been made in the past, and we are fostering close dialogue between the two municipalities.</p><h4><span></span>Besides the oil and gas industry, what would you say are the sectors set to grow the most in Pemba over the coming decade?</h4><p><span></span>The tourism sector is an area to watch. I also believe that a network of SMEs from different sectors will be created to support the larger firms, and foresee much growth in industry in the region.</p><h4><span></span>With tourism representing an important part of the economy, how will you ensure that projects do not negatively impact the environment?</h4><p><span></span>We are acutely aware of the challenges presented by such rapid growth. Tourism is a key part of Pemba's development, which is why there are local and regional regulations to avoid environmental damage. We are encouraging investors to build eco-friendly projects and to minimize adverse effects on the natural environment.</p><h4>What are some of the larger projects you will undertake in Pemba over the next five years?</h4><p><span></span>We want to provide transport infrastructure such as roads, but also to increase the level of water and electricity supply. There will be considerable development of these utilities in the near future. In addition, we are planning to construct a new dam. We are finishing the initial design drafts, and hope to have these complete by July. The dam is to be constructed on the Megaruma and Lúrio rivers, and will supply both water and hydroelectric power to the area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of economic ties between Vietnam and Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>On 26 May 2015, Vietnam and Mozambique celebrate the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations. We will also share the joy of commemorating the 40th anniversary of Mozambique's Independence and 40 years of Vietnam's national reunification. Looking back at our journey over the past 40 years, we have witnessed rapid developments in our bilateral relations in almost all areas, from trade, investment, and agriculture to culture, education, science, and technology. The two countries have established a sustainable cooperation framework through the signing and implementation of various agreements.</p><h4>In its cooperation with Mozambique, agriculture plays a significant role. What programs will you be supporting in this sector?</h4><p><span></span>Agricultural cooperation projects at a governmental level, between provinces and following the 2+1 model, have brought about tangible benefits and transformed lives in many Mozambican rural areas. In agriculture, Vietnam is keen to cooperate and share experience with Mozambique in the latter's Food Security Strategy. In recent years, Vietnam has sent hundreds of agricultural experts to many Mozambican provinces. We have also hosted Mozambican agricultural experts, technicians, and students in Vietnam for visits or study tours. In the years to come, the two countries will continue to implement the “Cooperation of Research and Development of Food and Foodstuff Crops in Mozambique" project signed in 2013 and aimed at improving capacity in R&amp;D regarding food and crops, developing production models for sustainable and high-productivity rice and crops in some areas of Mozambique, and training human resources.</p><h4>In the field of telecommunications, Movitel is a successful Vietnamese joint venture in Mozambique. What is the significance of this investment for the socioeconomic development of Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>This joint venture between Viettel and the SPI Mozambique is a bright light in bilateral investment relations. With 4 million subscribers, Movitel, the second largest mobile network in Mozambique has already covered 85% of the population, making significant contributions to the development of IT infrastructure. It has narrowed the gap between rural and urban areas and promoted the socioeconomic development of Mozambique. By upholding a development philosophy of associating business with social responsibility, Movitel has made active contributions to Mozambique's education by providing free internet for 2,500 schools. Movitel is also involved in e-government projects to enhance citizen access to public administrative services.</p><h4>In 2014, Mozambique and Vietnam renewed the Protocol on education. What are its key points?</h4><p><span></span>Education is a traditional area of cooperation between Vietnam and Mozambique. From 1980 to 1990, together with medical and agricultural experts, Vietnam sent hundreds of educational professionals to Mozambique, and they were well received. After many years living and working in Mozambique, many today consider it to be their second home. Besides, the two sides have paid due attention to tertiary education. During the visit to Vietnam by the Minister of Education of Mozambique Augusto Jone Luí­s, the two countries signed a new Protocol on cooperation in education (June 2014). Accordingly, since 2014, Vietnam and Mozambique have increased scholarships for students of both countries.</p><h4>How would you describe the business climate in Mozambique for Vietnamese investors?</h4><p><span></span>Over the past 10 years, Mozambique has been successful in reforming its economy. As a result, it has become one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. Ongoing government commitments such as improving the legal framework for investment and taxes and applying information technologies in customs and administrative procedures have turned Mozambique into an attractive destination for foreign investors, including those from Vietnam. Meanwhile, Mozambique's seaport system is a gateway for trading companies to penetrate major land-locked markets in the region such as Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p><h4>Besides telecommunications, agriculture, and education, which economic sectors hold the greatest potential for commercial relations between Mozambique and Vietnam?</h4><p><span></span>In addition to telecommunications, healthcare, agriculture, and education, both countries have huge potential, and we need to increase cooperation in trade, investment, sea shipping, construction, science, and technology. These are the areas on which ministries and agencies from both sides agreed for the cooperation roadmap at the 3rd Meeting of the Inter-governmental Committee in Hanoi last June. Besides bilateral trade, both countries should strive to become a gateway for the other to access and penetrate different markets in the South African Development Community (SADC) and ASEAN. Our bilateral relations are built on solidarity and mutual support. I am convinced that the friendship and multifaceted cooperation between Vietnam and Mozambique will continue to blossom, bringing more tangible benefits to and meeting the expectations of the two peoples.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Mozambique is a country brimming with dynamism that is now working to transform itself to rest at the very heart of Japan's business with Africa. Mozambique is home to one of the largest natural gas fields in the world and one of the largest coking coal fields in Africa. I am firmly convinced that cooperation between Mozambique, blessed with an abundance of resources, and Japan, with its highly advanced technological capabilities, will without any doubt result in greater wealth for both nations.</p><p><span></span>Bountiful resources and the wealth to be acquired through their use are Mozambique's very own treasure. The benefits must be shared by the Mozambican people and mobilized to engender sustained growth and improvements in the daily lives of the people. Japan's public and the private sectors can be of assistance in bringing this about. A good example of this is Mozal aluminum smelter, which through the participation of the Mitsubishi Corporation has now become the largest industry in the country. With technical transfers to the smelter site, Mozal has generated direct employment for more than 1,000 people and indirect employment, including in peripheral industries, for more than 10,000, and returns profits to the community through social activities in the local area. This is what occurs when Japanese corporations invest.</p><p><span></span>Mozambique is able to secure technologies through commercial relations with Japanese corporations. It promotes the development of industries through its own efforts, and a large number of Mozambicans enjoy the benefits of growth. It is for these reasons that the government of Japan makes use of ODA and other types of public finance and makes contributions in cooperation with private companies.</p><p><span></span>First of all, Japan will contribute to human resources development. In order for the people of Mozambique to develop resources, foster industries utilizing those resources, and take environmental countermeasures through their own efforts, Japan will support human resources development by assisting over 300 people over the next five years, through the African Business Education Initiative for Youth (the “ABE Initiative") announced at the International Conference on African Development (“TICAD V") and the “Development Initiative Based on Natural Gas and Coal."</p><p><span></span>It is also important that the development of resources does not give rise to economic disparities among local areas, or environmental issues. Japan will provide comprehensive assistance of approximately 70 billion Japanese yen ($585 million) over the next five years, with a view to advancing development centered on the Nacala Corridor region. We will strengthen our support for infrastructure development, including among other areas roads, ports, and electricity, as well as for education, health, and related areas from the perspective of human security.</p><p><span></span>If we combine Mozambique's efforts, including further improvements to the investment environment, with the support of Japan's public and private sectors, we will be certain to build a relationship as partners that contribute to growth in both countries.</p><p><span></span>At TICAD V, I made an appeal to the Japanese people, saying, “Now is the time to invest in Africa." The Japanese economy is now experiencing a strong revival. I would like to say to the people of Mozambique and of Africa, “Now is the time to choose Japan as a business partner."</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most innovative services that you have created to support new companies entering Mozambique?</h4><p>First of all we had to establish ourselves in each of the country's 11 provinces to widen the scope of our institutional assistance to investors, and secondly we had to equip our institution with appropriate human and technical resources. These were the most important steps that we have successfully taken. Thirdly, we had to improve our relations with other institutions involved in the process of attracting investment, as well as with relevant government ministries who have a strong say in the process of investment approval, such as the Ministries of Agriculture, Interior, Labor, Environment, Finance, and Mineral Resources. The government also recently approved a new investment promotion strategy to be implemented over the next three years, which is expected to substantially increase the investment flow into the country.</p><h4>What are the most common concerns of and challenges faced by international companies upon entering the market? </h4><p>I would identify the rather limited development of basic infrastructure in rural areas, as well as a low level of scientific literacy and professional training, inadequate electrical power distribution, and susceptibility of certain productive processes to international price fluctuations.</p><h4>What would you say are the most significant large-scale projects set to take place in the country in the near future, and how will they impact the broader economy? </h4><p>One of the largest forthcoming investment projects is the LNG plant set to cost some $30 billion. This project is to be developed in the Rovuma basin, in northern Mozambique, with the first exports due to start in 2018. There are other large-scale projects associated with gas exploration in the Rovuma basin, such as setting up a container terminal, a pipe-coating plant, a shipyard, bunkering, an LNG receiving terminal, a fertilizer plant, and gas to liquid (GTL), and dimethyl ether (DME) facilities. In addition, CPI recently approved investment projects worth more than $7 billion, mainly in hydro, coal, and gas power plants. The investment will also cover the development of the northern ports of Pemba and Palma, where a giant logistics base and LNG production plants are planned, which will use gas produced from offshore fields in the Rovuma Basin being developed by US oil major Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Italy's ENI. These projects will have a major impact on the entire economy directly or indirectly through their contribution to GDP, and the creation of employment, especially in Pemba and Palma. Moreover, Mozambique will enjoy much higher international visibility as one of the most important producers and exporters of natural gas. Mozambique's economy is already growing at 7.5% annually. In the medium term, as a result of the LNG plant and other megaprojects in the mining sector, the economy is expected to see acceleration of 9%, or even 10%.</p><h4>What sectors and regions have you identified as having the greatest potential for growth?</h4><p>Each of the three main regions of the country—the south, center, and north—are prime investment destinations. The sectors with the greatest potential include agriculture and agro-industry, construction and public works, mineral resources and energy, services, transport and communications, and tourism.</p><h4>How would you describe the current business environment in the country? </h4><p>It is healthy, as we remain one of the most stable countries in the region, both socially and politically. Dialogue in our society is the order of the day. All institutions mandated to assist investors are functioning properly and in concordance with laws in force in the Republic of Mozambique, and in a well-coordinated manner. Legal instruments have undergone major reforms. These include business licensing, fiscal, investment, and labor laws. And meanwhile, infrastructure such as ports and railways, energy and water supply, roads and bridges, telecommunications, and airports are being upgraded.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Mozambique's progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)?</h4><p>Mozambique's progress has been steady, but uneven. In some areas, such as education, gender equality and to some degree health, progress has been substantial. For example, enrolment rates in primary education have risen steadily over the past 15 years. Completion rates could use improvement, but gender parity in education has also increased to almost 50%. There is always room for expansion and improvement, specifically in enrolment rates, and there are still efforts being made to open more schools in remote areas. We have seen child mortality MDGs being met in the health sector, and though maternal mortality rates have been decreasing steadily, from 650 to 100,000 down to 400, Mozambique probably will not reach the MDG goal of close to 200. In general, progress has been slow in the area of communicable diseases; malaria still remains a serious problem. Between 1995 and 2006, there were substantial strides made in the reduction of absolute poverty, but over the past 10 years progress has slowed. In 2000 the rate of poverty was close to 60%, and 15 years later it has been reduced to around 50%.</p><h4>More than three quarters of the population are involved in agriculture, but this sector contributes only about one quarter to GDP.  How can the government transform this sector from subsistence farming to a more efficient and productive agro-industry?</h4><p>Agriculture has actually been growing reasonably well at 4-5% per year over the past 10 years, but it needs to grow faster. The challenge is to bring in more commercially oriented small farmers. To some degree, the government needs to provide knowledgeable services to the farmers, and locate market opportunities. While private enterprise is the best estimator of sustainable economic activity as opposed to government estimates of where comparative advantages exist, there needs to be a matching of private sector investment with ancillary service support from the government. Mozambique relies on intermediary smaller farmers, which is a model we see working worldwide. The best model is one in which farmers can form associations with training and governmental support such that in negotiations and partnership forming with large enterprises they maintain equal status. To increase access to markets, farmers need more tertiary rural roads and perhaps the establishment of more rural agricultural credit institutions. Lastly, the government plays a role in extending the degree to which Mozambican farms, small and large use irrigation in their production. </p><h4>Unsatisfied energy demands and access to electricity remains a concern in Mozambique for individuals, companies and potential investors. What role can public private partnerships play within this sector?</h4><p>The main role of the private sector will be primarily in generation and, to some degree, transmission. The generation of natural gas will be the prime focus for the private sector, especially as the natural gas in Palma becomes available. Consortiums are also pursuing an energy generation installation on the Zambezi River. Rather than extending the grid, many countries have been finding off-grid solutions, with solar energy in particular. The public sector can assist with grants to establish localized solar generation. In many schools for example, programs of this type have been developed. Once consumers realize the value of power, private companies can usually find customers to provide cost effective maintenance service on an annual basis. Public private partnerships can establish public installations with private sector maintenance service.</p><h4>How would you describe the role that foreign financed mega-projects play in Mozambique's economic growth?</h4><p>We have seen significant growth in some of the natural resource sectors, such as aluminium, coal, and minerals, which has helped to drastically improve the level of production, added value and exports. There is direct employment associated with this, in mining and construction in particular, though I think the employment impact of mega enterprise investment has been less than expected. Large-scale investors recognize this, which has been evident in changing approaches to stimulating groups of SMEs to be more focused on meeting the needs of the megaprojects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Christine Lagarde pointed out at the Africa Rising conference in Maputo in 2014, Mozambique's growth needs to become more sustainable and inclusive. What are the IMF's recommendations for achieving this?</h4><p><span></span>Mozambique has been recording impressive growth, reaching an average of 7.5% to 8% over the past 20 years.  While this is impressive, to achieve structural transformation, the country will need to sustain these levels over a period of 50 years, as two decades is not sufficient to achieve solid development. Growth will also have to be more inclusive. First of all, eighty percent of jobs in Mozambique are generated in the agricultural sector. Hence, it is difficult to foster inclusive growth without improvements in that sector's productivity. Secondly, despite the fact that Mozambique has done much to improve the domestic business environment, there is still excessive red tape to contend with, and it remains costly to set up a business. Efforts to improve the business environment must include better enforceability of contracts, and more simplified and transparent administrative systems. Another pillar of inclusive development is financial inclusion. The fact is that 75% of the population still lacks access to any form of credit. It is difficult for citizens and entrepreneurs to implement their ideas if they lack access to financing. Finally, as there will always be citizens who are unemployed, or else underprivileged or handicapped, social policy must protect those that cannot sustain themselves in the market system.</p><h4>The natural resources boom can be a source of growth, but also has the potential to jeopardize the economy. What are your recommendations for avoiding “Dutch disease"?</h4><p><span></span>There are two critical issues. The first is the importance of gradualism. If the country starts spending resources too quickly, this will generate distortions in the economy. There will be inflation, the exchange rate will appreciate, and those resources will generate unintended negative consequences. The second issue is that the country needs to be careful to strengthen the institutions that will provide and prepare investment projects. Projects financed with resource revenues should help transform wealth on the ground into other assets such as infrastructure or human capital. The other critical idea is to introduce a fiscal rule to help smooth out volatility. This means that the country could establish a sovereign wealth fund or sovereign development fund, in which to save a percentage of revenues to stabilize the budget in the event of a major drop in oil or gas prices in the future, as we are observing now.</p><h4>How can public-private partnerships meet increasing demand for access to electricity in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>Electricity is an area in which Mozambique can make a major contribution with its significant hydropower potential, and also through the use of natural gas. Public-private partnerships are crucial instruments for increasing infrastructure investment in Mozambique. The energy sector is a prime example of where cooperation between the public and private sectors is important, but public-private partnerships are also based on complex contracts and can become a source of fiscal risk. Mozambique will have to increase its capacity to deal with PPPs, including by hiring a new group of qualified experts in this area and more frequent use of international consultants.</p><h4>What is your ten-year outlook for Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>Mozambique is one of the few countries in Africa that is booming. It has tremendous potential thanks to its geographic position, resources, and a history of prudent macroeconomic policy management over the past decade. There are also some considerable challenges. For example, up to 43% of the country's population suffers from chronic malnutrition, and infrastructure gaps are enormous, and so it needs to step up efforts to deal with some of these weaknesses. A focus on growth, financial inclusion, infrastructure investment, effective natural resource management, and social development can make a difference. While it is not easy to find practical ideas to overcome these challenges, I remain optimistic that Mozambique can succeed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were your priorities when nominating the new government?</h4><p><span></span>I have established a government that will meet the requirements of the country in a hands-on and pragmatic manner. It is a government with a structure that is as lean as possible, and one which focuses on solving the concrete problems faced by our people. It is a cost effective government oriented toward the reduction of unnecessary expenditure, and our public service and justice officials will be selected on the basis of merit and professionalism. I have said this many times, but I repeat here that my commitment is to serving the Mozambican people, and respecting and upholding the constitution and existing laws of Mozambique. We have demanded more efficiency and better quality from public institutions, and we want public officials to abide by the principles of impartiality, legality, and transparency in order to deliver better services to our citizens. The measure of our success in doing this is the satisfaction and welfare of the people. We are encouraging leaders who listen to other people even if they hold opposing views.</p><p><span></span>My Government is guided by the values of humanity, humility, honesty, integrity, transparency, and tolerance. We shall, without fear or favor, take action against acts of misconduct, corruption, favoritism, nepotism, and patronage committed by leaders, public servants, and officials at all echelons. We will not accept the breach of the social contract that has been assumed with our people. No one is above the law, and all are equal before it. These are the basic principles on which we will commit ourselves so that citizens always respect and trust the State.</p><h4>How would you describe the importance of natural gas dicoveries for the future development of Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>Mozambique is a country endowed with ample natural resources, namely arable land, forests, and mineral and marine resources. The recent discovery of significant reserves of coal, natural gas, and heavy mineral sands places Mozambique on the international stage and has made it an obvious destination for investment. In my tenure I want to ensure that exploration, production, distribution, and industrialization activities are conducted in a responsible and transparent manner, contributing to the expansion, transformation, and modernization of the Mozambican economy.</p><h4>What strategies are you employing to ensure that international investment in the mineral and oil and gas industries offers the maximum benefits possible to Mozambicans?</h4><p><span></span>I shall strive to guarantee that Mozambicans are indeed the owners of these resources. We will do this by ensuring the increasing integration of local content and effective participation of Mozambicans in investment projects, particularly in the exploitation of natural resources. My government is acting as a strategic partner in building a broad-based and robust Mozambican enterpreneurial community. I want our state, and Mozambicans at large, to be the true owners of wealth and potential of our motherland.</p><h4>Agriculture employs a major share of the Mozambican population. How will your government support this sector to create a more efficient and productive industry?</h4><p><span></span>We are fostering enhanced public and private investment in agriculture, fisheries, and livestock. Particular attention is paid to family smallholders who sustain the majority of the Mozambican population. We wilI pursue incentive policies for small farmers to enable them to increase agricultural production and productivity, and to bring them into the mainstream market. We are focusing on the industrialization of our agricultural sector, and the results achieved so far are quite encouraging, with remarkable examples in crops such as cotton, sugar cane, cashew nut, tobacco, and soy beans. Mozambique possesses all necessary conditions for becoming an agricultural powerhouse in the region, and all that is needed to develop a vibrant textile, food, and beverage industry. We are intensifying production and access to food by citizens in order to ensure nutritional security. Decent food should not be the privilege of a few. It is a basic human right that should benefit all Mozambicans. Examples of our activities in this area can be seen in our successful bolstering of the maize, cassava, beans, sweet potato, and peanut crops, and we will ensure surplus in rice, vegetables, Irish potatoes, poultry, and red meats. We will have to utilize our existing human resources, including the graduates coming from our universities, with a view to promoting nutritional education throughout the nation's communities. We cannot allow chronic malnutrition to prevail alongside food abundance as is the case in some regions of our country.</p><h4>What are your strategies to incentivize job creation and entrepreneurship in the country?</h4><p><span></span>We are building a country that focuses on the training and development of human capital, the principle national asset. We shall promote new job creation for those of higher level, intermediate, and basic level qualifications. With the advent of the exploitation of natural resources, new activities and demands have arisen, and we have been following these closely to respond to the new requirements of the economy and society. However, we will remain focused on traditional sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, agri-business, transport, tourism, and services, as these have greater potential for the generation of employment. Together with my government we will work with determination to improve the living standards of the Mozambican people, by increasing jobs, productivity and competitiveness, and by creating wealth, in order to achieve inclusive development. For these objectives to materialize it is critical that we all commit ourselves to consolidating the rule of law, good governance practices, and decentralization. We want Mozambique to remain a reference for the rest of the world in boasting high growth rates that are beneficial and positive in the long term. This growth needs to be maintained and valued. We are aware that the welfare of ordinary citizens cannot only be gauged by macro-economic indicators. For this reason, despite the results achieved so far, a number of segments of our people in rural, peri-urban, and urban areas are still living in poverty.</p><p><span></span>This issue is a priority which we need to address, and we believe that the economic growth we are pursuing should have a direct impact on the improvement of the living standards of the people by contributing to the reduction of social inequalities and the generation of new jobs.</p><h4>Health and education are key to maintaining strong economic growth throughout the years. What will be your government's contributions to this field?</h4><p><span></span>We are continuing to build the state's financial base so we can invest further in the improvement of the quality of education. Since education is crucial for the development of every nation, we will spare no effort in the training of Mozambicans to take up the challenges of national development. No matter how well-intentioned our international cooperating partners may be, Mozambicans are the ones that will have to develop the country. For this reason there is no doubt about the importance of investing in education, science, technology, and innovation. We will continue expanding the school network to reduce the distance from home to school, and will make sure that our schools are properly equipped with furniture, libraries, and laboratories. We will also improve working facilities and living standards for teachers. For this new job creation to be sustainable, my government envisages the strengthening of technical and vocational training institutions in its Five Year Programme (2015-2019) and Annual Plan for 2015, and is also establishing public private partnerships for the promotion of professional internships and creating links between major projects and SMEs. Mozambique still faces challenges in fighting diseases such as malaria, HIV, and AIDS, and other ailments that are major causes of mortality, particularly infant-maternal mortality. We are proceeding with the construction of more health facilities that are equipped with adequate technical diagnosis and treatment resources. We are also investing in the training of medical personnel and other competent and motivated health practitioners to provide care to our people with humanity. We have mainly focused our attention on preventive and health awareness measures so that the communities adopt the practices and procedures recommended by health institutions.</p><h4>What legacy would you like to leave in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span>I was greatly honored and humbled to assume office as the fourth President of the Republic of Mozambique. I will devote all my energy to defending, promoting, and consolidating the national unity, human rights, democracy, and welfare of the Mozambican people. I want to leave a better country, with healthier, better educated, and better-fed citizens, as well as improved domestic and external connections and more entrepreneurs. I am confident that together we will create a brighter future for our children and grandchildren.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The programs that are being implemented in the country, including the government Salamatty Kazakhstan project, have positive effects on the dynamics of the public health index, which has been steadily improving through recent years. In today's Kazakhstan we can witness steady progress in the implementation of innovative policies for healthcare system. Modern medical science shows strong tendencies towards increased technological and innovation advancements. Because of important scientific discoveries, we are gaining access to highly precise medical technologies for diagnostics and treatment of various diseases. This enables us to significantly improve the quality of medical services, as well as playing an important role in allowing our patients to receive treatment in their own country, instead of going abroad.</p><h4>How does the Republican Diagnostic Center affect the development of healthcare sector?</h4><p><span></span>Today, the Republican Diagnostic Center is one of the most modern medical establishments of similar profile in the country. The Republican Diagnostic Center is an investment project, implemented by order from the president of Kazakhstan N.A. Nazarbayev according to the decision of the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The building was constructed by the building Mabco Constructions S.A. (Albania) in 2008, in accordance with their high quality standards. The center is equipped with innovative technological facilities—manufactured in leading countries, in Europe and the USA and Japan—in line with the global technological standards. Every year, our Center conducts diagnostics for over 50,000 patients, 65% of whom arrive from outside the capital.</p><h4>How do you help to disseminate the information about preventive and prophylactic oncological treatment?</h4><p><span></span>As of today, cancer is the second most common cause of death, after circulatory diseases. Every year the country discovers over 33,000 new cases of cancer, primarily breast cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer, and skin cancer. The government is financing a separate program for the development of oncological treatment, mainly designed to target early diagnostics of cancer diseases. Every year, our citizens undergo medical review for possible cancer diagnosis, and if the disease is discovered they have to undergo a complex test to determine the latent form of cancer, which can also involve intrusive tests in the regional medical facilities. The third level of diagnostics the patient can undergo in the Republican Diagnostic Center. In this way, full and timely medical inspection gives us the maximal chances to reveal the disease in its early stage and begin the treatment.</p><h4>How are you investing in the development of global cooperation networks in order to provide a higher quality of medical services?</h4><p><span></span>The Center works persistently on developing our global network. We have established important connections with medical centers around the world, in such countries as Germany, Belgium, Italy, USA, Turkey, Austria, Russia, and South Korea. Throughout the entire period of our activity more than 120 specialists have studied and went through study abroad programs. Through the mediation of Nazarbayev University, our Center has established relationships with Duke University and University of Pittsburg in the US. In order to ensure the exchange of knowledge and technologies, we are organizing a whole range of workshops and science conferences, focusing on priority development goals of our Center. Up to today, we have organized over 35 workshops.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the education sector of Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>Quality education is an important factor for economic growth and the development of the country; it enhances the country's competitiveness on the global market. Today, Kazakhstan is leading several global rankings as one of the fastest-developing economies in the world. One of the acknowledged rankings of the wealthiest countries in the world—the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), published annually by the World Economic Forum (WEF)—ranks countries by 28 statistical and 83 survey indicators; in the last five years we have seen how Kazakhstan's status improved by 10 positions in education and science, according to the survey. The factors that contributed to the country's higher position in the ranking was the start of a project for professional qualification improvement for teachers, based on the new three-level programs, as well as exceptional performance of our students at 32 international olympiads and science competitions, several important international science and math competitions held in Kazakhstan, and the introduction of dual qualifications in technical and professional education. The scientific progress in the country and increase of our position in the ranking was also determined by creation of intellectual clusters at Nazarbayev University and scientific and research departments in different universities, government support of 11 innovative universities, and introduction of new financial reforms.</p><h4>How does education affect the development of the country's economy?</h4><p><span></span>Economic growth is determined by the level of preparedness and qualifications of the staff on all levels. As the president has pointed out several times, first and foremost we must develop a system to prepare competitive human resources, based on the partnership of the state and private sector. The Ministry has raised questions on the preparation of qualified staff at the highest level, during the parliamentary hearings, government meetings, international forums, and so forth. At the moment, we have reached some significant positive results in the system of technical and professional education. With the help of foreign experts and employers we have renewed the standards for prioritized specialties in technical and professional education. The system of higher education seeks a balance between economic demand and government contracts for the preparation of qualified specialists. We have created the map to supply production with qualified human resources in 14 industrial programs and projects.</p><h4>What is your strategy for turning Kazakhstan into a center for research and science development in the CIS and Eurasian region?</h4><p><span></span>Presently, the government of Kazakhstan is conducting work in order to enhance the potential of Kazakhstan's science infrastructure, including the improvement of its reputation in the global market. The integration of science and education is one of the top priority questions for us. As a result of integration between scientific institutes and universities, their research potential will be enhanced, and the scientific potential of research institutes will be actively used in the preparation of human resources, and well as create a possibility to develop common scientific projects. In order to effectively integrate the scientific achievements of Kazakhstan into the global experience, we have opened access to global information resources of leading countries. In particular, we signed licenses and agreements with leading companies and publishers, such as Thomson Reuters (USA), Springer (Germany), and Elsevier (Netherlands). As a result of our work we have seen significant growth in publishing activity of Kazakhstan's scientists—in 2012 we counted 803 publications, and in 2013 already 1602 publications. In the last 10 years, compared with 2003, we have increased the number of publications significantly. By 2020 we are planning to increase the number of publications to 3,000. Besides this, at the moment we are working on attracting new foreign scientists into Kazakhstan and returning our own specialists back to the country. Every year the number of young scientists is increasing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Two years are left until the Winter Universiade takes place. How is the work progressing?</h4><p><span></span>We are now in an active phase of preparation because we have already finished all of our operational plans. One of the main problems for Kazakhstan is the lack of specialists. We do not have enough professional staff, especially at a multi-functional level when major sporting events take place. It is a huge task for Kazakhstan to work on acquiring these technical staff and resolving these sports management issues. Our organization focuses on educational programs as well. One of the things that I mention all the time is the importance of legacy. We have to think about the overall future of our country and what kind of legacy we will leave after our project. This includes what kind of sports infrastructure and staff we will be left with. If we do this work the right way, Almaty will get a professional team to organize events such as the Universiade and even bigger events.</p><h4>From a technical and infrastructural point of view, you have to meet the high standards expected for any Universiade. What kinds of venues and infrastructure will be built, renovated, or developed for the event?</h4><p><span></span>For this Universiade, we have three new venues—two sports venues and one non-sports venue. There is an athletes' village for 5,000 people and two ice arenas—required by International University Sports Federation (FISU) standards. One ice arena will be used for hockey—it will have 3,000 seats, and the other is for figure skating, and the opening and closing ceremonies. It will be a huge arena with 12,000 seats. Each of these arenas has additional ice rinks and one of them has a swimming pool. For training and preparation, as well as relaxation, these are the International Olympic Committee (IOC) standards we must comply with. In addition, some necessary changes and technical updates of our existing sport venues as are still being discovered. The Universiade is important for bidding for the Olympic Games. After our preparation for the Universiade, a maximum of 10-15% of these assets will be used to update resources for the Olympic Games. All the standards are set by the International Sports Federations, including the International Ski Federation, Speed-Skating Federation, Hockey, and Curling Federation.</p><h4>How do you plan to increase awareness about this event, not only among the local community but also internationally?</h4><p><span></span>I think that the promotional activities should start the day after winning a bid. We must understand that promotion is one of the most important steps for a project. Even if we host the games at the highest level, without spectators it's not a complete success. Things have not been done properly in the past. That is why it is crucial to do things differently, and in the right way, to involve the spectators and tourists. Currently, our plan is to invite between 90,000 and 110,000 tourists to Almaty for these games. I think we have to pay attention to the local tourists from Kazakhstan as well, rather than just to the international tourists. I am not speaking just about the competition now. It is one of our tasks to not only organize sports competitions, but also to create sporting occasions—sporting holidays with concerts, festivals, and exhibitions. The first task is to create the conditions for potential tourists to come here. The second step is the promotion of festivals and other events to bring them to the people's attention.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is KazTransCom contributing to the development of Kazakhstan's IT network?</h4><p><span></span>When it comes to internet penetration, only 8-10% of the Kazakhstani population had internet access in 2004, whereas today internet penetration has exceeded 70%. KazTransCom has historically focused on B2B transactions, and made a huge contribution in terms of infrastructure development in the oil and gas region, that is the western part of the country. We focused on production, whereas our competitors and other operators focused more on retail and doing business in the big cities. A lot of the infrastructure we are building is located in areas that specialize in production. Astana was one of the first cities with a large concentration of commercial companies that we started working in. We built most of the fiber optics in the city's Left Bank area. After that, we moved on to other cities that had a medium enterprise segment. There were situations where we approached companies that either had no internet access or were using highly expensive satellite or radio technologies, and we helped these businesses by providing them with internet access.</p><h4>The latest trend among telecommunications companies is to focus on cutting prices. However, it is equally important to provide quality service in this segment of the market. How does KazTransCom plan to improve the quality of its service?</h4><p><span></span>The quality of the service we provide is very important, as is the price. It still has a serious impact on the choice of the operator. In terms of the fiber-optic networks that we are building and the infrastructure we are developing, we make sure to reserve specific loops. In places where we cannot secure them directly, we do it through our partners. This ensures that the quality of communications is high and does not suffer from any interruptions. Another measure we have taken in order to ensure uninterrupted connections is that we never partner with just one operator—we always team up with at least two. That is one of the technical policies of the company that helps ensure the quality of the connection.</p><h4>What challenges and technical difficulties do you face trying to provide connectivity to the entire country, which is among the largest in the world?</h4><p><span></span>Kazakhstan is a large country with a small population. If we look at the price of a meter of fiber optics per person, we can see that it is very expensive. You would have to invest between $160 and $200 million in order to create proper infrastructure here. Given that KazTransCom's revenue is around $87 million, we are physically unable to make such an investment. Another challenge we face is the fact that distances between cities are huge and some areas do not have infrastructure, electricity, or even roads. What is often required is to use equipment that can transmit signals for longer distances, and this increases the cost of building the necessary infrastructure.</p><h4>What other trends do you see emerging in the Kazakhstani telecommunications market in the short term?</h4><p><span></span>One of the up-and-coming developments is related to cloud computing. Kazakhtelecom will be making large investments in order to develop various cloud computing technologies for SMEs and the retail sector. We also expect a lot more fiber optics cables to be built in cities. This will greatly increase traffic amounts. Moreover, there are a lot of international companies coming into Kazakhstan—companies from Russia and abroad that have their own corporate connections. Another trend is actively developing LTE wireless data network technology. Satellite network technologies are not developing as quickly as some of the overground methods.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to World Bank statistics, 77% of all the land in Kazakhstan is suitable for agricultural activities. What strategy does the Ministry implement to optimize land usage and increase agricultural potential?</h4><p><span></span>At the moment, Kazakhstan is not using much of its land, and this undercapitalization prevents us from attracting more investment into the agricultural industry. In order to solve this problem, the Ministry of Agriculture has taken under their control the Republican Center of Agrochemical Service. The center is responsible for inspection of soils and produces evaluations of soil condition, which in the long run will serve as validation to confiscate the land from inefficient landowners that allow the quality of soil to drop. Besides this, we have created a series of measures to produce written records of each field's history, and to establish certain rules for rational use of the land. All these measures will stimulate the landowners to use their land to its full capacity. At the moment, Kazakhstan is running the program Agrobusiness 2020 to stimulate the development of agrarian and industrial businesses. The program has been under way since 2013, and it contains a slew of government supports for the agroindustrial industry. Along with the current measures, the program offers new means of government support, such as financial improvement, insurance, and advance protection before financial institutions, investment subsidies, funding of second-tier banks, which will facilitate the access of agroindustrial establishments to funding. In order to increase the paying capacity, reduce the loan-debt burden, and minimize the risk of bankruptcy for owner-operated farms and agricultural establishments, we are implementing the mechanism of financial improvement by means of restructuring, refinancing, and financing of establishments for debt service payments. For the purpose of financial recovery of agroindustrial establishments the KazAgro holding has used eurobonds amounting to $2 billion. As a result of the financial recovery from 2013 until now, 292 applications from agroindustrial establishments have been approved, totalling KZT312.9 billion. Considering that the budget  for the program for financial recovery was limited to KZT300 billion, the plan for financial recovery has been completed successfully. Overall, to implement this program for the next eight years, the government will provide KZT3.1 trillion or almost $17 billion, which will attract no less than KZT10 trillion, or $66.6 billion in private investments to the industry throughout the period of implementation.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the attractiveness of the agrarian sector for international investors?</h4><p><span></span>At the moment attracting new investments, including to  the agrarian sector, is one of the priorities of the government. We are developing and adopting new measures of government support that would help us improve the investment climate. The agrarian sector of Kazakhstan is attractive to investors because of the annual growth of the gross output of agriculture, and current increases in investments into the base capital of agriculture industry. Besides this, significant resources and perspectives of the country for the development of agricultural sector are increasing the interest of potential investors in the agrarian sector. Our vast territory allows us to broaden the cultivation areas of different crops and develop free-range animal husbandry. Another potential for development lies in new methods and technologies for handling business in the agricultural industry. Today, Kazakhstan is one of the main producers and suppliers of crops and grain production to the world market. At the same time, the country intends to fully cover their internal demand for agricultural produce, in order to ensure the domestic food security. We are conducting work on export-oriented production of goods, specifically meat: beef, mutton, and poultry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main lines of business?</h4><p><span></span>Snack foods are one of our most important areas of operation. This part of our group comprises three companies: Rustar Food, Snack Foods, and Rd Company. We are also importing food products from Russia and the EU. The company aims at selling a quality product rather than a brand name. We're also selling the packaged sunflower seeds “Ginn," and their market share is about 80% of the roasted sunflower seeds market; these seeds are produced in the city of Zlatoust in Russia by a Russian market leader called SMART, and we cover 98% of the Almaty and Zhambyl retail market. Our product is among the top 10 best sellers in concession stalls. We also represent a company called Polet who produce oatmeal cookies that are sold in all the major countries around the world. We represent the Ramensky confectionery enterprise, a leader of the Russian biscuit market. We represent Chernogolovki Beverages, which is Russia's third most popular brand after Coca-Cola and Pepsi. We also represent Agro-Alliance, one of the biggest grain producers in Russia, and market leader in the rice segment. We're representing the Bebetto brand of a Turkish company Kervan, which specializes in producing marmalades. Our company is the official distributor of these brands in Kazakhstan. </p><h4>How do you position yourselves in a competitive local sector?</h4><p><span></span>We only focus on quality products. This is the only way to fight off competitors; we sell the products we would eat and drink ourselves. The high quality of our products and services makes us a strong player at the local market. We are quite competitive compared to such giants as Wrigley and Mars because we are very flexible in meeting the changing market demand. When a sales representative places an order of a store, it gets to the server by 4pm so that we can assemble the batch. By 8am the next morning the products are ready for delivery to the store. We also tried to open branches in the northern part of the country, but after experiencing huge losses we had to shut them. Currently we're operating in three regions—Almaty, Zhambyl, and Karaganda. We have a development strategy that  is based on our competitive advantage. We are now entering Russia's regional markets, the Northern Caucasus, and are considering Azerbaijani market.</p><h4>How do you promote your brands?</h4><p><span></span>We participate in numerous fairs where we meet potential partners willing to expand their sales. We're attending fairs in Dubai, Cologne, Moscow, and Istanbul, where we analyze Asia's and Europe's market trends and tendencies. We keep our eyes open for new tendencies and products that have already been successful elsewhere, in order to eventually introduce them to Kazakhstan's market. We'd also like to grow in other segments, such as cooled Angus meat, which has great potential in the country.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Our company was established during the 2009 downturn, and now the country is going through another financial crisis. Thus, we would like to boost the development of our company and to attract new partners, increase the number of the personnel, and expand to new markets. We have a development strategy that carries through 2017. Currently the company employs 250 people. Over the past 15 years there has been no other Kazakhstani company who could show performance similar to ours. Our company Snack Foods, for example, is a young company that managed to motivate its staff to succeed in hard times—they are mainly working in snack and confectionery segments, ranging from sunflower seeds, pistachio and corn sticks, to cookies and biscuits. The company's share in the Almaty and Zhambyl regional markets is 98%. We guarantee prompt delivery in 24 hours, and we work with all the country's chains.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main developments in the Salamatty Kazakhstan program and what are its key features?</h4><p><span></span>First of all, I would like to underline that the main goals of the program to improve the healthcare system have been reached. The measures we have taken helped us stabilize the situation in healthcare, decrease the level of illness and death rates, and improve main demographic indicators. The average life expectancy has gone over the 70-year milestone, and in the past five years birth rates in the country have improved significantly: 338,180 newborns within 10 months of 2014 (to compare with 305,357 in the same period of 2009). As a result of this program, an average life expectancy for many Kazakh people has been raised to 70 (an indicator initially planned for 2015), and we managed to decrease mortality rates among newborns and mothers. It all became possible because of the new model of managing and financing the department. If before the financing strictly depended on the number of hospital beds and medical staff, now it is based on payments per patient. Standardized rates for medical services are established throughout the entire country, and financing is attached to patients with particular diseases, and is directly proportional to the gravity and complexity of the illness. We have implemented the national screening program that allows us to reveal 11 illnesses that influence mortality in the early stages, and also broadened the accessibility of professional medical care at in-patient facilities regardless of their physical address in the country. New medical technologies are being developed, and last year we held over 60,000 cardiac surgeries, over 500 surgeries for organ and tissue transplants, and implemented new technologies to operate on the human brain.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the key elements that characterize your strategy of development for the healthcare sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>At the moment we are assessing the results of the current Salamatty Kazakhstan program. This assessment is done by leading experts from WHO and World Bank. It is necessary to underline that despite our continuous success in reduction of mortality and disease rates, life expectancy rates in Kazakhstan are still much lower than in other OECD countries. The effectiveness of early detection and treatment of illnesses remains quite low, among all age groups. In addition, we are experiencing problems with staffing in the medical sector. In these circumstances the strategic goal for Kazakhstan, to be included into the 30 most developed countries in the world, development of government policy for social protection, including the rights for healthcare and proportional amount of free medical assistance; it all requires further advancements in the healthcare system. </p><h4>The government of Kazakhstan is intending to provide easier access to medical care. How does the e-Healthcare system help to achieve this goal?</h4><p><span></span>Access to information about medical services among the citizens, as well as increase in accessibility of medical services are one of the main priorities of the new national healthcare system, or e-Healthcare. At the moment 14 web applications are implemented all around the country, in the form of web portals. Such portals allow anyone, even today, to choose their preferred medical facility for medical check-up and treatment. It is necessary to underline that patients' access to medical facilities, be it regional clinics or national medical centers, is provided as part of free medical care. In the future, we are planning to broaden our use of information technologies in the medical care. The central link of electronic healthcare system will be the electronic health record (EHR). The EHR will contain key medical information on each patient, collected from various medical resources and information systems. It will be accessible for the patient and medical doctors providing the service. EHR will allow medical workers to monitor patient health and consider all previous medical history when making decisions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ETU has a fairly short history. Could you tell us about the creation of ETU and the university's achievements in these past few years?</h4><p><span></span>The predecessor of ETU during Soviet times was an industrial college, which was renamed Almaty University For Humanities And Technology in 1988. In 2014 the institution underwent re-organization and rebranding and the new strategy for development of the university was formulated. It suggests a five-year period of transition towards making courses more practical, improving the quality of research, and strengthening of the faculty staff. We also take care of our professors and tutors, making every effort to ensure that they are satisfied with the working conditions.</p><h4>What courses does the university offer, and how is it different from other academic institutions of Almaty and Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>ETU offers a wide range of majors: from Economics and Business to Management in Public Transportation and Energy Development. As of today 2,400 students are enrolled at the university. The next year we plan to open food and nutrition related courses. One of the main features that makes ETU different is our practical approach to education. We strive to give our graduates the knowledge and skills that are in demand in the market. We give talks to our students when they change their major, should the need arise. ETU offers educational services at an average market price and at the same time, we invest into our faculty members and provide assistance in upgrading their existing qualifications or getting new ones. ETU faces many challenges and the first of them is to provide quality education at affordable price.</p><h4>How does the university strategy reflect the government policy for economic diversification?</h4><p><span></span>We work with the rector and the deans of the faculties in order to adapt courses and programs according to market needs. It is a rather efficient business model that corresponds to the norms of the Ministry of Education and at the same time is in high demand in the market. Our academic pro-grams are more fine tuned. For example, ETU students attended the launch of the assembly line at the Toyota Kazakhstan plant, where they undertake internships on a regular basis. We provide education that is relevant to the market.</p><h4>You have mentioned the work to enhance cooperation with enterprises. Could you give us more details?</h4><p><span></span>At the moment a number of enterprises produce electronic devices within Kazakhstan. We are negotiating with them, as well as with the food industry. The specialties that we teach, such as Economics, Law and Finance, are necessary at every enterprise, but there are particularities in each given industry. For our potential partners, we choose companies that are ready to work in close cooperation with the university. We conduct negotiations with major national corporations, com-panies in the petroleum refining, tourism, and consumer goods industries. The partnership between the university and the companies of is mutually beneficial—students receive the training necessary for work in a specific industry and companies get the opportunity to test certain technologies at the university. This year we are planning to build a new academic building, which will have the area of 16,000sqm. This will allow us to gradually increase the number of students at ETU up to 4,000-5,000 within the next five years. We also aspire to encourage extracurricular activities. The university has football and basketball teams, as well as a comedy club.</p><h4>When it comes to international cooperation, which foreign academic institutions do you work with?</h4><p><span></span>We have student exchange agreements with approximately 100 institutions at the Bachelor, Master and PhD levels. Student exchanges are carried out with many European universities. We also offer double-degree programs. I recently visited the University of Antwerp in Belgium and had a talk with the rector—they are very interested in collaboration. The University of Antwerp commands a powerful scientific base and adheres to a similar model of education service, which is in line with what we are accomplishing here. 6</p>]]></richbody0content>

We began discussions with some of the leading brands to set up shop at our retail center in Astana. Inditex, which is one of the largest groups in the world with brands like Zara, Massimo Dutti, and Bershka, decided to join us. Other international brands like Gap, Lacoste, and Armani Jeans decided to use Khan Shatyr as a platform to represent their products in Kazakhstan. Before Khan Shatyr opened, these brands were not in the market. And even though some international brands were available in Almaty prior to Khan Shatyr, these brands were not widely available elsewhere in the country. Khan Shatyr changed the retail landscape of Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What are the specific factors that make Khan Shatyr unique?</h4><p><span></span>The idea came from the President, who broached the idea to Sir Norman Foster, and the unique construction of the mall undertaken by Sembol Construction Company. It is a symbol of not only Astana but Kazakhstan as well. People now associate Khan Shatyr with Kazakhstan much like they would associate the Eiffel Tower with France. Not only is the mall housed in a unique building, it is also the biggest shopping center in Kazakhstan. The total area is 125,000 sqm and GLA is 55,000 sqm. We have approximately 210 tenants. Our success is not due to the look or the size of the building alone, but also its function. Khan Shatyr contains a beach club and an approximately 4,000 sqm children's entertainment center. We have cinemas and convenient parking, as well as premier parking.</p><h4>Khan Shatyr is characterized by flexible spaces that can accommodate a variety of events: in that regard, what kind of events are you organizing to promote Khan Shatyr?</h4><p><span></span>We organize almost 50 events per year here at Khan Shatyr. Two Sundays out of the month, the national orchestra puts on a concert in the main atrium. There are also many events for children, which get them involved through songs and games. Most of our main events are held in the atrium. Customers who spend more than 20,000 tenge in one day at Khan Shatyr can participate in a lottery, where they might win a trip to an international destination. We are trying to provide incentives to shop, but also to enjoy the cosmopolitan lifestyle that we are promoting here. Four times a year we also do night shopping, where major discounts are given. From 5% to 10% of the 800,000 residents of Astana show up during these shopping nights, which usually take place during February, June, August, and December. On a monthly basis, we also distribute a special magazine where we provide coverage of sports, local and international news, and tourism. In addition, we host the “Miss Khan Shatyr" competition, which is popular throughout the CIS states. We also hold raffles for cars and getaways at Rixos Hotels.</p><h4>As competition in the industry increases here in Astana, how are you positioned to maintain a leading position in the retail sector?</h4><p><span></span>In Astana there are eight shopping centers, and Khan Shatyr is the largest. The second biggest is only half the size of Khan Shatyr. Considering the weather that characterizes Astana, if people are not working or resting at home they are looking for entertainment, or something to do to over the weekend, and we are positioned to provide leisure activities, good restaurants, and international brands to our clients. For these reasons, Khan Shatyr will retain its status as the preferred shopping center in Astana.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the current status of the restaurant industry in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>In Kazakhstan, it took some time to develop after the Soviet era. During the early stages, restaurants were regarded as places where customers enter, order, get served, pay, and then leave. It was a mechanical process. This changed when foreign chains entered the market and raised the standards for food quality and service. Also, new five-star hotels in Almaty have raised expectations and quality. The growing number of international flights coming in and out is supporting the development of the sector by exposing Kazakh travelers to the importance of good food, good service, and atmosphere of restaurants when travelling abroad. Once back, they want to see the same standards applied to the restaurants in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How is Parmigiano Group promoting a new culture of food among local consumers?</h4><p><span></span>I was an absolute newcomer to the industry when we opened our first restaurant three years ago, which was Parmigiano. There was a major gap in the market at the time. There were few options for customers looking to enjoy dinner with family and friends in an intimate setting with high standards. Parmigiano was intended to be a small Italian restaurant with a welcoming atmosphere. We managed to achieve this; however, the restaurant ended up being bigger than initially intended. From an architectural and design point of view, it was a very satisfying project because it brought different views, concepts, and ideas on the design side to the market. All of our restaurants have been designed and built by us, and their concepts have been created internally. We do not franchise. The restaurant ended up being so successful that we decided to adopt the name for the group. If you want to become successful in this business, you need to bring professional experience: in all of our restaurants we have foreign chefs from places such as Moscow, Italy, Malaysia, and Australia.</p><h4>Can you talk about your implementation of a delivery service in a fine dining setting?</h4><p><span></span>We can deliver from any restaurant within its working hours. On a monthly base, we see about 15% growth. Word of mouth is the best advertisement. Almaty is not a big city, so restaurants have to fight for every client and guest. This makes us especially proud because we have been quite successful in that. We have recently started the special delivery program “Simple and Fresh," which provides balanced and healthy food. It became very successful among our current guests and attracts new clients.</p><h4>What kinds of events are you organizing to promote your restaurants?</h4><p><span></span>We bring in international chefs from time to time. We also cooperate with the Almaty wine club. We have a lot of special events. In 2014, we opened four more restaurants, marking a big step forward. Our steakhouse Crudo was recently awarded the best restaurant of the year, and Parmigiano has been selected twice as the best restaurant of the year. We received two excellence awards from Wine Spectator. These accolades set a high benchmark. We do not fight for these awards, but they are still important because they show how we were assessed by a discerning critic. This is vital in terms of promotion.</p><h4>Are you planning to open any restaurants in other cities of the country?</h4><p><span></span>We received many of offers to open a restaurant in Astana. However, starting operations in a new city is complicated, and if we decide to go there we would have to spend about one year in preperations. We have to find staff, including the right chefs, and bring them from Astana to Almaty for training. Astana is such a rapidly growing city that it still does not have a well-developed restaurant industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Rising To The Challenge]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[rising-to-the-challenge]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Kazakhstan faces numerous external challenges such as low oil prices and geopolitical tension in the region, however I believe the economy will be strong enough to weather the storm with minimal losses. The fall in oil prices could actually end up being another catalyst in developing the political will for diversifying the economy. This has already been seen through the government's introduction of numerous investment incentives and widespread message that Kazakhstan is “open for business." However, focus really needs to be on those sectors in the high value areas that give the country a competitive advantage on the global markets. As President Nursultan Nazarbayev announced earlier in January, the country is going into “economy mode," which involves freezing some scheduled construction activities and focusing only on completing ongoing projects.</p><p>The President also announced measures to stabilise Kazakhstan's economy in late 2014 under the Nurly Zhol economic policy, which will be sponsored by funds from the Samruk Kazyna Sovereign Welfare Fund. The policy's objective is to stimulate the economy through infrastructure investment and by implementing the Kazakhstan-2050 Strategy Development Plan which finances domestic transport, energy, industrial and social infrastructure to the tune of $542.6 million in 2015 and 2016 and $3 billion a year from 2015 to 2017. In addition, investment is also expected from other international organizations, and China, for example, has already contributed construction materials.</p><p>Secondly, the country's first five-year plan for mandated industrial and innovative development proved to be a learning experience, establishing a number of important building blocks on which diversification can now be achieved. Efforts should be focused on niche sectors and those where raw materials are abundant and there is existing demand, such as the service or chemical sectors in the oil and gas industry. One area that warrants further exploration is the potential for agriculture to become a far more important element of the national economy. Even though the levels of commercial farming in Kazakhstan are currently very low, there is no reason why focus cannot be given to farming and agriculture so that the country can compete on a global scale, partially due to its sheer size and favorable investment climate.</p><p>Finally, joining the Eurasian Economic Union and strengthening economic ties with other Central Asian countries will play a key role in increasing market scale and overcoming the challenges of geographical location. The size of the country, together with a widely dispersed and relatively small population, make markets harder to access. Membership of the Eurasian Economic Union will further solidify Kazakhstan's position in the region as a leading economic force, one that is party to many banking initiatives and organizations such as the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization. By positioning itself in this way, Kazakhstan is helping to offset any of the economic fallout from the collapsing Russian Ruble and the effects of the sanctions on Russia.</p><p>In order to develop in these directions, it is essential that companies investing in the country feel secure that their investment is being safeguarded. In other words, the rule of law is critical in attracting new investment. The government is currently taking steps to address this issue and is looking towards both Dubai and Singapore as international examples of best practice. Further, Kazakhstan has signed bilateral investment treaties with many countries, including OECD countries, guaranteeing national or most-favoured-nation treatment and stipulating the responsibilities of parties, most notably in the event of expropriation. Kazakhstan has also established institutions to promote investment, including KazNexInvest and the Foreign Investors' Council, and has created an investment ombudsman to help foreign investors address their issues and concerns to the right institution and ultimately ensure a favorable investment climate.<br>To date, Kazakhstan has made outstanding progress towards creating a favorable investment climate. For example, Kazakhstan was one of the first CIS countries to introduce IFRS, electronic filing, simplified visa procedures, liberalized currency controls and so on. Rightly so, Kazakhstan is widely recognized as having the best investment climate in the Caspian region and if it continues on that path, it should be successful in strengthening its position and reaching its potential of diversifying its economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess your business performance to date, compared with the results of 2013?</h4><p><span></span>The pharmaceuticals market saw remarkable growth in 2013; however, in 2014 we are experiencing much lower growth. This year we had a devaluation of the national currency. Because Kazakhstan's market depends on imports, consumers faced a 20-25% increase in the cost of products from the pharmaceutical industry. The government is trying to control the prices, and is working with distributors to keep the price low. Right now, customers can see that their prices have started to rise. For the local products, however, prices have not changed significantly. This is the key issue in 2014.</p><h4><span></span>VIVA Pharm pursues a comprehensive approach to the pharmaceutical industry: how is your logistics department contributing to your services in Kazakhstan and the broader region?</h4><p><span></span>VIVA Pharm delivers new technology and products that we cannot produce in our facilities. We import injectable products and new technology that we cannot produce in Kazakhstan. Whenever possible, we produce generic equivalents locally. Barring that, we import international products from major companies. When we import, we bring new technology. However, when we make local products—our generics—we do so at a lower cost. This is in line with local government objectives, and is beneficial to the customer. Our company works with our customer's interests at heart.  We sell to the Kazakhstani government-held company SK Pharma. In our country, the government hospitals receive products through this company. SK Pharma usually announces a tender every year; it buys medicines and then distributes them to hospitals.</p><h4><span></span>What is the importance of human capital here?</h4><p><span></span>In our country we say, “People and human resources are the most important part of the business." We are proud of our team. VIVA Pharm has an adept regulatory department that works with the Ministry of Health on approvals. To bring medicine to the market, it is necessary to submit files and samples to the Ministry of Health, and submit the product for testing and analysis. Our regulatory team brings new technology from abroad and performs the registration of our local products. VIVA Pharm sends its staff to various training sessions and to pharmaceutical exhibitions so that they can interact with the business community and learn about other markets.</p><h4><span></span>Is establishing joint ventures part of your business model?</h4><p><span></span>We are currently in negotiations with a number of international companies to create new joint ventures. These companies produce in their countries, and already have the experience for specific products. Our company wants to bring their products here, to Kazakhstan. The current economic environment in Kazakhstan is welcoming to foreign investors. We want them to bring their knowledge and capital to Kazakhstan, and the government will buy their products and support their local production. This is why we are inviting companies from Israel, India, and even Ukraine. Ukraine needs new markets, and its pharmaceutical producers have remarkable experience in this industry.</p><h4><span></span>How would you evaluate the legislation for this sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>I have suggested that our Ministry of Health allow pharmacies to offer generics first. This is already an established practice in parts of Europe, and it should be imported to Kazakhstan. This will mandate that the pharmacist offers generics first instead of original drugs as a way to save costs. In terms of legislation, we are in the process of establishing a Customs Union with Russia. But right now, we have different legislation. In Kazakhstan, we even have different packaging. There is both Kazakh stani and Russian packaging in this country, whereas in Russia there is only Russian packaging. To bring new products to the market here, the Ministry of Health must approve them. The next step for the Ministry of Health is to agree on one requirement.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the bank investing in more competitive IT platforms?</h4><p><span></span>Over the past year we have launched our mobile application processes in three different languages. We are continuing to develop internet banking for both the retail and corporate segments, working to better deal with foreign exchange. From a customer standpoint, it can be difficult to constantly adapt to updates to our online systems, so we are pushing our clients to learn how to efficiently utilize these platforms.</p><h4>What is the ratio of retail banking in Eurasian Bank's portfolio?</h4><p><span></span>Retail banking represents 50% of our loans and our business. However, by no means are we a retail bank. I do not like to use the term universal bank because we are too small for that, but we do actively tailor our business to smaller companies as well as retail. There is a great deal of synergy between these two areas. The government is working towards accelerating the growth of SMEs, which they consider to be a driver for the development of the national economy.</p><h4>How is Eurasian Bank supporting the development of new business activities in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>To be blunt, small and medium-sized businesses are not my favorite category of business. There is still a long way to go in terms of both transparency and information. There are credit bureaus for retail and corporate banking has audits, yet with SMEs there is nothing. There are financial statements, but these take on many different forms, and trying to understand the true economic picture of cash flows and collateral is difficult. This means we have to spend a lot of time on each individual customer, despite lending sizes being smaller. It is always a question of resources, time, knowing your customers, and working with them to understand where their sales come from. It is a critical part of what we do, and is one of the more difficult aspects of our work. The fact that the government has been supportive of the DAMU Fund certainly makes it feasible, but there is a long way to go in terms of how to raise the transparency of those SMEs further. There are also a number of requirements when working with the government for those companies, and these sorts of additional requirements need to be factored into any decisions we make.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your strategy for consolidating your presence and widening your market share?</h4><p><span></span>We are constantly evaluating the effectiveness of our actual physical network, but we believe we are where we need to be. There are always a few more places we could open in and a few places that did not work, but the main challenge is to continue to bring more business through, as this means more profits and capital. After that we need to figure out how to distribute better and decide on the best channels for reaching the population and our clients. For companies this usually involves relationship managers, but with people it involves internet lending and our centralized call centers and telesales processes.</p><h4>The Eurasian Economic Union is being established in 2015. Has this in any way impacted the amount of transactions you do with either Belarus or Russia?</h4><p><span></span>We have a bank in Russia and have just opened an office in Novosibirsk. Next month we are opening an office in Omsk. We are not trying to compete against major Russian banks, but are rather trying to look at cross-border trade. It is extremely early in the process, and it is clear that it will affect our business considerably, but with everything that is happening in the Russian economy and broader regional economic problems, it is not certain how it will play out.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Kazakhstan's power and transmission infrastructure?</h4><p><span></span>Kazakhstan's energy infrastructure is well developed and will be developed further. For example, a transmission line to join the south and the north of the country is being considered. This will allow the north of Kazakhstan to transmit its power surplus to south and west of the country where power is in short supply. In my opinion, there are two projects with the greatest potential. One of them is Balkhashskaya power plant, which is going to be built together with a Korean company, and the second is a nuclear power plant, though the location is yet to be discussed. On top of that, ERG is considering construction of two power facilities, both with 660 mV capacity in the Pavlodar region.</p><h4>Could you tell us about the ore assets you have? Is there any ongoing exploration of new deposits?</h4><p><span></span>The company is paying a lot of attention to sustaining the resource base as one of the essential components of sustainable development. We signed a contract for exploration of the South Kempirsaysky field, where we are hoping to prove chrome deposits. We are planning on development of two of our iron ore deposits:  Shubarkol and Sorsk. The project is now going through a construction design stage.  Over the past 20 years, we invested about $11 billion in the development of the company, development of running projects, and launching new ones, such as 4th facility or new ferroalloy and electrolysis plant in Pavlodar. ERG is developing the Kacharsky mine project as well. We are now extracting 15-16 million tons of raw ore there, and are planning to increase this number to 20-23 million tons. To achieve that goal, we are setting up a cyclic-flow conveyor facility. We have set up a similar one, with capacity of 10 million m3 a year in Vostochny coal mine. ERG is now building the second part of the facility, and once the construction is over, the capacity will reach 20 million m3.</p><h4>What are the processes that you integrate in the production to keep the margins high enough, especially given that ore prices are falling and production costs are growing?</h4><p><span></span>ERG is a diversified and vertically integrated company. Most of the raw materials are produced within the country. In this way, we are able to redirect the resources to ensure that all the companies in the group are working consistently, wages are paid on time, and the employees are provided with benefits in a timely manner. Nonetheless, production costs are growing because of the materials we need to buy, such as diesel fuel and explosives. We are taking all the efforts to optimize expenses. First of all, that refers to all the explosive projects, as explosives are a key component to ore mining. We launched this project together with a few other companies working in explosive and drilling works segment. ERG is also actively cutting down on maintenance expenses. Foreign equipment such as Caterpillar, Hitachi, and Komatsu gets fixed using recovered spare parts within the framework of the REMAN project. We employed this scheme at one of the group's companies and saved quite a lot. In terms of the entire ERG organization, the savings from REMAN can reach about $10 million. Apart from that, we are applying a scheme to save on oversized tires. Outsourcing oversized tires management at one of our companies will allow us to save up to 25% on purchasing such tires, and decrease expenses from $4 to $3 million. Outsourcing will also improve the quality of tire-lever services. We have also invited experts from Russia to conduct a technical audit of our railway infrastructure. The results of the audit are now being assessed within ERG. The company is developing a new technology for alumina production. Our bauxites are among the lowest quality sources for alumina production. Our aluminum branch is going through certain difficulties because of a price drop. To Kazakhstan's government and ERG's management credit, we managed to keep our aluminum business. In line with the government's measures, the railway and power transmission tariffs were lowered. We optimized the output and cut off the expenses as much as possible, which allowed the company to survive in such difficult times, although, not without support from the other companies. To date, the prices have change and it improved the state of the aluminum business, it became profitable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over the last few years the turnover of COLOS has more than doubled, reaching $43 million in 2013. What factors are driving the growth of your operations?</h4><p><span></span>The year of 2011 is known as our “breakthrough" year when we doubled our figures, TS Service was rebranded as IFC COLOS (abbreviation of our slogan Comprehensive Logistic Solutions), and expanded the range of services. Starting from 2011, our turnover increased remarkably; in 2011 by 78% against the previous year and in 2012, turnover increased by 96% compared to 2011. For the last two years, we hit $37.9 million in 2012, and then $43 million in 2013. We expect 2014 to be as successful as previous years. In 2008, when I joined the company, we signed 18 contracts. So far this year, without extended contracts, we have already signed 190 new contracts. Currently, IFC COLOS employs 100 people, including its representative offices.</p><h4>What is the field of specialization of the company and what is the composition of your client portfolio?</h4><p><span></span>IFC COLOS is a freight forwarding company that provides a full range of railway, air, road, sea, and multimodal transportation services. COLOS specializes in handling and transportation of oversized, long measured, heavy-lift, and project cargoes. We handle transportation of hazardous or fragile cargo under a specified temperature regime. IFC COLOS arranges import/export customs clearance and terminal handling services, and issues transit customs declarations on all border stations of the Republic of Kazakhstan. We provide all kinds of services connected to cargo transportation in the sphere of customs affairs. One of the most interesting projects, which we launched in 2012-13, was the transportation of equipment required for reconstruction of the Troitskaya GRES in Russia. In 2011, specialists of IFC COLOS conducted a pilot survey of the freight routes, and then analyzed the transport routes and modes for the implementation of the project. With this project, in 2012, we started moving the main metal structures from China to Russia, and in 2013 we handled transportation of high-technology equipment, which was the last cargo of the project.</p><h4>IFC COLOS is planning to acquire a railway terminal in the city of Almaty and to construct a facility on the Kazakh-Chinese border. Can you share the details of these ambitious projects?</h4><p><span></span>Towards COLOS's improvement and as a part of our strategic development, we have chosen the conception of logistics services provision using our own infrastructure. In the medium term we would like to increase our transportation services capacity and increase our quantity of logistics projects. We aim to construct a “dry port" logistics center in Almaty, fully equipped with the latest and most innovative technologies. By constructing the terminal we want to improve processes related to cargo handling and create a new approach to the terminal business in Kazakhstan. We will also construct a railway terminal in Khorgas near the Kazakhstan—China border, which is a Free Zone. The main function of the terminal will be reloading of different cargoes such as bulk, oversized, heavy-lift, and container cargo. We submitted our business plan and have gone through all the approvals of the customs authorities over the past two years. We were informed that in April 2015 we will be able to start construction following the distribution of land among approved participants. This terminal will allow us to realize our postal and e-commerce plans by maximizing the transit potential of Kazakhstan. This is an exciting moment for us, as we already have a lot of interest from different companies working in the transportation and logistics services segment. The realization of such large-scale projects will be fulfilled thanks to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which is ready to cover investment and funding for our terminal.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the highlights and milestones for Kaz Air Jet?</h4><p><span></span>Kaz Air Jet was established in 2007, and we have been growing ever since. The airline started off with one business jet. Now, our fleet comprises nine jets of different varieties—Cessna Citation CJ3, Yak-40, Yak-42, and a few other jets. We are one of the top-five business aviation companies in Kazakhstan. In the next couple of years our fleet will double, or at the very least grow substantially. Another important factor is the people who own the aircraft. Initially, these were businessmen who were tired of hiring charter flights from random companies and who considered acquiring a jet for themselves. We provide them with a range of services from consultancy to maintenance and PSM services. Kaz Air Jet takes numerous factors into consideration when advising on the type of aircraft for purchase, and offers turn-key solutions. At the moment we own two planes. All other aircraft in our fleet belong to people who task us with their management.</p><h4>What is special about your service, and how do you shape your competitive advantages in this environment?</h4><p><span></span>The competition in business aviation in Kazakhstan is not as fierce as it is in Europe or the US. Our competitors are our industry partners as well. Our clients prefer having what I call a “single window" system. If you look for business aviation services, you contact me and share the details of your flight. If my own planes can't carry the number of passengers you require, I refer you to one of our partners, other air carriers, or air brokerage companies that meet your expectations. Our clients never hear us say “no." We always offer at least two or three solutions and emphasize that nothing is impossible. Aviation is a fascinating industry, and we have developed strong relationships with our partners.</p><h4>How much are you investing in the maintenance of your fleet, and what is the importance of having a highly qualified team in this business?</h4><p><span></span>We have been dedicated to keeping up with the highest safety standards since the company was founded. This was something that we specifically talked about with the shareholders. In 2008 we acquired two Cessna Citation CJ3 aircraft. Since then, both jets have been serviced at the same station in Vienna, which we chose because it was the best at the time. We do not compromise on safety. And after every 300 flight-hours, all of our planes go there for a check up. A while back, we decided to upgrade our fleet, sold our old aircraft, and acquired more recent models. Potential buyers were impressed by the great technical condition of the jets we were selling. We also took over the only existing maintenance and repair center in Kazakhstan, which is located in Ust-Kamenogorsk. We have a license to service Yak-40 and Yak-42 aircraft. Human resource management is in a way more challenging than technical maintenance. You can always buy a spare part, but it's a lot more difficult to find the right talent. We always hire the best talent. Kaz Air Jet currently employs 55 people in the head office and 80 more in Ust-Kamenogorsk. Our company resembles a family-run business, and many of the employees get offers to work for other companies, which, obviously, they can do, but they still choose to work with Kaz Air Jet.</p><h4>What is the geographical area you cover with your flights?</h4><p><span></span>Our fleet is not big enough to cover every possible destination. The most popular route is Almaty-Astana because business is located in Almaty, but all the government agencies are in Astana. Our clients often require short-term services. Although we can't keep the pilots in the plane like they do in the military, we do ensure that the pilots always turn up on time. We work mainly in Kazakhstan, and our aircraft perfectly match the flight conditions here. We also fly to the border regions of Russia and to Moscow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the climate of the Kazakh helicopter industry?</h4><p><span></span>The helicopter industry can be likened to a complex ecosystem. ECKE is only one part of this ecosystem in Kazakhstan, but already provides its polyvalent in-house competencies to the other actors for them to expand their own production capacities. During the past two years, ECKE has had a 30% changeover in its staff, allowing the company to become the best in the whole region. Through appropriate HR policies we have positioned the company as an industrial tool for Kazakhstan and Airbus Helicopters to deploy helicopters and services throughout all of Central Asia. As of 2014 and the beginning of 2015, ECKE has been awarded its valuable maintenance and training certification by Airbus Helicopters for Kazakhstan and Mongolia, and we are on our way to be recognized throughout the whole CIS region within two years. In addition, we are increasing our capabilities into the complex fields of maintenance, design, and training, having just created a design office and started certifications through project innovation purely made in Kazakhstan. The other pillars of this ecosystem are the modern aeronautic basic education for young pilots and technicians, maintenance ability, adaptation of the regulations, and mission training enabling top-class operations. In Kazakhstan, the sector is not mature, and our project is certainly the most advanced pillar of this industry nationally—even regionally as there is no equivalent. There are not enough pilots and technicians to fly and maintain the machines purchased for rescuing and serving the population today. The crews are not able to fly by night using night vision systems, and they are not able to perform complex missions using modern equipment such as medical evacuation kits or hoists.</p><h4>What needs to be done to improve the industry from the government's side?</h4><p><span></span>Dozens of pilots and technicians are needed, and it takes time to educate and train them in these areas, requiring a minimum of two years. Without creating a high-standard national helicopter academy, the current situation will remain. State-of-the-art equipment will stay on the ground. We recommend the creation of a national helicopter academy within the Ministry of Defense at Aktobe, operating cost-efficient light helicopters and modern innovations such as flight simulators and 3D courses adapted to academic requirements. Our partner Kazaviaspas experiences difficulty in operations, and we also recommend the co-leadership of this company and the rebuilding of a new national operator in cooperation with best-in-class foreign operators to give better access to the oil and gas sector. Urban and peri-urban police missions are today not using the extraordinary capacities of helicopters, especially at night, so creating a police air operator would also boost the sector. We also recommend creating flexible helicopter flight regulations to ease private and corporate helicopter operations, as Kazakhstan clearly needs more of these modern assets.</p><h4>What is the annual production capacity of the plant?</h4><p><span></span>Our capacity is between 10 and 12 helicopters. The final number depends on the work that is done on the helicopter, meaning on the local content. Based on 2,000 man-hours per helicopter, we can assemble up to 12, which factors out to 24,000 man-hours per year plus all the maintenance inspections. We have created a design office as well. Together we started on the approval of the ADOA, which is a Design Office Organization, pre-approved by Airbus Helicopter. This design office will be able to propose scoped modifications to the EASA, which is the European safety agency. This means that the helicopters we propose here in Kazakhstan can be operated worldwide. Our objective is to have the design office fully operational before the end of 2016. In the near future, we will be looking for Russian suppliers for specific equipment like radios. We also have to look at the local market, especially in light of the recently established Eurasian Economic Union.</p><h4>Which countries are showing interest in acquiring helicopters assembled in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>Mongolia is keen, and Turkmenistan is also showing interest in our services. ECKE is also in negotiations with Russia as well for services in some regions. We are already in discussions with Kyrgyzstan too.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact has the firm had on Kazakhstan over the years?</h4><p>This year, KAZGOR Design Academy will celebrate its 85th anniversary. Over this time, we have completed almost 8,000 projects of different types. Our experience comprises the most iconic and impressive buildings in Kazakhstan.</p><h4><span></span>What specific sector are you targeting to expand your activity?</h4><p><span></span>From our perspective, we would like to participate in more projects in the public and infrastructure sectors. We are also interested in the design of camps and auxiliary facilities for industrial and mining projects.</p><h4>Design engineering and urban planning design are among the core activities of the KAZGOR. In that regard, how is KAZGOR supporting the development of the city of Astana?</h4><p><span></span>KAZGOR has been involved in the development of Astana from the outset. In the beginning, we drafted a normative document regulating the urban planning for Astana and designed several projects in the capital. From an architectural and construction point of view, the city is very dynamic and in my opinion, it has surpassed Almaty in terms of construction activity. Astana will host Expo 2017, and we have been involved in this project since the early stages. In fact, our international contest schematic proposal for Expo 2017 has been ranked among the top 10 designs. Initially, we were appointed as the local consultant of Adrian Smith &amp; Gordon Gill Architects. Currently, we provide our services to the Expo project under the signed consultancy agreement.</p><h4>The government has recognized KAZGOR as a science and educational institution. What is the company's commitment to knowledge transfer?</h4><p><span></span>We are actively supporting the Kazakhstan Union of Architects. On the base of KAZGOR, we also operate the Kazakh Designers Association, the public organization that constitutes the membership of more than 60 different companies. This association actively works to represent the interests and rights of its members. The Technical Committee TC 55 for design and construction is based at KAZGOR as well. We are conducting research and bringing proposals to the government for ways to improve and update regulations and codes related to the construction industry. This is our mission and we expend significant efforts toward it. KAZGOR is also introducing the best international standards to the country, especially those from Europe and America. In the future, we will strengthen our cooperation with architectural institutions and universities. Traditionally, we host master classes where we invite esteemed local and international architects to share their experience with the local community of students and experts.</p><h4>What are your short-term priorities and targets?</h4><p><span></span>In order to reach all of our targets, we have created a performance management system that can be used for any type of business. Thanks to this system, we are constantly monitoring our activities and reaching all of our financial and strategic goals. This gives us confidence and we plan to improve our business further. Our plan is to extend our presence in major projects. We also want to broaden our cooperation with foreign investors and new partners. We are a system-based, properly organized, modern and universal company well positioned in the local market to be the best partner for executing any construction design project.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the recent devaluation of the tenge affected the real estate sector?</h4><p>Despite the inability to sign lease agreements in foreign currencies due to legislative limitations, rents are closely tied up to the US dollar through specific clauses that allow landlords to review rents in case of major currency fluctuations in addition to standard indexation clauses. This is done to protect the income levels that are neccesary for owners to pay back their dollar denominated debts and cover other expenses that are tied to the dollar. Rental rates have been growing in A and B grade business centers. Property owners in C class business centers have been less successful in raising rental rates, due to high vacancy rates and the relative ease with which tenants can move from one building to another. Shopping centers are a totally different asset class. Shopping center owners are more cautious about rent increases because the tenant mix in each shopping center is a result of  hard work on concept development by the development team and their advisors. The success of the shopping mall is dependent on the concept and its ability to generate the footfall expected through the tenant mix. Hence the success of their tenants, i.e. retail operators, will contribute to the shopping center's overall success. Moreover, certain tenants' lease agreements are based on the higher end of fixed rent or percent of turnover, which gives certain mobility to shopping center management.</p><h4>In your experience, what are the main challenges that international investors face when investing in the local real estate sector?</h4><p><span></span>In general, the real estate market in Kazakhstan is small in comparison to other markets sharing a similar risk/return profile. This is causing liquidity issues, and liquidity is key for investors' exit strategies. This is why we do not see many foreign companies investing money in Kazakhstan real estate market. The government is expending significant efforts to showcase the country's potential. For example, tourist attractions and major international sporting events are becoming more and more commonplace in Kazakhstan. Hopefully these measures will prove successful and generate genuine interest from foreign investors.</p><h4>More people in Kazakhstan are trying to buy without an agent. How are you working to educate the market regarding the advantages of using an agency?</h4><p><span></span>From the commercial real estate perspective, we actually see a very different trend. More companies are seeking professional services in their lease and sales transactions. It has proven a more effective and efficient approach whereby professional agents provide a full range of advisory services. We help clients identify and prioritize their needs and requirements, develope comparative analysis matrices of properties, develop test-fits, and make recommendations for improving workplace productivity. These are the principal differentiating factors of a professional and experienced consultant from others. Unfortunately, Kazakhstani legislation neither licenses nor regulates the agency business; therefore there are almost no barriers to entry. We try to focus on advising the developers as they work on their projects in the early stages. When developers approach us, they have land, but they need ideas on how to provide high quality shopping, business, or residential environments, which will be in high demand in the years to come. This is the true role of consultants.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main trends that emerged last year in your sector?</h4><p><span></span>The year started off with a major devaluation. However, it was partially expected. The devaluation affected the FMCG manufacturers directly. As for Efes Kazakhstan, we rely heavily on importing our main raw materials, such as glass bottles and aluminum cans. It certainly was a challenging year. Despite these difficulties, we maintained a high performance level in the first three months following the devaluation. Luckily, in 2014 we had a good summer compared with 2013, which made up for the preceding slump. It may have not completely compensated for overall industry losses; however, the market overreacted during the season. All in all, it was an interesting, exciting, and competitive year. In terms of new brands and products appearing in the market, it was one of the most fruitful years for the industry.</p><h4>The brewery market in Kazakhstan is very dynamic: in 2013, 30 new brands appeared in the local market. How do you approach this fluid market?</h4><p><span></span>Innovation is the key to success. Efes is committed not only to growing its market share, but also to assisting in the growth of the beer segment as a whole. When we launch a new product, we are not trying to beat our competitors; instead we ensure that Efes offers a wider variety of products that meet the expectations of different target groups. In 2014 we launched quite a few products, such as Efes Radler, which was produced and launched in Kazakhstan for the first time. We also launched brands that meet the demand for milder beer products here. Upsizing is another area where Efes is a trend-setter. In 2014, we launched 10 packages in one-liter bottles, which was new for the market. Beer consumption per capita is not that high in Kazakhstan. A larger package is more convenient to take home and share with friends.</p><h4>How is Efes investing in modern technologies and equipment to create high-quality and competitive products?</h4><p><span></span>Almost half of our annual investments go to machinery, technologies, hardware, and software. Because efficiency and quality are extremely important, the technology we use is constantly changing. In addition, over the past two years, we have made significant investments to improve our reporting systems and integrate our software in order to eliminate human error.</p><h4>What are the advantages of brewing in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>Beer is a highly regional product. One of the main quality indicators for a beer is its freshness. The fresher it is, the better the taste. One of our core beliefs is that beer should be produced locally. On top of that, brewing adds value to the country's economy. Brewing creates a lot of jobs. Unfortunately, as is the case with packaging here, almost everything is imported. Again, we will be more than happy to have a large high-quality bottle or can producer in Kazakhstan when the opportunity arises. Beer has a small number of basic ingredients. These are basically water, malt, and hops—hops are mostly imported from Russia or the Czech Republic. Packaging is our weakest link as it accounts for about one-fifth of the shelf price.</p><h4>You recently launched “Efes Radler," a drink with a high component of lime, and a low-alcohol content (2%). What are the market opportunities for 'healthier' beers or non-alcoholic drinks in the country?</h4><p><span></span>Alcoholic beer is not necessarily less healthy than the non-alcoholic variety. Beer is a 100% natural product. That said, we agree with the government that consumers should drink responsibly. Efes encourages consumers of its products to do so, in which case our products can be part of a healthy lifestyle. However, we also offer three non-alcoholic brands. In the future, we will consider launching more non-alcoholic varieties.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you talk about the current state of affairs in the transportation sector, and about the transit potential of Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>In the past 15 years, Kazakhstan has seen rapid and steady development. The economy has reached a rather high GDP per capita, and for the country. On the request from the President Nazarbayev, the government has developed a strategy for Kazakhstan's industrialization, which allowed us to increase the export potential of the country. In the past 5-7 years, we focused on delivering export goods to external markets, especially in the Asian region, which required the development of transportation infrastructure. The logistics business has been growing quite actively in recent years due to extensive assistance from the government. Last year, the president announced a new economic policy that includes government investments in the development of transportation and logistics infrastructure. It also provided an incentive to form a transportation and logistics holding on the basis of KTZh. They will be managing not only railway deliveries, but also oversee all logistic undertakings tied to different transportation systems (overland, railway and shipment deliveries) and creation of various transportation and logistics hubs in Kazakhstan and beyond.</p><p><span></span>Experts predict that by 2020, the volume of railway transit deliveries may go up to 1 million TEU. For reference, the volume of railway deliveries moving through Russia is 2.5 million TEU. Right now, the overall annual volume of cargo deliveries in Kazakhstan constitutes 530,000 TEU, but this does not include cargo flow for the destinations we are developing at the moment, such the North-South corridor, which will provide a connection to Persian Gulf not only through the Aktau and Baku ports, but also through Turkey. The goods turnover between China and Europe may reach 1 trillion dollars by 2020, and between China and Turkey it will be up to 100 billion dollars. The turnover of goods between China and Russia will also grow.</p><h4>What are the main destinations that KedenTransService is focusing on to develop their activity and increase transportation volumes?</h4><p><span></span>Our shareholders are strongly backing development of delivery routes from Asia to Kazakhstan, as well as the development of transit deliveries through Kazakhstan. The main volume of transit is focused around Dostyk station. This transit point has been in operation for over 20 years, KedenTransService started operating at the station in 2005-2006, and at the moment we are operating seven terminals, one of which belongs to us, and the remaining six are under our supervision. Thanks to the development of business processes and automation of operations, we are seeing a constant increase in container deliveries, especially though Dostyk station. Together with KTZh we are also attracting new cargo deliveries to Horgos station. In 2015, we are planning to double the volume of deliveries to Europe. If last year we transported around 23,000 TEU, or 250 container cargo trains, this year we are planning to increase this number to 500 trains. Prior to 2014, cargo trains operated mostly between China and Europe, but this year we have started running the return route as well. From China to Europe, we are delivering electronics and domestic appliances, from Europe to China, we carry automotive components for companies like Ford, Volvo, and Volkswagen. Kazakhstan itself is rapidly developing its automotive industry. Our country has two main automotive clusters, Ust-Kamenogorsk in the east and Kostanay in the north. With the support from our shareholders, KedenTransService organized transit delivery of automotive parts in cargo trains from Europe. The same technologies have been successfully implemented in Kostanay, where the second biggest automotive manufacturing hub is growing. The volume of transit goods is increasing as well, and factories are demonstrating serious and innovative plans, which we provide with timely delivery of construction parts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The Treaty on the EEU will bring Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to a completely new level of integration, and provide for closer and better-coordinated economic cooperation while fully retaining their national sovereignty. It is very symbolic that we signed the treaty in the capital of Kazakhstan, because Nursultan Nazarbayev stood at the origins of this idea; he was the first to mention it when speaking at the Moscow State University, as I remember, in 1994. Together, we are creating a powerful and attractive economic development center, and a major regional market uniting over 170 million people. Our Union has immense natural resources, including energy resources. It accounts for 20% of global natural gas reserves and 15% of the world's oil reserves. At the same time, the three states have developed industrial bases, vast labor resources, and powerful intellectual and cultural potential. Our geographic location makes it possible to create transportation and logistics routes of not only regional, but also global significance and attract large-scale trade from Europe and Asia. All this is the basis for the competitiveness of our union and for its dynamic development in this rapidly changing and complicated world. I would like to stress that the EEU will operate based on universal, transparent, and clear principles. This includes the norms and principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO). I would also like to stress that this is the result of our joint efforts, based on the close interaction between the governments of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. As you may know, this process was launched in 1994, when President Nazarbayev first broached this idea at the Moscow State University. It was then developed at a variable pace. In 2009, the President of Kazakhstan yet again gave the idea additional impetus, and we agreed to intensify our efforts in this direction. The Treaty we signed is a truly historical milestone that opens up broad prospects for the development of our economies and improving the well being of our countries' citizens. Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan are moving toward a completely new level of cooperation by creating a common space where goods, services, capital, and workforce can move freely. We are essentially creating the largest common market in CIS territory, with enormous production, research, and technological potential and huge natural resources. It is not surprising that other major economies are already showing direct interest in this union. Wherever I go, and whomever I meet with, everyone wants to know how to establish relations with the new Eurasian Union. A new economic organization has appeared in the international arena, one that has full juridical personality and acts based on the principles of the WTO. Still, it is important that the transfer of certain authority to supranational agencies of the union is of no detriment to the sovereignty of our states. Mutual benefit from integration has already been demonstrated in practice. The economic ties between Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan are expanding, their trade structure is improving, the share of high-tech goods in the overall trade structure is increasing, and our countries are becoming ever more economically competitive in the world. Over the past three years, trade turnover within the Customs Union has gone up by 50%—that is by $23 billion. Belarus and Kazakhstan together come in third in the overall trade balance of the Russian Federation after the EU and China. Special attention is given to improving the business climate. Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan all intend to stimulate responsible competition in the union's market. At the same time, we will efficiently protect the interests of the consumers and the businesses of member states. For the future, we have set for ourselves the goal of creating a common financial market. The absence of barriers to the flow of capital will make it possible to diversify risks and improve the quality, accessibility, and reliability of financial services. Stage-by-stage harmonization of the currency policy will serve to enhance the stability of the financial systems of the union member states, and will make the national money markets more predictable and better protected from exchange rate fluctuations, and will enhance our sovereignty as well. The citizens of our countries should be able to fully assess the benefits of Eurasian integration. They will receive the right to work freely in the three states without having to obtain any work permits. Of course, we touched upon the issue of expanding membership in the Eurasian Union, and we have considered the draft treaty with Armenia. This document should be approved and signed shortly. Armenia would like to have this done in June. Overall, we all agreed. We expect that shortly after the union is set up, Armenia will become a fully fledged member. We also discussed the prospects for other partners joining the union, primarily Kyrgyzstan. I am convinced that through joint efforts we will be able to create favorable conditions for the development of our economies in order to maintain stability, security, and prosperity in Eurasia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does DBK support the new economical policy “Nurly Zhol" in terms of investments into projects that have no connection to natural resources?</h4><p><span></span>The Bank acts as chief financial operator for the crisis response measure policy “Nurly Zhol" when it comes to long-term credit provision for large industrial projects from the National Fund. The whole financing volume directed at the economy through DBK with this program is comprised of 185 billion tenge, or around $1 billion. Of this amount, 50 billion tenge was allocated at the end of 2014, and another 120 billion tenge are allocated for 2015, with 15 billion for 2016. Subsidized credit resources are allocated for projects in the processing industry, support for automotive, helicopter, and passenger transport manufacturers in Kazakhstan, as well as stimulation for export of added-value goods from the country. The main instruments of business support on behalf of DBK are credit loans, leasing, and conditional interbank financing. Credit conditions are very comfortable for the recipients, because the credits are provided in the national currency, tenge, at the nominal value not exceeding 7% per annum.</p><h4>What financial instruments does DBK employ in order to attract investments and production into Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>DBK has to respond to the requirements and demands of our credit borrowers. There is a growing demand for credit in domestic currency. The bank is actively working in this direction. Last year, we borrowed 20 billion tenge from the Integrated Accumulative Pension Fund, and 24 billion tenge in the form of deposits at “Bayterek" Holding. This issue allows the bank to utilize up to 100 billion tenge on the internal market. A new instrument for DBK will be a long-term—up to 10 years—dollar to tenge currency SWAP from the National Bank of Kazakhstan amounting to 60 billion tenge. Moreover, as financial operator of several government programs, the bank can count on the government of Kazakhstan as its final shareholder in the program of attracting tenge resources. And indeed, we received such support in the form of 185 billion tenge allocated to the “Nurly Zhol" program, DBK also received 75 billion tenge from the National Fund towards several projects as part of the second 5-year plan for industrialization. DBK has always actively borrowed money from external capital markets. In particular, the Bank has issued several issues of eurobonds amounting to $2 billion. As the foremost among the banks in the CIS region, DBK entered the Islamic financial market in 2012 with a deal for 240 million Malay ringgit.</p><h4>Can you talk about common projects between DBK and international financial organizations?</h4><p><span></span>The DBK is constantly collaborating with various international financial organizations, and has held negotiations with EBRD, ADB, World Bank, and the International Finance Corporation about the possibilities of co-financing projects in Kazakhstan. With EBRD, the Bank has signed a Memorandum on the principles of cooperation. We are hoping that these meetings will eventually allow us to reach certain agreements.</p><h4>What projects does DBK finance within the Program for Industrial Development in 2015-2019?</h4><p><span></span>The Bank has created a portfolio of all potential projects. For 2015-2016 only, the portfolio includes eleven projects for over 180 billion tenge in loans credits. These are just indicative numbers that may change in the future. We are mainly looking into large projects, primarily in the processing industry, that correspond to the credit memorandum of the Bank. The value of the project must not be lower than 30 million dollars, while for food production projects this number is 10 million dollars. We have already started crediting the project «Altel» that aims to expand the LTE network, costing around 105 billion tenge, of which 35% of funding is provided by the Development Bank.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the recent evolution of ATFBank?</h4><p><span></span>When we acquired ATFBank we were somewhat concerned about the bank's levels of non performing loans (NPLs) because it has one of the highest levels in Kazakhstan. However, when we looked further we found that there were several saving graces as it is a universal bank, including retail, SMEs, and corporate. Furthermore, the majority of the NPLs were corporate, which makes them considerably easier to collect. UniCredit acquired the bank back in 2008 and then they got hit by the financial crisis and by the first de-evaluation of the tenge. The customers were not in the position to repay. A lot of the loans were made in US dollars but because the customers did not have US dollar incomes, they were not able to service the loans after the de-evaluations. One thing that we were quite thankful to UniCredit for is that the bank is owned by Bank Austria, and they in turn are supervised by Austria's Financial Market Authority (FMA). Bank Austria is owned by UniCredit Group, which is supervised by the Bank of Italy. That meant that ATFBank had three supervisors sitting on top of us—three national banks. UniCredit applied the most stringent policies in regards to recognizing and making provisions for NPLs. In the six years that UniCredit owned the bank, they made approximately $1.24 billion, which was set aside as provisions against bad loans. Today, on our NPL books, we have 70% provisions on NPLs and 60% collateral coverage on top of that. In other words, we are well covered. Now that the economy has recovered, our collateral value has also recovered. The challenge now is to actually recover the debts because these debts originated before 2008. So far we have been successful in recovering debts. In the first four months of 2013 the bank actually lost close to $30 million. We managed to turn that around and by the end of 2013 we had made a small profit, of about $9.7 million. We think we can make a larger profit this year. In 2015, we will be able to make a proper profit, and from 2016 onward we will be reporting substantial profits because everything will be in place.</p><h4>What measures are you putting in place to boost your performance and improve your processes and procedures?</h4><p><span></span>We have a bank accounting system that has been tweaked to do other things; we call it loan origination. Basically, it acts as a document flow control, which it really was not meant to do. We have started looking at what solutions are available to us to improve this. We have decided to take a big-bang approach and to change everything at once, which is extremely risky. We have prioritized our needs and prepared a three-year business plan, with a five-year projection. In order to achieve this business plan we are going to have to grow our portfolio, our retail, our SME business, and our corporate by certain amounts. Therefore, we are looking at what we need to support this growth in terms of capital, people, processes, procedures, and platforms. It is now called the three Ps: people, process, and platform. This will be our road map. We will also be focusing our attention on other things: we are introducing a concept called lean banking. This is about the basic procedures that we need to follow. For example, does the client really need to sign five documents that are twenty pages long? Can we make it simpler? If we make it simpler for the client, we make it simpler for ourselves.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are involved in many key sectors of the national economy, but which sector are you most interested in exploring?</h4><p><span></span>One of the major industries we are not represented in is the oil and gas industry, and we also do not have a presence in railroads or transportation. Since Verny Capital was established in 2006, our assets have grown to $4 billion. We became a diversified group, we have expertise and experience, and for our strategic partners, we offer expertise on how to do business here in Kazakhstan and other CIS countries. I can say that all of our partners are happy to do business with us here. Verny Capital is an active partner, and not just an investment partner. We participate intensely in the strategic management of each of our investments.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the most recent iconic project you have been involved in?</h4><p><span></span>Currently, it is the Talan Towers, a 30-story mixed-use building with two towers with offices and a hotel plus luxury apartments in the second tower. The hotel is the Ritz-Carlton. In between will be a three-level luxury retail gallery, two levels of underground parking, and a large ballroom. The project is running well, the first phase (offices) should be finished by 2015, and the hotel and retail gallery should be completed by the end of 2016. The launching and start-up operations will commence at the beginning of 2017. Between the commissioning of the building and the opening, there is the so-called pre-opening period for the hotel. The real estate development business is not purely a private equity business. Most private equity companies are looking for opportunities to acquire distressed and undervalued companies, in order to bring in value and increase their capitalization.</p><h4>Do you have any specific targets set for the end of 2015? What is your strategy to achieve your goals?</h4><p><span></span>We have a number of strategic goals in each particular company that we own. I have already mentioned Talan Towers, and we also have goals for our gold mining company, Raygorodok. We are planning to finish 70% of the exploration work. In telecoms, we take a part in the management of Beeline, which is part of VympelCom Group, in Kazakhstan and Kyrgystan, where there is strong competition, and we wish to raise our market share with a goal of increased capitalization. By the end of 2015, we have to achieve substantial changes in our economic university as well. Our goal is to execute some exits and restructure our new portfolio because there is a cycle to our work. We are thinking about new partnerships. We have some plans to build grain and wheat processing plants in the pipeline, and we are also working on other mineral resource opportunities. We are considering food industries as well. In the short term, we are interested in finding partners in the wheat and grain segment. In addition, we are looking to get into transportation. We are hoping to extend our partnerships. We are open to new partnerships with global players in different industries. We know how to do business here, and we know which opportunities are present. We can brief and guide potential partners through all of the prospects in Kazakhstan, and we consider Verny Capital to be an experienced and reliable partner.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Rio Tinto signed two agreements of cooperation with KazGeology to implement the exploration in Balkhash-Saryshagan and Korgantas areas. Could you share with us the nature of this collaboration, and how this partnership will support your operations in the country?</h4><p><span></span>These agreements, once executed, will be joint ventures; 75% Rio Tinto and 25% KazGeology. The objective of the agreements is to discover new world-class mineral deposits in the area and, importantly, to serve as a mechanism for the capacity building of staff and the transfer of exploration technologies to KazGeology. We hope that we will find some quality deposits in those areas. However, we understand that the probability of finding a world-class deposit is very low. Statistically, in the industry the global average indicates that only one in 1,000 projects actually delivers a world class mining opportunity. Rio Tinto Exploration has a very strong track record of finding world class deposits that is well above the global average, however it still means that there are many projects that one would have to look at in order to deliver one quality mining project. This is also a long process and can take anywhere between five and 15 years to reach the stage where a decision could be taken to move a project towards mine development.</p><h4>How is Rio Tinto implementing world-class equipment and technology to increase its exploration activity in the country and allow for knowledge transfer?</h4><p><span></span>There are two things that we have to be clear on when we talk about transfer of technology. The first is the technology itself, which is the modern equipment, modern data processing techniques and interpretation tools, and high quality laboratories. This is important, as those are the tools of the trade. Secondly, but far more importantly, is the capacity of the people that are going to be utilizing the technology. There is no point in providing technology if it is not clearly linked with the capacity building of local staff. Therefore, our focus is to ensure that we provide that capacity building alongside the transfer of these technologies.</p><h4>The government has declared that it will invest more than $600 million for the 2015-19 exploration plan. How do you assess the future program of the government?</h4><p><span></span>This is a lot of money, and it will have a massive impact on the future exploration of Kazakhstan and the value that can add in improving attractiveness for foreign investors. A $100 million investment per year of grassroots basic regional exploration can be fantastic. The problem is when you look at the details in that proposal, there is significant ambiguity. One example is that the overall program contains not just grassroots exploration, but also the rehabilitation of oil and gas wells. The proposal is unclear on how it is broken down in terms of costing; $600 million is not a significant amount for the rehabilitation of oil and gas wells. Although it sounds good from a high level, when you look at the detail, how does that break down? If most of these funds go into the rehabilitation the remaining allocation may not have a significant impact on the key aspects that will provide value to the exploration and mining industry. Unless there is absolute clarity in how that money is going to be spent it is difficult to understand if the 2015-19 exploration plan is going to have a positive impact on the sector and attract more foreign direct investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the geological and technical specifies of Syrymbet's tin deposit?</h4><p><span></span>Regardless of location, we are able to mine year round. Even in the northern most part of Russia, most mines are working all year to produce metal concentrate. With a well-developed infrastructure, we have year round access to mines and power, and our technologies and equipment are housed in closed buildings to avoid issues with freezing temperatures. The deposit itself has a polymetallic nature, and during the latest test work at SGS Canada, we discovered additional recoverable metals such as copper and tungsten fluoride, which have increased the value of this project. We are now completing the estimation of these elements. Although tin is the main production target, we will attempt to produce not just tin concentrate, but we think we will also be able to produce tin ingots or fumes down the line.</p><h4>Syrymbet is cooperating with world-renowned international partners. What results have been achieved through these partnerships?</h4><p><span></span>Each mining project is based on the geology. In order to close gaps in the geology, we had to do drilling and resource estimations according to international standards. We invited CSA Global, and Australian consulting company to produce a JORC compliant report. Last year we signed a contract with AMEC, one of the top ten engineering companies in the world who now function as our general contractor and are conducting the pre-feasibility study. We have AMC consultants from Australia working on the mine design and in the ore reserve estimation. Golder Associates and TERRA Environmental Consultants are making international environmental and social impact assessments. In the last three years we have worked on geology, mining, hydrogeology, rock mechanics, metallurgical studies, and environmental studies. In working with reputable companies, our project has attained good quality reports, and we have closed historical gaps in geology and technology. We want to make this project attractive and transparent, and make it a benchmark for mining international standard projects in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>Which markets is Syrymbet looking at for off-take agreements in the future?</h4><p><span></span>It is important to explain that 60% of tin is used as a solder. The biggest tin consumers are Asia, the US, Europe, Japan, and South Korea. Every electronic producer is chasing after tin solder. In the mid-1990s when tin prices plummeted, the industry collapsed, and nearly all tin producers in the former Soviet Union went bankrupt. Only one tin smelter still exists in Novosibirsk, but it does not have a supply, and works at 10% of its historical capacity. Therefore, it is important to cover this gap in the region. We secured off-take agreements with the Novosibirsk smelter plant. In China for example, demand is still high, and we are working to put together a low-cost tin operation, and introduce export aspects that make tin from Kazakhstan attractive.</p><h4>What steps need to be taken in order to attract more investors to the country's mining industry?</h4><p><span></span>There are deterrents to the mining industry here, as there are with most places. There are unique bureaucratic procedures in Kazakhstan. For example, we have a fairly complicated continuous bidding process that happens in two stages that can be costly and time-consuming. It is the country's goal to invite in the world's best firms, so that we can make advancements, but the bidding process slows investments and impacts our project directly. Mining regulations and licensing issues can also deter investment. We hope to see processes simplified. Operating costs are also rising rapidly. Despite these challenges, we are hopeful after President Nazarbayev's latest announcement that licensing procedures and mining legislations and formal requirements for the project execution will be simplified and the situation will improve in the mining sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Considering Atlas Copco's global presence, what is the importance of the region and specifi-cally of Kazakhstan for the company's operations?</h4><p><span></span>This is a very important region for the group, specifically for the mining side of our business. The local Atlas Copco company is among the top 15 customer centers within the Atlas Copco Group. While Kazakhstan is classified as an emerging economy, which is very rich in mineral resources, neighboring Uzbekistan, Mongolia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are countries quite rich in natural resources as well. Atlas Copco opened a representative office in Kazakhstan in the late 1990s. The company was legally established in 2006, and a lot has happened since then. We now employ more than 350 people, out of which 250 are technicians. That's only in Kazakhstan. Our head office is here, although there is no mining around the Almaty region. For that we have three branches strategically located close to our customers in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Karaganda, and Satpayev. We call them service branches as they focus mainly on after-market activities. In Satpayev there is an excellent re-manufacturing center. It is a small, state-of-the-art facility in the middle of nowhere. We have about 10 such centers across the globe. There is a training facility there as well.</p><h4>What is the nature of Atlas Copco's business in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>More than 50% of our business in Kazakhstan is after-market services. Mining houses have really cut back on investing in capital equipment and are extremely cautious with their expenditure. We are selling a premium products at a premium price. It depends on the customer, but typically they would all have some maintenance, which is what we aim for. The base metal prices have stayed constant or declined for the last year and a half and the world market is not what it used to be. We are treating different segments of the market differently.</p><h4>What is Atlas Copco's strategy to deal with the different environments in which it operates?</h4><p><span></span>We always try to be a good corporate citizen, i.e. minimize our impact to the environment, assist the communities where we operate, care for our people, and train them, as we believe they are our future leaders. We never discriminate on nationality and gender and promote local content. In operations, we want to be lean and agile. We would like to get “more out of less" and be able to swiftly adapt our organization to market fluctuations and demand changes.</p><h4>How does Atlas Copco find synergies between economic growth, environmental stewardship, and socially responsible operations? Can you provide us some examples?</h4><p><span></span>We aim at sustainability and this includes the management of our operations' impact on society and the environment. In Africa, for example, we were spending 0.5% of our revenues on CSR activities. In Kazakhstan, the situation is different, but this does not mean there is no need. Here in Kazakhstan we spent some money last year to set up a garden and a playground in a school. This year we spent a larger amount to pave the whole area. Now there is a road to the school. We do it not only because we have to do it, but also because you have to take care of the community that you operate in. Here you can also support environmental initiatives.</p><h4>According to the Government's 2020 vision, 30,000km of roads will be upgraded; in that regard, what opportunities are there for Atlas Copco?</h4><p><span></span>Prior to 2011 we had a business area called construction &amp; mining technique. Then, the Group decided to split that business area into two simply because we wanted to focus on construction. In Kazakhstan, for increased focus we have a country manager who is responsible for the construction sector. In many instances mining and construction projects use the same equipment and this allows for synergies. Our equipment use the latest technologies available in the industry as we aim at our customers' sustainable productivity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SRK has over 50 offices on six continents. What is the significance of your Kazakhstan practice within SRK's global portfolio?</h4><p><span></span>It is very much part of SRK Consulting's image to be able to deliver world-class expertise in a local context. Opening the office in Almaty was a direct response to this, to provide SRK's services to clients in Kazakhstan and Central Asia, who otherwise might have been reluctant to deal with consultants based in London or Moscow for instance. We started off in 2010 in a small office with seven staff. Since then, we have grown considerably to 26 staff, with expertise in Geology, Mining Engineering, and Environmental Science, as well as Geotechnical Engineering. That is really a reflection of the needs of the clients we are dealing with. When we started the business, we had to bring in skills from other SRK offices around the world, but now we have started filling those skill gaps with local engineers and scientists. This has been an involved process, as we have developed the skills of our local employees by having them work in SRK offices abroad. Initially, we were focused on geological exploration, and we are still seeing some work of that nature, but now we are doing a lot more with established mining companies in Kazakhstan that want our help to make their business more efficient, to bring in technical expertise that they cannot find in-house, or to help with technical undertakings that they are simply unfamiliar with. It is a growing trend for us now that we are expected to be providers of technical excellence.</p><h4>Kazakhstan has vast resources, untapped to a large degree. Which commodities have the most potential for development?</h4><p><span></span>I think the base metal industry has great potential here, and it is already well established, so there are the skills and the understanding of that aspect of mining. Uranium is very important as well, despite the temporary cooling of demand. Gold has problems at the moment, but there are significant gold operations and resources here. The whole country has only been 15% explored during the Soviet period, and there is still a massive area that remains to be explored for all commodities—geologically it is promising, there could be anything there. </p><h4>The mining sector in Kazakhstan is dominated by big companies; what room is there for smaller players to get into exploration?</h4><p><span></span>There is plenty of opportunity and with the lifting of the moratorium, there are opportunities for small exploration companies to get engaged, but there is no funding for them at them moment, or anywhere in the world for that matter. But in terms of strategy, it is something that this country needs, because it is only through small-scale exploration companies that you get enough boots on the ground and people into the far corners of the country. Major exploration and mining companies have a very different agenda, for instance, an established gold miner would be looking for a minimum of 100 tons of gold in the ground, that is their threshold and they are not looking for anything smaller, they are not going to look closely at each and every indicator. Rather they are looking for their specific targets. So smaller deposits that would be ideal for smaller mining companies are just not being found through these means. On the other hand, a junior exploration company is looking for anything and they will turn over plenty of stones looking for it. Juniors are facing a high attrition rate around the world. The only way to get sustainable funding now as a junior company is to have an excellent project on hand, and an excellent track record.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Production at the Kashagan deposit has been delayed until 2016. What is the Ministry's strategy in terms of compensation for oil production at other sites?</h4><p>It is widely known that after the start of oil extraction at Kashagan in September 2013 several leaks were discovered in the sour petroleum gas piping, which led to a complete halt in production. The inspection of the piping system indicated that repairs are necessary for the proper operation of the facility. In order to ensure economic growth and price stability for raw hydrocarbons, the Ministry introduced corrections into the resolution entitled “On establishment of uniform rules of rational and complex usage of subsurface resources during the extraction process," which proposes the increase of norms of selection of raw hydrocarbons to 10% per year instead of 2% per quarter. This measure was part of other projects aimed at increasing economic growth and stability by the end of 2014, approved by the protocol of the Prime Minister's council in September 2014. Moreover, the ministry is working on including into the contracts of subsurface resource developers the obligation to deliver raw materials to the internal market of the Republic of Kazakhstan.</p><h4>Kazakhstan has expressed its intention to build its first nuclear power plant. What is the potential for nuclear energy here and what impact will it have on the country's development?</h4><p><span></span>Nuclear power, compared to traditional energy sources, and especially coal energy, holds quite a few convincing advantages. Chief amongst them is the low cost of energy generation and ecological benefits, which makes nuclear power one of the most competitive sources of energy in the world. Today, the Republic of Kazakhstan has all the right elements to develop its nuclear power industry. To elaborate on this idea, our key advantages are: an abundance of geologically explored uranium reserves; a developed industry in uranium extraction and processing; developed nuclear science; a sufficient number of qualified specialists in the area; and a legal base to regulate the questions of nuclear energy usage according to the requirements of IAEA. The development of the nuclear energy sector will allow us to use fuel and mineral resources in a balanced way, increase the export potential of the country, ensure the green benefits of power technologies, develop nuclear technologies for usage in different sectors of the economy, and boost the socio economic development of the country's territories in the regions where nuclear power stations are to be constructed.</p><h4>What significance do you attach to renewables?</h4><p><span></span>Despite the fact that the Republic of Kazakhstan is abundant in traditional energy sources, such as oil, coal, gas, and others, we fully understand that these energy sources are non-renewable. Moreover, their usage is harmful to the environment, and Kazakhstan is also full of renewable sources of energy, such as hydro, wind, solar, and others. Therefore, not making use of these resources would be unreasonable. According to the “Kazakhstan 2050: a new political course for a successful country" strategy, President Nazarbayev set out his goal to develop alternative and renewable types of energy. By 2050, such sources will provide for no less than half of all energy used among the population.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[infrastructure-everywhere]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the IT infrastructure here in the country and how is it currently serving the energy sector?</h4><p><span></span>It is actually at an exciting stage because Kazakhstan's communications and IT sectors are booming. We used to be a satellite communications provider, and although we never limited ourselves to this area, it was the only option due to the vast nature of the country. There was nothing there and the only solution was to use a satellite connection, so that was our business focus. Now the infrastructure is growing and almost everywhere there is land infrastructure, which brings challenges to our business. That said, we are still dealing with oil and mining companies that operate in remote areas, and the challenge will continue. We found the solution by establishing a solid partnership with the infrastructure holders, like Kaztranscom, which is a great company. There could have been intense competition between us, and perhaps we might not have even survived, but we found a solution with the partnership whereby we resell its services adding value, and we integrate it with the solutions that we have available and sell that package to our customers.</p><h4>Considering Hermes Datacomms' international operations, what is the importance of Kazakhstan for the company's business?</h4><p><span></span>We have some customers that we consider global, because we serve them in other locations worldwide, as well as in Kazakhstan, and are constituent parts of the global network that we serve. And this is our contribution to the validity of Hermes Datacomm as an international company. We support international customers in Kazakhstan and we provide the same high level of service and the same technology as our colleagues do in other locations worldwide. What makes us competitive in this market is that we are both local and global at the same time, and not many companies can say that.</p><h4>Hermes has started to diversify and widen the spectrum of its activities, and is set start seeking opportunities in the mining sector. Looking ahead, can you elaborate on the potential of this segment?</h4><p><span></span>We already work with Katco Mining, and now, we see that we can explore and widen our efforts in the mining sector as well. Of course, mining companies have different specifics in their day-to-day activities as apposed to oil and gas companies, but for us the requirements are quite similar with regard to hard-to-reach locations and necessity in reliable, redundant, managed networks, and that is exactly our field of expertise.</p><h4>What is your strategy for maintaining your leadership position in the market? And what are Hermes' goals for the future?</h4><p><span></span>The market is very competitive. It was easier done 10 years back since there were only a few companies on the market with the same level of expertise as Hermes. Today, the sector works on a different level and to a higher standard of professionalism. Of course there are competitors and, as Kazakhstan companies develop, they know they need to raise the level of their service and learn quickly. In a fast-paced world, you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in one spot, so we have to run even faster to move forward, and that is what we plan to do.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the notable recent developments at Al-Maha Petroleum?</h4><p>Al-Maha is a leading distributor of petroleum products for the retail and commercial sector in Oman, with close to 190 gas stations spread across the Sultanate. We have strong commercial business ties with different companies in both the private and public sectors, including a strategic partnership with Chevron. With regard to the aviation sector, we also operate in association with various airlines. In terms of development, we are focused on widening our retail networks and enhancing customer satisfaction. We also work toward implementing quality services within a shorter time frame. We used to have contracts with companies that provided us with trucks to deliver the goods to the Rural Areas Electricity Company (RAECO) stations. Today, Al-Maha has purchased a new fleet of trucks, whereby we have greater control over delivery time and efficiency.</p><h4>Al-Maha has many partnerships, including Rural Areas Electricity in the Dhofar Governorate and Oman Air. How does the company foresee the expansion of these partnerships?</h4><p>Oman is investing more in power related projects in light of the anticipated annual increase in power consumption due to the ongoing boom in industry and construction. REACO is undertaking electricity generation, transmission and distribution activities in Oman. There are over 30 power stations in Oman, all of which Al-Maha supplies fuel to under contract. One of the challenges we face is fuel transportation to rural areas as the refineries are located in Northern Oman, while the power stations are in the South. An increase in development has allowed Al-Maha to cater to the high demand. Oman Air, which operates scheduled domestic and international passenger services as well as regional air taxi and charter flights, is Al-Maha's most important and strategic partner. The aviation industry in Oman has been steadily increasing its passenger numbers both for transit and for tourists who visit the country. Our contract with Oman Air is of huge benefit. Around 50% of Oman Air's needs are catered by Al-Maha. Oman Air has expanded its destination to many countries, which is also beneficial for us. The further expansion of Muscat Airport in Salalah will ultimately boost Al-Maha's aviation business. We are focusing on the improvement of our services and quality of human resources at the airport. In terms of equipment developments in the airport, we are making our services more efficient and increasing reliability to global standards and specifications.</p><h4>Do you have expansion plans within the GCC region?</h4><p>As you know, growing a business is a constant challenge and today's economic climate just adds to the requirement of meeting that challenge. By exploring expansion options, however, we can take business to new heights. We believe there are opportunities for the company to expand into related business activities within Oman, while we also seek opportunities in our core business further afield. I anticipate a move to expand our business to the wider GCC. Currently, Al-Maha is focused on the development of its structure, honing its human resources, while also focusing on strategies such as opening convenience stores and rebranding stations. We are the largest company in Oman and are dedicated to delivering the best possible services and satisfaction to our customers across all sectors. Our Motto is With You Everywhere to that end.</p><h4>The company has two new innovations: one is E-rial and the other is Smart Fuel. How are these adding value to Al-Maha?</h4><p>Al-Maha was one of the first oil companies in the area to sell fuel through smartcards, which were inaugurated in 2001. A considerable number of consumers are using these highly popular cards today. The E-rial and smart cards were a promotional concept of Al-Maha's creative team. E-rial is a prepaid card generally used by individual customers, while Smart cards are for corporations; both state and private sector companies utilize this facility. It is highly beneficial being easily chargeable and keeps a check on consumption. Detailed reports allow for improved management and the better performance of our fleet, all with the advantage of a secure password. We are also focused on bringing improved connectivity and the quality of information to connect filling stations and the head office. For the near future we are tuned to improving this business line further.</p><h4>What are your company's expectations for 2015, and your long-term outlook for the development of Oman?</h4><p>Al-Maha is one of the leading companies in the oil and gas sector. Our growth for the past 20 years has been impressive. To maintain our market leadership, we have to adapt to greater challenges and hence, we stay a step ahead in terms of technology. There are opportunities for the company to expand into related businesses beyond Oman, and we intend to become internationally active and competitive. And today, we operate around 195 gas stations located throughout Oman. The future is promising for Al-Maha; we will become the market leader with a 40% share. We are extending our services to the remotest parts of the Sultanate, where fuel supply is limited, and as a result, we are contributing to economic growth. We also support tourism by building service stations at key tourist locations across the Sultanate. In short, through participation in energy and energy-related projects we play an important role in developing Oman's economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan's economy is already feeling the heat from falling oil prices and reciprocal sanctions between the West and Russia. What is the position of KMG in this challenging environment?</h4><p>At the moment we are involved in a business transformation process, which is the right way to go. The lower price of oil actually helps, because it gives more impetus to the transformation. In the past, when prices fell to $10 per barrel, companies all over the world were forced to make projects profitable at that price. It makes you think in a completely different way. From my point of view and that of KMG, the oil price coming down is difficult, but we are looking closely at where we can economize and where we can do things more efficiently, while at the same time maintaining our production levels. The business transformation focuses on the future, when the prices rise again and put us in a stronger position.</p><h4>Production at the Kashagan oil field has been postponed until 2016. What is your strategy to ensure that the delays in oil production there will be compensated by corresponding increases from other major fields?</h4><p><span></span>The delay in production at Kashagan is very unfortunate, and we continue working closely with our partners to make sure that we are sticking to our time schedule. Meanwhile, we are accelerating production at other projects. KMG is working closely with its partners through producing joint venture projects, namely in the Tengiz and Karachaganak oil fields. And of course we have domestic production, which is mostly onshore. The majority of our own onshore fields are 40-60 years old, which is a late stage of development and, thus, it is a challenge to increase production from those fields. Having said that, there are many opportunities and we are working closely with the regions to identify opportunities where we can increase production in a sustainable way. But in that follows best practices that we see in fields such as Samotlor in Russia, where they have gone through the process of increasing production through the use of best practices and appropriate technologies. Obviously, Kashagan was expected to be a huge chunk of production, and so it will be difficult to make up for that in less than two years. Our main task is to move toward value generation.</p><h4><br>How is the company supporting the generation of specific knowledge and research in the energy sector?</h4><p><span></span>We have a plan to set up our institute here in Astana, namely the Institute for Drilling, which will train technicians in field development, maximizing recovery, and opportunity identification. In the next few weeks a visualization and communication center will open, with an open-plan, collaborative, and integrated working space, where we will have about 150 institute employees. They will be able to use the latest technology as far as the visualization of our reservoirs goes, and enjoy quick turnaround on models. This will allow us to look ahead and predict the behavior of wells and new approaches that we are intending to implement. This will also give us direct communications with our institute in Aktau and Atyrau, as well as our laboratories, which are going to be fully integrated within one institute structure. We will be able to support our operating fields and our exploration projects—onshore and offshore—by using the latest IT and measurement technologies to speed up the decision-making process.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<url><![CDATA[square-deal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the evolution of Kazakhstan Kagazy from its inception in 2001?</h4><p><span></span>Our company is a leader and the most innovative company in its sector. Kazakhstan Kagazy was established in 2001 following an import substitution program and was financed by the Kazakhstani government. It was the first paper factory to be installed in Kazakhstan. Our factory was also the first to move to paper production from waste paper. Kazakhstan Kagazy takes waste paper, regenerates it, and then we make boxes; we were the first to establish a modern corrugated factory, and we are the leading factory in terms of size and the quality of the technology we are using. We are the top company in our sector, and the only one to be listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Kazakhstan Kagazy was the first company to produce mottled bleached cardboard out of waste paper in the country, and we are the first company to produce green boxes, which are made from 100% recycled paper.</p><h4>What is your market share within Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>In terms of paper production, we have a 90% market share in Kazakhstan. In corrugated paper products we have a 50% share of the Kazakhstani market. In waste paper it is hard to say, because there are no solid statistics; it is still a market that is under development. A lot of waste paper in Kazakhstan is used for heating in the winter. I estimate that out of the entire collectible market, we have around a 70% market share.</p><h4>What is the potential for the green economy and specifically for recycling businesses here in the region and in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>There are several positive developments, with even more room for progress. What is critical is that we are operating in a relatively rich economy that has money to reinvest; Kazakhstan is a wealthy country. And the country is doing well compared to its neighbors. The government, and specifically the President, has made it an objective that by 2050, Kazakhstan will no longer rely on oil and gas as the mainstay of its economy. What is still missing is public consciousness about recycling and the treatment of waste. The development of a green economy has to be a partnership between the government, the general public, and the private sector. One does not simply impose a green economy without public awareness. And currently, this awareness is still insufficient. This is critical for our company, as we are pioneers in certain areas of recycling. In addition, there is complex legislation that is not always properly executed at the municipal level. Through international conferences, we try to educate the industry about different ways of packaging, and we show how green packaging can actually provide long-term savings.</p><h4>What has to be done to increase the attractiveness of this sector to international investors?</h4><p><span></span>Right now, Kazakhstan is a small market. However, Russia is investing more into this area. Normally, international companies make an entry when the market has already evolved to a certain point. They stay away for the early stages, and thus our role is to move toward this point. Kazakhstan Kagazy must bring these recycling opportunities to the national stage and then partner with the international community and large international investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Global and Domestic Motives]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[global-and-domestic-motives]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Both global and domestic motives mark the sporting scene in the UAE. The global motive is a natural component of our global society. The UAE is a cosmopolitan destination and a global crossroads. People living and working in the UAE become global citizens—people whose scope of vision, understanding, and interest traverses national borders; people whose guiding values are more universal than provincial. And they all bring to our country the sports of their countries. The sports of the UAE are much more than just falconry and camel racing and skiing in the Dubai Mall.</p><p><span></span>Early in 2014, the government of India ruled that during the extended period for national elections, it could not provide security for the first 20 matches scheduled for the Indian Premier League (IPL). Thus, the IPL relocated the matches to our magnificent stadia in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah. Fans completely filled the stadiums for those 20 matches during the last 15 days of April. The sport, by the way, was cricket. We cherish the bridges that cricket has built between the international communities within the UAE. These bridges are a vital part of a complex crossing system that also features rugby, football, and basketball, and these sports bridge the gap for races of all kinds. They are representative of an extensive inventory of sporting bridges in the UAE, bridges crossed daily by our global population.</p><p><span></span>Sports demand dedication, practice, coordination, balance, alertness, concentration, technique, judgment, discipline, patience, daring, civility, and teamwork. Those are also the attributes that strengthen individuals and increase their ability to make a positive difference in their communities. Our UAE leadership values those attributes. His Highness the President, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, has said that our country “has relied, and will continue to rely, on the rich and diverse contributions of its true wealth, its people, to guarantee its prosperity." Our true wealth lies in people with the attributes that are also valued by the sports that appeal to our global population. Here in Abu Dhabi, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, believes strongly in the value of sports to a well-developed society. His strong support of the variety of sports played in the UAE helps everyone in our country to enjoy the benefits of athletic competition in improving the quality of our lives and in advancing the values of peace and understanding, both domestically and globally.</p><p><span></span>In the UAE, you will notice that global motives intertwine with domestic motives in regard to our support of major international sporting events. We embrace sports because we hope to see UAE citizens as well as all of our residents from around the world participate in sports and reap the benefits for mind and body so generously offered by sports. Our children and our young men and women are our primary concern. If the Roman poet Ovid is right that “nothing is stronger than habit," then we must encourage our young people to develop in a safe way with the healthiest habits. The danger for them, and for our country's future, lies in their not developing those habits.</p><p><span></span>To embrace sports is to embrace life. I highly recommend it and wish for you all a wholly productive conference. Women as well as men can excel in the competition and achieve success. And that in appreciating achievement in the sports world, we honor the human spirit, the hard work, the endurance, and the focus that success requires.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Twenty years ago, Kazakhstan made a decision not to have nuclear weapons. And not only has that led to growth and prosperity in President Nazarbayev's own country, but he has been a model in efforts around the world to eliminate nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands. So I very much appreciate President Nazarbayev's leadership. The United States of America really appreciates the outstanding effort to deal with nuclear materials that were carried over from the Soviet era. Working with Russia and the US, Kazakhstan has been able to secure those materials, and that makes us all safer.</p><p><span></span>During a bilateral meeting held in Korea back in 2012, we discussed some of the other efforts that Kazakhstan has made when it comes to highly enriched uranium, plutonium, including its efforts at helping to develop an international fuel bank that can lessen the need for countries to pursue their own enrichment capabilities. So across the board, Kazakhstan has been a key leader on these issues.</p><p><span></span>The United States of America will continue to partner with the Republic of Kazakhstan to strengthen its joint efforts to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear and radiological materials, confirming a shared commitment to non-proliferation and strengthening nuclear security.</p><p><span></span>The United States of America welcomes the Republic of Kazakhstan's activities to strengthen nuclear security and implement decisions of the Washington and Seoul Nuclear Security Summits, including by converting the VVR-K research reactor at the Institute of Nuclear Physics (INP) to low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel, down blending the INP's highly enriched uranium (HEU) material and removing the HEU spent fuel from the reactor. The US and Kazakhstan will continue to work together to convert Kazakhstan's remaining HEU reactors to LEU fuel and eliminate all remaining HEU research reactor fuel as soon as technically feasible. We support the efforts of the Republic of Kazakhstan to host the IAEA LEU Bank, establish a Regional Nuclear Security Training Center, and strengthen its emergency preparedness, response, and mitigation capabilities.</p><p><span></span>The close relationship between our two countries extends beyond just the nuclear security issue. We obviously have commercial ties as well. I am always interested in discussing with the President efforts to further expand democracy and human rights within Kazakhstan, which will help to lead to further growth and prosperity in the future.</p><p><span></span>And so I very much appreciate his leadership and his efforts.  And I look forward to continuing to strengthen the relationship between our two countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the nature of diplomatic relations between Kazakhstan and Italy?</h4><p>Italy and Kazakhstan, since the dawn of independence, have always been excellent partners, both in political and economic terms. The opening of our diplomatic relations immediately after the declaration of independence, the fact that Italy was the first EU Member to locate its embassy in the nation's new capital, and the number of fruitful meetings between our leaders—among which the last discussion held between Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and President Nazarbayev was last October—proves that our ties go beyond daily relations. Prime Minister Renzi and President Nazarbayev have entrusted us with the task of re-launching and deepening those excellent bilateral relations. A first step in this direction was the notable Italian business mission to Almaty and Astana last November, with over 120 participants belonging to strategic sectors of our partnership, such as clothing, agro-industry, infrastructure, and construction materials.</p><h4>Italy is a strategic economic partner for Kazakhstan, accounting for 13% of the country's total foreign trade turnover. What sectors of Kazakhstan's economy are particularly appealing for Italian companies?</h4><p><span></span>Economic and commercial relations are excellent in terms of numbers. From a commercial point of view, in 2013 Italy was the fifth client and eighth supplier to Kazakhstan. At the European level, Italy is the second trade partner of the country. Clothing, agro-industry, infrastructure, and construction materials—the selected sectors for November's mission—are among the most promising for the development of bilateral relations, given the strong appreciation for made in Italy products, the growing purchasing power of the population, as well as the several infrastructure projects launched by the Kazakhstani government. However, energy, the traditional sector of greatest bilateral cooperation, continues to offer lucrative opportunities to our companies. Other highly promising sectors are those of machinery and construction materials. Finally, interesting opportunities exist in the green economy and high-efficiency technologies, also in view of Expo 2017, the slogan of which is “Future Energy." The event will be dedicated to the development of energy-sustainable and responsible policies and technologies.</p><h4>What advantages does Kazakhstan offer Italian investors?</h4><p><span></span>Beside the advantageous conditions provided for by the law on investment attraction and the decision to lift visa requirements for countries like Italy, Kazakhstan offers many other opportunities. It is a country growing at high rates of between 4% and 5%, and also has huge reserves, an important public investment program in infrastructure (road and rail networks, port on the Caspian Sea, airports modernization), new technologies (including renewable), and has seen its per capita GDP grow to significant levels. Kazakhstan, moreover, belongs—along with the Russian Federation and Belarus—to the Eurasian Customs Union, with a market of about 170 million people, opening perspectives for investment in Kazakhstan as a hub for other Member Countries.</p><h4>You recently led a business delegation to Kazakhstan. What are the highlights and achievements that characterize this event?</h4><p><span></span>Many opportunities have arisen during the B2B meeting between entrepreneurs in the course of the recent business mission. With governmental counterparts we have jointly decided to draft a cooperation program for the short and medium term, with precise and verifiable objectives. For this, an important moment will be the Joint Economic Commission in early 2015.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main outcomes of the first five-year industrialization plan, and were there any changes in the quality of Kazakhstan's industrial sector?</h4><p><span></span>Diversification of economy is a long-term process. We have just completed the first step. The aim of the first five-year plan was to reform the economic policy of the country, to stimulate the development of the manufacturing industry and generate innovation. We concentrated on preparing the basic conditions for the development of the manufacturing industry, and attracting new investments and new technologies. The government had to review its entire legal base—changing and adopting 50 laws—and we developed new instruments to support and improve the business and investment climate. We also developed master plans in priority departments and gained a clear vision of what we are producing and what markets we are aiming for. Key projects were discussed, partners were found, and financing was secured. Secondly, we had to take down the infrastructural barriers, such as roads and electricity supply. All this required a massive effort and a lot of time.</p><h4>What factors are responsible for these results and improvement of investment climate?</h4><p><span></span>Kazakhstan has achieved real results in improving the investment climate. To implement the projects suggested by the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the government created several new incentives for investors and improved the investment climate. These propositions formed the base for the Complex Plan of the government of Kazakhstan to attract direct foreign and domestic investments. Within the framework of this plan, the government approved a law about implementation of new incentives for potential investors. The law provides additional means of government support for investors, such as exemption from corporate income tax and land tax for 10 years and from property tax for eight years, compensation up to 30% for capital expenses of the investor (investment subsidy, after coming into operation), guarantee of legal stability concerning the increase of tax rate (except VAT and excise tax) and in the employment sector, the right to invite foreign workers. This package will be provided for all new enterprises realizing investment priority projects of no less than $20 million in the priority spheres of economy. In addition, we introduced the 'one window' principle in order to support our investors that have made a contract, and the institute of investment ombudsman to protect the rights and interests of investors. We are hoping that these innovations in the legal system of Kazakhstan will affect our annual ratings in a positive way.</p><h4>Investors protection is an important task for every country, in order to increase the country's popularity in the wide world. What can guarantee low investment risk in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>What makes Kazakhstan attractive for investors is macroeconomic, social, and political stability. Kazakhstan today presents great opportunities and real potential, for large companies and medium-size businesses. Kazakhstan is more advanced in many rankings compared to its close neighbors like China and Russia. The ranking World Bank “Ease of Doing Business 2015" report reported that Kazakhstan occupies position number 77 out of 189 countries, while China is at position 90. At the same time, Kazakhstan stands ahead of Russia in the ranking of Global Competitiveness, issued by the World Economical Forum, occupying position 50 out of 144 countries, while Russia stands at position 53. We would like to underline such indicators as the effectiveness of out labor market to investors. Here, Kazakhstan is positioned at 15, and for investors protection Kazakhstan is at 22, which is well ahead of many other countries, even advanced ones such as Turkey or the Czech Republic. Moreover, according to S&amp;P, in 2014 Kazakhstan has a high rating in the long-term ranking of foreign currency. Above all, Kazakhstan also stands ahead of many of its neighbors in attractiveness of tax rates.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Kaznex Invest promoting Kazakhstan's image internationally, and how is the company attracting FDI? </h4><p><span></span>Creating a positive image of Kazakhstan is indisputably important because it is not enough to simply be an investment-attractive economy. We need to convey the country's advantages to foreign observers. Kaznex Invest is responsible for promoting the image of the country overseas. Our efforts have already led to positive outcomes. We are advertising with some of the reputable media outlets, as well hosting events. Doing this has allowed us to bolster our positive image, establish direct relations with foreign enterprises, and raise awareness of Kazakhstan among the investors. During events that we host, we provide detailed information on the investment climate and assistance that the government provides to the investors. The survey conducted in 2014 proved that the investors' awareness of Kazakhstan is on the rise. Other indexes have also improved. Kazakhstan as a brand grew stronger, and confidence in the government's consistent improvement of the investment climate went up.  When asked, “How do you see Kazakhstan by 2030?", the number of respondents who were uncertain dropped from 42% to 20%. Another optimistic development is a rise in the number of page views for investment-related resources on the internet. In 2014, the number of visitors doubled, compared to 2013, and tripled when compared to 2012. The number of inquiries from potential investors has grown by five fold. The major increases in traffic were from the USA (by 15 fold), Germany (by 10 fold), UK (two fold), France (by 21 fold), South Korea (by nine fold), Japan (by 20 fold).</p><h4>How is the brand “Made in Kazakhstan" promoted and recognized overseas?</h4><p><span></span>The “Made in Kazakhstan" campaign is just starting and will introduce local products to the citizens and to stimulate their demand for them. Our export department assists exporters who are entering external markets. Expenses on certification and ad placement are partially reimbursed, as are trade missions and fairs. In 2015 Kaznex Invest is planning to launch a number of export rep offices that will promote Kazakhstani products in external markets.</p><h4>How is the government promoting special economic zones (SEZs) to attract foreign companies?</h4><p><span></span>The government realizes that SEZs will be points of growth of the country's economy. SEZs provide investors with numerous benefits. Companies in SEZs are exempt from corporate VAT, land tax, customs tariffs, import tax, and other benefits. Now the agency is involved in promoting free economic zones, and by the end of the year we will be more involved in legislation and management of SEZs. The government is also trying to attract foreign asset management companies to develop in SEZs, and is hoping that SEZs will play major role in attracting investors who set up shop because of favorable taxation. These zones are all over Kazakhstan, there are economic zones in Astana, and more in the west and south of Kazakhstan.</p><h4><br>Currently, many transnational companies do their production outside Kazakhstan. What needs to be done to induce foreign companies to relocate their production facilities to Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>Some amendments were recently made to the legislation allowing the government to sign investment agreements and provide benefits in line with them, such as a 30% reimbursement of capital costs. Quite a lot has been done to improve the investment climate. It is necessary to advertise these changes, and attract investors to Kazakhstan. We need to use these new amendments to the legislation, and to improve procedures further, especially regarding approval documents.</p><h4>What potential does the Eurasian Economic Union have for Kazakhstan's economy?</h4><p><span></span>Kazakhstan is joining a large, 170-million person market. Kazakhstan's companies get better export opportunities and attract talent without needing to obtain additional work permits. Membership in the union will make Kazakh enterprises more competitive. Of course the entry o Russian firms will increase competition from Russian companies. In such circumstances our companies need to become more competitive. More opportunities bring greater risks. That's typical for any sort of integration processes.</p><h4>In your opinion, what sectors need to be developed to support diversification of Kazakhstan's economy?</h4><p><span></span>There is an industrialization program under way in Kazakhstan which focuses on six sectors: oil processing; chemistry; metallurgy; machinery; food production; and construction materials production. These sectors were selected by the government based on expert scientific analysis. These will be the sectors focused on attracting FDI. Nurly Zholy program also implies development of the infrastructure and related production (bitumen, asphalt).</p><h4>What are the goals that the company is setting for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>We will try to focus on large investors and assist in signing agreements between the government and foreign investors across all the sectors. The majority of our efforts will be in the prioritized sectors. We will support investment deals by the government and keep working on improving Kazakhstan's image, conduct advertisement campaigns, and holding conferences. As for exports, we will be expanding sales markets and introducing trade financing together with Kazakhstan's Development Bank. Regarding SEZs, we will work on improving the quality of management, increase the number of residents, total turnover, number of patents. 6</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Chamber supporting development of the business climate here in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>AmCham was founded in 1999, although the American business community began meeting several years earlier.  Since then, AmCham has become a truly international business association in which businesses from every part of the world, including Kazakhstan, work together on a broad variety of initiatives. It is sometimes assumed that we are an exclusively US business association or that we are a branch of the US government, but this is not the case. We represent the entire spectrum of the investor community, all sectors and all national affiliations. This is our strength. In recent years, advocacy to reform the business environment has become an AmCham priority, and we have developed a close relationship with the government of Kazakhstan for this purpose.  Six years ago, we started meeting directly with the Deputy Prime Minister, providing recommendations on cross-cutting policy issues in Kazakhstan's business environment. Then in 2013, Prime Minister Massimov suggested creating a council for AmCham and its members to meet monthly on issues of our choosing with cabinet ministers. The Prime Minister always attends and chairs these monthly meetings, and we are encouraged to speak out frankly on all issues. The Council to Improve the Investment Climate is composed of ten corporate leaders from among AmCham members and ten ministers and deputy ministers.  Depending on the topic for the meeting, we can specify the presence of a minister responsible for this portfolio.  For instance, the December Council session was devoted to the telecommunications industry, with the CEOs of Kazakhstan's three leading foreign telecoms presenting their ideas about the future of telecommunications in Kazakhstan.  The Chairman of Kazakhtelecom, along with ministers responsible for industry and technology, attended on the government side, and the Prime Minister spoke at length about the government telecommunications strategy in the year ahead.  Prime Minister Massimov has been extremely supportive and we consider ourselves very fortunate to be able to speak directly to him each month. In June, AmCham presented a White Paper, Top Ten Barriers to Foreign Investment, to the Prime Minister, and this became an Action Plan for the Government. Beginning in July, AmCham has been regularly invited to attend Cabinet meetings to take part in discussions of the “Top Ten," with ministers assigned to create Working Groups for each of the ten problem areas. This is a rare honor, and we are very grateful to Prime Minister Massimov for his attentiveness to business and to the AmCham business community.</p><h4>Future economic growth relies on improving the business environment by changing or eliminating policies and regulations that discourage investment. What are the main challenges that international companies face in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>AmCham started by focusing on the courts and judicial reform. Kazakhstan still has a way to go in creating a judicial system that can handle investor cases competently and equitably, although there has been improvement with a variety of judicial training programs.  The Supreme Court is able to handle complex cases, but the lower courts are less reliable. This is a post-Soviet problem of course, one that afflicts all of the countries whose judicial systems were once Soviet.  It will take time, as it requires a change in mentality.   Judges still feel they should automatically side with the government in tax cases, for instance, and this is discouraging to investors. Investors need a stable environment with rules and regulations that do not change constantly. Taxes are constantly in flux, and companies must work hard to keep up with the latest changes.  Government priorities also change, and despite much talk of economic diversification, this is not really happening. Visa and work permit regulations also need updating, so that companies can bring in senior foreign staff where local staff capacity is still not well developed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will Expo 2017 affect the development of infrastructure in Astana?</h4><p><span></span>Right now, Astana is preparing its tourism infrastructure for the Expo-2017. We have already started building a new railway station in the capital, capable of servicing 35,000 passengers, and we are planning to modernize the city airport. There has been 29 million tenge allocated for the construction of new airport terminal and reconstruction of the landing and takeoff area. Financial inputs and mass construction will allow us to double the service capacity of the airport by 2017; from 3.5 to 7.1 million passengers per year. We will also construct two new bus terminals and special lanes for public transport — called the BRT. The BRT will stretch for 48km, which will allow us to transport large number of passengers and improve the public transportation system in general. We are planning to build 10 separate parking areas, new hotels, and restaurants as well as other amenities. In addition to the hotels in Astana, we are planning to create several eco-villages in close proximity to the capital—similar to the Olympic villages. In the city itself, a 50MW solar power station is being built. This project will be implemented with the help of private investments.</p><h4>How do local companies participate in the construction of these objects?</h4><p><span></span>"Astana EXPO-2017" is promoting the participation of different regions of the country in the preparation for the Expo, in order to provide business for SMEs that produce the materials necessary for the construction of Expo Center in Astana. As part of this plan, 19 agreements have been signed between the general construction managers and material manufacturers from North Kazakhstan, Karaganda, and the Pavlodar regions, and the local administration of Astana, for the overall sum of 59.6 billion tenge. We are constructing the Expo Center and using mainly locally produced materials—structures from reinforced concrete, poling, panels, profiled metal, pipes, radiators, automated fire alarm systems, ventilation, special clothing, and other types of goods. We are certain that all these measures will allow us to not only support the local businesses during times of decreased economic activity, but to also stimulate them towards further development. We are planning to continue with this strategy by organizing food services, retail trade, hotel business and other details necessary for such a large international event.</p><h4>What have been the main plans in preparation for Expo 2015?</h4><p><span></span>This year, Kazakhstan will participate in the global EXPO-2015, held from May 1 to October 31 in Milan. The topic of this expo is “Feed the planet—Energy of life." 148 countries will take part in the Milan Expo. Kazakhstan will have its own pavilion, consisting of several exposition zones dedicated to such topics as agriculture, animal husbandry, interesting facts about Kazakhstan, aquaculture of Kazakhstan, ecology of Kazakhstan, and agriculture of the future. Historically, our country has incredible experience in agricultural activities and animal husbandry, and we are proud of our organic produce, Kazakhstan's experience in land farming, and successful experience of Academic Barayev. Our representatives will demonstrate the aquaculture successes of Kazakhstan and our experience of restoring the Aral Sea. Scientists and researchers from Kazakhstan will present their findings and projects at our national pavilion. Besides this, we want to introduce the guests of the Expo to our national cuisine. I expect a lot of attention to gravitate towards our pavilion because Kazakhstan is due to be hosting the next Expo. We should present a good image of Kazakhstan on the international level.</p><h4>How will you use the buildings and infrastructure for the Expo 2017 after the event has finished?</h4><p><span></span>We are planning to create a sustainable city area that will unite scientific, technological, and cultural objects, surrounded by open spaces and residential complexes, commercial, recreational, and business sites. Even at the current stage of planning for the pavilions, we are looking into many possibilities for rationally using the structure after the Expo. We will do everything to use every inch of the pavilions efficiently. Right now, the National Company "Astana EXPO-2017" is working on the strategy for the post-event use of the buildings, which will be confirmed by July 1, 2015. Constructed pavilions and other objects will be repurposed: they will be used as centers for scientific research, training centers, and recreational centers. Post-expo complex will include a Science-Tech Park comprised of clusters specialized in energetics, environmental studies, and technology, a well as a Complex for Culture and Arts, residential buildings and hotels, commercial zones, and sports venues.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Kazakhstan's car market?</h4><p><span></span>Kazakhstan's car market has been significantly affected by fluctuation in ruble's exchange rate. The dealers' prices became less competitive under such circumstances. We expect the market to shrink  by 60%. There is a truly difficult year ahead of us, but we hope the situation will improve in the coming three months as the prices go up in Russia.</p><h4>What is the significance of the recently opened Toyota City center in the Central Asia, which is the largest of its kind?</h4><p><span></span>The opening was a long-awaited event because Toyota is the brand of choice in Kazakhstan, and wait times at the two other service centers were an inconvenience for our customers. There are no lines now. On top of that, we are also providing express service, which is twice as fast as normal service. Customers come to Toyota first, and we are consistently working to improve the range of the services that we provide and improve quality. </p><h4>What financing incentives does Toyota-City offer?</h4><p><span></span>We make a real effort to meet the demands of our customers. Together with five financial institutions, including TFS (Toyota Financial System), we offer a number of products such as loans, installment payments, and operational and financial leasing. We also provide insurance products such as CNC, liability insurance, service insurance, and quite a few other insurance packages.</p><h4>What are the most popular Toyota vehicles in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span>The complete range of Toyota can be seen in Kazakhstan, however, the most popular ones are the Camry and the Land Cruiser. Last year Toyota introduced a new model to the market—the Toyota Fortuner. This vehicle is the first Toyota assembled in Kazakhstan. We acknowledge that it will take time for customers to appreciate the advantages of this model, but we see great potential for it in Kazakhstan. Toyota Fortuner is a perfect car for Kazakstan's roads and extreme weather conditions. It is already taking off in the countryside and in the mining and oil sector.</p><h4>Could you tell us about Toyota's share of the automotive market in Kazakhstan, and what you are doing to increase its share?</h4><p><span></span>Over the past 15 years, Toyota's share of the market dropped from 47% to 8.2% because of the other car producers entering the market, including more affordable brands such as Hyundai, Daewoo, Lada, Chevrolet, and Kia. Kazakhstan's customers understand that Toyota is a quality brand, but still opt for the cheaper option. We are trying to show customers that it is more reasonable to buy a Toyota in the long run. Toyota's share will reach 10% in the near future as we recover our share.</p><h4>Could you tell us a bit more about Toyota-City's plans for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Toyota-City Almaty will keep focusing on the customers' needs. We would like to remain a client-oriented company moving forward. We hope to keep our old customers, as well as attract new ones. Toyota will keep working to improve the quality of its services.  In 2015, we are opening a special test drive track to test-drive Toyotas on various road conditions. We are also opening a new Japanese restaurant at the service center and are planning to set up a special kids' zone. In addition, we are planning on opening a body shop, which will allow us to provide a full range of services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How are sports a part of the culture in Abu Dhabi and the UAE?</h4>
<p>Whether water sports, such as sailing and swimming, or equestrian sports, polo, or camel racing, there is a strong historical connection between the people of the UAE and sports, both traditional and modern. The late Sheikh Zayed continuously supported sport and the construction of sporting venues. In 1979 we hosted the qualifications for the Asian Cup at Zayed Stadium, our national stadium, which still hosts many leading football and sports events today. We also had an ice skating rink built in Zayed Sports City around the same time. We are proud today that the Abu Dhabi ice hockey team is becoming one of the top Division III teams in the Asian league. This is from a city not known for its winter sports. We also founded the Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Sports Academy for Women's Sports to raise awareness and education about sport for women, and to sponsor some of Abu Dhabi's female sporting talents. These and other sporting developments in Abu Dhabi began with Sheikh Zayed's vision, and continue today with our leadership and our passion for sport. The role of sport is very important for our communities, our families, and our country.</p>
<h4>What is the next phase of development for the sports sector in Abu Dhabi?</h4>
<p>At this stage we are trying to bring in more sporting events that have a direct benefit on the community and individuals using a one-to-one or B2B approach, thus promoting sport as a lifestyle. We would like to keep our calendar busy throughout the year, but we are selective in what we host, mainly choosing events that have an international appeal, while not overlapping with local sporting events. We are also aiming to establish different classes of tournaments. There is a need for a mix between hosting official tournaments sanctioned by world federations and other countries, and having exhibition tournaments with a more social appeal. Part of our vision now is to concentrate on hosting sanctioned tournaments that are part of the tournament calendars of world federations.</p>
<h4>How important is it for private-sector companies to play a role in promoting sports and sporting events in Abu Dhabi?</h4>
<p>Commercially, we would like to bring on board more companies from the private sector to show them that they can participate in sports by sponsoring social events or big international events. Major companies such as HSBC, Etihad, Mercedes Benz, Borouge, and ADNOC are doing a very good job. They are giving more, and truly understand the role they can play within the sporting community. They believe in the message that sports can deliver. When companies sponsor or work in partnership with an event they see immediate economic returns.</p>
<h4><br />What is your main aim as you look to the future of sport in Abu Dhabi?</h4>
<p>Now with both the infrastructure in place and the government support, there is an opportunity to have more champions in different sports, whether it is running, cycling, the triathlon, or tennis. This is what we are working toward and planning for in the future. As an example, Mohammed Khalifa Al Qubaisi is the President of the Emirates Bowling Federation; he is very successful in his career working with ADNOC, but in 1983 he was also the World Bowling Champion. We also have two chess world champions. These sporting figures act as role models. We would like to nurture more sporting heroes in different disciplines. For our champions it is a great source of national pride and the whole country gets involved.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Today's world is facing new challenges and threats. Its economy has still not recovered from the consequences of the global financial and economic crisis. And meanwhile, the geopolitical crisis and sanctions policy of the leading powers create additional obstacles for recovery.</p><p><span></span>From my experience, I feel that 2015 will be a time of global trials. The entire architecture of the world will be changing. Only strong states, with their people united, will manage to face these obstacles. Kazakhstan, as a part of the world economy and a country located close to the epicentre of geopolitical tensions, is also experiencing several challenges. The results are clearly observable: prices in global markets are dropping, and general economic growth is slowing down. We need to revise our own plans, and make adjustments for the coming period. There is no time for hesitation. The measures I will talk about today will be implemented in 2015.</p><p><span></span>The government is already working quickly at my order. We have revised the parameters of the republic's budget for 2015. And this is the right approach, as the drop in prices of raw material exports has led to the reduction of our national income. At the same time, the government has a tough, yet specific task: it must fulfil all social responsibilities in full.</p><p><span></span>In a time of crisis, such as we are experincing the world over, economic policies must be re-evaluated. The sectors that need support are those that create the highest multiplier effect on economic growth and employment. We have already had such an experience. Suffice it to recall our successful anti-crisis measures in 2007-2009. As you see, life makes adjustments to the best-laid plans. And we should add new content to the platform of our party based on today's reality.</p><p><span></span>On my instruction, the government has completed the drafting of a new large-scale development program. Today, as we respond to the challenges we face, I take the occasion to proclaim Kazakhstan's New Economic Policy “Nurly Zhol" (The Bright Road).</p><p><span></span>Over the years, when the situation in external markets was favorable, and the prices of oil and our export products were at a sufficiently high level, we diverted revenues from those exports to the National Fund. One of the main tasks of the National Fund is to increase the resistance of our economy to external shocks, including a decline in the prices of natural resources. Now we are in the period when we must use these reserves, as they will help us overcome times of unease and stimulate economic growth.</p><p><span></span>In February, a decision was made to allocate KZT1 trillion from the National Fund to support economic growth and employment in 2014-15 in two tranches of KZT500 billion. To finalize the initiated projects and resolve pressing issues, I have instructed the government to divert the second tranche of KZT500 billion from the National Fund to the following goals. First, KZT100 billion should be allocated to the issuing of easy-term loans to small and medium-sized businesses, as well as large enterprises. This will secure the implementation of projects in the food and chemical industries, and engineering, as well as the service sector.</p><p><span></span>Second, to revive the banking sector and buy out “bad" loans, I have ordered additional capitalization of the Fund of Problem Loans in the amount of KZT250 billion in 2015.</p><p><span></span>Third, to raise new investments, we need to improve respective conditions. For these purposes, I have ordered the government to allocate KZT81 billion in 2015 to complete the construction of the “dry port" complex, the infrastructure of the special economic zones at Khorgos—East Gate and the National Industrial Petrochemical Technological Park in Atyrau and Taraz.</p><p><span></span>Fourth, to continue the construction of the Expo 2017, I have ordered the allocation of KZT40 billion in 2015, adding to the already allocated KZT25 billion.</p><p><span></span>Fifth, on the eve of Expo 2017, we need to take care of the development of Astana's transport infrastructure. This year the capital's airport will reach its maximum capacity of 3.5 million people. Therefore, to increase its potential, I have ordered the allocation in 2015 of KZT29 billion towards the construction of a new terminal and a reconstruction of the landing strip. This will allow us to increase the airport capacity to 7.1 million passengers per year by 2017.</p><p><span></span>In light of new external risks for the development of our economy, we need fresh initiatives to stimulate business activity and employment. The Infrastructure Development Plan, which I want to make public today, will become the core of the New Economic Policy. It is intended to last for five years and is to run in parallel with the Second Five Year term of the Programme of Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development. More than 100 foreign companies intend to participate in its implementation. The total investment portfolio will amount to KZT6 trillion, with the state contributing 15% of the total. All the regions of Kazakhstan need to be closely connected by railroads, highways, and air services. The nine roads connecting with each other in Astana are like the roots of life, spreading our capital's creative spirit. Improving interconnectivity between the regions will eventually lead to a greater domestic wellbeing. It will strengthen trade and economic ties between the regions. New markets will emerge from within the country.</p><p><span></span>We established the National Fund mainly to provide stable social and economic development, and to protect our country's economy from unpredictable circumstances. It is now time to use this fund to meet our needs. Kazakhstan should avoid repeating the mistakes of other countries. We have to use our internal resources efficiently for economic growth.</p><p><span></span>The New Economic Policy “Nurly Zhol" will become a driver of growth in our economy during the coming years: 200,000 new jobs will be created by the construction of roads alone. And this means greater employment and growth of income for the population. “Nurly Zhol" will create a multiplier effect in other economic sectors: production of cement, metal, machinery, bitumen, equipment, and related services. Roads are lifelines for Kazakhstan. Life has always emerged and developed in our vast expanses around roads. Yet we must create a transport network such that car, railway, and airlines stretch in all directions from Astana.</p><p><span></span>The new lines built by the people of Kazakhstan will renew our economy and community. They will firmly link all corners of our country with its center. Cargo traffic will accelerate and increase. The volume of transit through the country will grow. Our citizens will drive on modern and quality highways, and will be able to get to any region quickly and safely. Social infrastructure will improve, while new and modern schools and hospitals will provide high-quality services. Finally, these will impact the welfare and quality of life of each citizen of Kazakhstan. And the main consideration is that all of this will remain in our land as the wealth of our future generations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Kazakhstan's keenness to build a firm and advanced relationship with the Kingdom of Bahrain deserves our thanks and appreciation, as this is the common goal we aim to achieve. During a recent official visit we signed a number of joint memorandums of understanding (MoUs) in the fields of politics, industry, food security, agriculture, culture, education, finance, investment, and media. These MoUs will solidify our aspired integration to serve the interests of our nations and people.</p><p>At the economic level, which has become the core interest of nations worldwide, we have been keen to bring businesspeople from both countries together to encourage the conclusion of financial, trade, and agricultural agreements and MoUs. And moreover, we have been able to optimize the benefits from available investment opportunities in both countries in numerous sectors, such as the Islamic banking sector, a promising and rapidly growing field in which Bahrain possesses great expertise. We also encourage the participation of the public and private sectors in Expo 2017 in Astana, and we push for educational, cultural, and tourism cooperation between our countries.</p><p><span></span>In the near future, we seek to sign an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation on income and tax evasion. Also, by activating the Joint Bahrain-Kazakhstan Business Council, we can move bilateral trade and economic relations forward to a much broader level. President Nazarbayev's keenness to cement the brotherly ties of cooperation with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states is something highly appreciated by all the Gulf leaders and peoples, and we can build on the genuine ties and strong will that unite us to attain further cooperation and coordination in different fields. In this context, the Kingdom of Bahrain, along with its GCC sister states, seeks to launch free trade negotiations with Kazakhstan to attain the desired integration.</p><p><span></span>It is a source of admiration and appreciation to have seen all of this development and growth taking place in the friendly state of Kazakhstan across many fields, something to be added to the credits of the country, which has contributed with its distinguished scholars to the enrichment of the Islamic civilization and advancement of humanity, and still does, under President Nazarbayev's wise leadership, with even greater contributions in various domains and creativity fields, in an advanced country that enjoys prevalent security, stability, and optimism. The President has many leading initiatives, notably his call for the First Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building in Asia, which was for the purposes of reinforcing peace, settling conflicts, consolidating regional and global cooperation against terrorism, and promoting tolerance and mutual understanding.</p><p><span></span>I strongly believe that the shared interests and common goals that unite us in deep-rooted Asia, such as civilized heritage, great potential, and a common fate constitute an opportunity for us to move with Asia from the stage of cooperation to a strong alliance. We fully support Kazakhstan's initiative to transform the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building in Asia into an international organization. Perhaps the most outstanding example of the existing rapprochement between us is our common interest in reinforcing dialogue among civilizations and faiths, a field where our two countries boast leading initiatives.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Kazakhstan is on the rise, a dynamic country that is poised to become a high-income economy by the end of this decade. And it is a country that also wants to play a bigger role in the region and in the world, not just an emerging market but an emerging power. That is why I want to strengthen relations between our two countries to help us both to succeed in the global race. During a recent diplomatic visit to Kazakhstan we agreed to open a new chapter in our relationship. The strategic partnership agreement that we've signed will take our relationship to a new level, a relationship based on strong economic ties, on closer cooperation on security and defense, and on increasing links between our people.</p><p>First, our economic ties. Britain is already the second largest investor in Kazakhstan, with companies like Shell and BG Group playing a leading role in the development of Kazakhstan's energy sector, as I saw for myself at Kashagan. But I believe we can go further, broadening the scope of investment and trade between our two countries to new sectors, like education, healthcare, retail, and financial services. That is why I brought a leading and diverse business delegation with me, to see the opportunities on offer and to link them up with their Kazakhstani counterparts.</p><p><span></span>We want to double bilateral trade by 2017, and on the visit we had British businesses concluded deals that will be worth more than £700 million, over $1 billion, from companies like Atkins, which has agreed on a new partnership to work on projects in Aktau and Astana, to Aberdeen-based Wood Group, which signed a new venture to provide essential equipment for the oil and gas sector.</p><p><span></span>But I do not want this trading relationship to be one way; I also want to encourage Kazakhstani companies to invest in Britain. That is why we have launched a new business visa service in Astana that streamlines and accelerates the process for leading Kazakhstani companies.</p><p><span></span>We also want to increase our cooperation on defense and foreign affairs. We have also discussed how we can work together on a range of foreign policy issues, especially on Afghanistan and Iran.</p><p><span></span>I believe that the President's moral authority, as a country that has prospered from giving up nuclear weapons, sets a clear example to other governments of the benefits of being nuclear weapons free.</p><p><span></span>Finally we have also discussed how we can strengthen ties between our people. I paid a visit to Nazarbayev University and visited the engineering faculty established by UCL. As Kazakhstan seeks to meet its target of one in five universities offering double degree programs with foreign universities, I believe there are real opportunities for British universities to offer higher educational, vocational training and English-language training.</p><p><span></span>And we also want to attract the brightest and best students to come to Britain. That is why we agreed to explore how we can extend the Bolashak Program, which has already seen more than 3,000 Kazakhstanis study in the UK to industry attachments. Bolashak means future, and I believe that is what our relationship is all about, a future based on closer cooperation right across the breadth of our partnership. Kazakhstan has an exciting future ahead of it, and Britain wants to be a major part of that future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Steel Going Strong]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[steel-going-strong]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the current state of the steel market?</h4><p><span></span>Overall, 2013 and 2014 have been difficult years for the global steel industry, mainly because of overcapacity, and the economic situation in China—where almost half the global production of steel is located—has been slowing down, which has had an effect on the entire steel industry worldwide. In addition, the European economy has been slowing down over the last two years. However, in this region, steel demand has been, and will always be, at least for the coming years, strong and healthy. In the UAE and the Gulf region in general, there has always been significant demand for steel due to high levels of investment in construction, infrastructure, and energy. If you talk about the Emirates market specifically during 2013 and 2014, we have been seeing relatively stable demand. We have sold what we have produced all over the world and we have a significant domestic market share. From the market point of view, I think we have been doing well.</p><h4>To what do you attribute your increase in revenues, and what is your strategy to continue this trend moving forward?</h4><p><span></span>With Phase II specifically, the heavy section mill came strongly into play in 2013 as well as in 2014. We produced 316,000 tons of structural steel in 2013, which is significant for a new facility like this. This gave a strong boost to our sales and also to the bottom line profit. For years, we have been planning the diversification of our products, and what I see now, specifically in 2014, is that we are reaping the benefits of our heavy section mill expansion. Our strategy is to really diversify away from rebar, wire rod, and focus on structural steel and perhaps one day on flat steel products.</p><h4>What have been some of the key markets for Emirates Steel this year?</h4><p><span></span>It varies from product to product. From the rebar point of view, we sold nearly 63% of the product domestically. For sections, I would expect in 2014 to grab 50% of the local UAE market in 2014, while the remainder would be exported abroad. Our main export market is Saudi Arabia. Apart from focusing on our domestic markets, we exert sustained efforts in increasing our exports to regional markets, with a YoY increase of 67%, our most significant export markets being the GCC states. We also sell to the Arab countries, Australasia, the Indian subcontinent, Africa, and Asia. Our newest markets include Europe and the US.</p><h4>How is the company progressing toward its target to reach 30% Emiratization by 2018?</h4><p><span></span>In 2006, Emiratization at Emirates Steel was at about 9%. Today, we are at 19%, and in few years' time, we expect to reach our 30% target. I think we have really succeeded in encouraging UAE nationals to join the company at different levels, from technical to engineering to administration. We have more than 400 UAE nationals in the company now. Our government mandate is to develop UAE nationals with expertise in the steel industry, which is relatively new in the UAE compared to oil and gas. There are opportunities for UAE nationals within the industrial sector in general and steel in particular, and we are encouraging people to join us and share our strides towards success and prosperity. There are many steel production units here in the country, but integrated steel manufacturing is an entirely new and unique concept to the UAE; it presents a range of opportunities for UAE nationals to gather knowledge and experience.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for the company over the years?</h4><p><span></span>First of all, ADVOC is in a strategically located port. In the early days, the company was set up with the primary aim to supply Iraq. While this plan had some success, the demand was not consistent and thus the company revised the business model with a view to ensuring the factory was fully engaged on a regular basis. ADVOC began producing Coroli brand products in Abu Dhabi in 2000 and 2004, and bought Cebag Middle East Limited, the owner of the Coroli brand, amongst other brands. ADVOC thus acquired the Coroli brand ownership rights for the MENA region, plus the Cebag trading business. This proved to be a significant milestone because it got the company away from relying on government tenders, which came on an irregular basis. Between 2004 and 2009, we built up a significant distribution network in all of the countries in the region, from East Africa to Pakistan and we now deal with all of the GCC for Coroli and other ADVOC brands. We also make private label brands for selected major clients. In 2010 we began a major program of upgrades and installed several automated sections to our plant including high-speed filling lines plus robotic packing and palletizing. In 2012 we expanded our factory capacity by about 25% increasing both efficiency and output. In 2013, we added a custom built modern PET bottle making plant. We are now capable of making most of our own bottles and we plan to add further capacity as demand increases. In 2014, we also acquired a plot adjacent to our refinery that will double our current factory area.</p><h4>What is your company's strategy for being as customer orientated as possible?</h4><p><span></span>We check our audit data to see how the product is perceived. We always get feedback through our people and solicit feedback from the trade. The Coroli brand has been around for 35-40 years and it has built a good client base throughout the region as well innovating a lot with the packaging. You need to provide a quality, competitive product and you need to provide support for advertising and promotion in order to keep the trade and the consumers happy.</p><h4>What countries are you present in at the moment?</h4><p><span></span>Most of the business goes to the GCC and up to the Levant with Saudi Arabia being probably an even larger market than the UAE. Despite the various conflicts in the region we are still able to continue to supply parts of Syria plus Lebanon, and Jordan, and down to Tanzania and some of the top-end African countries. We have had a long business relationship with Pakistan, Nepal, and the Seychelles. It is quite a spread over all of these places, although the bulk of the business is done nearby.</p><h4>What is your plan for the future?</h4><p><span></span>We intend to expand into the African markets, and in time we will also further expand and upgrade into other nearby countries such as Iraq and Iran when matters improve. We have traditionally dealt with Iraq; however, when trouble starts, business goes down; it is a difficult place to do business. However, these are quite attractive and sizable markets. In the future, ADVOC will increase the output capability of the refinery further, including adding specialty fats like shortening, margarine, and fats for the bakery, hotels, restaurants, and catering segment. This will not just be here in Abu Dhabi, but throughout. This will give us a wider range of products. We have a substantial network of distributors, so it is easy for us to tack that on. We are also going to improve some of the product types that we make and widen the range of our existing products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Strata Manufacturing, which is a subsidiary of Mubadala, was set up in 2010. What would you consider to be some of the key landmarks, and what were their impacts on the company?</h4><p><span></span>Our vision was inspired by the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 to diversify and building a knowledge-based economy in which UAE nationals will take leadership roles. The vision has identified aerospace as a key sector, and Mubadala decided to invest in composite aero structure manufacturing. This vision drove us to our first successful milestone, which was building our 21,000sqm manufacturing facility in 10 months and delivering our first A330 flap track fairings shipset to Airbus three months thereafter. Another milestone is our progress within the aerospace global value chain. We have moved from becoming a Tier 2 to a Tier 1 supplier for both Airbus and Boeing. Our third milestone has been earning the trust of our customers to manufacture their primary parts, as opposed to the secondary parts that we initially manufactured. Today, we are the single source supplier for every part we produce.</p><h4>How would you describe the overall growth strategy of Strata?</h4><p><span></span>We started out with simple and moveable parts on the wing. However, our fascination has been with the wing and empennage of an aircraft. The empennage is important because it is almost always made out of composites, and these parts are critical for the safety of an aircraft. Therefore, it requires high level of capability development. In terms of revenue, it has high margins. By creating different parts of the wing, we can integrate and assemble a complete wing. We are not going to go towards the wings, however, rather Strata have a commitment from Boeing to manufacture the vertical fin in Al-Ain, which is part of the empennage of the new Boeing B787. In terms of people, this would be our greatest achievement. Most of the technicians that are working on the shop floor and manufacturing parts are high school graduates that went through a training program with four months of foundation training, six months of technical training with Lockheed-Martin, and then 12 months of on-the-job training. Once they complete 22 months, we certify that this person is a qualified aerospace technician.</p><h4>What factors will contribute to achieving your AED1 billion target by 2020?</h4><p><span></span>Strategy is of no use if you cannot deliver products on time, to the high standard that has been promised, and manage the cost parameters to make sure that you are profitable. The number one factor for success is to ensure that you deliver on time within the quality standards that have been promised and at a manageable cost. Once you do that, you gain credibility. Once you gain credibility, you can gain more commitments from the OEMs.</p><h4>How would you describe your international expansion strategy?</h4><p><span></span>Two elements play a role here. The first is competitiveness. The customer, despite offering many commitments, is always going to insist that you be competitive. To be competitive, we need to have a low-cost partner. For us, this would probably come from the North African or East Asian region. They will be from India, China, or Malaysia. However, because we are close to Europe, the potential exists to partner with an entity in North Africa, either Morocco, or Tunisia. The customer will also think about minimizing risk. What the customer will want is proximity to the final assembly line.  By being closer to the customer, you can essentially fabricate the parts but assemble closer to the location, which minimizes risk, cost of shipping, and increases competitiveness. This sort of cooperation is what we are hoping to bring in to the industry to be more competitive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Our expansion into French-speaking Africa, which increased our presence to 19 markets across the MENA region, was perhaps out biggest achievement in 2014. This endeavor is a sea change for Etisalat, so our goal to become the world's most-admired telecoms company in emerging markets was further realized this past year. The year was accompanied by stronger than predicted figures along with the continuation of steady growth in our home market in the UAE. We also established strong global partnerships to develop new, cutting-edge technologies such as 5G.</p><h4>What are some of the ways you are working toward improving your network quality and connectivity?</h4><p><span></span>In the UAE in 2014 we invested $680 million in bringing 4G to its fullest potential. We also further expanded our fiber-to-the-home network, with efforts to reach 90% of UAE households in 2015. I am proud to say that we remain the dominant force in the UAE's mobile industry. This is due to our consistently innovative product and service offerings, coupled with the competitive prices we offer.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for investment in the mobile segment here in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>The number one thing is to improve the connectivity or the quality and the speed. That is why we are investing heavily in 4G and eventually 5G. We also want to be a partner in the innovation framework. Today, mobile phones are the center of most people's lives through communication and contacts. You never leave home without it, and it is no longer an accessory. We have to make it simple for people to use services on their device, whether they are government or financial, for example. We also have to provide enough security so that people feel safe when they use mobile service. We want to become the enabler for people and the role that technology plays in it.</p><h4>How are you looking to improve your position in your other countries of involvement around the world and where will your focus be in the near future?</h4><p><span></span>Last year was a critical year for Etisalat as an international operator. The milestone of acquiring Maroc Telecom—one of the largest in the region's history—has added strong value to Etisalat's global footprint. The world is more connected than ever before. And as we've been talking about, with the expansion of data and the digitization of services, access to quality telecommunications is increasingly becoming a necessity; not merely a luxury. Our expansion in Africa delivers affordable, accessible mobile technology to thousands of people in these markets. This is literally changing people's lives. Our portfolio of services is geared towards fostering improvements in education, healthcare, finance, and many other essential areas.</p><h4>What are Etisalat's aspirations and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p><span></span>HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, Ruler of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, has made the establishment of Smart Cities across the UAE a priority. As a result Etisalat has received consistent support from the UAE government as we work to develop the infrastructure and digital architecture that Smart Cities will be built on. Given this aspiration, and our own goals—both for EXPO 2020 and in a general sense as innovator—we will be heavily focused in these areas in the year to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

To support that, ADSIC is mandated to be the IT standards authority and the e-government enabler, provide expert advice for modernization, and align government efforts to provide innovative world-class services to the end-user. ADSIC's shared government initiatives including Abu Dhabi Government Contact Centre, e-Citizen Program, Abu Dhabi Spatial Data Infrastructure, Abu Dhabi Portal, CityGuard Application, Jobs Abu Dhabi, and the newly introduced government correspondence management system (Taresh).</p><h4>What are some Green IT initiatives that ADSIC is implementing, and what is the expected impact on reducing Abu Dhabi's carbon footprint?</h4><p><span></span>One of the core benefits of e-Government services is that it is inherently greener than the processes that were in place just a few years ago. Customers don't need to drive from one government department to another to complete a series of forms, for example, and those forms are no longer printed on paper and stored in archives. Specific initiatives, such as CityGuard and the Abu Dhabi Government Contact Centre, allow residents of Abu Dhabi to identify environmental concerns that can then be swiftly rectified by the relevant government entities.</p><h4>With mobile being one of the fastest growing segments in the ICT space, how is ADSIC investing in mobile technology and mobile service integration?</h4><p><span></span>Mobile services are crucial for the next era of e-government. Later in 2015, we will announce our plan to provide a top-notch, integrated m-Government service offering. It is one of our highest priorities at the moment.</p><h4>What is ADSIC's current level of Emiratization, and how is ADISC working to enhance the national skill-level within the ICT sector?</h4><p><span></span>Ensuring Emiratis are able to enter the ICT sector is a priority area of focus for ADSIC; however, it is just the start of our responsibility to the population of Abu Dhabi. Our e-Citizen Programme seeks to provide or improve ICT skills of UAE nationals who are not e-literate, enabling them to operate a computer, use the internet, and leverage the e-government services offered by ADSIC.</p><h4>How do envision ADSIC growing and evolving in its role over the next five years as the main e-Government services provider in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p><span></span>Our focus will be on integrating services across government entities better, and our soon to be released plan for m-Government will be a driving factor in how we conduct our day-to-day operations. We also plan to focus on educating the population on cyber threats. In the ICT sector, you have to be engaged in a constant process of improvement to your systems and procedures in order to safeguard information from cyber threats.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p><span></span>We know that m-Government will be a major part of 2015 for ADSIC and a number of other key government entities, but that only covers our efforts on the consumer/customer side of the equation. The Abu Dhabi government is aggressively pursuing a strategy to create smart cities throughout the Emirate. In regard to green initiatives, some of the most important things being done in ICT in this region to combat climate change stem from the creation of smart cities: automation of district cooling and improved efficiency of roads and transport systems, to name but two. Creating a truly smart city is a huge undertaking; however, the benefits to consumers, the cost savings, and the positive environmental impact make it of great strategic importance to ADSIC and the Abu Dhabi government.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the commercial arm of the Abu Dhabi Media Zone Authority, twofour54 was set up to nurture entrepreneurship in media and entertainment. How would you describe the creative environment and the work culture at twofour54?</h4><p><span></span>A group of 30 people started up this company in 2008. From day one we wanted to reflect creativity, teamwork, and a unique sense of environment, differentiating ourselves from companies that fall under the government and follow a specific structure. This does not mean that our processes are not fully compliant with the government, but there is a different look and feel of twofour54 and in how people operate here. This is a loose environment where we allow for creativity, and it is an environment where we allow people to express themselves. At the end of the day, they are part of a creative sector that is commercially based. In our creative lab, we have a video editing room, an audio editing room,  and tablets for creatives to work on their films, animations, or games, and also a game area to help generate ideas and encourage the flow of creativity—all for free. Individuals can come here during the weekends too. This is where we harness their creative energy.</p><h4>In terms of content and new developments, what are some current projects taking place at twofour54?</h4><p><span></span>We have partners like CNN, Sky News Arabia, and Cartoon Network set up here, and each one of them is responsible for its own target when it comes to its content or news segments. The Ubisoft studio developed a full iOS (iPad compatible) game called CSI: Hidden Crimes in Abu Dhabi with some graduates of Ubisoft Abu Dhabi, and it currently has over 13 million downloads. Furthermore, season two of an Emirati animation called Mansour supported by Mubadala, which used to be done outside the UAE, will be fully developed here in the Cartoon Network studios. We will also start filming the GCC version of Sesame Street, Iftah Ya Simsim, by the end of 2014, and it will show in 2015 on all GCC channels. We plan to have a channel on YouTube that will show the short films that are being made at twofour54; more than 400 members from our creative lab are volunteering on those short films. We have received a request from Etihad Airways to work on a documentary that shows the stories of Emirati pilots and cadets. These projects are helping our ecosystem by bringing more professionals, young creatives, and enthusiasts to twofour54; our creative lab now has more than 10,000 registered members. Our production services arm, intaj, has supported the production of more than 18,000 hours of content from its Abu Dhabi studios. intaj works closely with the Abu Dhabi Film Commission to encourage international films to be filmed here, such as Fast and Furious 7, Star Wars 7, and Bollywood films. We have also arranged for two episodes of the BBC's Top Gear to be filmed here.</p><h4>Following the Abu Dhabi Media Summit in 2014, the three themes are distribution, content, and finance. What were the main topics discussed?</h4><p><span></span>At the 2014 Summit we talked about how to build a sustainable media ecosystem in the Middle East. From a financing perspective, we wanted to talk about how start-ups can be taken to the next level. From a distribution and content perspective, there is a lot of piracy taking place and that, too, was a major topic of discussion. People were also talking a lot about the mobilization of content. In the coming year, we will be hosting people from Europe, the US, the region, and the Far East to talk about their models. For instance, the Hulu and Netflix models do not exist here yet. We discussed the major developments in the industry, such as new gadgets and technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In a highly specialized industry, labor represents an important part of success. How does your human capital policy attract the expertise required to support your operations?</h4><p><span></span>When we talk about human resources, we talk about our own business. We have to look at what differentiates one operator from another, in the sense that the same regulation is applied to all by civil aviation, but it doesn't make a big difference except in the caliber of the people that you use to carry out the task. Therefore, we have been very conscious of the fact that we are a service provider. Our focus and strategy has developed and evolved on providing quality services to our clients, meaning to achieve this we have to attract, train, and retrain human capital, which is what we do now. The main focus of this organization is on the production side, people who work on the anchor floor, engineers, and pilots, to make sure we will always have the best. Therefore, we provide them a decent way of living. To achieve this objective, we always try to look at what is important to the employee. We look at logistics support. Graduates travel in and out and they work from six to six. As a part of our plan, Abu Dhabi is becoming a busy city, and we offer our own accommodation for employee families. We started providing accommodation for our single workers, but now we are moving our plan toward employee families as well. We try to maximize what we can do for them. The other part of the plan is to ensure that our employees are aware of their job, what they want to do, and when they need to deliver. Basically, this is our human resources policy, and I think over the years it has proven to be a great strategy, as we have had some people with us for more than 25 years.</p><h4>The largest share of your business is to support the offshore oil industry. In which other sectors are you looking to expand?</h4><p><span></span>Offshore is our bread and butter; this is what we have done for years. When it comes to other sectors, we started with search and rescue, and we gained a significant amount of experience in Saudi Arabia with the Red Crescent. Actually, it is been excellent being part of its program because it was just starting up, and we started with it. It was a challenging experience, because we were dealing with clients that wanted to start a new business in a new area with new rules and regulations, and they were trying to do it independently. This kind of environment has created a quality team with a high amount of knowledge in the business. After three years, we started to focus in-house, and we were able to win a similar activity with an oil company in the UAE by providing medical support. Abu Dhabi Aviation partners with specialists who provide medical care; we provide the aircraft, and this partnership provides the ideal solution for our clients. I believe this is a good strategy, and we are expanding the business and providing more training courses. We built our own simulator, which will cover the training needs of all our clients in the UAE and the MENA region. Clients in the Middle East do not need to go to Europe for training anymore. To expand this business, we have a separate building just for the simulator, and we are trying to develop it to be an international hub for helicopter training. This will mean that different platforms, aircraft, and manufacturers can come here and we will be able to offer training to many clients. Additionally, we do fire fighting courses in Europe, seismic work, VIP transfers, filming, and lifting. For example, to celebrate 100 years of Aston Martin in 2013, we lifted an Aston Martin Vanquish to the top of the Burj Al Arab in Dubai.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the primary strategy of the Federal Land and Marine Transport Authority (FLMTA) when it comes to regulating the transport sector?</h4><p><span></span>The FLMTA is the federal authority that regulates land and maritime transport for the whole of the UAE, including railways. For maritime, we are now registering all of the ships in the UAE (except for fishing boats, which is done by the Ministry of Environment). We are the representatives for the country at the International Maritime Organization (IMO). We are the maritime authority for the UAE. The UAE has its own maritime law, which was promulgated in 1981, and we are now trying to update it. In terms of land transport, we are working according to the land transport law, which was approved in 2011.</p><h4>What laws do you have regarding land transport?</h4><p><span></span>The land transport law was approved in 2011, and we started to implement it in 2013. It works in three phases. The first is that we have to register the company. We are almost done with this and we are continuing. Now, we are issuing the permission for trucks and buses for transportation. It is mainly in the truck side of transportation, and we began this at the start of September 2014. We are now implementing this law ,and we have to see its impact on the economy, the UAE, and neighboring countries. Then, the higher authority of the government will decide to amend it or continue it.</p><h4>How would you assess the contribution of the maritime sector in the national economy?</h4><p><span></span>Of course, maritime transport is one of the main aspects of our work because it is connected with the economy. Most of the imported cargo to the UAE is transported by ships. Even exported cargo mainly goes by ships at a level of between 80% and 90%. Being an oil-exporting country, we export our oil by tankers over water, meaning we depend mostly on the maritime sector. Also, whatever you see transported in trucks is linked with ships. When the ships come to the ports, the trucks take the cargo from them and distribute it to the rest of the country. Also, the UAE has advantages in that it is a transshipment country and a hub for the container industry.</p><h4>How do you see Abu Dhabi's role in the UAE's maritime sector?</h4><p><span></span>Abu Dhabi is now also expanding very quickly. Port Khalifa is one of the most recognized ports in the world because it employs the best technology. The port has serviced more than 2 million containers since opening, while plans to expand this are being created. Also, Kizad is playing a major role because when most people come to discharge cargo, they want the logistics side of things taken care of as well. In Abu Dhabi, Kizad is performing the role of storing cargo and then shipping it around the world, and is expanding quickly so as to cope with the demand. We see Khalifa Port in the future being one of the leading ports in the region.</p><h4>What kinds of regulations are you looking at for the national railway?</h4><p><span></span>The country is now a part of the GCC railway project. This will change the style of business in the UAE ,and it will provide more services to clients in terms of moving cargo from Kuwait all the way to Oman. The deadline is expected to be in 2018 according to the study, and the UAE has the majority of the area of this project. The UAE has already started construction, and now the first phase of cargo shipping is underway.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ADSSC increased from a 12% Emiratization rate in 2006 to 72% in 2012. How do you manage to attract and keep Emiratis on your staff?</h4><p>We work closely with other stakeholders in terms of Emiratization. We have a large number of graduates coming into the business, and we try and provide them with the best training possible. Some of them go on to work closely with contractors, meaning that they learn about how the private sector operates as well as how a government business works. We are able to retain them because they enjoy the work, the atmosphere, and the positive aspect of learning and contributing to Abu Dhabi's society. We have been successful in this regard.</p><h4>What ongoing projects do you have to prepare for the upcoming population increase?</h4><p><span></span>ADSSC has recently completed four large treatment plants for Abu Dhabi and Al Ain to cater for the increased volumes there. We also have a sewer tunnel project, the Strategic Tunnel Enhancement Program (STEP), which will treble the current capacity of wastewater flows and prepare Abu Dhabi for the next few decades. We are putting in a system that will replace 35 pumping stations with one. It will use gravity to move the wastewater from the city out to our treatment plants, which are located on the mainland. We are constantly looking at providing for the future. To build sewage infrastructure takes several years. You have to plan it well in advance, because as more people come into the area, you have to think about how you plan downstream. New development impacts on the downstream development, meaning you have to allow for downstream flows when you examine upstream development.</p><h4>What kind of partnerships are you looking for?</h4><p><span></span>We are looking for partnerships where we are all working together as opposed to against each other. We obviously entered into contracts with consultants and contractors to deliver services. We expect high-quality service, but we also look for long-term relationships where we work in harmony with these contractors and consultants. As time goes on, they understand our business better so they can produce a better service for us. A good example is our four operating contracts. When we awarded these contracts, they were awarded for seven-year periods. STEP represents another good example of how we run a long-term project. Our program managers are from US consultancy CH2M Hill, and we have been working in partnership with them since 2008 when we first embarked on STEP—and they will be here until 2016, when we finish. Our working relationship is such that they are in this office, working with our people. This goes back to retaining Emiratis. By working closely with the private sector, we can get people trained to the highest of standards, which helps retain the staff as well.</p><h4>How do you want to promote yourself within the community?</h4><p><span></span>We want to promote ourselves as an environmentally friendly, sustainable business. In order to achieve our goal of being a world-class provider of services, we need to have that recognition. Only through branding and interaction with our government and citizens will we gain that recognition. Typically, people do not recognize a utility business such as power, water, or sewage until something goes wrong. When it goes wrong, it is a big problem. Fortunately, it doesn't go wrong very often. To a certain degree, we enjoy being anonymous because we can just get on with our work; however, we do want people to understand what this service is about, and that it does cost money. If you didn't have water and sanitation, everyone's health would suffer. Therefore, it is an important service, and one that people should not take for granted. People should recognize that it is expensive to run a sewage or water business, especially in the desert. People should value and respect it, not waste it.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the ADFCA, I commend the efforts made to highlight important innovations, solutions, and creative ideas within the agricultural sector. The UAE President, His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan and His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Chairman of the Executive Council, inspire us with their sustained efforts in achieving food security. I would like to express gratitude to our leaders for leading by example. On his part, His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Presidential Affairs and Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority, leaves no stone unturned in spearheading measures that translate our leadership's vision of achieving food security. The Global Forum for Innovations in Agriculture (GFIA) 2015 hosted in Abu Dhabi is one such initiative that has proved highly successful in its capacity to generate tangible outcomes.</p><p><span></span>Several years ago, the world food crisis resulted in increasing food costs to alarming levels. The growth in population and the lack of natural resources impelled countries to take action towards achieving food security. For us in the Arab world, the food crisis represents the biggest challenge. The population of the Arab world by the year 2030 is expected to double, reaching up to 480 million people. This triggers serious concern and calls for action in the region to ensure availability of safe and nutritious food to meet the needs of an increased population.</p><p><span></span>In the UAE, and Abu Dhabi in particular, we hold the belief that there is no security, no stability or progress, and no future without healthy people. The vision of our leaders on the issue of food focuses on the greater happiness of all humanity. Our leaders are keen to provide the necessary facilities to ensure that citizens and residents of the UAE have high quality foods based on the safety standards issued.</p><p><span></span>The Food Security Center Abu Dhabi was established in order to secure food supplies for citizens and residents. The center operates on a strategy aimed at maximizing the production of locally cultivated foods through the use of modern technology, the management of natural resources efficiently, and the promotion of agricultural investment abroad. The center also aims to benefit from the country's position as one of the most developed and prosperous markets in the region. We recognize that international trade traffic growth across the UAE contributes significantly to the convenient accessibility of secure food supplies. We are working on multiple axes to support the entire food security gamut. We are focused on creating non-traditional solutions through strategic inventory management. We are also focused on leveraging modern technology towards the formulation of food policies.</p><p><span></span>The Fujairah Strategic Storage Project is a great example. The project allowed the storage of grain in the most important strategic location of the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Gulf. We are able to benefit from all the initiatives and food security support projects and the infrastructure services from the government such as the mega-storage warehouses in the Khalifa Industrial City (Kizad), which includes a storage area of more than 220,000 square meters.</p><p><span></span>I am confident that collectively, we can work towards achieving regional and global food security for generations to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abu Dhabi played host to the second Global Forum for Innovations in Agriculture in 2015. What were the main objectives of your visit to the event, and what were some of the major take-aways?</h4><p><span></span>My primary objective in coming to GFIA was to demonstrate the US government's strong commitment to global food security and promote climate-smart agriculture—in essence, what we often refer to as “climate-smart food security." As Secretary Kerry mentioned in his videotaped remarks for the conference, this is a global issue that needs a unified, global response. Our office at the Department of State, working with our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, the US Agency for International Development, and many other agencies, are working collectively to support climate resilience at home and through our international development work abroad. One important element of that work is through membership and support for the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture (GACSA), launched at the UN Secretary General's Climate Summit in September 2014. The Global Alliance serves as a focal point for a multilateral and multi-sector approach to addressing the immediate threat of climate change to food production, including in the land/crops, fisheries, forestry, and livestock sectors. With a dedicated, collective effort from all sectors of agriculture, and from both public and private contributions, we can help farmers to improve their productivity, adapt to climate change, and where possible help ensure that agriculture has a positive role in net emission of greenhouse gases. It was clear in Abu Dhabi that there is a tremendous energy around ensuring global food security and improved nutrition outcomes, with a multitude of organizations and experts all committed to sustainable ways to address hunger and malnutrition. Pushing sustainable, innovative agriculture practices into the 21st century, while assisting poor and vulnerable farmers, especially women smallholder farmers in the developing world, is an imperative that clearly was a priority at GFIA.</p><h4>Where do you see opportunities for the UAE, and Abu Dhabi in particular, to work with the US in addressing global food security challenges?</h4><p><span></span>First, I wish to acknowledge the leadership and commitment from the government of the UAE, for not only hosting the GFIA conference in 2015, but also for hosting the Abu Dhabi Ascent meeting last April, 2014, which served as an important milestone for the eventual launch of the Global Alliance. We look forward to the UAE joining the Alliance, and to its continued leadership and support for innovative solutions to agricultural development, in the Middle East and further afield. In remarks I made during a panel session on climate-smart agriculture during the GFIA conference, I referenced the commitment by the UAE Minister of Environment and Water, Dr. Rashid bin Fahad, to identifying and adopting critical innovative ways to grow crops in a tough environmental location. The UAE understands, as well as any country, the tremendous challenges associated with climate change, limited water resources, and the criticality of an open, transparent international trading system to sustainable food security. As Dr. Rashid has said publicly, the international community cannot guarantee food security unless we curb the harmful impacts of climate change. The UAE continues to play a critical role in the Near East and East African regions, especially in regard to innovative agriculture and addressing climate change. We welcome their commitment to sustainable, responsible agricultural investment and development, and look forward to a continued fruitful partnership both in GACSA, and regionally.</p><h4>As the UAE invests in agricultural land abroad, what role can the UAE play in leveraging innovative and smart solutions for the development of the agriculture and food production sectors worldwide?</h4><p><span></span>The UAE has already had a profound impact and catalyzing effect on regional innovation and smart solutions to food security and agricultural development. The technical, financial, and policy-based understanding the UAE brings to agricultural land abroad has been instrumental in countries, such as Algeria. However, the ability to leverage regional capacity on a global scale and find mutually beneficial areas of focus is critical for moving UAE's agenda forward. Having access to climate smart agriculture experts, experienced local farmers groups, governments, civil society, businesses, and multilateral agencies will provide a space where innovation and smart solutions can be developed, adapted, and adopted. The GACSA offers a unified platform that encourages regional collaborations as climate change does not follow national borders. As I mentioned in my talk at Abu Dhabi, time is not on our side. The clock is ticking and people are suffering. GACSA will be critical for the international development agenda as we work together to end the scourge of hunger.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-healthy-option]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is diabetes so prevalent in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>There is more than one reason. If we benchmark Type I diabetes, for example, against the global market, it's not significantly higher. We don't have that big of a problem with Type I, which mainly affects children. Our biggest problem is with Type II. Type II is lifestyle-related—diet and exercise. As the UAE and its neighbors embarked on a rapid development, the traditional and somewhat simple diet synonymous with the region, was swiftly joined by fast-food products on every corner. In tandem, as the city infrastructure developed, the uptake of an exercise practice seemed to wane in general. The result is that the nationwide obesity rate is on the high side. Indeed, it is a regional issue, with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia very much alert to the challenge. In general, people walk a lot in Europe; much more than here.</p><h4>How do you make exercise part of the culture?</h4><p><span></span>Imperial College London Diabetes Centre's public health awareness campaign, “Diabetes-Knowledge-Action" has a year-round community outreach calendar. We go to schools and organizations with our Healthy Lifestyle interactive workshops; we host an annual walk—this year #Walk2015—and it is complemented by a nationwide grass roots campaign dubbed #TakeAStepForDiabetes. We also encourage companies and community associations to host simple, interactive activities, like “Take The Stairs" days, and we encourage all of our patients to see a specialist nurse, lifestyle educator, as well as our dietitians as part of ICLDC's diabetes management care. Our treatment includes not only medication, but the full spectrum of care for diabetes.</p><h4>What strategies do you promote to prevent or reverse diabetes?</h4><p><span></span>We have a very active outreach program. We do shows on TV and interviews on the radio, and run an extensive calendar of events. When it comes to the diabetes message, our PR campaign tends to account for more than 40% of the media voice, more than any other organization. We place emphasize on building knowledge through education and awareness and encouraging action through the calendar of activities. Continuous education is extremely important to us. Through our link with Imperial College London (ICL) we host a lot of speakers at our conferences for the medical sector. The conferences are held here at the center and elsewhere in the capital. We also host an Advanced Diabetes Conference every year.</p><h4>What are the benchmarks you look at to assess the success of your Centre?</h4><p><span></span>We keep track of all the important indicators for diabetes, and we publish an annual outcomes report. HbA1c is the best indicator of controlled diabetes versus uncontrolled diabetes. If the value is seven or below, that is considered controlled diabetes. It decreases the risk of cardio complication, kidney failure, and other related conditions. If it's above that, it's considered uncontrolled diabetes.  We also keep track of the lipid profile (cholesterol) and cardiac risk profile. BMI and blood pressure are also monitored. Of course, we also have targets for patient satisfaction and communications outreach, as well as targets for physicians' education and staff education. That's something we take very seriously.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future? What will it take to reduce the number of patients with diabetes in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>It will take an ongoing commitment to education, and it has to start at a young age. We engage with children of all ages, some as young as five or six years old, and we talk to them about a healthy lifestyle. We encourage them to join sports teams and be active. We host celebrities to help reinforce our healthy lifestyle message. It's been successful. In 2013 we had Laila Ali, the boxing champion and daughter of Muhammed Ali. She came and talked to the kids and she did a great job. Recently we hosted US All-Star basketball legend, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. It's something these kids won't forget easily. The target right now is to prevent diabetes from happening by encouraging people to take responsibility for their own health and realize that this disease is preventable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you invest in the training and development of your staff?</h4><p><span></span>Our training is specific to our needs and is a major part of our core business. Our training team covers all areas from basic life support to pediatric to advanced coronary care life support. Our trainers are in-house, and our courses are registered with the Health Authority Abu Dhabi (HAAD) where they are scrutinized and accredited. We even have hospitals that are asking us to come and train their staff. Training, for us, is a part of our DNA—it is what we do. Our staff has a tough job to do. It is essential for us that we look after our staff. Our turnover rate is less than 2% over four years, which we are very proud of.</p><h4>How has your fleet grown over the years, and how are you looking to develop it further?</h4><p><span></span>Our fleet has increased over the past four years to just over 100 vehicles. Ahmed Al Hajeri led the design of the vehicles so they would meet the demands of the environment we work in. The fleet is deployed across the UAE. The largest public deployment of our ambulances is in the Northern Emirates. We are providing a basic life support service in the Northern Emirates with 24 ambulances operating 24/7. We have invested in brand new ambulances based on the Mercedes-Benz 324 chassis, which is a reliable frame for this type of service. We get them sent directly from Germany to our Ambulance converter in the UK, and then we ship them here. The Northern Emirates has the most advanced ambulance fleet in the Middle East. We are currently in Phase I of this project; in Phase II we will add more vehicles and crew.</p><h4>What sort of operational model do you implement at National Ambulance?</h4><p><span></span>There are two different models. The Franco-German model is where a doctor is part of the ambulance crew, and they go from the hospital to the patient and back. What we provide is an Anglo-American model of service where we have emergency medical technicians and paramedics as the team to go to the patient and take them to the most appropriate hospital; that is the model that works best here. EMTs have a scope of practice that allows them to provide basic life support skills, while paramedics have a more advanced scope of practice that allows them to provide additional interventions and provide Advanced Life Support.</p><h4>What sort of technology do you use to enhance efficiency and reduce response times?</h4><p><span></span>Response times are one metric that is often used when people look at ambulance services. It is important that patients receive the most appropriate level of care as quickly as possible. In the Northern Emirates, we are continuing to improve our response times. As our fleet increases this will allow more ambulances to be deployed in the area. In terms of technology, we use computer-aided dispatch. One of the challenges here in the UAE, and something people take for granted in the US for example, is that you can pick up the phone, order something, and get all the information through the call line number identification. That system is being rolled out progressively in Abu Dhabi and Dubai and will eventually be rolled out in the rest of the UAE. We have also implemented a pre-alert system that allows our dispatchers to advise a receiving hospital if a serious injury is coming to their emergency department.</p><h4>Looking ahead to 2015 and beyond, what are your growth aspirations and expectations moving forward?</h4><p><span></span>We have seen a continued demand for our services from a wide range of sectors including oil and gas, the government and the private sector. Locally in Abu Dhabi a tender is being considered to privatize the service. We have registered our interest and look forward to the process continuing. Regardless of that tender the UAE is growing at an amazing rate. Our services are recognized as best practice so I am confident that we will see more opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you define excellence in the context of ECAE's five-year strategic plan (2013-18) to establish itself as an institution with a reputation for excellence?</h4><p><span></span>We define excellence through various measures, one being program excellence, whereby we make sure our graduates are well placed in the market after they graduate. We also consider accreditation a key measure of excellence. ECAE is in excellent standing in terms of accreditation, both nationally and internationally. Another factor is ensuring we recruit faculty from high-quality universities. We initially had only 10 faculty members with PhDs, whereas now we have recruited an additional 13 over the past year. The other strategic goals of the college include research, partnerships with our stakeholders, and serving the community. We plan to continue improving the core of our business, focusing on operational effectiveness and efficiency. We want the college's operations to be transparent yet manageable, staying true to the needs of the market and the nation.</p><h4>What were the objectives behind the recent launch of ECAE's Virtual Classroom program?</h4><p><span></span>The aim of the Virtual Classroom program, which we developed in partnership with the University of Central Florida, was to give our students and teachers the opportunity to develop practical teaching abilities early on in their studies. We believe that you cannot just learn through theoretical learning; you need practical application. In the virtual classroom, our students have to manage a simulated classroom and learn to deal with different kinds of common problems, such as the sleeping student, the inattentive student, questions that may be posed by students, and so on. In this way, students can practice dealing with real classroom situations without having to actually deal with a classroom in reality. We are also currently working on building a science simulation lab where not only the students are simulated, but also the topics and experiments.</p><h4>How do you encourage students to enter the teaching profession?</h4><p><span></span>Traditionally, there has not been much interest on the part of Emiratis to pursue a career in education. Our job is to show them that teaching is the basis of all professions. Whether you want to become a lawyer, a doctor, or an engineer, it all starts with education. We try to show them that national prosperity is tied in with education, and developed countries in the world all exhibit high levels and standards of education. We have also diversified our education programs at ECAE to be fully in line with what our students want and expect. We have started seven new programs at the undergraduate level, namely: early childhood, educational counseling, physical education, special needs education, behavioral therapy, educational technology, arts and music, and science and math. We also started a Master's program in 2013 allowing graduates to have the chance to further specialize in their field. Additionally, the Abu Dhabi government has developed a new salary structure for teachers, which is a big incentive for those considering teaching as a career. Nevertheless, society needs to change its perception and approach to teaching. Education is important, and without it you cannot have success in any profession.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the objectives behind the establishment of ADVETI in 2007?</h4><p>ADVETI is one of two operators in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi under the umbrella of the Abu Dhabi Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (ACTVET), the second operator being the Institute of Applied Technology (IAT). The idea behind the establishment of ADVETI was to train and provide UAE nationals with the skills required for employment that go beyond the essential technical skills and competencies required by a specific occupation. For example, mechanical engineering technicians need to be able to do more than simply handle technical aspects of a job such as the assembly and disassembly of a piece of equipment or machinery, they must also be able to communicate effectively, both in writing and orally. Occupational skills are vital.</p><h4><span></span>How do you develop your programs to meet the needs of industry and the greater economy?</h4><p><span></span>In building our programs and curricula, we refer to the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 and target those sectors identified as critical for the economy of Abu Dhabi. Sectors identified as major players in a knowledge-based economy are the ones addressed by our programs. As a result, we target the oil and gas industry and also energy and power generation. Currently, we are working with the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) on a program to develop the nuclear professionals they require. Media is another key industry identified in the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030, and we have built close relationships with the major employers in that sector. We offer a program in creative media production, for example, to equip UAE nationals for the needs of that industry. We partner with all major industries in the media, energy, government, and steel and aluminium manufacturing sectors, at both local and federal levels. For example, there is a huge demand for inspection professionals at Abu Dhabi Municipality. This is a new occupation that the Municipality wants to Emiratize, ranging across business inspection, safety inspection, health inspections, electrics, and so on.</p><h4><span></span>What are some of the key areas of cooperation you have with other institutions?</h4><p><span></span>As a training provider, we do not limit ourselves to just one training partner. We work not only with TAFE, but also with BTEC from the UK, which is more familiar to the oil and gas industry. For logistics management, our partner is the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT). We are also now developing programs with the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (ClPS) for procurement training. Our strategy is to approach the best training and professional bodies and partner with them. We assess their training packages and the needs of the industry, and incorporate that knowledge into our programs. Of course, in order to deliver their training programs tailored for our market, we obtain prior permission and agreement from the qualification owners to undergo our own customizations, and then present them to the employers. Once everyone is in agreement, we sign an MoU in order to secure sponsorship for the students in these programs. Creative Media Production is an example of a BTEC program offered by Edexcel, one of the major training awarding bodies in the UK.  In 2013, we signed an MoU with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). Emirates Steel is another of our partners and we are also involved with the Federal Electricity and Water Authority, akin to the Abu Dhabi Water and Electrical Authority, but at federal level. Overall, we have already signed some 32 MoUs. They are generally of three to five years duration, after which they are reassessed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the bilateral relationship between the UAE and Seychelles?</h4><p><span></span>The relationship between Seychelles and the UAE, and Abu Dhabi especially, is a beautiful partnership. In September of 2014, we proved the strength of our relations by signing a visa-waiver agreement, making Seychelles the first African country to benefit from visa exemption in the UAE. Apart from that, we have an excellent program of collaboration between our two countries, which is not only characterized as a bilateral relationship, but as a friendship that has evolved over the past 20 years with HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan having a residence in Seychelles and the royal family, and HH General Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan who comes to the Seychelles regularly for holidays. They have developed a love for the Seychelles and a friendship that is long lasting. As a result, they have been prepared to make tangible manifestations of that friendship through substantial grants to the Republic of Seychelles for the development of our youth and for social sectors, such as housing and healthcare. The economic reforms I launched in 2008 have been successful in opening the way for partnership as an avenue of investment with the UAE, and Abu Dhabi was the first to give us $50 million to boost our reserves. Over the past 10 years alone, the value of projects and grants between Seychelles and Abu Dhabi has amounted to almost $200 million. For a small country like Seychelles, this is huge. You can see the results of their investments all over the country, and they can see that the funds have been judiciously and properly utilized for the development of the country.</p><h4>The Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council has begun preparing the Seychelles Strategic Plan. What does the plan signify for Seychelles and how is it progressing?</h4><p><span></span>The Seychelles Strategic Plan will help in the proper planning and development not only of the town itself, but also the surrounding areas, which could turn into plans for the whole island and the whole country. It is a coordinated exercise that aims at creating ownership by the people in the future development of the country. We have meetings with the population and all stakeholders so they can give their views, and also try to maintain a balance with all the different sectors of development, including businesses, residences, national heritage sites, and the different utilities that will be needed over the next 30 to 50 years. It is a comprehensive plan that Abu Dhabi is helping us to develop that will enable Seychelles to ensure its orderly and sustainable development for the future. At the same time, it is a realistic plan, acknowledging what can be done now, and what can be achieved in the future. It is extremely important and useful for the development of the country, and the clean energy component will be incorporated as well. Technicians from Seychelles and Abu Dhabi will further study the plan, develop it, and come back with their suggestions. We have two more scoping exercises to do for the whole project. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the role Khalifa Fund plays in supporting entrepreneurs in the UAE?</h4><p>Khalifa Fund was created as a social development agency with the objective of transforming those supported enterprises we help into viable businesses economically that have a part of today's economic growth engine. We have access to finance and technical support organizations that foster entrepreneurship and advise federal and local agencies on how to contribute to a growing SME landscape. As a non-profit organization, we are able to provide access to finance on very reasonable terms and conditions. Over the last decade, UAE citizens have been more inclined toward public sector jobs. We are trying to provide a platform for individuals with the ability to explore their potential in becoming effective entrepreneurs. There is a suite of services that we have designed over the last couple of years that go toward promoting the whole notion of a vibrant entrepreneurship environment and SME ecosystem. The leadership of the UAE, starting from HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE and the Ruler of Abu Dhabi, have continuously given their support in pushing the envelope on SMEs in the UAE.</p><h4>The fund started with capital of AED300 million and then increased that amount to AED1 billion, and then to AED2 billion ($544 million). How do you allocate the fund's capital?</h4><p><span></span>Start-ups are the most sensitive enterprises we have because of the high risk of exposure and setup challenges, at times possible failure. We step in when financial institutions are shying away because of the fact that start-ups are considered to be, in financial terms, “toxic assets;" having said that, those institutions are more inclined to look to fast-growing businesses and those that are already making good returns. We work with people who are keen to start businesses and address their challenges. Over the last couple of years, we have created financial products for different economic activities and demographics within society. The aim is to guide the individuals who are in the process of putting together a business plan, they meet with an array of consultants who help in putting together a financial model, then they are required to present their plan to a committee of peers who make sure that the entrepreneur understands the different key parameters of establishing this Enterprise.</p><h4>How do you support SMEs in gaining access to global markets?</h4><p><span></span>Access to global markets is critical. The fact that our entrepreneurs and SMEs have the ability to participate in international events be it exhibitions or conferences is crucial in that it allows for the sharing of best practices and knowledge transfer. We have witnessed a growing number of entrepreneurs participating in such events all over the globe, which has led to adoption of new practices within the perspective SMEs signing of new alliances in delivering some of those services with the UAE and a vote of confidence for those entrepreneurs to take central stage in the global arena.</p><h4>How do you view the level of innovation among SMEs in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>The UAE needs to continue investing in areas of innovations. The country will have to make further investment in areas of R&amp;D especially within academia and some of the main clusters that have been developed across the UAE. Graduates should have the ability to develop their know-how further through R&amp;D and leverage on a growing number of mentors who come to this country with past experiences. For enterprises what to continue to grow, they should leverage innovating, which requires robust R&amp;D infrastructure. That is something that is lacking. We are engaged with a multitude of educational institutions from primary to tertiary, and from vocational to higher education, simply because we want to continue to foster entrepreneurship within the mindset of the younger generation from a very early stage all the way through to graduation. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Invest AD has been operating in the African and Middle Eastern markets for over 30 years. How would you characterize the kind of expertise investors can expect from Invest AD?</h4><p>One of the problems in our region is that we have gaps in our knowledge because of the historical instability of the Middle East. In contrast, Western financial and portfolio management theory has had a long history and developed its knowledge, with layers and revisions building on top of each other. In 2008, when we received a mandate, we thought that our people, who are our main strength, should focus on specific regions; those regions being MENA and a part of Sub-Saharan Africa. That knowledge is what we call boots on the ground. We also conduct quantitative analyses; however, in frontier or slightly emerging markets, and especially in Eastern societies, you need to see people; you need to look into their eyes, and talk to them. Therefore, fundamentally, on the ground research is essential for our markets. Invest AD's strength is that it focuses on specific areas; on a small set of asset classes, and we are building a knowledge base that will hopefully continue to add value for investors.</p><h4>What factors make the frontier markets you target attractive for investment?</h4><p><span></span>In most Western countries and developed markets, the loan to deposit ratio is close to one. In Iraq, it was 0.15. This means people did not trust the system and held on to their cash. Today, the Iraqi banking sector is still underdeveloped. Then, there is consumerism, especially in Africa. In places such as Kenya, with Safari Telecom, they have some interesting technologies for payments. Everybody uses their phone for daily commerce, including for such things as paying your plumber. This leads to the third item, which is the empowerment of people. New products and services, such as the iPad and Skype, are now a part of life. Many people may consider African countries backward, but actually they are far more advanced than many of the countries in the region in terms of how they are working together. Teamwork is an endangered species in many parts of the world. We are seeing evidence of highly- educated people coming back to the region and coordinating their policies together in order to attract capital for infrastructure purposes.</p><h4>Where do you see the most growth potential in the GCC?</h4><p><span></span>In the GCC, it is Saudi Arabia if you take it as the largest market and factor in its ability to diversify the economy and to concentrate on social spending. One of the issues we have in the region is that we are always looking to target products for “VVIPs," but the average man also has to live. There is growth potential in the middle class as well, and there will be a lot of policies to stimulate the middle class.</p><h4>What is your main strategy moving forward?</h4><p><span></span>Our main strategy is to figure out how we can add value for investors. To add value is to wander in the forest and let the forest lead you to the river. If you get lost, it is the best thing that could happen to you. I would love to see the great examples out there of entities and people that have made it big in any field in life that did not get lost at some point. Too many people put an emphasis on “you have got to do everything right, you have got to act right, you have got to do this or that." We are a corporate entity; meaning, we are continuously looking for ways to add value to our investors. If I tell you that we have a five-year plan with A, B, and C, it will sound nice, but it is not true. We are starting to get engaged in things we never thought we would. The journey you are on is never the journey you start with. We have our core businesses, we have our funds, and they are doing well. However, I think the real excitement will come from somewhere else; possibly from where we are least expecting to find it. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the key highlights at UNB over 2014?</h4><p><span></span>Reviewing our financials, we have maintained a consistent growth course, recording a profit of AED1.584 billion for 9M2014, achieving an increase of 10% compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. Our profit for 3Q2014 was AED552 million, up notably by 22% compared to the same quarter of 2013 and an impressive 6% QoQ, principally driven by an increase in volumes across our various business segments. The UNB Group's performance in 3Q2014 maintained its upward trend, with the Group announcing a record profit. We remain focused on sustainably growing our franchise and business. The key to the success of our business model is its strong customer-oriented strategy, providing a wide array of award-winning products and services and our persistent endeavor to enhance customer experience.</p><h4>How would you describe the position of UNB in the UAE's financial sector?</h4><p><span></span>We have consistently strong ratings from Moody's Investors' Service Ratings, Fitch Ratings, and Capital Intelligence, with all three ratings reporting a “stable" outlook for the bank. At UNB, we have improved our activities, services, and products over the years in order to be a good partner in the banking industry so as to support the economy and the country. We have an Islamic finance arm called Al Wifaq Finance Company. UNB established the first brokerage company in the UAE, Union Brokerage Company (UBC), as well as a sales and marketing services company, Injaz Marketing Management. We understand the market fully, and we focus on this aspect of our business. We are selective about where we engage outside the UAE. Currently, we have a presence in Egypt through a 96.6% owned subsidiary. While UNB has a representative office in China, and a presence in Kuwait and Qatar, we are not aggressive about expanding to every country in the world. We select markets in which we are able to manage our business.</p><h4>What is your analysis of UNB's 10% increase in profit in 3Q2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013?</h4><p><span></span>First, we have a strong credit culture. We plan our actions well, and we do not take excessively high risks. It is well known that UNB is more conservative, which was at one point taken as a negative. When 2008 came, it turned out to be a great point in our favor. Many others began complimenting what we had done. We are consistent. We stick with credit principles and take calculated risks. We identify the segments we want to deal with, and we understand them. We have specialized people in each industry. The bank understands in detail customer needs and plans, and it works as a partner with the client. We take the necessary action when the time is right. We are not the kind of bank that changes according to the news. We are consistent because of our conservative approach.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the added value of Watania to the takaful segment?</h4><p><span></span>Watania established strong relationships with a few Islamic financial institutions in the UAE, and we believe that there is still room for us to deliver products within this niche market in which we operate. Our main proposition has always been to cater in the medium to long term to individuals and SMEs, while initial focus remains on corporate clientele. We believe that the targeted markets of SMEs in the UAE are growing and are a part of our approach and strategy. We need to find a niche where we can build a network with these businesses and grow with them over time.</p><h4>Watania achieved profitability in 1H2014. To what do you attribute this positive financial result?</h4><p><span></span>There is great potential in the market, as well as difficult challenges ahead for the company. Our portfolio has a balance between different lines of businesses; it has not skewed toward a line that is more risky than others. We have worked hard as a team to deliver on the distribution of the portfolio. The underwritten business has been profitable on the technical side. We have been prudent with our investment strategy and we made some money along the way as well. While the technical side of our business is profitable, the majority of income is still being generated from the investment returns; the challenge is to balance our sources of income. This is how we will ensure the company is viable to continue its course without being largely dependent on investment income.</p><h4>The insurance authority is creating a National Sharia Committee. What else can be done in order to strengthen the regulatory bodies in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>One of the challenges that the takaful industry has is not having a unified body that regulates its operations. Sharia scholars help find solutions for takaful and Islamic finance at large. In order for a regulator to have an in-depth and scientific view of the industry, where it can manage multiple operators, it should enact unified regulations. The regulatory body should closely consult sharia scholars in order to bring about proper processes, procedures, and governing laws for the industry. The appointment of a higher committee for the sharia to operate at industry level was an integral part of the takaful rules issued by the UAE Insurance Authority in 2010. The IA is working on forming the higher sharia committee, and we hope this will bring uniformity to the rules and regulations that govern the takaful operators. This will not only impact positively the takaful operators, but also the insured. I am hopeful that the formation of the higher sharia committee will go through. The other major hurdle the committee must overcome is the interaction with several other sharia committees at company level in order to bring uniformity to the market. In addition, issuance of investment guidelines should take priority and must be clearly defined; we are anticipating the insurance authority introduction of the new financial regulations in respect of the investment and financial guidelines for the industry, which has been long awaited. The investment and financial guidelines should be addressed from a sharia compliance perspective. The higher sharia committee should address the audit processes of operators.</p><h4>What would be your recommendations to investors who are interested in takaful?</h4><p><span></span>When it comes to investing in a takaful operator, existing or green field, the investor should be aware that such investment should not be considered a short or medium term investment in any portfolio. It should not be done on speculation either. Investment in takaful operators should be long term due to the nature of the business. The industry still shows tremendous potential, and I am a believer of its viability in the long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What progress has been made towards achieving the 3.5 million bpd target by 2017, and how will increased output impact the market?</h4><p><span></span>ADNOC is on course to meet its production target of 3.5 million bpd by the year 2017. It is difficult to list all the projects' phases completed over the past one to two years and those yet on schedule to be completed in the coming two years, but whatever has been completed is a strong indication in meeting our commitment to meet such goal. In crude oil exploration, development and production activities, ADNOC has been utilizing latest technologies for maximum yield of its current onshore fields under its subsidiary Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Petroleum Operations (ADCO) and offshore under its other subsidiary Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Company (ADMA-OPCO). In addition, work is now in the last stages for the completion of four full-scale artificial islands project in the Zakum offshore field with a target to boost production from 550,000 to 750,000 bpd in 2015. The establishment of two new ADNOC Group companies, namely Al Dhafra Petroleum Operations Company and Al Yasat Petroleum Operations Company, aimed at further developing onshore and offshore fields across the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. In parallel with this, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology has been applied in various offshore and onshore existing reservoirs for further production and maximum yields. These efforts and tasks combined offer fairly promising good assessment of the status of what is currently ongoing in terms of projects and ambitions in meeting the 2017 outlook that ADNOC has set for itself and for the international market.</p><h4>What impact will the Ruwais Refinery expansion capacity of 417,000 bpd have on the domestic economy in Abu Dhabi when it comes online in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>The Ruwais Refinery expansion is expected to have a positive impact on ADNOC, Abu Dhabi, and the UAE. That is why ADNOC went forward in such strategic project. Through its subsidiary company Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Company (Takreer), ADNOC operates two refineries; one in Umm Al Nar on the outskirts of the city of Abu Dhabi and Ruwais in the Western Region. The expansion will increase the current, which has been for years, by 417,000 bpd bringing the total capacity up to 817,000 bpd and with Umm Al Nar Refinery, bringing ADNOC's total refining capacity to over 900,000 bpd. Such capacity will make ADNOC and Abu Dhabi much more self-dependent on utilizing their natural resources of crude oil and use this for local purposes and consumption rather than importing the Emirate's need from refined crude oil products. ADNOC will depend on its own manufactured, processed, and refined crude products, rather than just exporting quantities of crude oil, which gets processed and refined and then later to be imported for local consumption reducing costs to minimum levels and utilizing and customizing spending more efficiently for the company's benefit and so the emirate and the nation as a whole.</p><h4>How has the drop in oil price to less than $70 a barrel affected the UAE market in comparison to other GCC nations?</h4><p><span></span>Drop and fluctuations of international crude oil prices have been going on since crude oil became a major consumer commodity. Therefore, the recent price cycles come with no surprise. ADNOC has been receptive to such price cycles and with preemptive measures, mid- and long-term anticipations and adaptable. ADNOC remains on course in regard to its planned projects and expansions as per the set target in boosting production to 3.5 billion barrels a day and Emiratization target of 75%, both by 2017. Longer term, ADNOC has been pursuing its set objectives and plans for the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 as well. In other words, the short-term instability of recent years must not derail our long term goals. Therefore, all our committed projects are in progress.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your role as Executive Director of the IEA is to steer the world toward a more secure, sustainable energy future. What role does Abu Dhabi play in the global energy landscape?</h4><p><span></span>Abu Dhabi is of course a major producer and exporter of crude oil, and the UAE plays a very important role in OPEC. In recent years UAE production has been pushed up close to 3 million bpd to help compensate for some of the recent disruptions in supply. This has allowed prices to remain relatively stable. Abu Dhabi is also very active in the gas trade. LNG has been exported to Japan for nearly 40 years, while Abu Dhabi and Dubai have been importing surplus gas from Qatar since 2004, and transiting part of that supply to Oman. Therefore, Abu Dhabi sees all sides of the trade in gas. In the long term, the extensive use of renewable energies will also contribute to energy security, in the Gulf area as everywhere else. There is great scope for solar power in the region, as Abu Dhabi's pioneering solar thermal plant, Shams I, has recently demonstrated.</p><h4>As the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) works to increase natural gas production via the development of sour gas reserves and CO2 injection technology, how do you see Abu Dhabi's natural gas influence reaching beyond the borders of the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>Abu Dhabi certainly seems well integrated into the global gas market, as an exporter, an importer, and a transit country. Gas is becoming a popular fuel; it is relatively clean and quite widely available. But once Abu Dhabi's associated gas is spoken for and the easily available non-associated gas begins to decline, developing more challenging reserves gets expensive. It is important to find ways to make the projects more attractive through offsetting benefits. Wet gas-fields deliver NGLs and condensates; a sour gas field can deliver quantities of sulfur for export (and I think Abu Dhabi is building a special railway to transport this); and with CO2 injection you can enhance production while disposing of unwanted green house gases. Our team working on carbon capture and storage has been very interested in the technical and legal challenges of this approach. This is an area where international collaboration yields real dividends; and, as for solar power, successful projects will tell their own story.</p><h4>Part of the investment strategy toward energy diversification includes four nuclear power plants, which are intended to allow the city to be 25% powered by nuclear energy by 2020, when all four plants will come online. What is your take on Abu Dhabi's nuclear ambitions as countries such as Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland phase out of nuclear?</h4><p><span></span>Every country has a sovereign right to decide on the role of nuclear power in its energy mix. Nuclear is one of the world's largest sources of low-carbon energy, and as such has made and should continue to make an important contribution to energy security and sustainability. The IEA's World Energy Outlook has examined the effect of low nuclear investment in detail. The analysis has shown that low nuclear investment is likely to lead to higher demand for gas and coal, higher electricity prices, increased import dependency on fossil fuels and electricity, and a more difficult path to decarbonisation, although such a trend could also open up new opportunities for renewable energy sources. Such a scenario would therefore make it much more difficult for the world to meet the 2°C climate stabilization goal, and have potentially negative impacts on energy security.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of ADNATCO and NGSCO in the petroleum sector, and what role did the companies play in developing the Emirate of Abu Dhabi?</h4><p><span></span>We primarily serve Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and its group of companies; however, as a well-positioned and growing regional maritime operator, we also contribute to the trade growth of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Trading with a diversified fleet of ships, which includes LNG carriers, bulk carriers, chemical and products tankers, and container ships provides us the opportunity to extend our services to the different business sectors of the Emirate. Our vessels carry LNG from Das Island in the Arabian Gulf to Japan, while ADNATCO is involved in the worldwide transportation of the hydrocarbon products that are produced by ADNOC Group companies.</p><h4>How are ADNATCO and NGSCO planning on fighting high energy prices and resolving the need for more efficient and high-tech ships in the market?</h4><p><span></span>We believe that saving fuel consumption and establishing an organizational culture based on energy efficiency is an effective alternative fuel for the future. To achieve this, we embarked on an initiative called the Al Daffah Project, which was aimed at reducing the CO2 emissions generated by the company's ships. By using new tools and techniques in managing our fleet, as well as installing new measuring instruments to achieve the company's targets and improve key performance indicators (KPIs), Al Daffah's ultimate aim is to achieve huge savings in fuel consumption and greatly reduce CO2 emissions.</p><h4>How do you see the market developing in the medium term, and what will be the strategy of ADNATCO and NGSCO to maintain their leading position in the region?</h4><p><span></span>We always look at the long term. Our strategic objective is to meet the needs for ADNOC and its group of companies for efficient marine transportation. We know that ADNOC certainly remains firmly committed to maintaining a strong presence in the shipping industry. This provides us with numerous opportunities to grow our business and stay in the lead.</p><h4>The maritime industry faces the increased threat of piracy. Which innovative defensive measures is ADNATCO implementing to ensure the protection of its seafarers and ships?</h4><p><span></span>We remain vigilant and ensure that we have the right preventative measures available to safeguard the security and safety of our crews and ships. We always seek innovative ways to strengthen the defensive mechanism of our ships, and I am happy to say that some of our company's award-winning innovations in this regard have been adopted by other companies.</p><h4>Through the Cadetship Program, ADNATCO and NGSCO are strongly committed to the employment of UAE nationals. How are ADNATCO and NGSCO currently investing in the UAE's capital by forming skilled petroleum professionals?</h4><p><span></span>Our Cadetship Program, which trains UAE nationals to become seamen, is one of our most successful initiatives in developing and employing UAE nationals in key positions throughout the company. Every year, we accept over 40 new young high school graduates to join the program, which offers attractive career prospects. Over the years, we have trained hundreds of UAE nationals as maritime professionals, who today hold senior positions, not just at ADNATCO and NGSCO, but also in shipping and port companies throughout the UAE. As a result of this program, over 40% of our seafarers are Emirati nationals. Over time, our national seafarers are taking increasingly senior positions on-board our vessels and already hold Master and Chief Engineer tickets. We also provide a wide range of other opportunities for office-based UAE nationals. Our Tamkeen program provides a structured training program for onshore UAE nationals to support their long-term career development within the company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the recent decline in oil prices impacted your relations with oil and gas companies in the Middle East?</h4><p>The relationship between the Middle East and Japan should be based on mutual benefit over the long term. The short-term matters are not our first concern. That is the principle of the JCCP. Of course, the price of oil is sometimes high and sometimes low. The impact of that can either be good or bad for any particular economy. Focusing on the medium to long term, in addition to developing new oil and gas industries, we support technological and human resource development as well. Those are the base of our mutual relations with the Middle East.</p><h4>What are some of the key areas of technology cooperation taking place?</h4><p><span></span>One area is high severity fluid catalytic cracking (HSFCC)—an original technology of Japan which process can be obtained highly value added products such as light olefin, thereby stimulate energy conservation. We have multiple technologies in Japan that are solutions to issues facing oil companies in the Gulf, and we welcome cooperation and dialogue to try and promote collaboration. In Abu Dhabi, under ADNOC, there is a national oil refining company called TAKREER, which operates a technical research center called TAKREER Research Centre (TRC). TRC was originally created by IDEMITSU and JCCP along with TAKREER, and it has developed well. It researches refining technologies and evaluates and improves performance of refineries. Abu Dhabi is now developing major new refineries, which need the technological support that TRC provides. I am in discussion with the CEO of ADNOC, Abdulla Nasser Al Suwaidi, to develop further collaboration in technology and human resource development. We engage in similar collaboration with Nizar Al Adsani, CEO of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC).</p><h4>How are you working to promote collaboration between JCCP in the long term through engagement with national oil companies in the Gulf?</h4><p><span></span>Of course, we are one of the highest petroleum consuming countries. In addition, Japan has a particularly unique working style not found in Europe or the US. As a developed country, Japan can supply an interesting, pleasant way of doing business, which derives from our long history and rich culture. The Middle East has its own histories and cultures, and we are offering a new way of cultural engagement as the third choice. It is important that Japan tries to import aspects of Western culture and integrate them into Japanese society. In the automobile sectors; for example, we have our own business and working style, though originally automobile technology comes from Europe and the US. Japanese industries are becoming very competitive today. They know how to make a product efficiently, safely, and in an environmentally friendly way. Especially in the field of manufacturing, Japan is developing a reputation for high-quality products. Additionally, we have experienced many environmental problems during our economic growth period that we overcame, and we had a major earthquake, namely North-East Japan Earthquake several years ago. We faced the difficulties and recognize that safety and environmental issues are important. Historically, our culture and values show that Japanese people are very involved in addressing the challenges of promoting higher levels of safety and a better environment. This kind of expertise can help countries in the Middle East.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What shifts have you seen in the cost of renewables?</h4><p><span></span>Over the last five years, the cost of solar PV modules has fallen by 75%, which has dramatically changed the business case for solar. The cost of wind turbines has fallen by around 30%. The trends are downward, and as innovation continues, we will see reduced costs. The costs of geothermal and hydro are already some of the lowest costs on the grid.</p><h4><span></span>What role do private companies and investors play in making the transition toward renewables?</h4><p><span></span>Private investment is the greatest driver for cost reduction. There is not enough public finance to reach the level and ambition that we need; thus, the role of the private sector is central to whatever will happen to renewable energy in the future. When the cost of technology starts to fall, that is when you reap the benefits of what is possible with renewable energy. The role of the private sector in developing models for market transformation is critical. The private sector possesses the knowledge, the technology, and the investment experience to make it happen. The key players we need to work with are investors because, so far, the perception of risk related to renewable energy is unrealistically high compared to its performance; therefore, we have to find ways to de-risk finance and investment.</p><h4><span></span>Focusing on the UAE specifically, how do you assess the renewable energy market here and the policies in place to enable sustainable technologies to flourish?</h4><p><span></span>In the UAE, Abu Dhabi created a 7% renewable energy target by 2020. To set an early target like that was an important step to indicate the seriousness with which they took this. I believe it is had a huge impact throughout the region because many other countries are now establishing their own plans. In Abu Dhabi, we have seen some of the initial investments of distributed solar projects around Masdar and the Shams 1 concentrated solar plant, one of the largest in the world at 100 MW. These indicate that the UAE is serious about moving ahead to meet the target; still, time is limited. What is required now is a clear policy framework through which investment in renewables will be incentivized and a clear roadmap highlighting which technologies and models are going to be used for reaching that target. It is a short time frame, but I think knowing the record of achievement in Abu Dhabi, it is possible to reach this target.</p><h4>In what ways is the city of Abu Dhabi a model for other cities in the region and around the world in its efforts toward reducing its carbon footprint?</h4><p><span></span>Abu Dhabi was the first to launch one of the most efficient and ambitious projects for sustainability. That first investment led to huge dynamism in the region and has been an example to others, such as Saudi Arabia. The creation of Masdar City as a low carbon city in the desert, a very harsh environment, demonstrates some of the critical renewable technologies' integration into cities and the way you can actually build cities of the future with a much lower carbon footprint. The investments that they are undertaking, nationally and internationally, in renewables send a strong message.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[All Along The Stream]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[all-along-the-stream]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What customer services does Linde provide in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p><span></span>The majority of the business segments that we are engaged in can be clustered primarily into: Linde Engineering, which is the technology and execution arm of the group; Linde Gas, one of the world's leading industrial gas suppliers with a considerable contribution to the group's revenue; and Healthcare, a relatively new and exciting field that has been augmented through a major acquisition in the US. Linde Engineering's business model is basically a technology-based EPC, meaning a comprehensive value proposition around our broad range of in-house technologies from upstream gas treatment, to midstream LNG, all the way to downstream in petrochemicals and chemicals. With its own specific market cycles, Linde Engineering has grown steadily over the past decade to revenues of between $4 billion to $4.5 billion. On the upstream side, we do natural gas treatment based on in-house and also external partnerships. Along that line comes nitrogen rejection units, sulfur recovery, and, of course, LPG extraction, which has been booming in the US thanks to the shale gas revolution. In the midstream segment, Linde is one of main players in the field of LNG technology. We focus on midsize and smaller-scale opportunities that have their own momentum fueled by the era of distributed energy and enhanced monetization of the gas reserves. Downstream petrochemicals are also a focus market segment for Linde Engineering, built around several in-house patented technologies and innovative solutions that are aimed at adding value to our customers' operations.</p><h4>What are the main opportunities feedstock diversity offers to the industry in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p><span></span>This is where we believe technology leadership and collaboration is key to the challenges ahead. The gas shortage became a reality in the region. The ability to manage heavier feedstock is the bridge. The most interesting takeaway here is that technology not only enables also aims to make ventures more economically attractive. Linde is a leading player in this domain, on one side due to the decades of experience and excellence in liquid cracking and on the other side with new enhancing technologies and solutions. What we call it “value cracking" is a game-changing solution whereby optimization of the streams and derivatives in a liquid cracker creates more value that then enhances the economics of the system. There are other well-established trends, including the integration of the refinery and petrochemicals, which basically builds on feedstock synergies, scope, optimization, and, of course, cost synergies. In an ideal scenario, Takreer and Chemaweyaat may have an opportunity to build on these synergies.</p><h4>What is your strategy in terms of R&amp;D?</h4><p><span></span>R&amp;D is beyond a priority for us in the hydrocarbon industry; it is more like a necessity to remain in the game. If you want to lead the game, then you need to have a different game plan, or a combination of several initiatives.</p><h4>How would you assess your relationship with ADNOC?</h4><p><span></span>The industry has become so complex and volatile that without trustful and successful partnerships, business ideas become more of a theory than a reality. Without a proper partnership, it is impossible to create value, to grow, and, of course, to succeed. When looking at ADNOC group, you see an interesting and broad mix of opportunities, from upstream gas and LNG terminals all the way to downstream and petrochemicals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a holding company with diversified exposure in the UAE, how do you characterize Horizon Energy's role in the local market?</h4><p><span></span>We are a holding company; yet, we are a family office. Our model is simple: we want growth and to be able to market that growth. We invest in companies that meet our criteria, whether it is a start-up, a green field project, or a company that has the know-how and management in place but is also looking for growth, marketing, human, or financial resources. We also support businesses by removing the barriers and challenges they face, which could be in the industry or any issues that are related to that business. We only invest with people who know their business, are committed, and who are entrepreneurs wanting to do something for themselves. If these elements exist within the staff or the company, then we invest with them. This is our business model. We invest our time, money, and effort heavily, which is what differentiates us.</p><h4>What is your main strategy when it comes to investing in different sectors?</h4><p><span></span>There are certain business areas we focus on. Our main focus is oil and gas, followed by heavy industry, manufacturing, and the marine sector. We seek niche products or if we see a service company with potential we will invest in that too. One example is vMonitor; we invested in it, and grew it from being a local company, to a regional company, and now it is on the international stage. We invest in companies that are related to engineering, fabrication, and technology. We are not the executives of any business, and we do not invest 100%. We support the oil and gas business in Abu Dhabi by identifying local companies that have limited resources. We take them to a higher level than where they were, allowing them to compete on par with international players and qualify in the oil and gas sector, which is highly competitive. We try and put them in a position where they can perform a quality job in a timely fashion and within budget. IOCs have been in Abu Dhabi for the past 75 years, and have been instrumental in the sector; however, ADNOC has been and still is a major protector of the interests of Abu Dhabi. That is important to us as well. We want to apply the latest technology to meet the interests of Abu Dhabi and recover the maximum capacity of our reservoirs. The trend is in technologies and increased productivity because costs are increasing. Companies with effective technologies reduce operating costs and increase project competence. The way forward is automation and efficiency. These are the two areas that are extremely important to the client. We invest in the latest long-term sustainable technologies to achieve client satisfaction. Financial returns are important; however, sustainability is extremely important, which allows the returns to be sustainable as well.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi is a key player in the global energy industry. What role do you think Abu Dhabi plays in regard to innovation and human capital development in the sector?</h4><p><span></span>Abu Dhabi is contributing to innovation through universities and petroleum institutions, and through the training of technicians to cope with the new automation systems being applied here. The oil industry in Abu Dhabi has done a fantastic job training young men and women in applying the latest technologies in the oil and gas business. The Petroleum Institute is unique in the way it prepares people in fields of petroleum engineering to chemical engineering in support of the oil and gas business. We need to conduct more R&amp;D in the UAE, because this will keep that knowledge within the country, and it will train Emiratis to innovate and be able to sustain industry, which is important.</p><h4>What is the UAE's benefit if the foreign companies come, and they only employ their own nationals? </h4><p>All local companies in Abu Dhabi need some kind of local content where they benefit and gain experience, know-how, and knowledge of technologies, and then transfer that knowledge. Through technology transfer, the participation of local employment, and know-how, we can grow our industry in Abu Dhabi, and export this to other regions as a model. We can do the same business in Oman and in the region. We do not want to be only consumers; we want to be an active player in our economy. That is only done through a model that creates an environment that supports these factors. I am an advocate for local content but also in making sure there are processes there to be an international player.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your analysis of the gas market today?</h4><p><span></span>Abu Dhabi and the UAE are growing rapidly. That economic growth will have to be supported with increased energy production. When you consider Abu Dhabi's Vision 2030, energy requirements become even more crucial, and gas is a major part of it. There are calls for the diversification of energy resources, which is why nuclear and renewables are also there in terms of solar energy and gas. Shah Gas is here to meet that requirement and meet future expected growth. The demand for gas today outstrips supply and UAE has been a net importer of natural gas for a number of years. The demand-supply gap is increasing with rapid industrialization across the UAE. Al Hosn Gas will be producing 500 million standard cubic feet per day, which is approximately 10% of current UAE gas production, in an effort to reduce the shortfall in gas supplies. All of our natural gas production will be for domestic consumption.</p><h4>How is Al Hosn Gas continuing to innovate to meet the growing domestic energy needs?</h4><p><span></span>Innovation is imperative in terms of meeting the energy needs of the UAE. The “low hanging" energy sources such as natural gas from conventional fields are already exploited and cannot be relied upon solely to meet energy requirements. As a result, forays into tapping unconventional gas reserves such as sour gas, tight gas, and shale gas are inevitable, and this requires innovation and the adoption of state-of-the-art technologies. Also, the UAE is wisely diversifying its energy mix using nuclear and solar energy sources in addition to traditional fossil fuels. So, yes, innovation is widely prevalent in both the planning and execution of projects in the energy sector.</p><h4>What are some of the advancements in engineering, materials, machinery, and state-of-the-art technology that have contributed to making local sour gas accessible in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p><span></span>The Shah Gas Field was discovered in the 1960s; however, it was not technically feasible to develop until recently. This project could be undertaken only because of the technological advancement that has occurred over several decades in the fields of drilling, reservoir management, facilities design and engineering, metallurgy, and equipment manufacturing, for example. Abu Dhabi has been quick to grab the opportunity to adopt the latest technological advancements. From Al Hosn Gas' perspective, the moment we were entrusted with the responsibility to implement this project, we realized it was not business as usual. We meticulously planned the front-end engineering and design of the facilities and pipelines, paying attention to areas as diverse as selection of metallurgy and equipment, layout, and spacing of the gas plant, segregation of sour gas and sweet gas areas in the plant, plant maintenance philosophy, designing a control room with state-of the-art technology, and much more.</p><h4>What sort of market conditions will be required to achieve sustainable sour gas production in the long term?</h4><p><span></span>The gas supply-demand imbalance is projected to continue and expand through the foreseeable future. The alternative to sour gas is imported LNG, which is more expensive. And so, the economics of sour gas is robust and, furthermore, it contributes to domestic energy security, which is a paramount strategic consideration; the challenge is developing it in a safe and sustainable manner.</p><h4>How has multinational collaboration benefited the sector?</h4><p><span></span>ADNOC has been one of the first NOCs to adopt a multinational collaboration model. That model has been a win-win situation. It has served the UAE as well as the foreign partners quite well. It has given the UAE access to the latest technology while the foreign partners profited from accessing and developing the UAE's vast oil and gas reserves. The Al Hosn Gas partnership between ADNOC and Occidental has been exemplary, with both shareholders bringing unique and complementary strengths to the partnership.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to the establishment of TASNEEF in 2012?</h4><p><span></span>The concept of ship classification itself started 250 years ago to fulfill a requirement that was badly needed in the maritime industry. More than 12 classification societies have worked in the Middle East region; however, these societies have not provided customized services to meet the immediate needs demanded here. The UAE's leaders saw a need to have a national classification society to fill certain gaps. TASNEEF is a nonprofit organization that acts as a third party on behalf of regulators and owners to provide inspection, surveys, certification, and consultancy services based on a non-conflict of interest. Part of the services that we have been providing are tailored to the region's own unique needs, such as weather conditions including extreme heat, dense humidity, and dust, as well as shallow waters and the different types and lengths of waves. These factors impact the operation of vessels in the UAE and the region and have not been well considered previously.</p><h4><span></span>TASNEEF has pioneered a new GCC code applicable to ships in the region. How is the code an improvement on current standards?</h4><p><span></span>International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations and conventions already regulate vessels above 500 tons, but for those vessels below 500 tons regulatory responsibility falls on the national authorities. Many authorities in different regions of the world are creating and adopting a national safety and environmental protection code for vessels. We have worked hard with the Federal Land and Marine Transport Authority (FLMTA) to adopt the GCC Code for those vessels that are not subject to the IMO standards. This will help better regulate the market, and make sure we have safer vessels. As a result, vessels will be more environmentally friendly with reduced emissions of dangerous gases, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The code will control sewage with better treatment plans as well.</p><h4>TASNEEF has signed a landmark partnership agreement with DryDocks World in collaboration with Dubai Maritime City to build the world's first LNG-powered harbor tug. What is the significance of this achievement for the UAE and the global maritime industry at large?</h4><p><span></span>There is significant pressure from the IMO to reduce the environmental impact of vessels and they have put in place certain targets leading up to 2035, whereby every five years we have to have a reduction in emissions. LNG as a fuel has zero emissions of dangerous gases. Because of this, the world is now moving toward LNG. Harbor tugs are used continuously in all ports in the UAE and have a direct impact on the coastal and nearby environment. The initiative to design, build, and operate an LNG harbor tug will significantly reduce the direct emissions of dangerous gases. This project is one of the projects that we are most proud of. The agreement has been signed and production will start during 2014.</p><h4>What is your assessment of TASNEEF's progress and achievements thus far, being one of the youngest classification societies in the world?</h4><p><span></span>We are more dynamic, more technology-driven, and more energetic. In less than two years, we have achieved two awards. We were selected as the best classification society for excellence in maritime services within the entire region. We received a second award at the Sea Trade Maritime Awards for being the best classification society in terms of contribution to the development of the maritime cluster in the Middle East and Africa, including being an active partner with all stakeholders. The reason we were selected for this is because of the innovative solutions we have put on the table. Firstly, the Sahara Notation, and secondly our cooperation with all stakeholders here, especially the FLMTA, to implement the GCC Code promoting safety and environmental protection.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the importance of TransAD's role in Abu Dhabi's transportation sector?</h4><p><span></span>We work on the regulation side of the sector with the Department of Transport (DoT) whereby they monitor the entire transportation sector, and we focus on the taxis and limousine business. Our service involves the drivers, the cars, and the companies that are franchised to operate the taxi businesses; we have seven companies under The Centre in total. Our responsibility is to ensure they operate at the quality we require—from the number of cars to the facilities that we offer—and that they offer the best possible service. Our role is becoming increasingly important as the tourism industry in Abu Dhabi and the country as a whole is growing.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi's National Vision 2030 includes several environmentally friendly initiatives. How is TransAD contributing to making transportation an environmentally friendly sector?</h4><p><span></span>We are proud of our efforts; for example, 25% of our taxis run on compressed natural gas, which is around 2,000 out of 7,200 taxis. Airport taxis run on green diesel, which is one of the cleanest fuels, and the 270 newly launched taxis will also run on this fuel. In addition, we also have a small number of taxis that are hybrid/electric, and we are heading more in this direction. A good example of our commitment is that the hybrid cars are more expensive than a regular car. At the same time, the long-term savings are better. We also have paperless procedures, and communicate with our franchisees regarding policies and administrative orders online, provide documents for drivers, as well as permits and certifications which can be issued and accessed online.</p><h4>When you look ahead to the next five years, what are your expectations for how TransAD will evolve?</h4><p><span></span>What we want to do is improve other forms of transportation; we want better bus services, a metro, and a tramway. These will help reduce the number of taxis. It is not our aim to increase taxi use. However, because of the lack of other modes of transport, we need to have the size fleet we currently have, which we might increase until we succeed in building up other modes of transport. We want to encourage the usage of public transport, a taxi is not really considered public transport because they often take a single passenger, which means more traffic and leads to more pollution. With the “AbuDhabi Taxi" mobile application and the call center, we are also trying to reduce our “dead kilometers," which is when the taxis run with no passengers. Some 45% of the time taxis are driving around without customers. We encourage people and make it easier to get a taxi through the call center or the mobile application so that the closest taxi can pick up a customer with less wasted time, less wasted fuel, and less damage to the environment.</p><h4>In terms of numbers, what benchmarks do you use to monitor how you are doing?</h4><p><span></span>We make approximately 6 million trips per month from one destination to another. We have around 400,000 trips booked via the call center, which is not a large percentage. This is where there is room to improve to get more people to use this service, and right now, some 10% of call center bookings come through the mobile application, which for us makes more sense because we can employ less people. Through the application, the jobs go straight to the driver. With the new meters, which have full navigation systems, drivers can reach a destination taking the best possible route with turn-by-turn control. We are always conscious to ensure that nothing is missing, and our aim is to be seen as the number one service in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>CCC has a well-known reputation in the region as the largest construction company in the Middle East. What factors make CCC one of the top 25 international contractors here?</h4><p><span></span>The owner of the company's message has always been to maintain integration with the people in each country where we do business, using the local resources, materials, and companies in all of our projects, in order to build relations with each community. The culture at CCC has a family feel. In each country we operate, we have developed good relations with people from politicians to those working in the construction field. We always start with the aim of building good relationships and delivering on what we have committed to. This is why CCC has become a strong construction company in the Middle East. The UAE in particular has been one of the main areas where we have grown and expanded in the GCC.</p><h4>Are there any new areas where you are looking to expand?</h4><p><span></span>We expand wherever the market is hungry for our existence. We are considering Brazil. We are bidding for some projects in Canada. We have diversified our experience in many fields, including oil and gas, infrastructure, heavy and light civil projects, and we are able to diversify from sector to sector depending on market needs.</p><h4>Are you looking for any future JVs or partnerships here in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>One of our main interests is to work with others, primarily with local contractors in areas where they can add value such as in equipment, supplies, and manpower. Today, we are also bidding with many European companies for the museum series, the Guggenheim, and Khalifa Medical Care City, where we are bidding with Chinese and Italian companies. We are always looking to gain experience from others to continuously develop and improve our capabilities. We work with others to get a sense of how they handle issues. In an international market, we need this kind of diversified experience.</p><h4>In the UAE market, what type of projects are you focusing on?</h4><p><span></span>In the wider UAE, our main focus is oil and gas, heavy civil works, and infrastructure projects. As an experienced contractor, we know that the money is in engineering and procurement—construction is the low margin side. We created an EPC arm to handle our EP for the company. It is a venture between CCC and the Japanese company Chiyoda CCC Engineering Ltd. (CCEL), and we have succeeded in winning  projects in the oil sector. This is where we try to cover areas that we believe will improve our capabilities in EPC roles. For infrastructure projects, we are bidding for the next phase of Etihad railway projects. We are bidding for Metro Abu Dhabi in a joint venture with Bechtel and Zublin Construction, and we are also bidding for the Guggenheim Museum—both major projects. We are one of the main contractors starting the road, highway, port, and airport construction projects within the UAE.</p><h4>Looking ahead five years, in what areas do you envision CCC playing a key role in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p><span></span>We always have internal sessions to discuss future expectations, how we plan on developing our capabilities, and what our goals are in each country and region. We study each sector and we focus on each field depending on the development needs in each country. With the Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, one of the main goals is to heavily invest in power and electricity, and this is one of the major sectors that we are focusing on now in addition to contributing to the infrastructure projects, industrial zones, and the water sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about your experiences in the UAE and what led you to join the PI?</h4><p>Working in the UAE, I came to know and respect the PI as one of the foremost institutions of higher learning in the country.  The PI has taken as its specific mission the education of young Emirati nationals for successful careers in the oil and gas industry, and particularly in the ADNOC Group of companies.  I have always been supportive of educational innovation, and in the late 1990s, I was a founder of a new university in Germany, Jacobs University at Bremen. So taking the reins at the PI, which has all of the excitement and freshness of a young enterprise, was a natural step for me.</p><h4>Can you describe the transition that is taking place at the PI?</h4><p><span></span>It may seem strange to speak of such a young institution (the PI was founded in 2001) as being in a state of transition, but in fact the PI is in the process of reinventing itself.  The PI spent its first decade establishing itself as a top-tier educational institution, where high-quality teachers have been teaching an increasingly well-qualified student body in engineering.  In the last few years, the PI has moved into advanced research across a broad range of fields related to energy, and is engaging ever more with our sister institutions in Abu Dhabi, expanding the number of research projects we are pursuing. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is a major focus for our research, but we are also expanding our research portfolio to include projects in sustainable energy.  We will be increasing our overall enrollments in the next five years by 50%.</p><h4>What are some of the main subjects studied for research at PI?</h4><p><span></span>The new ADPIRC that we are building on the PI campus has dedicated space to a wide variety of topics. EOR continues to offer a fertile field of research, as our research engineers seek innovative ways of raising the rate of return on existing fields and of finding new ways of tapping into reserves that had at one time been thought to be outside the range of profitability.  Many technical fields are now converging, with big data reservoir simulation, microscopic and submicroscopic core analysis, and research on the use of electrokinetics to raise recovery rates now on our agenda.</p><h4>How is sustainability being integrated into the oil industry?</h4><p><span></span>One of the major challenges of the industry today is how we can implement a green agenda to ensure sustainability and environmental friendliness.  Our task is to extract the mineral wealth of the earth at the same time that we bequeath to future generations an environment where people can live healthy, prosperous lives.  All of that is in balance at this moment in history.  I think as we begin to look at the future, we are also beginning to think about sustainability and the combination of fossil-based fuels and the industries associated with them with the mandate to create a sustainable economic, social, and cultural future for the nation. We are beginning to look at solar power. We have always had some of our courses, clients, and majors focus on sustainability, but it is becoming increasingly important so we are focusing on that even more. We are partnering more with Masdar in that regard.</p><h4>What kind of increases in enrollment are you expecting?</h4><p><span></span>We currently have about 1,400 students and will be going up to about 2,150, which is still relatively small but we think that is the right size.  We expect the student body to increase by about 50% over the next five to six years, and we are building facilities and hiring faculty and staff with that in mind.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key areas of cooperation currently in place between Thailand and the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>The areas of cooperation are diverse, but our economic ties currently stand out, if you consider that the UAE and Thailand are each other's biggest trading partners in the Middle East and Southeast Asia respectively. The UAE is also vital for our energy security as it has been our number-one import source of crude oil for many years now. Beyond the macro-level, people-to-people relations between both countries are very close. Many Emiratis have visited Thailand as tourists, many among them medical tourists, and they have a good impression of my country and its people. On the other hand, there are currently about 10,000 Thai nationals residing in the UAE and working in various sectors, ranging from heavy industry and infrastructure to the hospitality sector and the airline business. Thai people are contributing to the growth and prosperity of the UAE as well.</p><h4>The UAE is Thailand's primary trade partner in the region. How has the volume of bilateral trade developed over the years and in what ways is the UAE a hub for Thai trade to the Middle East?</h4><p><span></span>The UAE is not only our primary trade partner in the Middle East, but was our fifth largest trading partner worldwide in 2013, with a trade volume exceeding $20 billion for the first time in history. Both our exports to and imports from the UAE have risen continuously over many years, although for 2014 Thai imports from the UAE may decline for the first time. However, there is no cause for concern as this drop is mainly due to the falling average price of crude oil, which dominates our imports from the UAE. The UAE is a perfect hub for Thai trade to the Middle East because of its highly developed infrastructure, both physical and digital, its excellent connectivity to other parts of the world, and also its enabling trade and economic policy. This is best illustrated by the fact that the Thai Trade Centre, which is the government export promotion agency in the Middle East, is based in Dubai.</p><h4>What opportunities exist for the UAE's private-sector investment in Thailand?</h4><p><span></span>Foreign investment opportunities exist across all sectors in Thailand. We have an investment-friendly economic policy, a highly skilled workforce, reasonably well-developed infrastructure, and a favorable geographical location. These factors will be boosted even further by the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015 when the 10 South-East Asian nations become a single market and production base with free flow of goods, labor, and capital—and Thailand is right in the heart of it. In the coming years, there will be numerous investment opportunities in the logistics industry and related sectors, especially in the transportation infrastructure area, following the recent approval of the infrastructure development plan for 2015-22, which targets the improvement and expansion of the provincial rail network, highways, a sea port, and public transport in Bangkok. For the very short term, UAE oil firms might be interested in the coming petroleum concession bidding round, which is the first petroleum concession in Thailand since 2007. The Thai Board of Investment (BOI) also just approved the Seven-Year Investment Strategy for 2015-21, with a view to promote investments that create value for Thailand and those that have positive impact on the society and environment. Special incentives will be given to investments in, for example, high-tech and creative industries, the digital economy, projects located in 20 lower-income provinces, as well as the five special economic development zones in the border areas. In this regard, I would encourage potential investors to study this strategy in order to optimize their investment decisions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the largest security provider in the Emirates, what are G4S UAE's major accomplishments to date?</h4><p>Like any business operating in the UAE, we are delighted to support the country, its citizens, and its businesses. We are a business that operates in shopping malls to residential communities to businesses to national infrastructure. Being part of that, and actually delivering what I believe are excellent services to our clients and citizens of the UAE, is a massive accomplishment. We have over 11,500 employees delivering outstanding service and solutions across five different businesses, which is 21 years old in 2015.</p><h4>What are some of the primary services you provide in the Emirates?</h4><p><span></span>From a human capital point of view, our largest footprint is secure solutions or the traditional term of “man guarding," which today is being augmented with technology. In guarding business towers, shopping centers, airports, ports, and remote sites, we use over 5,500 staff. That is what G4S is primarily built on globally as a security company. Equally, we support the country's cash movements for financial institutions, moving capital around the Emirates on behalf of banks and financial institutions. We help process cash, checks, and other forms of high value goods into the financial institutions and economy. We also have a facilities management business, which is very much soft services for office, building, and hotel support.</p><h4>What are some pioneering technological solutions that you are bringing into the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>There are some exciting things happening with cash. This is a very cash-generative country. The amount of cash that still moves hands versus electronic methods is much greater than many other parts of the world. We have a great technology for cash called Retail 360. It allows clients to be able to deposit their back office cash much quicker; therefore, they can put it on their balance sheet, which is better for their cash flow and security. This is different from the traditional methodology, which will take away some of our traditional business; however, we believe investing in it now will help in the long term. Today, someone takes cash to a shop, it gets collected, goes through processing, and hits their balance sheet; yet, with this technology it is allowing for a quicker transaction time and reduced need for the supply chain, while delivering balance sheet awareness. As soon as it goes into the machine, it is effectively in the bank. With the UAE being a destination country, it also allows you to take multiple denominations of up to five different currencies, which is a huge potential advantage for retailers.</p><h4>What sort of partnerships or collaborative projects are you looking to build in the near future?</h4><p><span></span>One of our focuses is on sourcing the best people who can act as the face of our service proposition in comparison to our competitors. We work with our own company overseas to offer that career route through our business here. Equally, we want to train local people and give them international experience in security that will help them develop and ultimately secure businesses and infrastructure in their own country. That is something that I am really passionate about. It is going back to basics: schools, universities, and having partnerships early on. Security goes from asset protection to managing a whole supply chain of critical infrastructure. How do we take local people and give them a career in security? We are developing a program, which is currently in its infancy. In the future, I would like to see Emiratis being sent to help operations overseas, and then come back to run the operation here. We are looking at the best ways to differentiate ourselves through partnerships or acquisitions to fundamentally change our proposition. It is a great opportunity to be able to partner with the right people and enter sectors and organically grow those sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does your new ADS London office add to your network?</h4><p><span></span>Our office in London will initially be focused on our FX, precious metals, and CFD trading business. This is because London is still responsible for trading 41% of the daily $5.3 trillion currency market, meaning it is essential that we have a regulated business in the UK. Most of the important liquidity providers, our counter parties, and a number of our largest clients are in the City. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is a respected regulator, and we are pleased that it has accepted ADS Securities to work alongside some of the most important global financial services companies. Before I could be appointed as Chairman of ADS London, along with James Watson, our Managing Director, we had to go through detailed checks from the FCA to ensure that we met the international standards it works to. Having our London and Hong Kong offices means that we are now regulated in three major markets and act as a genuine bridge from the Far East through the Middle East to Europe and on to North America.</p><h4>How has the response been in regard to bringing online trading to the Middle East?</h4><p><span></span>We are the first international online trading company headquartered in the Middle East, and the response has been overwhelming. I look at all the awards we have and I am shocked. Every day we have clients willing to trade with us, and we have had a great response. We are a real success story. And we continue to invest in the services we can provide them, including fixed income (bonds), structured products, wealth management, investment banking, and asset management. They like what ADS Securities provides and they want us to grow. People want to put money in ADS and be managed by ADS, because we have qualified people and we have a hands-on approach.</p><h4>What kinds of new technology are you investing in?</h4><p><span></span>We have a new platform out called OREX Optim, which is a platform made for all kinds of traders, from bank traders to professional traders. It is a platform that gives you the ability to manage all your assets. It is an easy platform to use, being quick and highly sophisticated. The whole objective of this platform was to build on the idea of giving our clients excellent execution and putting them in charge of their trades. From having developed the first platform in the region we are now creating global technology firsts for Abu Dhabi; for example, we have implemented the world's first 40 GB FX Ethernet cards. The 40 GB network cards allow each tick from multiple liquidity venues to be processed with dramatically reduced delays during volatile market conditions. This option is only available to ADS Securities clients.</p><h4>What are some challenges you expect going forward?</h4><p><span></span>The financial services sector is always the most competitive in the world. It is a very challenging industry that can also produce great rewards and, if you are not very careful, also losses. To be able to compete against the main well-known firms that have been building their reputation and businesses for many years is difficult. But, for the reasons we have discussed, we believe that we have a unique and important offer and will work day and night to make sure that this is delivered to the market. Our challenge is to keep making money so that we can keep investing in our people, our technology, and services for our clients. We want to be the best and will strive to achieve this even when markets are difficult and investors are cautious. Our vision has always been to demonstrate that the independent financial services sector in Abu Dhabi has a role to play alongside other similar sectors in the world's leading financial centers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>RAKBANK is ranked first in the UAE by return on assets. To what do you attribute this distinction?</h4><p><span></span>We are tightly focused on retail and small business lending. One of the reasons the bank's return on assets, as well as net interest margins and gross interest margins, are the highest in the UAE, and very high globally, is that we are predominantly in the unsecured lending business. If you get it right, you have high returns. If you get it wrong, you have low or negative returns. However, RAKBANK has stuck with the formula it has adopted for a long time. Bit by bit, RAKBANK has developed its ideas. It has tried new things, and changed new solutions along the way; however, once it decided to enter into certain lines of business, it stayed with it. We have focused heavily on mobile sales and to a certain extent electronic channels, because we believe that in this day and age it is not really necessary to have hundreds of branches, particularly in a relatively small place like the UAE. Therefore, we prefer to go to customers rather than have them come to us.</p><h4>RAKBANK won an award in 2014 for its “Click and Collect" online service. How do you plan to continue innovating in the digital segment?</h4><p><span></span>RAKBANK is perceived to be technologically advanced; however, considering the markets I come from, I still believe we have a long way to go. The world is changing quickly, and we need to rethink our whole digital strategy and come back to the market with something powerful and refreshing. There is a great space to do that in the UAE. The UAE market is sophisticated, but in terms of digital banking, it is still at its infancy. Our digital offering is functional and works nicely, but we are looking to offer more of a financial services platform rather than just a pure transactional internet site and to do more in terms of convergence of mobile and internet.</p><h4>RAKBANK is currently awaiting regulatory approval for a majority stake in Ras Al-Khaimah National Insurance Company (RAKNIC). What value do you expect RAKNIC to add to the bank once approved?</h4><p><span></span>The intention is to work in synergy. RAKNIC is a successful general insurance company and is doing exceptionally well at an operating profit level. It has a full life license, which it isn't using at this point in time. In the longer term, we see a fantastic opportunity to use RAKNIC for both our general and life offerings. We will have to build the life capability with RAKNIC's management but I think it is still a fantastic synergy. Even though we don't have the majority stake yet, we are passing quite a lot of business to RAKNIC. In the past, we would pass customers who wanted insurance for something on to other organizations. There is a great opportunity for business to go both ways through RAKNIC and RAKBANK. RAKNIC is also a large insurer and has a large customer base. It is not a takaful company at the moment, which is something we would also potentially explore down the road if we were able to obtain a takaful license.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has the Insurance Authority done in recent years to ensure that the industry continues to grow and meet market demand?</h4><p><span></span>We are now at the stage where we are reorganizing all the sectors within insurance. We have new regulations that address investment and finance and concern both takaful and conventional insurance. We already have the brokerage firms regulation in operation, which came out in 2013. We are working with actuaries to ensure that most of the companies are solvent and comply with international solvency levels. These are the major topics we are working on.</p><h4>How do you see the role of takaful in the insurance industry of the country?</h4><p><span></span>We currently have around 10 takaful companies in the UAE, and we have been discussing how we can improve the law and regulations to make them more beneficial for both sides. We need to promote takaful, and are in the process of creating the sharia committee that the law requires. And this national sharia committee will help companies comply with the law.</p><h4>How would you assess the growth that the local insurance industry has experienced in recent years?</h4><p><span></span>Every year, we have a growth rate of around 10%. What we want, however, is a higher penetration rate. There is growth in a general sense, but on the life side I do not think there is enough. This is where we are now focusing. We need more products and penetration, and we are helping companies achieve this. Therefore, we are working with them to develop new products and get them onto the market quicker. We have been approached by government entities and professionals that want a specialized contract for their business. We are helping them liaise with companies to ensure this happens.</p><h4>What is being done currently to increase the insurance penetration rate? </h4><p><span></span>We cannot tell companies to “do this." They have to come up with the ideas. However, if government or professional entities approach us, then we will work with them. Basically, we go to companies and say that if they want a policy for life or their children, then offer them a proposal that could meets their needs. It is not our job, but we are trying to liaise between companies so that we can increase penetration. Our mandate is the regulation and supervision of the industry. Although we facilitate the growth of the business, we do not seek to interfere.</p><h4>In early 2014, the Insurance Authority signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Hamdan Bin Mohammed Smart University (HBMSU). How will this contribute to the country's insurance sector?</h4><p><span></span>We are working with HBMSU to ensure that more students go to university to study insurance, because we need to increase the level of awareness. That is why we are taking up MoUs with not only this university, but are also looking at other universities in the UAE, allowing us to establish dialogue to enhance the sector. The UAE used to have universities that offered insurance degrees. At the moment, there are no courses because not enough people were interested. The UAE needs more people in this field, and for this reason we are working with universities to try and create an appealing and useful program for the youth. We are interested in doing campaigns in universities, malls, and schools to spread this awareness of insurance and that this is a good field to study.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the history of Chedid Capital Holding in Dubai and the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>For Chedid Capital Holding, the UAE is of great importance. It is a very dynamic and competitive market, which makes it extremely challenging. At Chedid Capital Holding, we see these parameters as very exciting, and we tune our team mind accordingly. Therefore, we understand that to be successful we always have to anticipate our clients' needs before it becomes obvious. On the other hand, since we are based in Lebanon, we have the luxury of cost advantage and can attract competent and committed human resources at relatively acceptable packages that give us a competitive edge. Our team is trained to respond and offer a high level of service and we are reachable seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and ready to run the extra mile. We understand that the deal is just a few breaths away from our competitors.</p><h4>How would you describe your client base or your partner base in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>The UAE market is very dynamic and active, and I believe it is one of the most enjoyable markets to service. It is also an extremely aggressive market, as you have to be innovative and willing to run the extra mile. Over the years, we have managed to build a sound and respectful reputation, and our clients are more comfortable dealing with us since they are convinced that Chedid Capital Holding is a reliable partner of choice.</p><h4>How would you describe your growth strategy for the UAE market?</h4><p><span></span>Our growth strategy relies on the areas with unexploited opportunity, especially regarding the restrictions imposed by the reinsurers on the businesses shared between the insurance companies. Previously, many mid-sized businesses and SMEs were not routed to the open market because that business used to be shared between the insurance companies locally. However, with the restrictions imposed by treaty reinsurers, they cannot carry on with such an arrangement. Consequently, we are seeing a great deal of growth in the SME business as a result of the new applicable restrictions. We have to keep in mind that although the primary market is growing by double digits every year, the reinsurance market is shrinking because this premium is being retained, meaning that many proportional arrangements are shifting to excess of loss arrangements. Many premiums on the topside are being retained by the companies, the potential growth lies in the business that used to be shared between the players, and this is what we are currently focusing on.</p><h4>How important do you think creating a UAE-based association of insurance companies and brokers is?</h4><p><span></span>Any joint effort is much better than a unilateral action. If you have an association to discuss threats that the market is encountering or the challenges that we have, and it is finding solutions or imposing regulations to assist, then I think this benefits the country's economy as a whole. When a governing body is in place, those who benefit the most out of such initiatives are the companies themselves since we will be tackling obstacles from a macro perspective.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the Ministry's priorities when it comes to diversifying the UAE's energy mix leading up to 2030?</h4><p><span></span>Natural gas accounts for almost 100% of our energy currently, but we know that this will not last. We want to increase green energy as a share of the overall electricity sector. We aim, by 2020, to achieve around 30% of electricity generation from emission-free sources, with 25% from nuclear power and the remainder from solar energy. Today, we have three solar projects that are currently in the bidding phase, each at 100 MW. One is in Al Ain, and the other is in Dubai. At the end of 2014, we hope to be at the final investment decision stage to start constructing the largest single-site LNG receiving facility in the region, the Emirates LNG receiving terminal at Fujairah. With a capacity of 9 million tons, it will enable us to deal with future growth in demand. We have received commercial bids, and we are currently evaluating them. The facility will help us to diversify our gas import market by having three different forms: indigenous gas, pipeline gas, and LNG. The fact that gas prices are increasing has made us consider sour gas projects. Electricity demand is growing at around 6% per annum in the UAE, and that requires additional resources every year. The first sour gas project is Al Hosn Gas' Shah field, which will start production in 2015. We are now implementing the second sour project, Bab, which Shell is developing. That will come in 2017. With electricity as the largest consumer of gas, we are working with electricity providers and regulators across the Emirates to establish a unified conservation law to encourage people to consume less. The levels of subsidies paid by the government will triple when the more expensive gas comes into the system. We want to look at this structurally and with a unified approach. We are trying to monitor newly built housing and structures through green initiatives, which force the construction of energy-efficient buildings. However, existing buildings are less efficient. We have launched the first UAE Energy Status Report for 2015 in collaboration with the UN, which puts together all of these initiatives and all of the work that has been done in one easily comprehensible format.</p><h4>What is the Ministry doing to make solar energy more attractive and feasible for the private sector?</h4><p><span></span>We are trying to make the tariff attractive and reasonable, while at the same time looking at the costs of generation for solar energy. The PV Solar energy generation cost went as low as $0.12 per KWh. This makes solar much more attractive. The UAE, and the wider region, have the lowest tariffs in the world, and we are going to try to raise them when prices increase. If we reach $0.15-0.16 per KWh, that would be reasonable. In Europe, it is around $0.33 per KWh. It is not costing us as much as it used to, but people need to preserve energy. People are now living in larger houses with many more amenities. The aim is for a reasonable per capita use of energy.</p><h4>How are you working to bring about change in consumption behavior toward conservation?</h4><p><span></span>Talking to, and incentivizing people, is extremely important to us. We have started giving lectures to this effect. I myself have gone to universities for this purpose. We gave a televised lecture at the Majlis of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, which was attended by government officials, businessmen, and diplomats, along with about 300-400 other citizens, on the subject of the importance of the conservation of energy. We also allocated several prizes across the different sectors for consumers. We launched the UAE prize for electricity and water conservation achievements offered to housewives, schools, and mosques for reducing energy and water consumption.</p><h4>In terms of solar energy technology, what role does innovation play alongside public-sector involvement and R&amp;D in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p><span></span>Innovation plays a key role, which is why we have not merely focused on attracting investors but have also emphasized R&amp;D. For example, through the Masdar Institute of Technology we are developing better and more efficient PV cells and working with international companies on new technology. Masdar is one of the leading companies that is wholly owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. It is a major investor in a variety of renewable energies. We are also working directly with the industry by putting seed capital into research projects in companies. Our market is open for this, and has attracted people to work on innovation in this area; however, we do not want to over-subsidize the sector. Incentives and new technology are coming to the market, and I believe that we have an excellent future in solar energy.</p><h4>How does the recent slump in oil prices affect your outlook on production capacity building?</h4><p><span></span>Capacity is for the long term. As a mature investor in and producer of oil, we always look at the long term to continue to being a reliable producer. Upstream energy requires such investments to cater to the shortage that is coming to the market. However, pricing is important, and what led to the development of fracking in the US was pricing. If pricing there does not adjust, investors will leave; you don't produce oil to lose money. I don't see these low prices as the new norm. The current low prices aren't going to affect the major players, such as the UAE, in the long term. The worry is that if the cost of production stays higher than the price for consumers, investors will be scared off. We need them to stay and help us supply the world with what it needs. Imagine what would have happened to prices if shale oil had not been around over the past four years. It has been a huge help to the world to keep prices reasonable and sustainable, at around $100 per barrel. The context is important; this is not the first time we have seen a slump, and in general, 2014 was a good year for us, with average prices still standing at around $100.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Norway and Abu Dhabi are both in a transitional state, diversifying their economies away from dependence on oil revenues. What similarities exist between the two regions in regards to this shift?</h4><p><span></span>Norway and the UAE are both small countries, but large energy producers. Although the petroleum sector contributes significantly to the national economies, both countries also have a strong focus on renewable energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS). This is particularly evident when it comes to R&amp;D in renewable energy sources. Norway has, together with Iceland, the largest share of renewable energy production—and consumption—in Europe. Nearly all of the electricity in Norway comes from hydropower. Norway and the UAE, with Abu Dhabi in the forefront, are both committed to reducing CO2 in order to mitigate climate change. The two countries collaborate in the major global processes to achieve this goal.</p><h4><span></span>Statoil, Norway's state oil company, is one of the top international oil companies bidding in Abu Dhabi's main onshore oil concessions, as the historic 75-year operations agreement expired in January 2014. What is Statoil's main value-added as a partner in operating the UAE's biggest onshore oilfields?</h4><p><span></span>Statoil is the largest operator on the Norwegian continental shelf and has more than 40 years of experience in developing cutting-edge technology for producing both oil and gas. I believe Statoil can add value to particularly three areas that are of importance to Abu Dhabi; increased oil recovery, gas production, and CCS. Increased oil recovery is important both because it represents enormous value and ensures that natural resources are not wasted. Statoil is already a world leader in increased oil recovery with an average recovery rate of 50%. Thus it can contribute with important technology and experience.</p><p><span></span>Abu Dhabi plans to spend over $60 billion over the next decade to expand its oil and gas industry and is looking to increase its sustainable oil production capacity from 2.8 million to 3.5 million barrels per day by 2017. What opportunities do you see for further collaboration and between Norway and Abu Dhabi in light of these aims?</p><p><span></span>The Norwegian petroleum industry has developed world-class technology and expertise. Increased oil recovery is one area that will be crucial in order for Abu Dhabi to reach its ambitious goals. Both Statoil and the world leading Norwegian supply industry can contribute with technology and expertise in this development. I would also like to mention that due to a strong CO2 taxation regime on the Norwegian continental shelf, the Norwegian industry has had a strong economic incentive to research and develop more environmentally friendly technology. This has led to operators and suppliers on the Norwegian continental shelf being world leading when it comes to producing oil and gas in a sustainable manner. I believe this fits with Abu Dhabi's role both as a large energy producer and ambitions to mitigate climate change.</p><h4><span></span>How do you view Norway's and Abu Dhabi's role in leading the transition toward clean energy technology and a more sustainable energy future in the decades to come?</h4><p><span></span>The contribution of small countries like Norway and Abu Dhabi is mainly in the areas of research and technology development, in addition to promoting international cooperation.</p><p><span></span>Both countries are undertaking focused efforts into this contribution and this is particularly evident when it comes to renewable energy and CCS. In this context, I would like to mention Abu Dhabi's Masdar City as an ambitious initiative in the pursuit of developing sustainable cities. The fact that the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has its headquarters in Abu Dhabi is further proof of these ambitious renewable energy policies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Applus Velosi been adding value to the local and regional markets with Abu Dhabi as its base in the Middle East?</h4><p>We have been in Abu Dhabi for many years, so we are well known in our industry. Our main business is testing, inspection, and certification. For example, if TAKREER has a refinery expansion it would order equipment and materials, and it needs to know that its vendors are going to be producing what it needs on time and on specification. Our company has a worldwide network of inspectors who visit vendor sites and help to ensure that costly delays and rework are avoided. We also provide third-party inspections at the customer's own site to certify the integrity of the installed unit. Other services include non-destructive testing. For example, if a customer is building a pipeline, the welds that connect each section need to be absolutely perfect. We will carry out ultra-sonic testing or radiographic testing, or whatever the job requires, to check the integrity of the welds.</p><h4>What factors drove the bulk of your business in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>Our business is driven by projects. The oil refinery is a nice example. The nuclear power projects ongoing in the Emirates are opportunities for us as well and we do provide services there. One interesting thing that stands out when you look at where the UAE's capital is spent is that there is a lot more being spent in construction than in hydrocarbons. The Etihad Rail project is a great example. In the last year or so, the number of new projects in the oil and gas business has fallen away slightly. There is more to come, of course, but when I look at the mix of investments and where capital is being spent, there are superb opportunities for us in infrastructure and construction, as well as the traditional oil and gas chain. So my focus is shifting toward developing new services for those sectors.</p><h4>How are you capitalizing on the opportunities that you see arising with various projects in the pipeline?</h4><p><span></span>One such opportunity is services, in which we are already successful and well established, such as lift equipment inspection. Every construction site we see has huge tower cranes. They all need to be inspected and certified. It is very much the same service, and delivered by the same inspectors. The obvious thing to do is to take a successful service and replicate that success in another sector. We also provide HSE services to many sectors. The other thing we are doing is introducing new services, like mechanical and electrical power systems, such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in buildings. We are helping our customers to make certain that everything they do is compliant with the regulations. Regulations drive everything we do. Companies won't spend money if they don't have to.</p><h4>What makes Applus Velosi the partner of choice for industry players?</h4><p><span></span>One thing that we have in our favor is that we have been around for many years, so we know our customers very well. We are pre-qualified with all the major operating companies and are very experienced. We continuously review the services that we provide to make sure that the latest technology is available to our customers, not just at the point where the projects are being built and commissioned, but also throughout the operating life of the project. We provide asset integrity management services, which assess the life of a process unit, for example, and how to extend it. We introduce services that go beyond the commodity.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[here-we-go]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the new technologies that you are bringing to the market here?</h4><p><span></span>We were pleased to have had the global launch for the GeoSphere reservoir-mapping-while drilling service here in Abu Dhabi in May of 2014 and GeoSphere won the ADIPEC award for Best Technology and Innovation in November of the same year. The GeoSphere service allows you to see up to 35m from the well bore, revolutionizing the ability to map the reservoir as it is being drilled. If we look at reservoir characterization and seismic data processing, we have one of the largest centers in the region. We are acquiring seismic data and one of the technologies we have introduced here is called the UniQ service, which is a single point source receiver that offers high fidelity seismic data enabling the imaging of structures never seen before. We have also introduced the Saturn 3D radial probe, which is a reservoir-sampling tool. We have always lead the way in sampling technology; however, Saturn takes it to a new level and allows the acquisition of samplings in much tighter formations while significantly reducing the risks of getting stuck while sampling. This benefits the drillers and allows us to acquire samples in formations that were previously difficult to acquire.</p><h4>What does the next phase of technology look like at Schlumberger?</h4><p><span></span>As far as the UAE market is concerned, the main technical challenges are extended reach drilling and the sour gas development by Al Hosn and Shell. We are looking to enhance the existing technology to meet the increasing complexities within the extended reach and sour gas environment in the UAE, where there is high H2S and high CO2. Most importantly, it is about the reliability of that technology. We have an Excellence in Execution initiative to achieve this. A key concern for the whole industry is reliability of technology. To address this, Schlumberger launched an Excellence in Execution initiative to improve tool reliability and to further operational excellence. Another area where service providers can play a key part is in efficiency. We are reducing our footprint in the fields by doing some of the jobs remotely where we can control the tools and communicate off-site. Our remote operations are definitely complimenting new technology as well.</p><h4>How is Schlumberger adapting to the declining price of oil and in what ways do you expect the market to adjust?</h4><p><span></span>It has been made certain that the UAE will carry on with all their major projects. We will have to see how new projects will be affected. As service providers, we are in a bubble. We expect there will be pressure on compensation and the pricing of our services, which is something we saw coming. Our role is to maintain the efficiency and the reliability of our services, which translates to more cost effective solutions for our clients. Simply giving discounts is not necessarily the right solution. We maintain our focus on offering reliable tools whether oil prices go up or down. It is a continuous process and commitment we have with our clients and the UAE. We are continuing with several of our internal transformation initiatives, which are transmitting into more efficient, more reliable services, overall, giving more cost effective solutions to our clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Agthia's overall performance for the past year?</h4><p><span></span>We are quite satisfied with our overall financial and business performance. We have continued to advance our strategy of driving profitable growth across our core businesses, implementing cost saving initiatives, diversifying and launching new products, expanding our distribution reach, enhancing the in-store presence, and at the same time addressing underperforming businesses. In addition, we also continue to enhance our manufacturing capabilities and remain focused on improving operating and cost efficiencies. Furthermore, the company's business and financial fundamentals are strong with a solid balance sheet to support our expansion plans. Agthia recorded net sales of approximately $326 million for the first nine months of 2014, an increase of 9% over the same period in 2013. Our net profit stood at $41 million, which represented a 26% increase YoY.</p><h4>To what do you attribute the 10% YoY increase in net sales within the consumer division, and what is your near-term focus in the water, beverages, food, and dairy segments moving forward?</h4><p><span></span>The bottled water, beverage, and dairy segments are growing categories and provide us with opportunities to further strengthen our position by gaining market share, expanding distribution reach, strengthening in-store presence and enhancing our product offerings to consumers. In addition to this, there are M&amp;A opportunities within these categories, which is part of our growth strategy.</p><h4>How have the company's recent expansion projects added value to Agthia, and what projects are currently underway?</h4><p><span></span>We have been growing faster than the category in all our key businesses, and our overall sales CAGR over the last seven years has been 19%. In order to meet the increasing demand for our products we have set up our distribution center in Abu Dhabi and expanded our production capacity for bottled water, flour, and animal feed. In addition, we have invested in new categories, for example dairy and frozen baked products. We have plans to further expand production capacity of bottled water and feed, and set up a distribution center in Dubai. All these initiatives obviously have resulted in delivering strong sales and profit growth. As far as dairy and frozen baked products investments are concerned, these are new categories we have entered recently and will take some time to become profitable.</p><h4>In light of Agthia's second year of increasing total net sales, total volume, and total profit figures, what opportunities do you see for future growth in the industry?</h4><p><span></span>All product categories that we compete in are growing. Our sales growth is ahead of the category growth and will further strengthen our market position. We expect growth in the food and beverage sectors in the UAE and wider GCC as the population and tourism grows. Consumers are becoming more health conscious, which in future will involve adjusting our strategy in line with change in consumer behaviors. Furthermore, we also expect some consolidation happening in the food industry in the years to come.</p><h4>How have government initiatives promoting food security and domestic production impacted agri-business in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>The UAE government's initiatives to promote food security and encourage domestic food production, has helped to create favorable conditions for the segment. Growth is mainly driven by poultry and large animal feed.</p><h4>What is your outlook on continued economic growth in the region in 2015 and beyond?</h4><p><span></span>Although regional economic growth uncertainty and the commodity market volatility suggest challenges, the company's strong balance sheet along with a clear strategy to continue driving profitable growth across our core businesses, improving profitability, diversifying and launching new products, and expanding our distribution reach provides us with reason to remain optimistic on the company's prospects for future revenue and profit growth. The focus will also be to capture the white spaces within our existing geographies, and at the same time evaluate expanding distribution in Egypt and entering the Saudi Arabian market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ministry of Higher Education progressing in implementing its 2010—2020 strategy?</h4><p><span></span>When the 10-year strategy was announced in February 2010 as a national document to achieve the UAE Vision 2021 on its Golden Jubilee, it was aimed at making the UAE among the best countries in the world, according to four pillars: an ambitious and confident people maintaining their heritage, a strong union united by a common destiny, a competitive economy led by the UAE citizens distinguished by creativity, and knowledge and the quality of a good life in a nurturing and sustainable environment. The Ministry draws its strategy from these four pillars, bearing in mind creating a generation of citizens confident in their leadership abilities, in their land, in their homeland, and in the potential of their State to strengthen the union through this generation; hence, it could not only keep up with the developments, but to lead and always be in the foreground, and the road to this is knowledge and sustainable knowledge in all areas of life. We developed our strategic plan for 2014-2016 in order to contribute to the achievement of the knowledge society and the development of higher education and scientific research in the state. In addition to the establishment of the National Committee for Scholarships, with the aim of ensuring complementarity and coordination between scholarship authorities in the state, we aim to guide the system of scholarships and grants in line with the laws of the Ministry and to develop a strategy and performance indicators for the scholarship system to meet the needs of the labor market in the State. The signing of several agreements and memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with countries that have pioneering experiences in higher education and scientific research to raise the e-readiness and transformation of our services into smart services for more convenience for the customer have increased well-being and happiness indicators in the UAE under the guidance and initiatives of our wise leadership.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for educators, entrepreneurs, investors, and education businesses in the higher education sector in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>The higher education system is a consistently integrated one; any change that occurs in one of the paths is definitely followed by change in other paths; the UAE market is a promising market and an attractive environment. In addition to local investments, foreign investment in the state reached $14.4 billion in the year 2014. Education and communication technology is considered one of the sectors with the most investment. The UAE is the first among Arab countries in attracting FDI due to sustainable infrastructure, pro-business legislation and regulations, safety and security, and harmony between more than 200 nationalities living in the UAE. In addition to a State-led green economy initiative regionally and its adoption of green technology, this means growing opportunities for innovation, scientific research, inventions, and academic study in the various fields of science. The state attracts prestigious top universities to set up branches in the UAE, and studies indicate that the number of students in GCC countries is continuously growing, and it is expected to reach 11.6 million in 2016. And through local or international exhibitions held in the state, which specialize in education and employment, the UAE environment is one of the most attractive environments for investment in education, and investment in some Emirates is expected to grow by 60% by the year 2020.</p><h4>What legislative reforms have been key to the education sector's development in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>All the affairs of higher education and scientific research are continually discussed under the umbrella of the Federal National Council, and take all appropriate decisions consistent with the vision and ambition of the UAE in cooperation with the relevant institutions and bodies. The Ministry does not work in isolation; on the contrary, it is the federal agency most interconnected with others, and the proposals submitted by the Ministry or other relevant actors are discussed in order to develop or update some systems so as to improve and keep up with changes on the global education front, however big or small these proposals might be.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Abu Dhabi's healthcare sector embarks on a new phase of reform through HAAD's five-year strategic plan, how do you characterize the importance of the Health Authority's role within the sector?</h4><p><span></span>The HAAD is the regulatory body of the healthcare sector for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and ensures excellence in healthcare for the community by monitoring the health status of the population. HAAD defines the strategy for the health system, the health status of the population, and the performance of the system. In addition, HAAD shapes the regulatory framework for the health system, inspects against regulations, enforces standards, and encourages adoption of best practice and performance targets by all healthcare service providers in the Emirate. HAAD also drives programs to increase awareness and adoption of healthy living standards among the residents of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in addition to regulating scope of services, premiums and reimbursement rates of the health system in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>How do you face maintaining international best practices and evidence-based clinical best practices with an expenditure that keeps going up each year?</h4><p>This is a challenge being faced in almost every country around the world, not just in Abu Dhabi or the region. The goal is to monitor and improve access, quality, and control cost of care. Our five-year strategy is a very robust document that has had stakeholder involvement and consensus throughout.</p><h4>What are the key objectives laid out in HAAD's five-year strategy?</h4><p><span></span>Improving the availability and access to a full spectrum of health care services across the entire Emirate is a key priority. We have developed both the Health Statistics reports and the Capacity Master Plan, which use data to identify capacity gaps, enabling us to determine how best to fill them—be it through private or public sector investment—with avoidance of duplicated efforts. Ultimately, this will minimize the need for patients to seek medical treatment abroad, which has a significant financial impact, as well as improve access to care in rural areas. Currently, under-serviced areas include intensive and critical care medicine, emergency care, neonatology, pediatrics, oncology, orthopedics, rehabilitation and psychiatry. Sub-specialty gaps also exist in pediatrics and pediatric surgery, as well as adult sub-specialties such as neurosurgery, plastics, and surgical oncology. It is imperative that we are transparent about what services are lacking in order to encourage investors to participate in those areas. Another important element in elevating the quality of care is the implementation of initiatives to attract, train, and retain healthcare professionals, with a specific focus on increasing the number of Emiratis in the sector. Currently, there is high medical staff turnover and few Emirati physicians and nurses. This must be addressed if we are to create a sustainable industry. We are working with institutions like SEHA, Tawteen Council, and the Higher Colleges of Technology to develop programs with this aim. UAE University already has a medical school in Al Ain and Khalifa University is planning to establish one as well. Sheikha Fatima College of Health Sciences has also expanded to provide degree programs in fields including nursing and paramedics. The next priority of our strategy is emergency preparedness. We were under heavy pressure during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-COV) in 2012, but our systems were able to cope with it very well and contain the infection. We optimized the way that the hospitals dealt with patients who had the virus. Thankfully, we have had zero cases of Ebola, but several suspected cases were managed according to international best practice. The final priority is public health, where we go by the adage that prevention is better than cure. A healthy diet and lifestyle is important, and that applies to non-communicable disease. Tackling smoking is an important part of this. Abu Dhabi has successfully hosted the World Congress for Tobacco or Health in March 2015. For communicable disease, vaccines are essential. The Emirate is now going through a revaccination of Polio and Measles through a nationwide campaign to make sure we have 100% participation. In a very short period of time, Abu Dhabi has evolved to the point of 100% compliance with an e-claims system, ensuring that all patient interactions with health care providers are recorded electronically. We are still optimizing and fine-tuning the system, with the most recent changes encompassing the introduction of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). However, the continued enhancement of our health care informatics and e-health platform will enable further exchange of data among providers, which will then give us the ability to achieve our goals on our specified priority areas of focus.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Abu Dhabi's economy developed and diversified in recent years?</h4><p><span></span>Thanks to the Emirate's wise leadership and continuous efforts to maximize benefits from oil revenues, Abu Dhabi's economy registered significant progress in all key areas of development. Economic development in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in recent years has been characterized by the increased focus on channeling investments into non-oil sectors, to advance the diversification of the economic base and its income sources. This approach has been matched by government efforts to stimulate private sector involvement to contribute actively to the Emirate's development process through laying down the foundations for an attractive and competitive business environment. The diversification strategy has succeeded in enhancing non-oil sector activities within the country. Abu Dhabi's real GDP achieved a growth rate of 5.6% in 2012. In addition, non-oil economic activities have been experiencing stable growth rates between 5% and 9% during the period 2007-12, which in turn have raised the contribution of non-oil economic activities to the real GDP from less than 44% in 2007 to 49% in 2013. Abu Dhabi's economy has clearly made significant strides in a short period of time and is steadily moving toward greater progress and development. The Abu Dhabi government is seeking to transform the Emirate into a diversified knowledge-based economy, capable of achieving sustainable development, as well as regional leadership and competitiveness at the global level.</p><h4>With 2015 being named the Year of Innovation, how do you view the Ministry's role in cultivating a culture of innovation in Abu Dhabi and the UAE at large?</h4><p><span></span>The federal government in general and the Ministry of Economy in particular do not spare any efforts in advancing and encouraging innovation and research in the UAE. Our national agenda focuses on building a sustainable knowledge-based economy and our target is to increase the share of knowledge-based sectors to 5% of the UAE's GDP by 2021. We are collaborating with all concerned stakeholders to enhance the business environment and support innovation and creativity. We do this through developing the country's legal and legislative framework with the aim of creating a competitive, highly productive, and sustainable economy. A major milestone in building a competitive economy will be the launch of our National Patent Center to inspect, award, and register patents in the UAE. We believe this process will greatly encourage technological innovation and economic growth in the country and the wider region. Finally, the National Innovation Strategy, which was launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai in 2014, will further encourage the UAE as a whole to position itself among the most innovative nations in the world within the next six years.</p><h4>What opportunities exist for partnerships, knowledge transfer, and investment into the critical growth sectors outlined in the Abu Dhabi Vision 2030?</h4><p><span></span>Through our local and foreign relations, we are always working on attracting investors from developed countries. During our visits outside the UAE, we focus on establishing synergies with technological and industrial development research centers primarily in fields that are beneficial to the UAE as a whole as well as the individual emirates. The government is actively stimulating FDI, and providing various opportunities for investors, particularly in areas that contribute to the transfer of technology and expertise. The UAE Offset Program, now renamed the Tawazun Economic Program, is a huge initiative that will aid the economy. The Offset Program ensures that local capacities are built through the transfer of technologies (from foreign contractors), and opens up markets related to these specific purchases. The program has gone a long way toward diversifying the UAE's economy and creating new ventures in various sectors by partnering with international defense contractors. To date, the program has effectively generated several multi-million dollar joint ventures in various economic and industrial sectors including ship building, district cooling, aircraft leasing, fish farming, healthcare, agriculture, banking, and education. R&amp;D and knowledge transfer at a regional level can also help to facilitate the development of industrial and service clusters that can in turn have a transformative impact on a country's economy.</p><h4>What was the significance of the UAE's first Economic Planning Forum held in the Emirate of Fujairah in 2014 for the Ministry's objectives of boosting cooperation between federal and local governments from each of the seven Emirates?</h4><p><span></span>This and future forums will have a major impact on the country's national economy. The aim of these forums is to offer an advanced discussion platform for all participants and stakeholders concerned with the development of the national economy on both local and federal levels. The forums are in line with our strategy to step-up cooperation among the different Emirates. The Economic Planning Forum concept is aligned with the national agenda adopted by the UAE government and calls for better coordination and collaboration from each Emirate. We are keen to streamline our efforts on the local and national levels and advance the growth of expertise to further boost the competitiveness of the nation as a whole, and develop a successful and sustainable economy. The forums facilitate better communication among individual Emirates, which results in better planning and more cohesive policies and strategies, eventually leading to a more advanced overall economy for the UAE. </p><h4>What regional economic role do you see Abu Dhabi taking on in the coming years?</h4><p><span></span>Abu Dhabi is set to play a major role in a range of economic activities. In addition to the traditional oil and gas industry in which Abu Dhabi is major international player, the Emirate has emerged as a regional and international leader in renewable energy through Masdar, the home of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the inter-governmental organization that supports countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future. Over the last few years, Abu Dhabi has made huge strides in logistics and transportation with new developments, such as the massive expansion of its international airport and the mega Khalifa Port project. The Kizad project and other investments in industry are also setting the scene for a paradigm shift in the Emirate's economy. In the future, there will also be a much greater focus on tourism, as several more projects are expected to be completed, including the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, the Louvre Abu Dhabi, and Saadiyat Island, among others. The Emirate's aviation industry is also advancing with double-digit growth rates annually. Abu Dhabi is aiming to become a regional and international hub for air travel through the rapid expansion of Etihad Airways, the second largest airline in the UAE, after Emirates. Abu Dhabi is also looking to play a leading role in the regional financial services sector through the implementation of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). Therefore, it is apparent that Abu Dhabi will play a significant role in the coming few years by emerging as a regional center for energy, logistics, transport, and also play an increasingly important role in trade, finance, tourism, and leisure.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's priorities in 2015 to further promote Abu Dhabi as a competitive, global business hub?</h4><p><span></span>As a federal ministry, we work on preparing the general plan for economic development in the country through relevant laws and bills that are aligned to the overall general federal strategy. Our immediate priorities for 2015 include outlining a general economic and trade policy, identifying action plans for the policy, and implementing those plans as soon and as effectively as possible. We offer complete support to Abu Dhabi and the other Emirates through our long-standing cordial relations, international agreements, visits, conferences, and trade fairs. We coordinate with other federal ministries and local authorities in each Emirate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When it comes to education, what are some focus areas that are important to the UAE?</h4><p>Focusing on education entails focusing on educators and on the mechanisms of action for raising teacher performance and experience, as well as updating academic curricula to meet the best international standards. We need to update the curricula because the requirements today in 2015 are different from what they were in the 1960s and 1970s. We have to tackle the socio-economic constraints of the Emirati disinclination toward the teaching profession. It is also important to develop digital infrastructure in order to meet the evolving requirements of modern education, and explore future trends in educational information technologies and their possible applications in the UAE. Moreover, there is a clear relationship between educational process and labor market needs; therefore, the output of the modern education process should be compatible with the labor market. Ultimately, this will enable us to create an advanced academic environment where a culture of excellence, creativity and innovation prevails among our students and youth, leading to a productive knowledge-based society in the UAE. It is worth mentioning here that the ECSSR, since 2010, organizes an annual education conference.</p><h4>The UAE embraces technology at a rapid pace compared to other countries in the region. What effect has technology had on society in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>In my book “From Tribe to Facebook: The Transformational Role of Social Networks," I have outlined that the proliferation of social networks has led to a social shift, and this phenomenon wouldn't have been possible without the unprecedented spread of technological advances. The UAE is an excellent consumer of technology; however, the UAE doesn't produce technology. There is a difference. When the Cabinet marked 2015 as the Year of Innovation, it is because they want people to produce technology and know it, not just consume it. In the same context came the Smart Government initiative launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Ruler of Dubai, UAE Vice President and Prime Minister. The UAE is highly developed compared to many countries in the Middle East, but as we embrace technology we have to be aware of the repercussions of interconnectedness and globalization.</p><h4>What makes Abu Dhabi an attractive place for foreign investment in the region?</h4><p><span></span>First is the stability in the UAE. As long as the UAE is able to maintain stability, foreign investment will continue to flow into the Emirates. Second is the laws that we have in place, which are supportive of foreign investment. These two factors are conducive to investment.</p><h4>How do you see the ECSSR's role in educating the public, and how are you looking to increase the ECSSR's influence in the near future?</h4><p><span></span>The ECSSR is a place where people come together and live in harmony with each other. We have people from all over the world coming here to deliver lectures. We never censor their ideas or tell them “say this, but don't say that;" people can say anything they like. These lectures are open, we publicize them in newspapers, and invite the public to attend. The ECSSR has become a destination of choice for both lecturers and audience. As for our research and publications, we need to ensure we have a wide network of distribution. The unfortunate part is that research is like milk, if you don't consume it on time it will expire and become irrelevant. We have excellent content; however, if we don't tell people about it, and if we don't publish in different languages—French, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, and Urdu for example—then it will remain at the local level, while we aim for global outreach. We have excellent publications, such as the most recent one Mirage, which I have published in Arabic and will be released in several languages soon. The book's main idea is the political illusion promoted by religious political groups among Arab and Muslim nations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Do you think your data is being used correctly by the business community in general?</h4><p>Part of SCAD's strategy is to support informed investment decisions by the private sector. The availability of reliable and relevant statistics promotes investors' confidence and facilitates informed decision-making. This mix serves as a platform for balanced and sustainable economic growth in the Emirate. SCAD compiles and disseminates a wide range of official statistics of interest to the business community. These include economic, demographic, agricultural, and environmental indicators. For example, GDP is one of the most important indicators of the economic performance of a country. The FDI statistics show something of the relationship between foreign investors and Abu Dhabi. The statistics demonstrate that European countries account for the largest proportion of FDI. SCAD undertakes a number of initiatives to improve the understanding and use of statistics, especially among those in the business community, including investors.</p><h4>Are you planning to expand your database to other fields in the near future?</h4><p><span></span>SCAD is keen to open up new opportunities by working with strategic partners in the government and the business world. The current Sport Survey, undertaken at the request of the Abu Dhabi Sport Council, will provide baseline information for planning and policy for sport, recreation, and community health in the Emirate. The Disability Survey is being undertaken in collaboration with the Zayed Higher Organization, and will produce measures such as disability prevalence rates and participation rates in education and work by persons with disabilities. Thus, we continue to make advances by coming up with new indicators in the economic and social sectors. Recently, SCAD released a new indicator called Expected Inflation, which we will continue to issue every quarter.</p><h4>How do you see your contribution to the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030?</h4><p><span></span>By law, the government acknowledges SCAD as the official statistical organization of Abu Dhabi. One of SCAD's strategic outcomes is to ensure sound government policies and decisions based on relevant statistics. Whenever official figures are needed, SCAD is the main resource for statistics. We have assumed the role as the trusted partner in providing timely and relevant statistical products, which support decision and policy makers. As such, SCAD is a key player in the pursuit of the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 under the umbrella of the Executive Council of Abu Dhabi Emirate. We have been an active contributor to the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 since its first draft, and we update all the data at appropriate intervals. As the provider of latest available data and official statistics, SCAD makes a fundamental contribution to the technical work aimed at achieving the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030. SCAD contributes to the Five-Year Economic Development Strategic Plan, which contains the guiding principles for Abu Dhabi to achieve its 2030 targets.</p><h4>What are the advantages of SCAD's recent MoU with the Italian National Institute?</h4><p><span></span>SCAD has signed several MoUs with key international statistical agencies. The first international agreement was signed with the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in February 2011 and Statistics Korea (KOSTAT) in September 2012. This year we signed an MoU with the Federal Statistical Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (Destatis), and most recently with the National Institute of Statistics of Italy (Istat) in May 2014. The aim of international cooperation is to boost the technical know-how in statistics, especially within the younger generation of UAE nationals. Building these alliances has supported SCAD's success in hosting the Conference of International Association for Official Statistics (IAOS) to be held in Abu Dhabi in 2016. By raising SCAD's profile internationally and with the transfer of knowledge and experience gained through our international partnerships, we hope for further success in bidding to host the International Statistical Institute World Statistics Congress (WSC ISI) 2021.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the current shifts and trends occurring in Abu Dhabi's water, wastewater, and electricity sectors?</h4><p>A huge amount of diversity and change is taking place. With electricity, we are seeing more renewable energy, more panels on roofs, and more involvement with customers—more focus is being put on conservation. There are many developments in the use of recycled water, particularly in the wastewater sector, where we have introduced a three-tap  approach that seeks to direct large users to the best source of water for their needs. In this connection, the three taps are; ground water, drinking water, and recycled water. The more recycled water we can use and the more efficiently we use it, the less drinking water we have to produce in the beginning. The key themes of diversity and sustainability run through everything we are doing.</p><h4>What are the goals behind the RSB's Business Continuity Management regulations?</h4><p><span></span>This is part of a much wider process the Abu Dhabi government has introduced in terms of planning requirements to ensure that, under any circumstances, business continues. For example, we have seven power plants in the Gulf waters producing drinking water using desalination technology. We have looked at the likelihood of incidents such as what would happen if these waters become heavily contaminated. In such a situation, we can supply all of our drinking water needs from Fujairah into Abu Dhabi. We have done that and tested the system and it works perfectly. We have also looked at things such as IT systems and if they would be prone to cyber attacks. In other words, we look at how to deal with worst-case scenarios for everything.</p><h4>What are some of the findings of your feasibility studies on waste-to-energy (WtE) technology in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p><span></span>Overall, we have a good understanding of WtE projects and have been working with deferent stockholders in studying these technologies. WtE incineration plants offer a reliable form of energy production and stop the release of dangerous gases ,such as methane, into the atmosphere. It is known as a carbon-neutral technology. However, in line with our conservation philosophy there are certain rules that apply to everyone in connection with waste. The first thing is to try not to produce much of it. The second is when you do produce waste, recycle as much as you can before burning it. The third is how you deal with the residue. The things you can't recycle easily, such as rubber, plastic, and organic materials, are either burnt or are fed into anaerobic digestives for the organic materials. The average electricity unit costs are pretty competitive compared with other technologies.</p><h4>What are some key features of the new Al Mirfa power and water plant, and how will it add value to the sector?</h4><p><span></span>The Al Mirfa plant is probably the most complex and unique plant procured since the restructuring of the sector in 1999. Utilizing four unused plants from one of the Northern Emirates with a total capacity of 400MW and new gas and steam turbines, the station will have a combined output capacity 1,600MW.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the targets in place to achieve the “BIOjet Abu Dhabi: Flight Path to Sustainability" venture project with Etihad Airways, the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, Boeing, and Total, and what is the expected timeline of this product?</h4><p><span></span>This product is introducing a certain percentage of biofuel into jet fuel. Etihad Airways is planning this in preparation for the expected future worldwide regulation that jet fuel should be composed of a certain percentage of biofuel. TAKREER participated in this project by refining the biofuel at TAKREER Research Centre and bringing it to the specifications required that can be blended into regular jet fuel, which was used in a test flight by Etihad last January. The initiative is currently in the early stages and Masdar Institute is embarking on research to generate biofuel from crops that are inedible. We are continuing to work with Etihad and Masdar in this direction, because we see the biofuel production in the future as complementary to our efforts, in view of the expected increase in demand for jet fuel due to the rapid expansion of the aviation industry in the Emirates and the region.</p><h4>In the UAE market, TAKREER has just begun distributing its new low-sulfur, environmentally friendly diesel fuel. What is the significance of this milestone for TAKREER?</h4><p><span></span>This product falls in line with the sustainability efforts undertaken by ADNOC. We introduced this product, the Green Diesel, in the market in July 2014. All diesel types in the UAE meet now the Euro5 specifications, which is 10 parts per million (ppm) of sulfur. We are proud of being the first country in the region to introduce this sort of high-level product in the market. TAKREER was already ahead of its time two years ago, and in anticipation of the expected regulation we were able to start production after completing and commissioning the Green Diesel Project in Ruwais, which enabled us to convert all the diesel produced in our facilities into Green Diesel that meet the Euro5 specifications. This is important for us for obvious environmental reasons, and also to cope with the global market trend to go with low-sulfur diesel. We are happy to see such a regulation is enforced in our country. ADNOC had committed itself to meeting this regulation and invested in our facilities to ensure its smooth implementation. For the external market, we will be able to export this low-sulfur diesel to locations where it is required, whether in Europe or the Far East, which will give us a more competitive edge as it is a higher value product.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you think the 2015 European Games will add to the continent's sporting landscape, and what does this event signal about the future of global sports?</h4><p>There were many people, including myself, who at the onset felt that Europe already had a lot of continental championships. Why overcrowd the calendar with another major international sports event? However, after rethinking and talking among ourselves in the Olympic world, I believe the European Games are on par with the general tradition and trend that every continent should have a regional games or a continental games. There are, of course, other types of multi-sports events, but it is fair that Europe has their own continental games. The only worry that we have to address is, of course, managing athletes in different sports who already have busy seasons, with other world championships and regional games elsewhere. You just have to ensure that they know this and can adjust their season accordingly. Still, the European Games reflect a great opportunity for different countries around Europe to host events that are more manageable than Olympic Games. The choice of Azerbaijan is very interesting in that I know this country wants to host many international events, and I think that it is great exposure for them and probably a stepping stone to other major events.<br></p><h4>What does Baku bring to the table as the inaugural host city?</h4><p>I hope that they do not place the bar too high that others will not be able to follow, because I get the feeling that they want to make their mark and do great things. Azerbaijan has developed incredibly over the past few years, and one unique thing is that they are on the frontier of Europe and Asia and, therefore, are a great link to other parts of the world. The Caucasus region is also historically within the Silk Road and represents a great tradition of exchange and meeting of people from different horizons all around the world. It is a unique culture, and a fortuitous set of circumstances has brought people here. If that can be reflected in the Games, it will be a great success. International sports have a great ability to unite people anyway; however, if it can also be in this kind of atmosphere, then the discovery of a unique culture makes the experience that much more pleasurable and interesting.</p><h4>Where do you see opportunities for increased cooperation between Monaco and Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We are talking about cultural events and exchanges related to the Games, such as a small exhibition on my family and my parents that will open in time for the Games. I think it would be interesting at some point to see if the equivalent of our Chamber of Commerce in Monaco, which is the Chamber of Economic Development can coordinate to meet some business leaders from Azerbaijan. I believe that would be very productive and I think they could find great synergies for cooperation in different areas.<br> <br>Photograph: G.

		<url><![CDATA[a-balanced-relationship]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the performance of Burgan Bank over 2014 and into 2015?</h4><p>The performance of the bank has been consistently solid, like most other banks in Kuwait; however, our model is different, as we are the most international Kuwaiti bank. First, we have the largest relative international presence compared to others, because in terms of our expansion strategy we decided to diversify out of Kuwait into faster growth markets. At the same time, diversification has to do with risk management. The more diversified you are, your ability to endure and keep growing becomes more solid. Second, we focus on quality earnings, and we are not based on one-off large gains or deals. Third, We are truly customer-centric. We look for long-term relationships with our customers, and offer products that are relevant and needed by the customers, allowing for a balanced relationship between the customer and the bank. Our model has proven to be successful. We have been able to outpace growth in both the market and wider region for the past four years, delivering solid returns to our shareholders and continuing to gain market share and generate profit in the core market.</p><h4>How would you describe the health of Kuwait's banking sector?</h4><p>The health of the market, like many other conditions, has several variables. If you think in terms of solvency and the strength of the system, the Kuwaiti banking system is one of the strongest in the world, thanks to the players present and the support given by a strong government. This is also backed up by the fact that the Central Bank, by law, backs 100% of deposits, irrespective of the amount. It is true that Kuwait is not at the forefront of innovation; yet, that has not precluded effective performance. Kuwait focuses on fundamentals, and our customers tend not to look for complex structures. However, we could benefit from evolution as the market very heavily depends on the strength of the government, which could still safeguard the system in extreme circumstances.</p><div class="quote">“The performance of the bank has been consistently solid, like most other banks in Kuwait."</div><h4>What is your strategy when it comes to building the retail side of Burgan Bank's operations?</h4><p>The building of the retail business is like the planning of a city. You can quickly build houses and buildings and appear to be modern; however, you will eventually end up in trouble if your fundamentals are not in place. Therefore, we are redesigning channels and implementing a new core banking system. We have redefined products and pricing, and are building on that. We are here to create value, meaning that we cannot build without tangible results. We have timed this based on our ability to remain profitable; still, our strategy in Kuwait, which is a relatively small country, is about focusing on the basic needs and doing them well, quickly, and building on customer satisfaction. We are not going to fight for the largest market share or the most sophisticated product suite, but eventually our customers will be the happiest in the market. If we can achieve that, then results and profitability comes and there is nothing more effective in marketing for growth in retail than happy customers.</p><h4>What are you doing to facilitate international banking in Kuwait?</h4><p>In reality, being customer-centric means that we are building around the success of our customers. We are helping customers do things outside of their environments, as well as serving customers in other jurisdictions. In order to help Kuwait to grow—and this is a country that has unbelievable possibilities due to some competitive advantages—someone has to occupy the space of being the conduit of helping our customers here to be successful elsewhere in the world. We are not the only ones, but right now we have the largest footprint out of Kuwait; therefore, we have a competitive edge to build on. Our code of behavior is also solid. A long-term relationship means that when our good customers have problems, we help them. We have been one of the most loyal banks to our customers, as well as one of the most active in letting go of customers that we don't feel are compatible with our way of doing business.</p><h4>What growth opportunities are you looking into beyond Kuwait?</h4><p>There are three markets in the region that are interesting to us as we have publically announced, that we will eventually extend our footprint to. These are Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. I look at the Emirates with enormous respect. It has been successful and has registered a number of successes. Our customers are interested in doing business there, and we are helping them with this. We have recently obtained licenses to operate in the Dubai International Finance Center (DIFC). I don't believe we will enter the retail-banking sphere in the UAE, as it is an over-banked environment; however, you cannot be successful in this part of the world if you lack a successful operation there. We do not always require a physical presence to be operational, but if we have a presence in over 15 countries it provides us with a platform. It is important that we keep growing organically and remain profitable, acquiring good quality customers, manage risks well, and focusing on our strengths.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Burgan Bank in 2016?</h4><p>The penetration of Basel III has significantly affected the banking system around the world, particularly in Kuwait, which has been conservative. It has implications in terms of returns, for example, that have to be considered. Basel III was implemented in 2014, and we had to adjust our capital structure to comply with the new requirements. We did so by issuing some of the first instruments in Kuwait and the region. Today, it is a case of continuing our buildup, while consolidating our recent acquisitions. We have several projects in the pipeline, and need to manage our risk profile carefully. We are profitable because we know how to operate in this environment. Sudden moves happen, as in Iraq; however, we are able to react quickly to remain profitable, and are happy with ourselves for being able to cope. We have to preserve our ability to adjust and evolve. That is absolutely critical. Ultimately we cannot be successful in environments such as this if we only performing well in expansionary cycles. We also perform well during recessions, and periods of stagnation, because our model is agile and resilient. And being agile regardless of the environment, it is a model that we intend to maintain.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Inadem was created in 2013. What have been your main goals in this period and what are your expectations for 2015?</h4><p>One of the goals of the current government is to raise the level of support for entrepreneurs and SMEs. The establishment of Inadem is in line with those targets and takes into account the important role that entrepreneurs play in the Mexican economy. The entrepreneur is a key factor in the development of Mexico. They are innovative, resourceful, and they strengthen the economy. As for the 2015 targets, we have an entrepreneurial fund to support ideas for start-ups. With these funds we help entrepreneurs to cope with the challenges they face in the process of consolidation of the ecosystem. In addition, we are also working to boost the low productivity rates that some Mexican SMEs register in order to help them maximize their growth potential. In addition, we are also supporting certain entrepreneurial and innovative projects to help Mexican SMEs internationalize their products. These efforts could spur their competitiveness because developing businesses abroad creates more and better paid jobs, in addition to increasing productivity. The reality of the Mexican economy lies within these two economies. On the one hand, there is an economy focused on the external market. This one is highly competitive and has allowed export manufacturing to grow. On the other hand there is a second economy whereby we have low productivity and here is where Indaem comes in. We are focused on those domestic companies that have potential to grow in the domestic and external market.</p><h4>What other steps have been taken by Inadem to support Mexican SMEs in addition to providing financing to entrepreneurs?</h4><p>The government has taken several steps to try to achieve this. First, we have worked on creating similar working conditions for Mexican entrepreneurs as in other parts of the world. According to the OECD, Mexico is the country with the highest costs for entrepreneurs. That puts Mexicans entrepreneurs at a disadvantage against other countries. Therefore, we have sought to level the playing field, and the reforms were an important part of this. For instance, the energy reform will bring down the cost of electricity in Mexico and that will give us an advantage in competing against entrepreneurs in other countries. Inadem was founded to create contact with SMEs and the public sector. Usually these two sectors do not go hand in hand, and our aim is to increase contact between them. Through a careful assessment we have been able to deliver important advice. A major part of what Inadem does is just that; namely tutoring. We provide these entrepreneurial firms with training, management, skills, and access to finance. This gives them the tools to carry out their work. And at the end of the day, they are more professional and organized when pursuing investment capital. Training in IT technologies is another step in this process. This boosts their productivity and increases their competitiveness.</p><div class="quote">“Definitely the greatest potential lies in the energy sector."</div><h4>In your view, what sectors of the Mexican economy are more attractive for foreign investors to lend money to Mexican SMEs?</h4><p>Definitely the greatest potential lies in the energy sector. We are opening it to foreign investment and expect many SMEs to benefit from it. Inadem conducted a state-by-state study to identify which sectors generated the strongest growth in the economy. We identified 24 sectors and among them textiles, auto, telecommunications, and aerospace also stood out. We expect significant FDI in those sectors and, in that regard, we expect Mexican SMEs to benefit the most.</p><h4>How is Inadem helping to improve productivity and internationalize Mexican SMEs?</h4><p>SMEs in Mexico constitute over 95% of all established companies, and are also the largest employers. The challenge for Inadem is to identify those SMEs of greatest potential for growth and plug them into supply chains through training certification processes that lead to increased productivity. Mexico needs to strengthen its domestic market, and SMEs are the way to do so. Yet, as I mentioned, going abroad is a key factor for these companies because it increases their productivity rate and makes them more competitive.</p><h4>How is your partnership with organizations like Promexico encouraging entrepreneurship?</h4><p>Inadem wants to support a network for entrepreneurs, and earlier this government undertook a survey of which areas required greater support. We are working with programs that improve productivity and that establish the network of public partners in the network that supports entrepreneurs. This year we have a greater collaboration with agencies that have programs such as Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Education, and the secretary of Agriculture. This network has partners throughout the country such as Startup Mexico and Techba, and is present in over 400 locations nationwide. Some of the offices are in the delegations and the offices of some municipal governments, state governments, and educational institutions. This networks brings together people who are creative, entrepreneurial, and organizations that are also working with other entrepreneurs. We are developing our website to create a visual platform that best promotes the products of SMEs and that can deliver real advantages to them.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has ISPAT's role in investment support developed over time?</h4><p>The establishment of ISPAT in 2006 is an integral part of a comprehensive reform agenda whose main pillars are the FDI law enacted in 2003 and major amendments made to the commercial code in 2012. These two important laws helped establish a business-friendly environment by not only conferring some essential rights to international investors but by also presenting international standards, transparency, and accountability to business context. In this sense, ISPAT was established as the official organization for promoting Turkey's investment environment and opportunities to the global business community and providing assistance to international investors at every stage of their investment in Turkey. As a consequence of such a transparent and predictable environment, together with the corporate capability and international network of ISPAT, FDI into Turkey skyrocketed. Total FDI into Turkey stood at only $15 billion until 2002, while the country was able to attract $150 billion in the last 13 years.</p><h4>One of Turkey's primary goals is diversifying its sources of FDI. How successfully has this strategy been implemented thus far?</h4><p>The recent global financial crisis showed that every single economy in the world was mutually attached to one other and it damaged the ones that put a lot of eggs in a limited number of baskets in terms of export markets or FDI sources. Although Turkey had already diversified its export markets and sources of FDI at a certain level before the global crisis, the country strategically determined to have a better distribution of its eggs in different baskets to ensure balanced and sustainable proceeds of exports and inflow of FDI. For this reason, ISPAT employed its international network to attract more FDI from capital-rich and emerging countries such as Japan, China, South Korea, the Gulf countries, Russia, and the US, on top of Turkey's traditional FDI sources. Eventually, Turkey managed to attain a more balanced inward FDI profile. The share of Near and Middle Eastern countries, as well as of Asian countries and Russia, increased considerably over the period of 2010-2014 when compared to 2002-2010 period. For instance, while Near and Middle East Asia's share in Turkey's total FDI inflow was 10% in the 2002-2010 period, this increased to 15% over the last five years. Similarly, Russia doubled its share and reached the 5% level. Hence, we can confidently express that Turkey has successfully implemented the diversification strategy so far.</p><div class="quote">“Over the past 13 years, the Turkish economy has more than tripled in size."</div><h4>The Southern Gas Corridor is positioning Turkey as an energy hub and a highly strategic conduit for European energy security. How is the development of energy infrastructure impacting Turkey's overall investment landscape?</h4><p>The Southern Gas Corridor is an important project for the EU that secures the energy supply of Europe by diversifying sources. The Trans-Anatolian Gas Pipeline (TANAP), meanwhile, is the most substantial component of the Southern Gas Corridor and originates from Azerbaijan and passes through Georgia and Turkey, reaching Greece. Turkey will not only become an energy corridor between Azerbaijan and Europe, but also will also participate in overseas contracting and meet a considerable amount of its energy needs from the project. There is no doubt that it is not possible for a country to attract major scale investment projects unless it has a continuous and secure energy supply. Hence, TANAP will be an enabler for new international investments in Turkey and will impact the overall investment landscape positively. On top of that, it will have an immediate value-added to the economy; the size of the project is more than $1.5 billion and it employs more than 15,000 people.</p><h4>Istanbul is becoming increasingly popular as a regional headquarters for multinational corporations (MNCs). What differentiates Istanbul from other cities vying to host regional headquarters?</h4><p>Turkey, and Istanbul in particular, have some natural assets such as geographical and cultural proximity to neighboring countries and regions that make it an attractive destination for multinational corporations (MNCs) as their regional headquarters. A total of 1.5 billion people live in a four-hour flight distance to Turkey, where the volume of economic activity exceeds $26 trillion and international trade reaches $8 trillion. On top of these natural assets, Turkey's political and economic stability in the last 13 years has facilitated the increasing existence of headquarters of MNCs in Istanbul. In addition, there is also another opportunity for MNCs that have not yet established their regional headquarters in Istanbul to benefit from the increasing network effect of the business environment in Istanbul, where more than fifty MNCs, including Coca-Cola, GE Healthcare, Microsoft, and Intel have management bases.</p><h4>How have structural changes over the past decades enabled Turkey's strengthening economic power and affected the business environment?</h4><p>Over the past 13 years, the Turkish economy has more than tripled in size, reaching USD 800 billion as of 2014. Similarly, Turkey's exports more than quadrupled, exceeding USD 158 billion by the end of 2014. The remarkable performance with the steady growth over the last 13 years was the result of a sound macroeconomic strategy in combination with prudent fiscal policies and major structural reforms in the banking sector and in FDI laws. These reforms integrated the Turkish economy into the globalized world and created an investor-friendly business environment, while transforming the country into one of the major recipients of FDI in its region.</p><h4>What are the key targets of ISPAT for the forthcoming year?</h4><p>In the current global conjuncture where European economies lose their power as FDI sources, Asian economies are emerging as new sources of FDI. China and India, in addition to Japan, are becoming increasingly important in terms of their potential to invest abroad. For example, China's outward investment amount has been steadily increasing for the last 10 years and it is expected to exceed $100 billion annually in the coming years. For this reason, we will continue with our strategy of focusing on and targeting these economies in 2014. Besides, the other key target for ISPAT is to attract technology and R&amp;D-intensive investments in the manufacturing industry, as well as investments in the energy sector. These investments will enable Turkey to transfer technology, promote Turkey to transform into a knowledge economy, and help mitigate external fragilities. We have been successful in practicing this strategy in recent past, and I hope we will keep serving our country by attracting more investments in 2015 and beyond.</p><h4>Antalya-based Sun Express broke through the ‚¬1 billion revenue barrier last year. How will it continue on this successful path and what impact will its improving stature have on Turkey's positioning as a regional transport hub?</h4><p>SunExpress, a joint venture between Turkish Airlines and Lufthansa, celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. Often dubbed the “holiday airline," SunExpress is the most experienced airline after Turkish Airlines in Turkey and posted its largest revenue in 2014 at ‚¬1.25 billion. SunExpress is also the airline that carries the highest number of tourists in the Mediterranean and Aegean regions on scheduled flights. Contrary to other airlines picking Istanbul as their hub, SunExpress preferred to concentrate on Antalya and Izmir, flying to 35 international and eight domestic destinations from Antalya and 30 international and 13 domestic destinations from Izmir. I am also happy to join the SunExpress Board of Directors and support the joint venture company on its journey to an even more successful future.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some things foreign companies should know about the business environment and norms of Abu Dhabi's local market and society?</h4><p><span></span>Abu Dhabi is one of the most rapidly growing economies and entrepreneurial places in the world—it is quite an achievement. Foreign companies can carry out business activities in the UAE only after having been registered by the relevant authorities. A foreign investor can generally establish a business presence either on the UAE mainland or offshore, which basically involves a business presence in a free trade zone. In terms of legal forms, there is a company law providing regulation governing the operations of a foreign business. The federal law provides for seven categories of business organization: limited liability company (LLC), branches, partnership, joint venture company, public share holding company, private share holding company, and share partnership company. But owing to certain restrictions, the choices commonly adopted by foreign companies are generally limited to an LLC, or a branch. Other options, such as partnerships and joint ventures, are usually not favored by foreign investors. As for UAE commercial company law, the foreign owner of an LLC may not exceed 49%, meaning 51% has to be held by a UAE national.</p><h4>What are some of the factors that are attracting foreign companies and foreign investors to Abu Dhabi?</h4><p><span></span>In Abu Dhabi, there is a disciplined process for registering your company and entering the market. Foreign companies like to know that there is a consistent set of regulations. This disciplined procedure is important for the UAE and Abu Dhabi in terms of attracting foreign businesses. Abu Dhabi also provides competitively priced utilities. Abu Dhabi has been attracting more and more visitors, and the hospitality sector is constantly growing and attracting many residential and office developments. Investors are attracted here because of the good returns on their investments.</p><h4>What should foreign investors know about taxation in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p><span></span>The federal government of the UAE has not promulgated any tax laws. Most of the individual Emirates have issued corporation tax decrees, but in practice taxes are only imposed on oil and gas producing companies at rates set forth in government concession agreements, and also on branches of foreign banks at specific tax rates. Unless you are an oil and gas producing company or a bank, you are not subject to taxation. That is very attractive for foreign investors. The income taxes that have been enacted in each Emirate provide for tax to be imposed on the taxable income of all bodies and the branches that carry on trade and businesses at any time during the taxable year through a permanent establishment in the relevant Emirates. But apart from those three industries—oil, gas, and banking—nothing is being collected. In terms of taxation in Abu Dhabi, according to the Abu Dhabi income tax decree, all companies carrying on trade or business in Abu Dhabi are required to pay tax on their earnings. Legally, the tax rates are on a sliding scale, with a maximum rate of 55%. But in practice, oil and gas companies pay taxes at rates specified by the relevant concession agreement. Oil companies also pay royalties on production. Branches of foreign banks, meanwhile, pay an annual flat rate of 20% on profits. The taxable income of the banks is determined by the reference rates audited on financial statements. The Abu Dhabi Income Tax Decree of 1965 specified that an organization that conducts trade or business in Abu Dhabi shall be subject to taxation as follows, bearing in mind this is what is set out in law but not applied in practice: companies are exempt for up to $1 million; $1-2 million is 10%; $2-3 million is 20%; $3-4 million is 30%; $4-5 million is 40%; and above $5 million is 55%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the inaugural European Games approach, what will be the role of Trend in covering the event?</h4><p>The European Games are truly a great event for Azerbaijan, and we are looking forward to hosting them. New arenas are being constructed in Baku with all available facilities being reconstructed. Beside the 68,000-seat Baku Olympic Stadium, which will host the opening ceremony, the Olympic Village with a capacity of 7,300 people is being developed. Of course, holding the first European Games in Baku brings with it broader international interest in Azerbaijan. We will make every effort to highlight this event as much as possible, with text, photo, and video content. The entire event will be broadcast via our website, Trend.Az, and through our social channels. Naturally, we expect our reader number to increase. We are also planning to create special Euro games-related projects on our website.</p><h4><span></span>Which areas of the economy held the primary focus for Trend in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijan is an oil and gas producing country. Of course, this sector is the primary area of our focus. Our analysts regularly publish articles reflecting the role of Azerbaijan as an energy bridge between Europe and Asia. We are working with major Western oil experts, who provide us with opinions on the international role of Azerbaijan's energy resources. We will continue to pay attention to this area over 2015, as many export and transit projects remain under development, while new deposits are being explored. The non-oil sector of Azerbaijan also continues to be developed successfully. This allows the national economy to remain stable even amid falling oil prices since the autumn of 2014. For example, it may readily be observed that the Azerbaijani manat rate has not changed significantly, despite an almost threefold decline in oil prices, which continue to slide. Meanwhile, the non-oil sector, including IT, banking, agriculture, and construction, has been a focus of our attention and remains so.</p><h4><span></span>What importance do social media have for your business, and what opportunities are there to develop this further?</h4><p><span></span>Social media has become an integral part of the “life" of the internet; we cannot bypass this. For example, in Azerbaijan, Facebook ranks first among social media platforms with a share of almost 95%. We have an active presence on all major social networks. Trend's English Twitter account, @TRENDNewsAgency, is followed by well-known media outlets such as The Financial Times, Bloomberg, BBC, Sky News, Turkish Weekly, Pipeline Magazine, and The New York Times, among others. The account is also popular among diplomats, and it is followed by the representatives of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the World Bank (WB), the UN Development Program (UNDP), and the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). Naturally, social media is an important element in our work, since it allows us to be closer to our users, learn about various events quickly, and get almost instant feedback from people. We will continue to pay special attention to social networks, since they help us in our work, and we, in turn, help people remain in step with the latest developments. A kind of symbiosis takes place, which will increasingly deepen in terms of its interaction.</p><h4><span></span>How would you assess the progress of Azerbaijan's media industry in the context of national development?</h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijani media outlets have made a major developmental breakthrough in recent years. One can see many news portals, news agencies, and online TV channels operating nationwide. For example, such world-renowned news agencies as Bloomberg, Business Week, BBC, Deutsche Welle, Reuters, UPI, Itar-Tass, RIA Novosti, RBK, and Vesti regularly cite Trend News Agency regularly in their reports. Time has begun to follow the trend. An influential UK station, Share Radio station, specializing exclusively in business news, often uses Trend's commentary on oil-related topics. Today, hundreds of media outlets operate in Azerbaijan, amid full internet freedom. We are approaching the indices of developed countries in terms of internet usage. Azerbaijan is also the leader among CIS countries for internet penetration rate (nearly 72%), having sustained this position for some years now. </p>]]></richbody0content>

How is the World Bank supporting anti-corruption initiatives?</h4><p>Generally speaking, governance and transparency to serve secured and faithful transactions are the main underpinnings of the World Bank's engagements worldwide.

Through our operations and financing, we aim to build the capacity of the government agencies with which we work, and to do so by instilling  transparency and predictability in our procedures and processes. Subsequently, those agencies are exposed to the makings of good governance. Our main thrust is to build the long-term capacity of local institutions, and a sound basis for their business. This is important, because when foreign and local investors weigh the risks of investing in a certain country, they need to be confident of predictability, transparency, and accountability at all levels. The Lebanese Minister of Finance has lately taken a strong public stance on corruption. He has mentioned in no uncertain terms that the system as it is functioning today is inefficient, and works to the detriment of the Lebanese people and Lebanese institutions. He stated that the presidential vacuum was taking its toll on all institutions, and that, consequently, parliament was rendered ineffective and unable to perform its basic legislative duties. He is looking aggressively at addressing the corrupt practices that seem to be plaguing the system, and cited the energy sector as one of those areas where more needs to be done. It will be interesting to see what methods and means he will opt for in tackling these challenges.</p><h4>The World Bank recently granted Lebanon a $474 million loan for the construction of the Bisri dam, aimed at improving national water supply. What is the significance of this project?</h4><p>This is the largest project that the Bank has ever financed in Lebanon. When this completed, it will provide potable water to 1.6 million people in Greater Beirut and Mount Lebanon. These citizens represent 45% of the Lebanese population. It will therefore, make a huge difference in the way Lebanon manages its water potential. Despite its abundance, to date Lebanon's water resources have not been properly governed. In fact, in an ideal world, Lebanon should be able to export water to neighboring countries. The new project will have transformational outcomes, by establishing new, comprehensive systems for water treatment, distribution, and management. It is part of a package of projects in Lebanon that the Bank has been financing for a number of years. It is a huge infrastructure undertaking, which will take six or seven years to be completed, and another year or two to become operational. This is a medium-term project, which is all the more reason to start implementation swiftly once the agreement is ratified in Parliament. And the challenge today is precisely that while all government-related actions have been taken to move forward with this project, parliament is stalled. We want to avoid this project being cancelled due to the legislative inability to ratify it. Cancelling this project due to institutional immobility would be disastrous.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanese entrepreneurs are extremely successful abroad because host governments allow them to perform to their full potential."</div><h4>With a large diaspora, Lebanon has relatively stable remittance inflows. What is the importance of this for the Lebanese economy?</h4><p>Lebanese entrepreneurs are extremely successful abroad because host governments allow them to perform to their full potential. In Lebanon, they are doing the best they can, but the country's governance structure is not as conducive as it should be, stifling the energy and productivity of the Lebanese people. This country is blessed with tremendously human resources; bright and highly educated people, who end up frustrated by inefficient institutions, and may therefore opt to emigrate. Yet the vast remittances that derive from emigration play a great part in maintaining the Lebanese economy. In evidence of this, against all the odds, is the fact that the Lebanese are viscerally attached to their country and are keen to finance it through various channels, remittances, and also by participating in the bond market. When Lebanon issues bonds on the international market, the vast majority of subscribers are Lebanese; such cash injections are crucial.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the prospects for the athletes at the Gabala Sports Club in the coming years?</h4><p><span></span>The club was created in line with President HE Ilham Aliyev's 2005-15 policy to promote the development of football in Azerbaijan. Gabala Football Club started in 2005, although back then it was called Gilan because it was, and still is, owned by Gilan Holding. In 2013, the club became Gabala Sports Club, embracing different sports besides just football, and took on martial arts such as judo, boxing, karate, and taekwondo, as well as shooting, and most recently wrestling. There is a demand for different types of sports from young people around Azerbaijan. Our aim has been to create a financially strong and well-rooted club, and one that can contribute to both club and national teams in all sports that our teams engages in. We now have facilities and fields throughout Gabala and Baku. Although we have not had much success in the European arena, considering we have been around a long time, we have managed in this 10-year period to create a truly impressive foundation. There is a youth football academy and a total of nine football fields, with both grass and artificial surfaces, along with excellent facilities. We have been investing in the future and have set ourselves long-term goals, rather than trying to go for immediate successes and achievements. We are focusing especially on children and youth, so that we can create Azerbaijani, European, and even world champions for the future. </p><h4>Are you planning on adding any new sports to your club?</h4><p><span></span>We aim to open more schools and facilities throughout the region, and we want to provide facilities for those who do not have access to the kinds of facilities that can often only be found in Baku or the other large cities. We aim to find, train, educate, and develop those who have the right build and potential to be talented players, wrestlers, boxers, and martial artists of the future. For example, we found two or three very talented youths who have gone on to become formidable boxers, as well as freestyle and judo wrestlers.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the club's partnership with Pepsi?</h4><p><span></span>After our sponsorship agreement with Hyundai, we entered a new partnership with Pepsi, who have proven to be a great partner for us, contributing significant financial support for our club and also for major tournaments and competitions that have been held in Gabala. For example, we have the annual Gabala Cup, an under-15 football tournament that is sponsored by Pepsi. The Gabala Cup features youth teams from some of the world's top clubs, including the under-15 youth squads from Barcelona, Porto, Feyenoord, and also Turkish giants Galatasaray, Fenerbahçe, and Beï¬‚iktaï¬‚, along with top Russian clubs like Zenit St. Petersburg and Lokomotiv Moscow; it is an eight-club tournament that always features two Azerbaijani clubs and six other international clubs. Pepsi has helped bring this about, and without them—and of course Gilan Holding, who make these sponsorships possible—tournaments like this would not happen.</p><h4>What is the importance of Azerbaijan's hosting the European Games, in terms of the development of sports in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>This is a major opportunity for Azerbaijan, and its importance cannot be underestimated. Azerbaijan already has considerable experience hosting major international events and organizations, be it the Eurovision Song Contest, or the European and world championships in various sports. Our country can, and will, host major events on a regular basis, and the European Games in Azerbaijan is yet another example of that. I believe it will be of great benefit to the development of Azerbaijani sports, and will be a great inspiration for our sportsmen and women, who will get to see firsthand some of the best athletes in Europe, and indeed the world. We hope that our club will continue to contribute to these events, to Azerbaijan's overall sporting development and success, and that our athletes will bring European and World trophies home to Azerbaijan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the tourism sector in the country and of the hotel market in Baku specifically?</h4><p><span></span>Currently, the market base of our industry is working in Baku. When we are looking at business in hospitality, it is necessary to have different sources for tourism. There are not enough right now, and we need more in the future, which is our main goal. We anticipate the tourism sector growing; however, it will take some time.</p><h4>In terms of infrastructure that is available for tourists, such as hotels and public transportation, how would you assess this sector, and what needs to be done to attract more tourists?</h4><p><span></span>In terms of hotels, we have a good range of two- to five-star hotels, and we also have the new airport with many flights coming in from other countries to support the tourists that will be coming. What we need is the construction of a nicely laid out convention center. If we want to attract new clients and major conventions, then we need to have a proper convention center, which will come soon. In terms of a hotel base, we do have that here in anticipation for the coming tourists.</p><h4>How does the beginning of 2015 compare to last year's results, and what has changed in Kempinski's strategies?</h4><p><span></span>Our business market in Baku has improved. The results since the beginning of the year are very promising in terms of average rate. We have a new chef, and we will re-open our  Aquapark this summer, unique in Baku. We will offer packages for families and individuals, including food and animations for kids.</p><h4>Can you describe the typical guest staying at Kempinski, and are they staying for business or for leisure?</h4><p><span></span>We primarily have corporates and people who are coming from different companies ,staying three or four nights. That is a typical guest for us; however, since the beginning of the year, we have had some unconventional groups coming for different purposes. The last one was a university group that had to do with development, and our sales team is trying to attract these types of groups now. We have an auditorium for 500 people as well as different meeting rooms. We offer plenty of different leisure activities. Right now, the majority of our guests are coming for business, but we want to develop another facet of clientele, including more tourists.</p><h4>From what particular sectors do you see more exhibitions coming here that will create the opportunity for business?</h4><p><span></span>If you want to attract conventions, then the name of the host city is important, and the country is working hard on that. The European Games and Formula One coming over the next year will help to draw in people and will allow Baku to make a name for itself. The completion of a convention center in addition to our hotels will be able to attract major events.</p><h4>How will Kempinski Hotel Badamdar benefit from the European Games, and what preparations are being made in regard to the upcoming event?</h4><p><span></span>Preparations are already underway, and we have a number of bookings for June. We are involved, and the staff too, in exercises to find out how transportation from the lobby to the stadium is effective. Of course, it is the major event of the year, and we are ready to welcome the guests. There is a lot of stress, and we know how important it will be for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the most significant events that Jumeirah Bilgah Beach Hotel has hosted this year?</h4><p><span></span>We are proud of the fact that the hotel has now been open and operating for three successful years. Jumeirah Bilgah Beach Hotel has established a positive reputation in the market both because of the strength of the Jumeirah brand, the appeal of the hotel's location, and the relationship we have with a number of business partners, including the Exhibition Center. For example, we worked with the organisers of the Azerbaijan Defence Exhibition (ADEX) to host top exhibitors and high-ranking military officials both regional and international. We also host the welcome gala reception of the Caspian Oil and Gas Conference every year and are the key sponsor for the Baku Polo World Cup. Jumeirah Bilgah Beach Hotel is popular for weddings and social events, often involving local celebrities and high-ranking officials. Notably, the First Lady of Azerbaijan celebrated her 50th birthday here in combination with the Heydar Aliyev Foundation charity event. We also hosted the recently elected Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani and his entourage in our uniquely appointed 17th Floor Presidential Suites. Due to our proximity to the airport and to the Presidential Palace, we are a preferred destination for hosting state visits. Overall, 2014 was a great year for us, especially given the number of repeat guests; in fact, well above 75% of our visitors in the summer season, which is encouraging as return business is a key indicator of success in the luxury hospitality sector.</p><h4>What are some of the unique services that the hotel has been preparing for the first European Games in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>The Jumeirah brand “Stay Different" is the promise that we are imaginative in our product and destination. It says that we are thoughtful and generous, and it says that we are culturally connected. Our approach to the European Games reflects this promise. We are proud to be involved and plan to create  a strong sports theme throughout the resort, and our unique sport, leisure, and outdoor facilities will make us a preferred destination for all to patronize. We are one of the European Games' partner hotels, and we are working closely with the executive committee—BEGOC—to make sure it is a monumental success both for the hotel as the only city resort and the reputation of Baku as a luxury destination. We look forward to welcoming many guests as a result of the European Games as well as delegates from key ministries and other officials from the European Community.</p><h4>How do you ensure that your personnel live up to the reputation of the Jumeirah Group?</h4><p><span></span>Our focus is fully on ensuring the most memorable guest experience. To achieve this, we invest in training our employees to ensure they are equipped to deliver the quality of experience our guests expect. Every colleague has an Individual Development Plan, from the most junior stewards to top executives. The same goes for colleagues across the whole Jumeirah footprint, which includes 22 hotels and resorts across the world. Personally, I am a living example of Jumeirah's commitment to developing talent within, having joined the company over 10 years ago and subsequently promoted to senior executive roles in three of our flagship properties.</p><h4>Services are also available for external guests. What is the demand right now from external guests?</h4><p><span></span>A successful resort has to be built on the local community. Jumeirah Bilgah Beach Hotel is a summer destination and people come here to relax and enjoy the clean environment, which consists of six acres of landscaped gardens, as well as a 550m private beach. In the summer, we welcome many non-hotel guests. The water park is a particular draw for families, and we have long-stay guests that come here for 30, 60, or 90 days. We are seeing an increase in business from outside Baku and Azerbaijan, especially from Russia and CIS countries. We have also noticed a considerable increase in online bookings from the US, UK and Europe, as well as Asia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision that led to the launch of the Grand Hotel Europe in Baku?</h4><p><span></span>This is the first five-star hotel in Baku, and it is a historical landmark. It was built in 1995 and many presidents, ministers, and other foreign dignitaries have stayed here since the independence of Azerbaijan. The hotel sector in Azerbaijan has improved greatly and is becoming extremely dynamic. There are many more people visiting Baku now, and there is a demand for high quality hotel services. As tourism increases, hotels like the Grand Hotel Europe are a must for the city.</p><h4><span></span>The European Games will be held in Azerbaijan in 2015. How is Grand Hotel Europe preparing for this?</h4><p><span></span>We are designing new menus geared toward sportsmen and sportswomen, and we are also offering extensive massages and other services related specifically to athletes. We are trying to use and learn from Turkey's experience in this sector for the benefit of Azerbaijan. All of our services are being improved, not just for the European Games but also the upcoming Formula One event, and others that are surely to follow. The European Games will be a great opportunity for Azerbaijan overall, because few people know Azerbaijan well. It will be a chance to really get to know our country.</p><h4><span></span>What is your client portfolio, and how do you ensure that your position in the hotel industry is recognized?</h4><p><span></span>Our guests are mostly businessmen, especially from the oil sector, as well as traders from neighboring countries, such as Turkey, Iran, Georgia, and Russia, for example. We are a local brand, not an international one, and our prices are lower than international hotels, like the Four Seasons or the Hilton. We go to fairs and other events and organizations abroad to increase our exposure, and we aim to have regular guests.</p><h4><span></span>How important is hospitality in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>The hospitality sector is growing in importance year-by-year, and we need to have top quality people to staff the sector. I believe that the benefits of the new tourism and hospitality courses at universities will manifest in a few years time when the graduates hit the market and start managing these hotels. The quality will improve and once the service improves, growth will also increase. The hospitality sector has a great many strengths, such as its cuisine. The aim is to mix our strengths with lessons we can learn and apply from European and international brands.</p><h4><span></span>What investment opportunities are there in the hospitality sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>There are many investments right now, with many chain and big brand hotels coming to Baku. These are constantly improving standards in Azerbaijan. It is a great time to invest here, and there are many opportunities in the market.</p><h4><span></span>What are your primary objectives over the coming five years?</h4><p><span></span>We must maintain this hotel to the high standard it is currently at. This is a major challenge considering pricing and other factors in this competitive environment. We do not want to lower our standards, however, and we also want to be competitive cost-wise. Our slogan for the hotel, taking into account the fact that it is an historic building, is “Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow," which sums up our ambitions and expectations. We bring something from the past to the present, always with an eye on the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2014 is the Year of Industry in Azerbaijan. Which new projects you have been involved this year?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has a rich history as a young, newly independent country. Despite a very short period since gaining independence, we have achieved quite a lot. The mining industry has been developing rapidly in the last 10 years. Along with the launch of large industrial enterprises, the major highlight of this year is the start-up of two new cement plants. We were involved with geological exploration and explosive works to provide these plants with raw materials. The Azerbaijan Steel Production Complex was created following the President's decree last year and started operations in 2014. We have signed a contract with them and are looking forward to a productive collaboration in 2015.</p><h4>The use of explosives is a very complex business. How does your company handle such specific work?</h4><p><span></span>There are special training courses organized by the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The trainees are being monitored by a commission and their proficiency level is verified on site. The trainees should also pass a particular exam to work with us. Our company has a number of certified specialists for such work, and some of them were certified by Orica. Orica Mining Services is a leading European company and explosives manufacturer.</p><h4>How does Azinterpartlayish-X implement state-of-the-art technologies?</h4><p><span></span>The majority of utilized explosives were imported from Russia and Ukraine in the past. They were manufactured by outdated technologies. I studied to gain global experience in this field—technologies used in Europe, America, and China—and selected Orica as a best one. As for drilling rigs, we have carried out an intensive market survey and decided to enter into partnership with the Japanese company, Furukawa and Swedish Atlas Copco. We have procured drilling rigs manufactured by Furukawa and Atlas Copco. Apart from that, we have also imported smaller machinery manufactured jointly by a German-Turkish venture. As the mining industry is developing rapidly, we are trying to keep pace with it.</p><h4>What are the primary objectives of the company for the future?</h4><p><span></span>Quite a few journalists have asked me about the name of the company; there is an “X." It should be noted that AZ stands for Azerbaijan, Inter stands for international, Partlayish stands for explosion and X stands for the mining symbol. Explosive operations are the main area of the mining business. We are eager to expand our area of business worldwide and start new mining industry activity. We are publishing “Yer ve €¹nsan" (Land and Human) magazine to increase awareness in the mining business and involve business people into this industry. Our main objective is to make the mining industry as one of the leading industries of Azerbaijan's economy.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for further investment in the mining sector and your company?</h4><p><span></span>We have offered to set up a supervisory government agency that would cover all the mining business segments. Setting up such a supervisory agency will be a great step forward in the mining industry. It is very difficult to show the potential capabilities of Azerbaijan's mining industry in figures. The development of this industry means the development of our company. It is worthwhile to highlight that our company's competitive and fair business operations are well known in-country, which expands our capabilities as well.</p><h4>How competitive is the market at the moment?</h4><p><span></span>There are several companies at the market now. We are also helping them as we can see huge potential capabilities in the mining industry in Azerbaijan. We would like to develop this industry,  and build strong foundations for this development. There is a huge gap between us and other companies, and we run all major projects in Azerbaijan. The Mining industry is the only sector that can compete with the oil &amp; gas industry, and I am quite optimistic about its potential capacities. I expect the rapid development of this industry in the coming years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerbaijan has recently started to prioritize scientific research. How can this influence the development of the economy?</h4><p>The share of technological and science-based products as a part of a country's total exports constitutes 45% in Singapore, 26% in China, 25% in France, 22% in the UK, and 18% in US. These figures are not so high in Post-Soviet states, meaning the government of Azerbaijan has taken measures in developing science, defining new priorities, and commercializing scientific findings. Along with the reforms that are reflected in the National Strategy, there are various science funds, including the Science Development Fund that operates in order to support and stimulate fundamental, applied, and innovative scientific researches. The State Fund for the Development of Information Technologies provides low-interest loans and grants for science-based projects in order to expand scientific research and innovation. It is important to strengthen the cooperation between scientific-research institutions, institutions of higher education, and corporations and industry.</p><h4>It was announced in May 2014 that Azerbaijan would establish a National Nuclear Research Center under the Ministry. What are the goals of this initiative?</h4><p><span></span>Research in nuclear energy started in Azerbaijan in the 1970s; however, due to the lack of infrastructure, nuclear research did not meet modern requirements. The National Nuclear Research Center was established in order to develop nuclear technologies for the peaceful meeting of today's requirements and national demands. Our first goal is to create a nuclear research reactor in Azerbaijan that is implemented together with the State Agency for Regulation of Nuclear and Radiological Activity of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and other related entities. With the technical support of IAEA, a multi-purpose gamma radiation complex is being established in Azerbaijan. Dosimetric and microbiological laboratories will also be established, while agricultural products, medical equipment, and other materials will be sterilized in the complex. Adding nuclear sciences and technology majors to the priority list of the education-abroad program has been requested. At the same time, we are cooperating with global nuclear research centers on the training of personnel.</p><h4>Azerbaijan has adopted the State Program on Establishment and Development of Space Industry in 2009. What are the results achieved and future plans?</h4><p><span></span>In 2013, Azerbaijan launched Azerspace-1 in cooperation with Orbital Sciences Corporation (US) and Arianespace (France). Azerbaijan entered a new phase of development in becoming a recognized brand in the regional telecommunications sector. To date, 55% of the Azerspace-1's satellite capacity is under commercial use. Over 150 TV channels are being broadcast over the satellite; and 90% are foreign. Currently, Azercosmos is providing services to a customer base of 24 countries from Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East. In 2014, we entered into the commercial business of Earth observation services, including geo-information services. We signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Airbus Defence and Space (France) and took over the rights to operate and commercialize Azersky (Spot 7) high-resolution (1.5m imagery products) optical Earth observation satellite, which was successfully launched on June 30, 2014. This satellite has a broad range of applications including defense and security, emergency response, exploration of natural resources, maritime surveillance, sea faring, environmental protection, urban planning, and cartography. Cooperation with Airbus Defence and Space has allowed for advanced education in the field of satellite imagery and geo-information services. Our plans also include enhancing the coverage area by launching Azerspace-2, the second telecommunications satellite. In 2015, we will sign contracts regarding the manufacturing and launching of the satellite. We have reached an initial agreement with Intelsat on a long-term lease of the satellite's capacity. Azerspace-2 will enhance our capacity and service offerings for customers in terms of reliability and coverage.</p><h4>Azerbaijan has recently adopted a new ICT Development Program in the frame of the national strategy from 2014-2020. What are the primary objectives of this news program?</h4><p><span></span>Systematic works have been carried out over the past 10 years in the direction of development of information society. The National Strategy on information and communication technologies for the development of the Republic of Azerbaijan (2003-2012) was the first document declaring the development of information society in the country. The new National Strategy demonstrates successive policy of the government in the development of an information society, as well as purposefulness of its further continuance. The newly adopted National Strategy attaches great importance primarily from the standpoint of determining the development priorities of information society in the country. Being a future oriented document, the National Strategy provides for the overall activity allowing for technological innovations, development trends and most importantly, demands of the society. The development of an information society in the country will create favorable conditions for the government, society, businesses, and citizens to benefit from the contributions of IT. In its turn, it will serve the overall development of Azerbaijan, since in international experience the development of an information society is proven to be the driving force behind enhancing changes in society and economy, as well as increasing competitive opportunities in industry. We are planning to attract state bodies, business entities and public organizations for implementing actions proposed in the National Strategy. Favorable conditions will be created for joint civil and public initiatives and their realization.</p><h4>What efforts have been made by the Ministry to support education?</h4><p><span></span>The State Program on education of Azerbaijani youth abroad in 2007-2015 is a prime example of the attention given to education by the country's leadership. Many people now study at international universities, and among them many students are studying ICT. Works to support the State Program are carried out by the Ministry as well. Signed MoUs with a number of reputable foreign universities and the Ministry's Human Recourses Fund for ICT Development have supported more than 200 young people to receive undergraduate and graduate education in ICT at leading universities throughout the world. We closely cooperate with university departments that provide ICT training in Azerbaijan. For the provision of high-speed internet connections in institutions of higher education, fiber-optic cable networks were set up through Azerbaijan Research and Education Networks Association. In addition, financial support is provided to research carried out in high-tech fields at universities.</p><h4>How effectively has Azerbaijan encouraged entrepreneurs in the ICT sector and supported national efforts to diversify the economy?</h4><p><span></span>The World Economic Forum's Global Information Technology 2014 reported that Azerbaijan was sixth among 148 countries for the importance of ICT to the government vision, and eight for government success in ICT promotion. Our innovative policy is based on the golden triangle concept that focuses on three columns. The first column is capacity building, the development of human resources and knowledge potential. Second is the creation of a favorable economic and business environment. The last is facilitating access to financial resources for the implementation of innovative projects. The State Fund for Development of Information Technologies has successfully credited entrepreneurs on preferential terms and supported projects. It allocates support in a form of grants to start up projects on basis of competition. Two competitions were announced by the Fund last year: 194 projects were submitted at the first grant competition and funding was allocated to 25 projects. It prioritizes the establishment of close cooperation with countries that support SME entrepreneurship in ICT. The Ministry established the High Technologies Park, and beginning entrepreneurs who start their activities at the Hi-Tech Park are exempt from income, property, and land taxes, as well as VAT for imported equipment for seven years. The creation of a suitable investment and business environment, support for the sale and promotion of companies' products, and the simplification of procedures for starting a business are some of our priority policies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What sort of training programs does Azercosmos use? </h4><p><span></span>There are different types. During the first phase of operations, we were sending our employees abroad to receive theoretical and practical training either at universities, manufacturing sites, or the premises of existing satellite operators. Now, those employees transfer their knowledge to the next generation of engineers via in-home training, which is sustainable for us. An example of how efficient our training has been is that we have recently promoted two satellite operators, who had never passed through any overseas training in the past, to the position of satellite engineers. Over the last four years, we have sent one engineer to study his Master's in the UK. He has returned; and we currently have an additional two in the UK studying satellite engineering. Although it provides us with some challenges in our day-to-day work, we want them to develop continuously. Alongside developing technical skills of our employees, we also focus on the advancement of their soft skills, such as leadership, communication, presentation, negotiation, project management skills, and business ethics, for example.</p><h4><span></span>Azerspace-1 now covers a range of areas across the world. What is the potential for Azercosmos to reach its increase?</h4><p><span></span>After two years of real operations, it is clear that in order to be competitive in this industry we have to have better coverage across different regions. Azerspace-1 provides Ku-band coverage over most of Central Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and C-band coverage over the same regions as well as over Africa. Azerspace-2 will offer enhanced Ku-band coverage over the same regions and expand into Africa to meet customers' demands we are seeing there. We are interested in the Indian Ocean, and our second satellite will provide perfect coverage of that region as well. Most important, Azerspace-2 will enable us to provide improved business continuity and assurance with added back-up capacity for Azerspace-1.</p><h4><span></span>Azerspace-2 is set to launch in 2017. At what stage is its development currently?</h4><p><span></span>We cooperate with one of the largest satellite operators in the world, Intelsat, and will be working on their orbital slot for a long time, which is at 45 degrees east. We will launch Azerspace-2 to that orbital slot. In March 2015, we have announced open tender for the procurement of the second telecommunication satellite and the related equipment. We are planning to finalize contractual negotiations by the end of June 2015, which will put us in the position to launch in 2017.</p><h4><span></span>In December 2014, there was a signing with a French company, Airbus Defence and Space. What was the significance of that?</h4><p><span></span>Alongside diversifying our geographical presence around the world with a telecommunication satellite, we are also working toward diversifying our portfolio. In 2014, we entered into the commercial business of Earth observation services. We signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Airbus Defence and Space and took over the rights to operate and commercialize Azersky, an optical Earth observation satellite. This direction is new for our business, and the cooperation that we put together with Airbus Defence and Space is long term. It is aimed at efficiency as it already has Spot 6 satellite as well as Azersky operated in a constellation mode. We still kept it as a part of that constellation because of an excellent customer base that was acquired by Airbus over the past 25 years. We have a local demand for such images in different areas, including but not limited to defense and security, emergency response, exploration of natural resources, maritime surveillance, sea faring, environmental protection, urban planning, cartography, agriculture, and tourism. We could actually have taken the path of buying images from that satellite; however, that comes with limited sovereignty over the territories and frequencies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Azercell continue to be a technological pioneer in Azerbaijan in the coming years?</h4><p>Since 1996, we have pioneered numerous products, brought the most advanced technologies to Azerbaijan and the region, and provided the best customer experience. Our biggest subscriber family Azercell covers 99.8% of the population and 80% of Azerbaijan's territory, excluding the 20% comprising occupied territories. Despite high levels of competition, more than half of Azerbaijan's mobile telecom market chooses Azercell. Our clients have always been the central figure around which we built our business and this helps us to stay different. We pioneered the deployment of LTE in Azerbaijan, the platform on which to develop next generation technologies and services. We have 4G in Baku and the entire Absheron peninsula, and are looking to expand into the regions soon. Over the last two years, we have expanded our network by 25% and in 2014 we installed 169 2G/3G radio base stations. With the help of second carriers, we installed 969 stations, expanded our 3G network on a record-high level—in the country by 48%, and in Baku by 92%. According to MCHT's research, Azercell provides the highest speed of Mobile Data in the country. In 2015, we expect huge growth of data usage as we have had 200%, 300%, and 1,000% growth of data usage recently. In 2014, data transmission in our network increased by 60%. Last year, the number of smartphones increased by 38% in our market, while the range of applications become increasingly data intensive. We aim to bring affordable smartphones to the regions outside the capital in particular, and we are determined to offer devices that are desirable and affordable.</p><h4>In November 2014, the number of Azercell subscribers exceeded 4.5 million. How significant is this achievement?</h4><p><span></span>Despite the fact that Azercell leads the country's mobile market, mobile penetration has already exceeded 110%. There has been a steady increase of our subscriber base each year, and we forecast a continuous rise of this figure due to Azercell's commitment to our customer. A successful customer-centered initiative was the continuation of our program for the development of mobile communication in the regions. Starting from June to October 2014, we implemented a unique regional project in 13 cities of Azerbaijan and let our local clients benefit from a wide range of discount campaigns. Following this, we have increased our regional market share by 5%. In 2014, we started to calculate Net Promoter Score (NPS) to measure our customer loyalty and better understand their needs. In 2014, our largest front office in Baku started to operate from 09:00 until 23:00 for the convenience of our customers. </p><h4>Looking ahead to the first European Games in June, what advantages does Azercell have that can support the organization of this event and what further possibilities can it present?</h4><p><span></span>Azercell has provided our multi-operational system at the main venues of Baku European Games 2015, which will enable other operators to provide their network through our in-building solutions technology. Azercell will keep high network quality and introduce new services to meet customer demands during the whole event. </p><h4>The ICT sector has become a target sector for the growth of SMEs. In what ways can Azercell support this objective?</h4><p><span></span>This is an important topic for our future business perspectives. Azercell wants to move from a SIM-card selling culture to solution providing and always anticipating customer needs. M2M technology, long touted as the next big thing in the communications revolution, is present in Azerbaijan and utilized by a number of sectors. Azercell is the widest provider of M2M solutions among mobile operators In Azerbaijan. M2M can also help smaller companies to compete. Azercell's Barama Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center was launched in 2009 and has supported the development of entrepreneurship in ICT. In 2014, Azercell introduced a new concept office of Barama with a larger space, and equipped with the necessary tools for more effective implementation of ideas for future entrepreneurs.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The ICT sector in Azerbaijan is historically competitive. How would you characterize your portfolio of current clients as a result?</h4><p><span></span>Bakcell has always seen its customers, first and foremost, as its primary asset. Our customers have a thirst for new technology, great service, and a great brand experience. In 2014, customers are beginning to live the strategy we put forward a couple of years ago, to take people's use of the internet from information and email to entertainment. There has been a rise in videos on our network and the number of smartphones is increasing dramatically. Upwards of 60% of our clients use data services in one form or another. Customers are interacting and using their phones in more complex ways, so there is a much greater involvement with the service and brand. That can open access for customers in terms of information, entertainment, and how they interact with people. It is a much more comprehensive engagement than simply buying a phone, sending a text message, or making a call. We have an overall younger customer contingency than Azercell, for example. Those customers are much more mobile savvy, more internet aware and, in many ways, are much more demanding. They expect us as an operator to be able to help them navigate the internet and discover new services, the coolest apps to download, and the best phones to use. All of that is part of the brand engagement. </p><h4>At the moment, what is the current demand for the smartphone that you released?</h4><p><span></span>We are seeing significant demand for the Bakcell branded smartphone. We already launched our third smartphone, and we started last September with a lower function version. We split that with a larger screen, the ALOV phone, and there is an entry level, which is called Ilk. In splitting that market, we timed it almost exactly at the same time as Apple. We have been able to push smartphones into the regional areas where Ilk is popular. ALOV phone, which is a bigger screen format, has proven to be a lot more popular in Baku, as a second smartphone. For customers, in line with everywhere else in the world, screen size is defining experience and so we see customers who are going through their second-generation smartphone will typically purchase ALOV. </p><h4>Bakcell has an important partnership with Manchester United. How has that developed in the past year?</h4><p><span></span>It is a three-way partnership with Manchester United and the Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan (AFFA), and Bakcell. One of our key themes is development through sport, so we do a lot of development of sports talent—primarily football—with AFFA, and we have done the Manchester United Soccer Schools for two summers. They were really successful touring around the country and doing open trials. After being selected, participants came to Baku for a series of coaching sessions with Manchester United coaches. It was so successful that a fulltime school has been established in Baku, together with AFFA, and it is one of only two schools outside of Manchester, the other being in Hong Kong. It has been a successful initiative in terms of investing in younger talent, sport, and all the lessons that youngsters can learn through sport. It is becoming part of the fabric of society here. We accept 64 kids, who are the best players. We have one full-time trainer from Manchester United and two assistants, one is a professional coach from AFFA, the other is an assistant also from AFFA. </p><h4>The development of the non-oil sector is fundamental, especially now that the oil price has fallen. What role can ICT play in non-oil sector development?</h4><p><span></span>There are two primary roles: firstly, as an enabler—since without a strong ICT infrastructure, most businesses will not get off the ground, survive, or thrive; the other is as an investor and employer. Bakcell is one of the largest investors in the non-oil sector, and we are also one of the larger employers. Bakcell group employs well over 11,000 people, and we do that also with Azerconnect, which is our subsidiary. From this, we see our role as drivers of innovation, investment, employment for people in the sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nar Mobile has been the official sponsor of the 2015 European Games since July 2014. How important has that been for the company's strategy?</h4><p><span></span>We are proud to be the Official Partners of the Baku 2015 European Games, and Sponsor of the Baku 2015 European Games Volunteer Program. We were the second sponsor to sign on, and it is a huge responsibility because this is one of the largest events that has ever been held in Azerbaijan involving more people and resources than anything before it. For us to be selected as a sponsor is a tribute to the fact that we have been making great progress in the quality of our network and our customer service for the last years. We are putting a huge amount of effort to making sure that everything we do provides the best possible service not only to those in Azerbaijan and the athletes joining the games, but also to the guests that will be coming from all over Europe for this event. We know that our customers are proud of their cultural heritage and national athletes. Therefore, it is a major honor for us to play such a significant role related to the Games that will enter the history of Azerbaijan as an important moment. We are fully prepared to share the joy of the Azerbaijani population during the Games and to contribute to the success of the Games.</p><h4>In terms of customer subscription, revenue, and data traffic, how successful was 2014 for Nar Mobile?</h4><p><span></span>Revenue was up double digits to more than 10%, and we were the only mobile operator in the country that grew in terms of revenue last year. In terms of subscribers, we grew as well, not on a percentage basis but on an absolute number basis. Our subscriber growth is also close to double digits. We doubled in data revenue; therefore, we have had two consecutive years of more than doubling data revenue.</p><h4>ICT has been identified as a key sector for SME development in Azerbaijan. To what extent can Nar Mobile support this?</h4><p><span></span>SMEs represent an important sector, and we have identified several programs to support it. As an example, we have a unit within our outgoing telemarketing that will directly go after SME accounts, and try to offer the services that we provide. We are working on packaging a number of services that will be helpful for SMEs, and we will have a specific offering for SMEs. </p><h4>In what way can Nar Mobile support youth development in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>We regularly implement educational programs, and there are a number of projects that we are working on at the moment. We support the Enactus international program, the main mission of which is to improve business,  leadership and presentation skills among students, to educate students on implementation of business projects, as well as to support professional development of young people. Students work in teams to present their start up projects. Last year, the winning team represented Azerbaijan in the Enactus World Cup 2014, which took place in Beijing. </p><h4>Bearing in mind the aforementioned partnership with Microsoft, what is the potential to establish more international collaborations?</h4><p><span></span>There is always potential for more international collaborations. Usually, we try to find ones that are consistent with a theme that we are trying to develop. However, we are primarily focused on Azerbaijan. We support culture, sports, youth, and education. Many of our programs are focused on Azerbaijan, supporting local causes and events. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The first European Games is taking place this June in Baku, making 2015 an exciting year for Azerbaijan. What has been AzerNews's angle on the event so far, and what is your outlook on the Games?</h4><p><span></span>The Azerbaijani capital is set to welcome 6,000 athletes from 50 countries to compete in 20 different sports at the Games. It will be a two-week sporting event overseen by the European Olympic Committee. We are closely cooperating with the Baku European Games Operation Committee, in particular its media organizer Synergy Partnership, to cover the long-awaited inaugural Games this June. Along with highlighting the major activities of the operation committee, we are also focused on large-scale preparations. </p><h4>How will AzerNews differentiate their coverage from other media during the Games?</h4><p><span></span>AzerNews is keen on covering the innovative Games, broadly taking into consideration overall interest. AzerNews has signed a contract with Perform Group, UK's progressive sports media specialists, to broadcast the Games live, which will allow our readers to stay informed about all developments as they happen. Of course, we will work directly with newsmakers, post breaking news, and cover all sport disciplines, as well as present all the latest interviews in collaboration with the BEGOC team. We are also working with Trend News Agency on an exclusive video project.</p><h4>What are some of the other important events upcoming in the next year that AzerNews will be focusing on?</h4><p><span></span>The next most important event of the year we will cover will be the parliamentary elections scheduled for November.</p><h4>How successful has AzerNews been in terms of distribution and market share in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>We attach as much importance on marketing and distribution as we do with the quality of our newspaper content. In 2014, we considerably expanded our market coverage, and AzerNews is now available at every major hotel and business center. We were also able to expand the distribution of our newspaper through international news content providers, which translated into a surge in advertisement volumes. We are proud that our audience recognizes AzerNews as a newspaper with quality content, providing them with an objective insight into Azerbaijan. </p><h4>Media is always innovating and progressing. To what extent has AzerNews developed in 2014, and what are your targets for 2015?</h4><p>It was a big year for us in 2014. We made many innovations and worked hard to expand our audience. We were able to expand the list of our partners through reliable cooperation, and we launched many new projects. For example, following an agreement with Bloomberg, we were able to set up a special syndicated page. This was both an exciting development for our readers and our team. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway plans to become one of the major railway lines in the region. With the line set to be fully commissioned at the end of 2015, at what stage is its development now?</h4><p><span></span>The economic changes initiated by Heydar Aliyev and successfully continued by President HE Ilham Aliyev have brought our country success and facilitated its rapid economic development. As is the case with all other areas, major projects have been implemented in the transport sector, and there have been successful upgrades and modernization in Azerbaijan's transport infrastructure. Azerbaijan's integration into the global economy is well under way. The railway, which is one of the main branches of the country's transport system, is undergoing a period of rapid development as well. Work is currently in full swing on the implementation of the new BTK railway, which is considered to be one of the major construction projects of the 21st Century, not just linking three countries, but also playing the role of a bridge between dozens of peoples and nations. The rail laying and overhaul process on the territory of Georgia has already been completed. A construction train is running to the Georgian station of Kartsakhi on the border with Turkey. Due to the upcoming change of one track for another, completion work is now in progress on the replacement of rail trolleys at Akhalkalaki station and the Marabda-Turkish border (Kartsakhi) site. The construction of the Turkish section of the 4.4km tunnel linking Georgia with the Turkish Republic has also been completed. The BTK railway is scheduled for commissioning in 2015. Azerbaijan Railways maintains and enhances its infrastructure to enable participation in international and regional projects in addition to addressing the demand for railway transportation. These projects will bring stability, prosperity, and economic dividends both to Azerbaijan and the whole region.</p><h4>Kazakhstan and Afghanistan have demonstrated interest in joining the BTK railway project. What is the potential for other countries to be involved?</h4><p><span></span>The BTK railway is expected to provide a significant boost to the development of trade and economic relations in Eurasia. It will create ample opportunities not only for the three countries involved, but also for other countries, such as Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, and India, to establish transport links with each other. The implementation of the BTK railway project and the construction of a railway tunnel under the Bosphorus in Istanbul will provide linkages between Trans-European and Trans-Asian railway networks, thus enabling passenger and cargo transportation from Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey to Europe and Asia, expanding the transit potential of the entire region, speeding up the process of European integration, and broadening Azerbaijan's economic relations with foreign countries.</p><h4><span></span>Another important railway project is the North-South Transport Corridor. What is the role of Azerbaijan in supporting its continuing development?</h4><p><span></span>Our country is heavily involved in this process. The issue of merging the railways of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Iran was discussed at the 61st meeting of the CIS and Baltic Railway Council held in Baku in October 2014. The construction of a railway line between the Astara in Azerbaijan and the Astara in Iran has been envisaged within the framework of the North-South international transport corridor, linking the railway networks of Azerbaijan and Iran. As part of this project, Azerbaijan will build an 8.4km railway line and four station tracks each 1,050m long. Land has already been allocated for the construction. As the volume of transit increases in the future, further measures will be taken.</p><h4><span></span>Ganja City Railcar Manufacturing Plant plans to export passenger cars. When is this likely to begin, and what is its importance in the development of Azerbaijan's transport sector?</h4><p><span></span>President HE Ilham Aliyev, on October 18, 2014, attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the Stadler railcar manufacturing plant in Ganja. Switzerland's Stadler Rail Group and Azerbaijan's Railway International Distribution signed an agreement on the establishment of a railcar manufacturing plant in Ganja. Under said agreement, a plant with a capacity of 60 railcars a year will be built in Ganja. The plant will be fitted with cutting-edge equipment from Switzerland. It will cover an area of 20 hectares and operate in line with advanced environmental standards. The plant is expected to become operational in 2016. The launch of the plant will herald a new phase in the railcar depot of the Azerbaijan Railways. The leadership of the country has recently adopted a number of decisions and signed several executive orders on the future development of the railway as one of the key components of the transport system. These decisions have created a watershed in the development of the railway. The most important of the documents is the State Program on the development of railway transport in the Republic of Azerbaijan signed by President Ilham Aliyev on July 6th, 2010. The implementation of this is currently underway as the entire railway infrastructure is being upgraded. One of the central components of these activities is the renewal of the railcar infrastructure. It is no secret that most of the railcars currently operated by Azerbaijan Railways have long outlasted their service life, and we are currently using the resources of railcar repair plants of different countries to keep them operational. In the last few years alone, we have had 85 railcars repaired at plants in the Russian Federation and Ukraine.</p><h4>To what extent have international events such as the upcoming first European Games prompted the development of transport infrastructure, and what is your outlook for the sector?</h4><p><span></span>In recent years, Azerbaijan has become a venue for a number of international and regional events. Our capital Baku will soon play host to the inaugural European Games. This places tremendous responsibility on all relevant agencies of the country. The Transport Ministry of Azerbaijan has developed a specific action plan in relation to the First European Games, and we have a number of specific objectives to meet under this program. The Games are expected to bring together representatives of 49 countries, and the main transport hubs to be used are Heydar Aliyev International Airport, the Baku railway station, and automobile transport infrastructure. We will do our best to meet the objectives ahead of us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	Azerbaija<strong></strong>n 2020: Outlook for the Future is the country's national target. In reaching this goal, what role will be played by construction and by AzVirt itself?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>Within the development concept of Azerbaijan 2020: Outlook for the Future, the country's road and transport infrastructure will be brought in line with international standards through the widening and completion of roads of national importance. The construction of new roads will be carried out with the principle of ensuring the population's security; the construction of intra-urban and inter-urban car parks will be accelerated; relevant infrastructure will be improved; and an intelligent system of transport management will be implemented in large cities. The public transport system in the capital and other cities, districts, and villages will be significantly developed. The country's railway system and air transport systems will improve, and we will work on the balanced development of the regions as well as the progress of tourism. One of the most important projects within this is Baku's White City project. The area, located in the center of the Baku Bay, covers an area of 221 ha and was once known as the “Black City," because it was completely unusable from an environmental point of view, due to oil operations that were carried out without regard for environmental regulations. In accordance with the new development project, a modern and large residential settlement is to be established in what was the most environmentally unsuitable area, polluted with oil and oil waste. We have also planned office buildings, shopping centers, parks, and a boulevard, which will link the new residential area with the sea. The social infrastructure of Baku's White City will be state of the art. Our company has been entrusted to construct streets and roads within Baku's White City project.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>The 2015 European Games are a monumental occasion for Azerbaijan. What has AzVirt done to prepare Azerbaijan for the games?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>Games of the Olympic level have not been held in Azerbaijan before. Many infrastructure projects have been executed in the city related to the European Games. Most of the events will be held in Baku's Olympic Stadium, situated on the eastern coast of Boyukshor lake. The construction of the Hasan Aliyev Street-Ziya Bunyadov Avenue-Olympic Stadium motorway, which is being executed by our company, will provide a safer and more convenient link to the Olympic Stadium. Main sections of the road will have six lanes while the others will have four. The project requires the construction of two bridges, two tunnels, two pedestrian bridges, and passageways. The main aim of the project, which is part of the State Program, is to provide a road traffic route from all directions leading to Koroglu Metro Station, both to the city center and to Ganjlik Metro Station, via Hasan Aliyev Street. By also creating easier access to international-category highways for vehicles from Baku settlements, the new highway will ease traffic in the city center.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>The European Games are attracting a certain amount of international attention. What opportunities can AzVirt look to take advantage of in the future as a result?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>The planning and dynamic development of Azerbaijan throughout the last 20 years gave the country an opportunity to grow on the international arena, politically and economically. The opportunity for Azerbaijan to host the European Games will contribute to the development of relationships with European countries. With this in mind, there is the potential for participating in international road construction projects in the future.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>With an increasing presence abroad, what contribution can AzVirt make to the strengthening of international relations?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>AzVirt has branched out to new subsidiaries in Eastern Europe. In countries such as Romania and Serbia, we are undertaking highway construction projects. Our projects include the construction of highway E763 between Beograd to Juzni Jadran, the highway between Ljig and Preljina in Serbia and the reconstruction of the Bucharest ring road in Romania. They are scheduled to be completed on time and with our customary high quality. Our company takes part in the development of economic relations with these countries and fulfills its mission at the highest levels.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Aral Group consists of eleven companies. Can you give us a brief history of the inception of the company?</h4><p><span></span>Aral Group was established in Konya, Turkey in 1991. The company itself was situated in Konya until 1995, after 1995 the company moved to Azerbaijan and since that time Aral Group has mostly been involved in different projects in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.  Since 2004, we have also worked on projects in Istanbul.</p><h4><span></span>How important are operations in Azerbaijan for the overall strategy of the company?</h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijan is the most important country for us. Our construction activities and projects all began in Azerbaijan. The growth of this company has preceded parallel to the growth and development of Azerbaijan. I would not be exaggerating when I say that we owe everything to Azerbaijan. We have always been here; through the good times and the bad, and through Azerbaijan's troubles and its successes. Azerbaijan has given me so much, and I now consider my family to be Azerbaijani.</p><h4><span></span>How successful was 2014 for Aral Group?</h4><p><span></span>It was an excellent year, despite the drop in oil prices. Although, we are not sure yet what 2015 will bring if the drop in oil prices continues. Looking back, Azerbaijan was not badly affected by the 2008 crisis and, although there was a slowdown until 2010, business has picked up since then considerably. </p><h4><span></span>What are some of the unique features of Aral Group?</h4><p><span></span>Our projects have always been different from the kinds that are generally found in Azerbaijan. Every construction project we have undertaken has been better than the previous. Our projects are always the kind that people follow closely and point to as industry defining developments. The projects and complexes we do here are at the level of projects you see in Turkey. That is why we are one of the leading companies in the Azerbaijani market, and there is a lot of trust in the Aral name. We are one of the few firms that can sell before the project has even begun. Ultimately, that is what distinguishes us. </p><h4>Which projects do you have underway, and what are some future projects to look out for?</h4><p><span></span>One major project, starting after the European Games, is City Star. Our Roseville project is continuing and is now in Phase II. We have a major project in Sumgait with 2,700 residential units. This project is more for middle-class families and should be completed in three years.</p><h4>Aral Group projects seem to stand out for their designs. How important is design and aesthetics for Aral Group?</h4><p><span></span>The design is extremely important. We have our own interior design company, for example, and we believe that aesthetics is a critical aspect of our projects. Everything we do must be beautiful. This is part of our vision. It is more than just business for me; I love to look at what we have built, and I want it to be beautiful. </p><p><span></span>What changes or improvements do you think can be made in the Azerbaijani construction sector in general?The state is doing what it can, with mortgages now underway and banks are extending long-term credits. The most important thing is to build cities and complexes that are livable, modern, and appealing. It is not just accommodation that you are providing, it is a way of life, and we can see this perfectly when we look at projects such as Baku White City.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>We are wary of 2015, and we will see depending on what happens on the international scene. I do not expect anything negative in Azerbaijan; however, I believe we will have a better idea after the European Games. On a positive note, the Azerbaijani government is quick to act and is on top of things; therefore, its strong and wise leadership would prevent any serious crisis in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which steps led to the creation of Agropark in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>On February 12th, 2013, President of the Azerbaijan Republic Ilham Aliyev said, “I think there are already conditions for creation of Agropark." We appreciated this sentence at the right time and since then we have commenced our research within internal and external markets. Firstly, we looked into the history, development path, and the management mechanisms of already existing Agroparks around the globe. This research included, but was not limited to, the investigation of their products, supply, processing, and sales policies. During this research into the market, we understood that not only are there real conditions in Azerbaijan for the launch of agricultural institutions such as Agropark, but also there are great conditions for the further sustainable development of such institutions. Nevertheless, the most challenging question we faced was as if Agropark were to be created, where in Azerbaijan it would be located. Since the decision was of a high responsibility and strategy, we initiated research within the internal market, which lasted for four months. Our final decision ended up being Shamkir, because it has several strategic advantages in order to implement this project. To start with, it has a variety of development opportunities, profitable economical and geographical location, availability of infrastructure corresponding to requirements, and it has self-representation as a specialized agricultural region. In addition to that, there are high stakes of export potential; the location is on the historical Silk Road and in proximity to Georgia's Poti port (500km). There is traditional experience in organizing sales in Russian markets. Finally, there is sufficient internal demand, an availability of buyers' purchasing power—the region is the second most populated region after Absheron economical region—and proximity to Ganja, which is the second largest city after Baku.</p><h4>What is the production purpose of Agropark, and what are you going to produce in Agropark in the initial phase?</h4><p><span></span>Shamkir city has a profitable nature. The temperature, humidity, and soil structure is quite different here due to Shamkir's location on the foothills. Therefore, such conditions enable us to produce a number of different types of fruits and vegetables. When it comes to what we are to produce, we are going to grow tomatoes and other vegetables both in open fields and in greenhouses, and grow kernelled fruits in intensive orchards.</p><h4>What countries are you going to export your products to?</h4><p><span></span>Any businessman can export its products to any country. The only conditions are that the products should be of high quality and should be available for the purchase of clients at the right time corresponding to their desires. At Shamkir Agropark, we are thinking of providing our country with food security in the first place. At the same time, we have a huge export potential. The list of countries where we are to export our goods include, but not limited to, Russia, Kazakhstan, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. </p><h4>How are you going to help develop agriculture in Azerbaijan and stimulate new investors to come to Agropark?</h4><p><span></span>There are profitable conditions in Azerbaijan to make agricultural investments. Additionally, we enjoy a variety of resources and opportunities to further develop this sphere. In a political spectrum, the laws made by our State are of great motivation for farmers and extra incentive for investors. For example, the investors will be free of the Income Tax in Agropark. I would like to mention that those who are going to invest in Agropark will also be free of building utility infrastructure (water, gas, and electricity), as this will be provided by Agropark. In addition, investors will be able to enjoy other preferential services organized by our center. Additionally, we would enter into the 99-year contractual agreement with the investors. We are also not going to take any rental fees for three years. However, the biggest advantage here is the fact that Agropark is the real buyer of the goods produced by the investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways can Azersun Holding contribute to the Year of Agriculture in 2015?</h4><p>Azersun Holding plays an important role in the development of the country's non-oil sector, and has always attached great importance to agriculture. Most of our projects are directly related to this sector. President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev declared 2014 as the Year of Industry. By commissioning the Azersun Industrial Estate in 2014, with two major industrial complexes in it, we have made our contribution to agricultural development. Put into operation at a ceremony attended by the President, the industrial estate includes the Azerbaijan Paper and Cardboard Enterprise and the Sumgait Butter Factory, which has an annual capacity of 270,000 tons. In addition, on the initiative of the presidents of Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, the construction of the Logistical Center, which will be in Aktau, has been entrusted to Azersun Holding. Work on this project is now in full swing. After this enterprise becomes operational, it will be more profitable and easier to export agricultural produce from Azerbaijan. This will directly facilitate the expansion of Azerbaijan's export potential, in particular the exports of agricultural produce. We hope that the opening of the Logistical Center will be attended by the presidents of the two countries, and this project will contribute to further strengthen our economic relations. Azersun Holding is entering 2015 with major plans. We will soon commission a new animal feed factory in Imishli, with a capacity that will be twice that of the previous enterprise, producing 200,000 tons of feed a year. In 2015, we will also start a project to establish a large livestock breeding enterprise in the districts of Masalli and Shamakhi. </p><h4>What new areas is Azersun Holding looking to develop in the coming year in particular?</h4><p><span></span>The rapid development of Azerbaijan creates favorable conditions for the private sector. Azersun Holding is also taking advantage of the judicious policies conducted by the government. Growing in size with every passing year, our company provides an increasing number of people with jobs and implements projects contributing to improved prosperity and well being of its employees and society. In 2015, the company intends to start producing industrial chocolate. Various chocolate producers operating in the country will now be able to acquire high-quality raw materials from Azersun Holding. We also plan to commission other new enterprises. Baku will play host to the inaugural European Games in 2015 and Azersun Holding intends to make a contribution to the organization of this major international event.</p><h4>As Azerbaijan looks to develop its export market in the non-oil sector, what role will Azersun Holding play in supporting Azerbaijan's export market?</h4><p><span></span>Whereas in the early years of our operation the main objective of Azersun Holding was to provide for the country's food security, we have now met the internal demand. Our new focus is to try to take our domestic products to external markets. You can already come across Azersun Holding products in China, Central Asia, Arab countries, CIS, and other post-Soviet republics, Europe, and the US. We will soon establish a distribution office in Cologne, Germany, which is expected to increase our sales to European markets. At the same time, the Aktau Logistics Center is also expected to create favorable conditions for expanding our sales to Asian markets. In cooperation with Heinemann Duty Free, we are already selling our Azercay products in 54 airports around the world.</p><h4>One of Azersun's goals has been to produce goods that are competitive in foreign markets. How would you assess the success of Azerbaijani products in global markets?</h4><p><span></span>In general, the philosophy of Azersun Holding is underpinned by quality. Wherever the product is to be sold, as long as there is an Azersun Holding logo on it, there should be no issues with quality. What we have achieved to this day has been possible thanks to this approach. The quality of our products allows them the opportunity to compete with any product anywhere in the world. The central laboratory, in which Azersun Holding has invested great funds, serves this very goal. Having received international accreditation in 2014, this laboratory enables a complete quality assurance process. This, in turn, has earned us the respect of customers both in domestic and foreign markets. In addition, the agricultural produce cultivated in Azerbaijan are processed and canned with the best quality at four canneries. In terms of their quality, they are capable of competing with analogous products made in Europe. We will succeed in exporting quality Azerbaijani products to European markets. </p><h4>What further ways can the Agriculture sector develop in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijan's favorable geographic location and the attention being paid to agriculture facilitate agricultural development are two important ways to progress the sector. I believe that as a result of the government's attention to agricultural development, the contribution of this sector to the economy will increase several times in the coming years. Speaking in more specific terms, I would say that, where there is hard work and diligence, anything can be achieved. Azerbaijani products are already available and popular in many countries around the globe. This attests to the fact that our products are of good quality and competitive. </p><h4>How would you assess the investment opportunities available in Azerbaijan now as a result of events such as the upcoming European Games in Baku?</h4><p><span></span>We have great expectations from the First European Games due to be held in Baku in June. I have no doubt that the Games will be held at a high level and stay on the world's sporting agenda for a long time. The fact that such a high-profile event is to be held in Baku is first of all evidence of Azerbaijan's authority in the sporting world. We are capable of conducting high-level international sporting events. This attests to the level of international confidence in our country. Azersun Holding has recently signed a cooperation agreement with the Baku European Games Organizing Committee. It is gratifying for us that Azersun Holding and Bazarstore will take an active part in Baku-2015. According to the agreement reached, our company will act as an official partner of the European Games. The chain of Bazarstore supermarkets owned by Azersun Holding will provide merchandising and wholesale services, while Azerçay will act as official provider of tea during the Games. Most importantly, tens of thousands of foreign tourists will come to Baku to watch the Games. This will provide us with an excellent opportunity to promote our products to a much broader audience. Azersun Holding is proud to be an official partner of such a high-profile event as the First European Games. Speaking about investments, I can say that a lot has been invested in many areas of Azerbaijan to date, and these investments are already paying off. Nevertheless, we are also thinking of further investments. The Games will also provide foreign investors with the opportunity to discover Azerbaijan for themselves, and I am sure that this will produce specific results in the future. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you describe the launch of Green Tech's greenhouse complex?</h4><p><span></span>Green Tech is a modern glass-coated greenhouse complex launched in Azerbaijan in 2011. We grow seedlings, fresh vegetables, and mainly tomatoes. Our greenhouse complex is fitted with cutting-edge processing equipment. Our company has achieved maximum efficiency using the latest technology; therefore, it is playing an important part in providing the population with quality products. Ever since the first day of operations, the enterprise has attached special importance to increasing production volume and productivity. At the moment, the area of the company's greenhouses has been expanded to 200,000sqm. There is also a warehouse covering an area of 400sqm, which enables high-quality storage and processing of our products.</p><h4>What does Green Tech do to enable the cultivation of healthy products in its greenhouse complex? </h4><p><span></span>Our slogan is “Healthy products mean a healthy life." To obtain healthy products, we give preference to the application of various biological techniques to fighting parasites rather than using chemical methods. At the same time, bees carry out plant pollination naturally. One of the most widespread food safety systems used worldwide is the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP). It is an important tool enabling identification, evaluation, and control over food safety risk factors. The HACCP is considered the most efficient system of exercising control over food safety.</p><h4>What international quality certificates has Green Tech obtained for its products?</h4><p><span></span>Green Tech has recently obtained the food safety certificate to conform with ISO 22000 standard from the renowned SGS company, thereby confirming that it complies with the most stringent food safety requirement. The ISO 22000:2005 Food Safety Management System standard for us is a benchmark in terms of the quality of customer service, continuous improvement of our staff and customer satisfaction, and effective management of our main processes. </p><h4>How would you evaluate the impact of state-of-the-art technologies available at your greenhouse complex on production?</h4><p><span></span>In contrast to the greenhouses used in previous years, the Green Tech greenhouse complex operates on the basis of innovative technologies. This allows us the opportunity to receive an extra 10% of the sunlight, maintain the microclimate in the warehouse using a cutting-edge computerized system, and save on electricity consumption by utilizing greenhouse gases. These and other unique innovations will lead to increased productivity and economize on consumables and labor intensity.</p><h4>What impact does your enterprise have on the social well being of surrounding communities?</h4><p><span></span>In addition to applying the best practices to this area, the Green Tech greenhouse complex is also doing its best to improve the socioeconomic prosperity of the population in suburban settlements of Baku. In particular, more than 300 residents of such settlements have been provided with jobs, which means a source of income for 300 households. Also, by manufacturing high-quality products, Green Tech is also contributing to food security of the country. </p><h4>Where do you export Green Tech's products?</h4><p><span></span>The vegetables produced by our enterprise are mainly exported to and valued very highly in Russia. You can come across high-quality Green Tech products in a number of Russian cities. As the area of our greenhouse complex expands and production capacity increases, we will certainly further broaden the geography of our exports. I can say with full confidence that our products can compete with their counterparts in any part of the world.</p><h4>How can you assess the role of the state in the development of the Green Tech greenhouse complex?</h4><p><span></span>Of course, it would have been impossible to achieve all this without the continuous support of our government and President HE Ilham Aliyev. We received a concessional loan from the National Fund on Entrepreneurship Support for the establishment of our enterprise. In addition, the tax breaks provided to agricultural producers are a great incentive for us. As a result of this support, our enterprise has embarked on the construction of its third 10-ha greenhouse, and this project will be successfully completed in the coming months. Starting from 2015, we will grow such vegetables as different varieties of tomato, eggplants, and green peppers. We intend to increase our production capacity to 12,000 tons this year.</p><h4>Is the greenhouse complex a profitable business?</h4><p><span></span>The greenhouse complex is a part of agriculture, which means that, in order for it to bring you an income, you have to invest all your time and effort into it. You cannot succeed in any business if you do not have affection for it. You have to love nature, plants, flowers, and trees, otherwise you cannot be a successful businessman in this sphere. Therefore, I urge everyone who loves nature to pay more attention to this field. I would also like to express my gratitude to President HE Ilham Aliyev for the permanent attention paid to agricultural development. The produce grown in greenhouse complexes in Azerbaijan are exported to foreign countries, and this contributes to enhancing the country's export potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[prime-harvest]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Who are your most important partners in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>Farmers are our main partners. Every year we summarize the preceding season and make new contracts with the farmers for the upcoming year. We sign contracts with the farmers that grow tobacco, which always go under our supervision. We then provide advance financing for the project. This last season was not very successful, unfortunately, due to climatic issues. When we first started people still did not believe that this tobacco is good to work with, and in 2007 we managed to seal just three agreements—with only three farmers who agreed to test-grow the tobacco. Now, after the last season, we have around 70 agreements. Some agreements are now actually comprised of more than one person, for example, a group of farmers who decide to work together.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the equipment that you use at the plants and the process of production?</h4><p><span></span>In order to grow tobacco from seed to cigarette, you must go through a set of steps. The first part is agricultural: seed it, grow it, tend it, gather it, and dry it. The second part is to separate the leaf from its strands. The third stage is the production of cigarettes. Our project is big, and we covered the first two steps, while the third is not in our plans yet. We work with two approaches here. Firstly, we contact the farmers, and secondly, we try to grow on our own available company land. We dry Virginia leaves inside special dryers. Green tobacco leaves are put inside the dryer for seven days. We constructed and equipped three points for tobacco where the farmers send it freshly picked. It is dried, and then transferred to our factory where the tobacco leaves are peeled. In order to help the farmers, we work with an American company called Valmont, which helped us install many items of agricultural machinery. After the tobacco is collected and delivered to the factory, we use 180 drying compartments that allow us to dry 4,000 tons of tobacco every year. Afterwards, the tobacco moves to the next stage, which is separation. We have set up two companies that help us with the equipment here: the American company MacTavish and the Italian company Godioli &amp; Bellanti. We have set up our own line of production with the help of these two companies. The drying part of our production has cost us about $20 million, excluding the construction. We are very happy with our suppliers. </p><h4>The agricultural sector is very important in Azerbaijan. What share does tobacco have in it?</h4><p><span></span>I hope that the tobacco sector will grow and expand. In general, the agricultural sector, overall, is growing quickly: whether it is grain production, cotton production, or anything else. When it comes to tobacco, the drought might become a problem again, and farmers are getting suspicious about weather conditions. Growing tobacco needs a lot of human resources, and human labour always comes with additional costs. We set a goal for ourselves to increase the number of work places. Our sector is also important for the economy of the country: our rates per ton of production are high. On average, our rate per ton is $4,200.</p><h4>What investing opportunities does your company and the tobacco growing sector in general have for the future?</h4><p><span></span>I believe that the main investment opportunities are available through the companies that work with farmers. Local people have been growing tobacco forever, and whoever wants to invest should work with the farmers. The President has visited our factory twice, in 2007 and 2010. After this, he gave an interview to the regional newspaper and said that we can now speak about the absolute revival and reconstruction of the tobacco industry in the region—the highest praise I could ever get. People here really like working in this area, and all investors should consider this, and plan on improving the agricultural tools, fertilizers, and new means of working the land, for example. Although the latter can be said about any branch of agricultural production, in the tobacco industry, the human factor is essential. In the last couple of years, there has been no new development in the technological aspect of tobacco production, so all you need is to work with people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The First Lady, Mehriban Aliyeva, recently visited the National Children's Sanatorium in Baku and assessed operations there. What improvements have been carried out at the sanatorium recently?</h4><p><span></span>The reforms carried out in the healthcare sector form the backbone of the social policy of the state. The goal-oriented activities carried out under the leadership of President HE Ilham Aliyev have led to a qualitative and quantitative improvement of this sphere. Along with the excellent organization of children's education and training, the government is attaching great importance to their health. The President of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, HE Mehriban Aliyeva, is doing a great deal for the protection of children's health, the modernization of the healthcare system, and the development of its material and technical infrastructure. The measures carried out by HE Mehriban Aliyeva in the public health sector are of a consistent nature. The commissioning of such a facility for children in need of special care is commendable. Built in 1986, the sanatorium had never been renovated. Since the building was no longer serviceable, its major overhaul commenced in 2012. The eight-story building has a total area of 8,000sqm. The electrocardiography, physiotherapy, training, psychology, game halls, and wards are fitted with state-of-the-art equipment. The building is fully equipped for 182 personnel to provide children with qualified medical assistance. Children aged 4-14 suffering from somatic diseases will be treated at the medical facility. Children from all over Azerbaijan will have access to the sanatorium. There is also a ward for the parents of the children needing special care. The sanatorium has physiotherapy, rehabilitation and remedial gymnastics units, a 100-seat auditorium, and healing baths. The facility is well suited to provide children with comfortable recreation, examination, and treatment.</p><h4>What is the Ministry of Health doing to provide participants and visitors to Azerbaijan during the First European Games with qualified medical assistance?</h4><p><span></span>Although the preparation time is rather limited, all government agencies involved with preparations for the Games, including the healthcare sector, are attaching great importance to this issue. As in all other spheres, extensive preparations are under way in the healthcare sector. Given the scale of the inaugural European Games, as well as the expected number of visitors, the entire healthcare system has an obligation to provide visitors and the local population with qualified medical assistance. Following an executive order of the Ministry of Health, a special European Games healthcare committee has been set up. The committee operates in close contact with the Baku European Games Organizing Committee (BEGOC). Preparations cover all spheres of the healthcare system, including the overall sanitary and hygienic situation, medical institutions, medical personnel, and medical equipment and supplies. It is mainly focused on two areas: organization of medical assistance and sanitary-hygienic safety. When we talk about the organization of medical assistance, we imply the establishment of specialized medical institutions (organization of a specialized medical clinic in the Olympic village), provision of the existing and newly-established medical institutions with medical equipment meeting international standards, comprehensive training of medical personnel, and the organization of qualified emergency medical care at the required level. The organization of emergency medical care is of paramount importance because people experiencing acute health problems first contact the ambulance, and further examination and treatment of a patient often depends on the ambulance. Therefore, ambulance crews are expected to operate at all venues, hotels, and public spaces during the Games on a round-the-clock basis. In order to provide visitors and Azerbaijani citizens with qualified medical assistance during the Games, new Mercedes ambulance vehicles fully fitted with all the latest emergency medical equipment and appliances are to be commissioned. As more than 10,000 people are expected to visit Azerbaijan during the Games, in addition to enhancing the qualification of medical personnel, we have also organized English language courses for doctors.</p><h4>Healthcare is readily available throughout Baku, but less so in other parts of Azerbaijan. What can be done to increase the strength of regional healthcare in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>One of the main objectives facing the Ministry of Health is to improve the level of first-aid and improve the quality of medical services in the countryside. In addition to Baku, a number of activities have been carried out and are still ongoing all across the country. The numerous central district hospitals, village centers, perinatal clinics, and dispensaries built and renovated in our districts are fitted with all the necessary medical facilities, equipment, and medicine, and meet the latest international standards, which is evidence of the application of a rigorous approach to this sphere. This work will be continued in the future too, as we plan to further improve the material and technical infrastructure of medical facilities in the countryside, build and renovate them, and supply them with state-of-the-art medical equipment. The vast majority of the 600 recently commissioned medical facilities are located in the districts.</p><h4>The Heydar Aliyev Foundation has implemented of a number of international humanitarian projects in Azerbaijan. What has been the role of the Ministry of Health in these projects?</h4><p><span></span>The Heydar Aliyev Foundation, led by its President HE Mehriban Aliyeva, has made an exceptional contribution to the development of healthcare in Azerbaijan. These activities include a project on helping children suffering from diabetes, the provision of children under 14 years of age with insulin and syringes, the construction in Baku of a modern Center of Thalassemia as part of a project “Life without Thalassemia," permanent blood donation campaigns in the capital and other cities, assistance to children suffering from cardiac insufficiency, cleft lip and palate, and free-of-charge examination and treatment of people from low-income families. The Foundation also takes an active part in the construction and major overhaul of medical institutions. Our grateful people always remember and appreciate the immeasurable contribution of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation to the development of our healthcare system. </p><h4>What areas does the Ministry of Health plan to develop more in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Continuation of healthcare reforms and provision of qualified and affordable medical assistance is an important part of Azerbaijan 2020: Outlook for the Future. The concept envisages further improvement of the material and technical infrastructure, construction, renovation, and the major overhaul of new medical institutions and their provision with the latest medical equipment. In addition, various state programs on social diseases (diabetes, hemophilia, thalassemia, olcological diseases, immunoprophylaxis, hemodialysis, tuberculosis, and AIDS, as well as others) are to be implemented. We intend to continue the campaign to fight drug and alcohol addiction, and implement a number of public awareness activities. The improvement of health services to the level of developed countries is an important component of the country's long-term development strategy. A healthy individual and a strong healthcare system are key factors for the sustainable and long-term development of human resources. The reforms under way attest to the fact that people are at the heart of the policies pursued under the leadership of President Ilham Aliyev. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>The first European Games will be held in 2015 and is a historic landmark in many ways. How significant are the Games in promoting Azerbaijan as a reputable international venue?</h4><p><span></span>This year will be a historic one for Azerbaijan, as well as for European sport. The inaugural European Games were awarded to Azerbaijan in December 2012 based on the European Olympic Committees' confidence in our ability to stage a Games worthy of the continent. The vote on that occasion was overwhelmingly in favor of the Baku 2015 bid, and we intend to repay that trust with a truly memorable event. The Games are part of President Ilham Aliyev's vision to cement our country's position as a dynamic, hospitable, culture and business center in Europe. Azerbaijan is already known as a key provider of energy for the continent, but thanks to events such as the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest, the FIFA Women's U-17 World Championship, the Baku 2015 European Games, and, in the coming years, the 2016 European Formula One Grand Prix, the Baku 2017 Islamic Solidarity Games, and UEFA Euro 2020 football matches, our profile will be higher than ever.</p><h4>Azerbaijan's sporting prowess has increased considerably with improved efforts at the last Olympic Games in London 2012. What opportunities do the Baku Games present to enhance the performance of Azerbaijani athletes?</h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijan is a country with a strong sporting tradition. Although we are not large in terms of population, we are increasingly punching above our weight. We have high hopes for our athletes' chances at Baku 2015. Recent years have seen Azerbaijan make great strides, from the positive results at the London 2012 Olympic Games where our delegation finished 30th in the medal tally, to the exceptional performances by our young competitors at the Youth Olympic Games last year in China, where we finished among the top ten competing National Olympic Committees. Those results have given us a great springboard from which to achieve another impressive position in the medal table this summer. I truly believe we are entering a golden age for Azerbaijani sport.</p><h4>It was announced in October 2014 that the 1,000th member of staff had been employed for the First European Games. How important have the Games been in encouraging employment?</h4><p><span></span>The Baku 2015 Operations Committee now has over 1,400 employees, around 70% of whom are Azerbaijani with the remainder drawn from 43 different countries. Working to organize the European Games is a unique experience for these members of staff, who are learning valuable, often highly specialized and technical skills in an international context. This human legacy will play a key role in building on what we are achieving by staging the Games. The Games Academy and Graduate Excellence Programme incorporates 188 ambitious young people—162 from Azerbaijan and 26 from the National Olympic Committees of Europe—into the Baku 2015 team. The program, which enhances career advancement, ensures that these graduates are developing the skills and knowledge required to deliver not only the European Games, but also future sporting events in our country. Baku 2015 has also launched a volunteer program. The Flamekeepers, as the volunteers are known, will take on key roles during the Games, and will play a central role in fostering the spirit of Baku 2015. Part of their human legacy will be to encourage a national interest in volunteering, as well as participation in future major events.</p><h4>SOCAR became an official partner of the Baku Games in September 2014. How has this partnership strengthened national efforts for the games?</h4><p><span></span>SOCAR is part of a strong team of Official Partners that have joined Baku 2015. We see these relationships to be true partnerships rather than simply sponsorships. Hosting the first European Games is a major step in Azerbaijan's national development, and Azerbaijani companies such as SOCAR will enjoy lasting benefits from the increasing professionalism and internationalism that the Games' human legacy aspect will bring, as well as the ongoing transformations in Baku, which will help to make our capital a leading business center. Baku 2015's eight Official Partners are Azerbaijan Airlines, BP, Coca-Cola, Nar Mobile, P&amp;G, SOCAR, Tissot, and Kapital Bank. The Official Supporters are Azercosmos, NAZ, Néstle, Red Bull, Azersun Holding, Bazarstore, McDonald's Azerbaijan, Milla, Motorola Solutions, Sitecore, Tickethour, and Unicef as the Official Children's Rights Organization.</p><h4>How well has sport developed among the younger generations in Azerbaijan, and what are the challenges in encouraging participation?</h4><p><span></span>With 60% of the population under the age of 35, Azerbaijan has one of the youngest populations in Europe. As mentioned, the government has been undertaking a major program of construction of sporting facilities across the country to encourage our youth to develop interests in active pursuits. Young people are the future of any society, and our country is blessed with great potential in this regard. Sport has been identified by President HE Ilham Aliyev as a key driver of our nation's economic and social development, and as Minister of Youth and Sports, I have the privilege of ensuring that this policy is carried out to the benefit of our young people. Generating interest and stimulating participation in sport is key in achieving our objective of a healthy, productive population. The new facilities will ensure that the option of taking part in active pursuits is there for all, and the European Games and other major events will provide the spark, which encourages our youngsters to maximize their potential. Part of our vision for engaging young Azerbaijanis to take part in sport and healthy lifestyles is to inspire them though the Games. Baku 2015 Organising Committee Chair First Lady HE Mehriban Aliyeva is leading this initiative personally, through her oversight of the artistic side of the Games, including the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, medal and uniform design, and the Baku 2015 mascots. Her creative vision and the elite-level competitions to be held during the Games will combine to make an unforgettable spectacle. Baku 2015 will be a watershed moment for sport in Azerbaijan, and the current investment in sporting facilities will ensure that our young people will benefit for generations to come.</p><h4>Once the first European Games have been completed, what are the necessary steps to ensure that the Games continue to have a positive impact?</h4><p><span></span>From the start, the aim of leaving a positive legacy in human and infrastructure terms has been central to Baku 2015. Our commitment has been to stage the Games, which will provide everything necessary for the athletes to shine, while ensuring that the investments made benefit Baku and Azerbaijan as a whole in the long term. An example of this is our Driver Training Programme, which will see more than 2,000 of the city's professional drivers take a 15-day course designed to bring their skills up to international standards and ensure a safer driving environment in Baku. The city's sporting infrastructure is being transformed, which is part of the broader nationwide campaign to invest in sporting facilities. For example, the Games will leave the city the world-class Baku Aquatics Center, a legacy item that will encourage people to take part in swimming. The large-scale events to be hosted in the coming years will provide immediate use for much of the infrastructure and human legacy of Baku 2015. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>The first European Games have already created a great deal of external interest in Azerbaijan. What have been some of the major opportunities and challenges that the Games have provided?</h4><p><span></span>We strongly believe that these games, which are the first European Games in history, will provide a brilliant opportunity for us to show Azerbaijan from a different angle. It will bring the main features, traditions, attractions, sport facilities, safety, and perfect organization of our country into the spotlight. With the successful organization of previous tourism events held in Azerbaijan, we have already proven that the country can host any kind of event, large or small. The importance of this event should be especially emphasized. On the one hand for Azerbaijan's tourism industry, this event will be beneficial for long-term investment of the country's image as an emerging tourist destination that is capable of facilitating various tastes and expectations to the highest standards. We expect this event to attract tourists from all over Europe and other countries. Preparations for the European Games are on schedule with the event set to deliver world-class venues, sporting action, and innovation and new standards of athlete accommodation. The government is striving to provide the best possible venues for the finest athletes of Europe, and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism has implemented different actions aimed at the success of this event along with the Organizing Committee.</p><h4><span></span>The increase of foreign interest in Azerbaijan has increased the demand for high quality services. How would you assess the standard of business services in the hotel industry?</h4><p><span></span>The flow of tourists is increasing every year, and in the capital and other tourist areas, there is a growing number of world class hotels. Among the most popular hotels in the capital are chains of brand hotels such as Four Seasons Hotel Baku, Hyatt Regency, JW Marriott Absheron Baku Hotel, Jumeirah Bilgah Beach Hotel, Fairmont, Grand Hotel Europe, Hilton Baku, Kempinski Hotel Badamdar, and others. We are positive about these world-known brands, as they bring the highest standards and international practices, staff development opportunities, and management systems. It will be a great benefit to the entire tourism industry, as other players will have to improve their quality and service standards to be able to compete. The Ministry is monitoring the activities of the hotels operating in Azerbaijan periodically in order to check whether their activities comply with the state's standards. We will ensure that the hotels and travel agencies offer high-level services during the Games in June 2015.</p><h4><span></span>Which foreign ministries do you collaborate with, and what opportunities does this provide for mutual tourism?</h4><p><span></span>As a Ministry of Culture and Tourism, we collaborate with the foreign ministries in different countries, exchanging information and best practice. We should emphasize our close collaboration with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Turkey. Thanks to this successful cooperation, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Turkey is organizing continuous training courses for members of the Tourism Industry in Azerbaijan every year. These courses in areas such as hotel management, front-desk management, and housekeeping have brought great opportunities for the members of the Tourism industry in Azerbaijan to upgrade competence in their fields. Different projects are constantly organized between the two ministries on different spheres of tourism. We should also not forget our cooperation with Ministries responsible for tourism in the framework of international organizations such as UNWTO, COMCEC, and BSEC.</p><h4><span></span>What developments can be made to further improve the infrastructure of tourism in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>All segments of tourism need to be worked on in terms of the development and improvement of infrastructure. In some segments, however, we have already improved, and this can be seen as the first steps of this long-term process. Shah-Dag skiing resort was built in the northern part of Azerbaijan, which plans to be the largest skiing facility in Europe with the capability to receive 5,000 people, and Tufandag ski center, which opened in Gabala in 2014, are perfect examples of this. The list can go on with other winter or summer infrastructure samples. We have also established fruitful cooperation with Azerbaijan Investment &amp; Export Promotion Agency (AZPROMO) with several projects developed jointly and promoted via various organized events in order to increase foreign investment in the hospitality sector. In addition, we have held active negotiations with several potential investors who have interest in the Azerbaijani tourist market. With them, we discuss concrete projects, help them to understand the business and legislative environments, identify opportunities, potential challenges, and propose solutions to overcome these. This is done in order to further improve the tourism infrastructure in Azerbaijan. It should be highlighted that tourism is one of three non-petroleum economic sectors identified as a priority in the national economic development plans of Azerbaijan. Consequently, the industry has received strong support from the state leadership and personally from President HE Ilham Aliyev. Such a high level of commitment contributes significantly to the development of tourism and associated infrastructure, elaboration of new policies and standards, international cooperation programs, development of dialogue between the public and private sector, and the attraction of domestic and international investments.</p><h4>In which areas is there the greatest potential for growth in the tourism sector in Azerbaijan over the coming years?</h4><p><span></span>Current tourism statistics reveals the fact that the number of sun and beach tourists, as well as the number of winter tourists coming to Azerbaijan, are increasing year by year. One of the main missions of our tourism development strategy is the diversification of tourism products. We are creating every opportunity to bring the most exciting programs and entertainment to everyone visiting Azerbaijan, and we are exploring new types of tourism activities. Due to the unique characteristics of the all-year round destination, we can incorporate almost every type of tourism in our country. Much has been done to promote Azerbaijan as both a summer and winter tourism destination. We have active promotions of summer and winter tourism in Azerbaijan via world mass media, such as advertising on CNN, Euronews, and many other international channels. MICE tourism is also in our focus, as this industry is one of the most developing ones all over the world as well as in Azerbaijan. As a partnership between the public and private sectors, the Azerbaijan Convention Bureau represents the Alliance of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan and industry members operating in the market. We should not forget the importance of cultural tourism as the rich historical and cultural heritage of the country attracts visitors from all over the world. Despite the size of the country, the culture and heritage of Azerbaijan is diverse and colorful. Azerbaijan has great potential for health tourism, which is becoming more popular as we have a unique element for this type of tourism. In fact, Naftalan resort, located 320km west of Baku, has gained worldwide fame thanks to the healing Naftalan oil. The healing properties and the effectiveness of Naftalan oil for different diseases have been proven by the results of thousands of scientific works and monographs. Taking these into consideration, we are doing our best to regain the past popularity of this resort and type of tourism in Azerbaijan, and we will definitely succeed. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>KPMG's outfit has grown to employ more than 80 employees since setting up a full service office in 2011. Why has KPMG been able to grow in this way?</h4><p><span></span>KPMG is a strong brand. It is an international company, which has more than 162,000 professionals working together and delivering value in 155 countries worldwide. In addition, we have gathered a professional local team with many years of experience and deep expertise in the market, whom we are proud of. Last, but the most important, is our clients, both international and local, who stay loyal and with whom we are working closely on daily basis.</p><h4>What is the balance in employees between Azerbaijani and foreign, and how are potential employees trained?</h4><p><span></span>Approximately 90% of our staff is local professionals, and this percentage is growing. In 2014 alone, we hired 21 new local employees. At the same time, our global membership provides us with access to an enormous amount of best practice, knowledge, and methodology to use in Azerbaijan. International experience helps to create indispensable experience for talented local employees, and it is a huge advantage for our clients; we offer decisions that proved their efficiency worldwide.</p><h4>KPMG, with its global presence, can observe different countries and their reactions to global market shifts. How would you assess Azerbaijan's success so far in combatting the falling oil price and depreciation of the manat? </h4><p><span></span>Despite of some crisis signs in the region, Azerbaijani economy still shows growth, and we have a positive balance of trade. Actually, all of these are the yields of proper economic policy. Over the past decade, the non-oil sector increased by 2.5 fold, and its share in GDP reached 68%. It is no coincidence that, in spite of the volatility in the energy market and decline in oil prices over the last year, the economy has grown up by 5.3. I believe that 2015 will be a difficult year for all countries with rich energy resources; however, our difference is that we have tried to diversify the economy on time. Since 1995, Azerbaijan's economy has attracted more than $200 billion of investments, 62% of which was invested in non-oil sector. </p><h4>Looking at Azerbaijan from its regional position, how would you assess its development compared with the region?</h4><p><span></span>Azerbaijan is an undisputable leader of the region. GDP for the past 10 years has increased by 3 fold, its volume per capita 2.6 times, industry 3.6 times, agriculture 1.4 times, and state budget revenues 12 fold. At present, Azerbaijan's economy comprises more than 75% of the economy of the South Caucasus.</p><h4>KPMG sponsors a number of events and institutions including the Azerbaijan Foreign MBA Club. How are these sponsorships chosen, and in what way can they provide mutual benefits?</h4><p><span></span>During the last year and a half, we were organizers, sponsors, and partners of many events. Our main objectives in this activity are to share our knowledge with institutional business community and our customers, create the network, and bring the best practices of various industries to Azerbaijan. The aims of these events that we sponsor are the same: we are embarking on useful projects for our society and business. For us, sponsorship is the commitment for the community.</p><h4>What are KPMG's current aspirations and targets in Azerbaijan for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>As a company, we will continue as a center to deliver value-adding product. As for the business segments growing in Azerbaijan, we forecast the development of consulting service area, and we will work intensively in this direction. We also focus on the development of industries, such as ICT, transportation, and the rapidly growing non-oil sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There have been substantial changes to the foreign involvement in Shah Deniz 2. As the operator in the field, what impact has this had on BP?</h4><p><span></span>It is not unusual to see partnership changes at this stage of a project. We are in an industry where companies regularly evaluate their portfolios to concentrate on their strengths. We welcome the expanded relationship with TPAO who bought Total's 10% stake in the Shah Deniz consortium. TPAO is a key participant in many of our major regional projects. And we very much appreciate the contribution made by Statoil over the years, but welcome Petronas as a new partner in this endeavor. This huge project is in the early stages, but we are on track to deliver it over the next five years. Since the beginning of 2014, the BP-operated projects have already committed about $10 billion in contracts.</p><h4>How is BP's project at the Shafag-Asiman field developing so far and what are the next steps?</h4><p><span></span>We successfully conducted the first 3D seismic acquisition on the structure. This in fact was the first 3D seismic ever conducted on this contract area. The processing of the acquired data, which is believed to be the largest 3D survey ever processed within Azerbaijan, took two years to complete. In 2014, we completed the data processing and started interpretation of the seismic dataset and this will require some 18 months to complete. This will be followed by planning of the first exploration well. We look forward to this joint exploration and development opportunity with SOCAR and we continue to hope for a successful exploration result. </p><p><span></span>In addition, in 2014, we also signed a new exploration contract with SOCAR to jointly explore for and develop potential prospects in the shallow water area around the Absheron Peninsula in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea. This is a great opportunity for BP given that we have extensive experience in responsibly exploring and developing in shallow water areas around the world. Working together with SOCAR we have been very successful over the past 20 years in all the projects we have operated in the Caspian. We look forward to building on this success with this opportunity to further expand the country's resource base.</p><h4>BP is heavily involved in several terminals and pipelines. How important are these in terms of BP's long-term ambitions in Azerbaijan and in the region?</h4><p><span></span>Indeed, as the biggest operator in the region, we believe we are in a good position to deepen our involvement in the region. The key drivers of this are 1) our successful partnership with Azerbaijan/SOCAR, 2) very good relationship with all key regional stakeholders, 3) access to all existing world class infrastructure including construction yards, drilling rigs, vessels, 4) operatorship of the region's biggest offshore and onshore facilities including the Sangachal Terminal, BTC and SCP pipelines that connect the Caspian with the world markets, 5) the opportunity to integrate any new plan  with other BP operated projects, expertise and deep understanding of the Caspian basin, and 6) the world-class local project content including suppliers, staff and workforce  that we have developed here.  These are all the main factors that, we believe, our plans for long-term presence in the region and expansion of our business here can be built on.  </p><p><span></span>On the global scale, we have extensive experience in responsibly exploring, developing and transporting major oil and gas resources. To do this safely and efficiently, we use the best technology available in the industry and environmentally friendly solutions. Throughout our presence here we have been successfully transferring all this to the Caspian and we will continue to do so in the future. </p><h4>The “Regulation of nationalization and migration issues in the oil and gas sector" meeting was held by SOCAR, BP, and the State Migration Service in November 2014. What was the significance of this meeting and what are the primary objectives of the initiative?</h4><p><span></span>The meeting in November was specifically focused on how we can cooperate in the areas of nationalization of BP's staff, development and training of professionals specializing in petroleum disciplines, and the workforce involved in oil and gas development projects in Azerbaijan. The long-term and technically complex nature of BP-operated projects requires the involvement of qualified national professionals. Both SOCAR and BP see these projects as a unique opportunity for developing Azerbaijan's local highly skilled oil and gas industry professionals and workforce. Therefore we have worked closely with SOCAR and other relevant government agencies for many years to agree a long-term strategy that would allow us to reach this goal by combining our efforts. This strategy aims to develop Azerbaijan's national workforce specializing in oil and gas sector disciplines. As the operator of Azerbaijan's main oil and gas projects, we are committed to this strategy, which is expected to enhance nationalization of our staff and development of the workforce involved in our operations in Azerbaijan. We all believe that it is in the government's and BP's and our co-venturers' interest that the large majority of the workforce involved in our projects and operations are Azerbaijani nationals. We have signed several documents that enable us to continue to work together to realize our shared vision. I would specifically single out one of them which I believe goes beyond BP-operated projects' requirements and targets the development of the country's overall workforce capacity. This is an agreement with SOCAR on cooperation in the area of training of national workforce at Gobustan Regional Training Centre. Under this agreement BP has committed to supporting vocational and technician discipline training for a large group of representatives of the local communities residing in the neighborhood of the Sangachal Terminal - Sangachal, Umid, Azimkend and Gobustan settlements. BP currently covers the tuition and other expenses related to the training of these people at the Gobustan Regional Training Centre.</p><h4>It was mentioned last year that BP had a target to ensure that 90% of staff in Azerbaijan and Georgia were nationals by the end of 2018. What further steps need to be taken to ensure that this goal is reached</h4><p><span></span>Nationalization of our staff has always been a priority of our business agenda in Azerbaijan. We have already achieved a lot with 86% of our direct professional staff and 90% of the workforce involved in our construction activities through our major contractors being nationals. Looking to the future, we have committed to working even more closely with SOCAR to reach our targets. We have specifically signed a protocol, which will enable us to work together to develop national professionals so that they can take over the maximum number of jobs within BP. Among these targets the most important is the one that you mention — by 2018 BP will have nationalized 90% of its direct professional staff. Work is underway to that end - we have initiated a number of learning and development programs, enhanced our support for local capability-building projects, revised our recruitment strategy. As a result, significant progress has already been made. We will continue to work closely with SOCAR to arrange recruitment campaigns, educational and training programs to support the development of national oil and gas industry professionals. </p><h4>It has been announced that investments in the Southern Gas Corridor are set to reach up to $45 billion. How important is sustainable investment in Azerbaijan's energy sector?</h4><p><span></span>We are an industry increasingly alert to the need for greater financial discipline, and focusing more and more on value. All projects must compete for funding within our portfolio of opportunities. Our role during this execute phase is to deliver the project safely, on time and on budget. The numbers we associate with the Shah Deniz 2 and Southern Gas Corridor projects are colossal by any standard: 16 billion cubic meters of gas per year; $45 billion of capital investment; thousands of new jobs; 3,500km of pipeline. But these are over-shadowed by the potential that this new Caspian gas supply will unlock. It will offer a major new source of energy diversity to Europe, it will have a material positive impact on the economies along the Corridor, and it will have created a legacy of agreement and understanding between a host of governments, state and independent energy companies and gas purchasers which will encourage the development of even greater volumes of gas from the Caspian and other countries.</p><p><span></span>That is an immense prize and the success of the Southern Gas Corridor is key to securing it.</p><h4>What effect do you expect Russia's cancellation of the South Stream will have on operations in Azerbaijan and what opportunities can BP derive from this?</h4><p><span></span>Our focus, as a shareholder in the Shah Deniz project, is to get the project completed. Shah Deniz Stage 2 is on track for first gas in 2018, with sales to Turkey. Shah Deniz 2 has long term gas sales contracts in place for essentially all the gas it will produce, as announced in September 2013. And TANAP has customers under contract to ship their gas through TANAP. The Southern Gas Corridor has an important role to play in diversifying European energy supply.</p><p><span></span>Beyond this it would not be appropriate for us to comment on another project. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-cable-guy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Goknur's establishment in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>We were established in 2003 at a small-scale factory where our production ranged from 04kV, low voltage cables to 35kV cable. We were the first company in Azerbaijan to produce large XLP cable, and today we employ approximately 300 people at a plant built in 2007. It has increased significantly in its size. We have had to grow our factory. We were the first manufacturers to produce this special cable, and moreover, the first in Azerbaijan to produce KEMA certified cable; this is a special Norwegian universal certificate awarded for production quality, whereby we are now able to export to Europe, as we meet European standards. We are also the first company in Azerbaijan to receive a license in 2002 from Germany VDE, a laboratory that issues quality certification, which is similar to KEMA. Such certification also paves the way to working with larger companies. For 2015, our first target is to start exporting to Europe. KEMA certification is mainly geared toward electrical products. Now, we are looking at Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Our sales department visited Turkmenistan recently, and we have hosted a guest recently from there. In 2013-14, we realized exports of $17 million of cable products to Turkmenistan. Today, our targeted markets are Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan on the strength of our competitive prices.</p><h4>How do you train and select your staff?</h4><p><span></span>We invite special teams to organize training for our staff to keep them informed at the high skill level that merits our international certification. Once a month, we organize a training meeting with our staff and the technical department. We do not work with the universities on this as they lack our specific products; however, sometimes we invite special companies to organize training, often comprising people who have worked at major companies, and are therefore able to meet our organizational needs.</p><h4>What raw materials do you use?</h4><p><span></span>We use high quality raw materials for the cable. For example, we use RUSAL aluminum for its high quality. We also use copper from the largest producer in Uzbekistan, a government factory. And regarding PVC and special technical materials, we use the products of Borealis, a European company. There are a numerous components in cabling, and we exclusively focus on quality.</p><h4>What projects have you been involved in for the European Games?</h4><p><span></span>We are part of a holding, Baku Electric Group, which, along with Goknur and GBS, is participating in the Games. We will provide electricity to all the stadiums. We have the generators, cables, and switchboard panels. If there are 11 stadiums, all of them will have us as the main contractors for electricity, power, installation of cables, and generators. During the Games, we are confident of our cables and generators performing excellently. </p><h4>To what extent are your exports boosting your operations?</h4><p><span></span>Our company is growing significantly, and today this depends on the wider political and economic environment. Occasionally we experience imbalanced growth, and are buffeted by We have events surrounding the US dollar and Azeri manat. We have increased employee headcount to 300 at our factory, today with a 35,000sqm area compared to the previous 20,000sqm. Our priority is to boost our exports.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for foreign investments?</h4><p><span></span>We are open to serious offers, even from foreign companies. We are looking for strong partners from Europe, for example, to organize exports. We like European companies because they are more professional and it would be a fruitful experience for us.</p><h4>What are your objectives for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>A core objective is to become involved in key projects within our market. Our main target, however, is to increase exports. From now until the European Games, there will be a significant volume of construction that we intend to supply. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What services do you provide currently, and what are your most important projects?</h4><p><span></span>At present, GBS carries out work in the application of electrical equipment manufactured by leading companies in the field of electrical technology, as well as for integration into the world market.

		<url><![CDATA[part-of-the-furniture]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>One of the distinctive features of Embawood is the functionality of its furniture. What are Embawood's development innovations in this direction?</h4><p><span></span>When designing new models, Embawood designers and engineers follow ASE, LGA, and Neufertin standards. In order to enable the use of soft furniture, both for sitting and lying, we use multi-functional mechanisms. Sometimes, customers who have large homes use two or three furniture sets in one room. This both undermines the interior design of a home and costs the customer more. To address this problem, we have introduced built-in closets to bedroom sets and a modular system to soft furniture sets. Furniture ergonomics is as important to us as functionality. Therefore, we have introduced changes to bedroom closets to meet average customer requirements.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for increasing the market share of Embawood in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>The reforms carried out at the factory have helped us expand production and introduce new products. This includes expansion of the assortment of mattresses, an increase in the size of soft furniture sets, and the production of furniture sets that have smaller numbers of items. This, in turn, helps us secure an additional market share and meet market demand for local products. It has allowed us the opportunity to take advantage of favorable conditions created for domestic manufacturers as well as take our products to the international level.</p><h4>Azerbaijan is becoming increasingly self-sufficient with raw materials. How important is self-sufficiency for the sustainable development of Embawood?</h4><p><span></span>It is highly important to be able to provide oneself with raw materials in the furniture business. In the past, we imported most of our raw materials from foreign countries. Starting from 2013, as a result of the development of the national economy, the share of our domestic supplies has significantly increased.</p><h4>The first European Games will offer ample opportunities for Azerbaijan to assert itself in the international arena. What does it mean for your business and the industry in general?</h4><p><span></span>The first European Games are tremendously important from the standpoint of promoting the country in the world. The Games will help the country as a whole and the industry in particular to attract new investors, establish cooperation with companies from other countries, ease the access of local companies to foreign markets, develop the economy, and expand the market. In addition, the Games will have a significant impact on the development of tourism.</p><h4>What steps has Embawood taken in supporting the development of the non-oil sector?</h4><p><span></span>Non-oil sector development is a national priority. The President of the Republic of Azerbaijan has repeatedly stated this. As a company, Embawood has made a tangible contribution to the Azerbaijani economy. The company has also expanded its campaign of sales on the basis of loans. From the first day of its establishment, Embawood has operated with the money of its shareholders and paid taxes into the state budget.</p><h4>How does Embawood protect its market share in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><span></span>Over the past two years, Embawood has carried out a number of activities to protect its market share both at home and abroad. We are currently considering introducing a 0% loan campaign for retail customers. The company has developed a different marketing and advertising campaign. In January 2015, Embawood attended the Koelnmesse furniture exhibition in Cologne, Germany. The event helped the company to gain international experience and aspire to new achievements. As a result of the application of this experience to Azerbaijan, we have managed to become frontrunners in the domestic market. Our main goal is to preserve the existing customers by setting affordable prices and attracting their attention again. To achieve that, we have developed a program to improve the level of customer satisfaction. We intend to complete a transition to the CRM electronic customer support program in 1H2015. </p>]]></richbody0content>
