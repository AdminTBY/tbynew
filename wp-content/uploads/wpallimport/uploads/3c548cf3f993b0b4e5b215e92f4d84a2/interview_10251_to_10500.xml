		<title><![CDATA[A Safe Harbor for Investment]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-safe-harbor-for-investment]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The global economic crisis of recent years has shaken the foundations of the global economy, causing it to enter a period of change and transformation. In this time of crisis and upheaval, interest naturally shifts to emerging economies like Turkey, which has emerged as a safe harbor for international investors.<br></p><p>Turkey has succeeded in becoming one of the countries least affected by the recent crisis. The main reasons behind this economic transformation lies in our government, which has, for the past 10 years, instigated and implemented the necessary measures and structural changes to set Turkey on the right track. From 2002 onward, the Turkish economy has proven to be dynamic, solid, and stable.</p><p>In just a short period of time, we have already begun reaping the rewards of the economic, political, and legal reforms that we've undertaken. Except for 2009, at the height of the global economic crisis, the Turkish economy has posted steady and consistent growth since 2002. Our GDP, which was $230 billion in 2002, has tripled in the last nine years to reach $772 billion by the end of 2011. Similarly, our exports, which were $36 billion in 2002, have since risen to $135 billion at the end of 2011. As for our Central Bank reserves, they've increased from $27 billion to $91 billion within the same time period.</p><p>On top of that, we've had record drops in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates. The ratio of EU-defined general government gross debt stock to GDP stood at 74% when our government came to power; today, that ratio has dropped to 39%. Furthermore, the ratio of net public sector debt stock to GDP has dropped from 61.5% in 2002 to just 22% today.</p><p>In order to gain a complete picture of the extent to which the economy has grown and transformed, investment figures are a key indicator. While in 2002 investments totaled TL59 billion, by the end of 2011 that figure had increased fivefold to TL283 billion. Private sector investment rose from TL43 billion to TL235 billion. This major increase in investments is no doubt a result of the stability and security that has held sway over Turkey for the past 10 years. Today, every investor in Turkey can look to the future with confidence, secure in the solid foundations they stand on.</p><p>There is no doubt that the wide-ranging structural reform program undertaken since the end of 2002 has been of great benefit to Turkey's investment environment, transforming our country into a highly attractive destination for FDI. Today, Turkey continues to evaluate and assess its position vis-í -vis global economic developments and crises, as it continues to adapt successfully to the ever-changing political and economic environment.</p><p>That being said, we don't measure economic development on macroeconomic statistics alone; we also pay great attention to socioeconomic factors, making sure to assess our development with these factors in mind. In this sense, Turkey has been very successful in relieving its population from poverty. Indeed, per capita GDP has risen from $3,500 to over $10,000.</p><p>Impressed by Turkey's healthy economic performance, global investors have been pouring into the country. In the last nine years, Turkey managed to attract over $110 billion worth of FDI. When you consider that total FDI in the 80 years between 1923 and 2002 stood at just $15 billion, you can appreciate just how impressive FDI growth has been in the last decade.</p><p>Our government has implemented various incentive programs to attract foreign investment, and we continue to add new incentive programs while keeping an eye on changing conditions in the global economy. We announced our latest incentive program in April 2012. Our new incentive system offers investors different options, enabling them to benefit from these incentives in all kinds of situations. These incentives include tax cuts and exemptions, land allocation, and the payment of insurance premiums on the part of both employers and employees, thereby contributing to a major overall drop in production costs. It's important to underline something here: with the new incentive system, we will continue to strongly support strategic investments that reduce the current account deficit and contribute to the structural transformation of our industries—no matter where—in Turkey.</p><p>As the government, we aim to strengthen the attractive investment environment through reforms and incentives. Our government continues to support global investors before, during, and after every investment. With this in mind, we've created the Investment Support and Promotion Agency of Turkey (ISPAT), which reports directly to me. The message we're giving global investors is crystal clear: Turkey is a safe harbor with a business-friendly government that will support you fully through every step of the investment process.</p><p>Further lucrative opportunities are awaiting global investors as Turkey has embarked on realizing ambitious targets by the year 2023, the centennial celebration of the foundation of the Republic. One of the targets is to place Turkey among the top 10 economies in the world, with a GDP of $2 trillion and a per capita income of $25,000. Our past experience and success assures us that Turkey will realize all its objectives in the coming period, moving decisively forward in pursuit of its goals. I believe that, in light of these objectives, global investors will find more and more business and investment opportunities in Turkey. While global investors will contribute to Turkey's growth and economic development on the one hand, they will reap handsome rewards on the other. That's why we will always support global investors who seek to make investments in our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The past year has seen Turkey play a significant role in the region. To what extent is the “zero problems with neighbors" policy still viable?</h4><p>There has been no change in our policy of “zero problems with neighbors." We still preserve our strong will toward developing relations with our neighbors and aim to focus on prospects for cooperation rather than perceptions of threats and divergences. However, we cannot control the developments that take place in our neighborhood, nor the stances that other countries adopt in the face of challenges. We stand by our values and work toward our mutual interests. The events that take place in our Middle Eastern neighborhood have the potential to produce global repercussions in terms of stability and security. We therefore pursue more proactive policies toward averting crises and steering events in a positive direction whenever possible. It is with this understanding that we have set the “zero problems with neighbors" policy, and have begun making positive contributions to stability, security, and welfare both in our region and beyond. This reflects the orientation of our foreign policy and should not be seen as a time-bound objective. The policy has been successful in creating more positive relations with most of our neighbors and has brought cooperation to the forefront. We established new mechanisms for cooperation, such as the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council, and abolished barriers in order to pave the way for further economic cooperation. We also lifted visa requirements in order to ensure more people-to-people contact and create cooperation that forges a common and positive regional identity. In other words, we tried to lift obstacles in order to form more cooperation, interaction, and welfare in our region. Of course, no one expects every problem to be solved overnight; circumstances constantly change. Moreover, relationships are inherently two sided, which indicates that the outcome of efforts toward improving ties and enhancing cooperation depends on the attitudes of many. Our relations with Israel, Syria, and Armenia should be viewed from this perspective. The current difficulties do not arise from Turkey's lack of determination to resolve problems, but rather from the policies of these countries, which are outside of our control. However, we are determined to work toward zero problems, as we believe that in the long run these efforts will lay the groundwork for solving problems.</p><h4>What is Turkey's strategy to use water as a catalyst for cooperation rather than conflict?</h4><p>One of the main principles of Turkey's water policy is to utilize its water resources in an optimal manner through cooperation among states. We are working to create the necessary environment of confidence so that we can share the benefits of water with our neighbors. To this end, Turkey has introduced modern irrigation technology and water-efficient cropping techniques as well as water conservation in urban areas. We have also built multi-purpose water infrastructure, including improved storage capacity, which is essential in arid and semi-arid regions.</p><h4>To what extent do energy imports determine relations with neighboring countries—Iran in particular?</h4><p>Turkey is geographically located in close proximity to around 72% of the world's proven gas and around 73% of its oil reserves, in particular those of the Middle East and the Caspian Basin. Constituting a natural energy bridge between the source countries and consumer markets, Turkey meets a major portion of its oil and natural gas supplies directly from its neighbors, mainly Russia, Iraq, and Iran. Safe, secure, sustainable, and affordable energy remains a priority for the country. Therefore, Turkey attaches great importance to source and route diversification. Energy constitutes one of the most important dimensions of our bilateral economic and trade relations with Iran. Being a major regional oil and natural gas supplier, Iran has been an important energy partner for Turkey, based on our mutual commercial interests.</p><h4>Is there a conflict in fostering relations with Europe and the US as well as the Middle East and China?</h4><p>Turkey greatly values its alliance with the Euro-Atlantic community. Our membership in NATO and strategic relations with the US and other Western partners in Europe constitute a fundamental pillar of our foreign policy. However, this is in no way an obstacle to enhance our relations with every other country in our region. On the contrary, Turkey's multi-faceted and multi-dimensional ties with countries in both the East and West complement each other in a mutually reinforcing manner. In other words, our relations with one region or one country are by no means an alternative to others. The fact that Turkey has good relations with Middle Eastern countries makes the country an asset for the EU, a region with which we share common goals and principles. Turkey's accession process to the EU and active dialogue with the Euro-Atlantic community increases Turkey's credibility and added value to its neighbors and partners in the East. Increasing the level of economic cooperation with as many countries as possible has become an important priority for the country. This is among the reasons why we have increased our cooperation and engagement over a vast geography, including the emerging powers of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, all of which have become important partners for us.</p><h4>What role do you envision Turkey playing in Africa?</h4><p>Turkish-African cooperation has gained momentum in recent years, and Africa today has become a strong component of Turkish foreign policy. Turkey has become a strategic partner for Africa through decisions made at the 10th African Union Summit in January 2008. In the context of our efforts to deepen our relations with the continent, we have opened 19 new embassies in Sub-Saharan Africa since May 2009. This has brought the number of the Turkish embassies on the continent to 31. This figure will reach 34 by the end of 2012. Our businessmen and entrepreneurs are becoming increasingly active in all corners of Africa, and trade volume with the continent grew to $17.1 billion in 2011, $7 billion of which was with sub-Saharan countries.</p><h4>As Turkey celebrates its 60th year as a member of the NATO Alliance, what do you believe is the significance of its membership in this region?</h4><p>Turkey's membership in NATO is an integral part of its global identity. NATO, as a unique forum for Euro-Atlantic security, also provides Turkey with the opportunity to put forward its views and expectations regarding regional and international security issues, as well as have a strong impact on transatlantic initiatives. In this new international system with many political or economic threats and challenges, I believe that NATO has the necessary capabilities to move beyond crisis management to the setting of a new international order, based on cooperative security combined with soft power instruments. Security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area and the Middle East are closely linked to each other. Turkey takes the lead in the development of NATO's relations with countries in the Middle East through partnership mechanisms such as the Mediterranean Dialogue and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI). We will continue to add value to NATO's outreach in the future. Today, Turkey not only takes part in missions and operations for collective defense and crisis management purposes, but also mobilizes its increasing “soft power," using its deep historical ties with populations and countries in the Middle East and North Africa.</p><h4>Turkey has taken over the Chairmanship of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) for 2010-2012. What are Turkey's strategic goals regarding its relations with the nations of Central Asia?</h4><p>CICA is an Asian organization bringing together strategic countries stretching from Turkey to the Republic of Korea. Therefore, during its chairmanship of CICA, Turkey aims to foster an atmosphere of dialogue in Asia. Turkey believes that the establishment of an environment of trust in Asia constitutes a priority in maintaining peace in the world. With 24 member states, CICA carries the potential to be among the most important international organizations of the future, particularly taking into consideration the recent economic developments in Asia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-investment-agenda]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Did ISPAT meet its targets for FDI in 2011? What goals are in place for 2012, and what strategy is in place to achieve them?</h4><p>Turkey attracted around $16 billion of FDI in 2011, which was a 76% increase compared to 2010. We were very optimistic at the beginning of 2011, expecting $12 billion-$15 billion in FDI and we were able to meet our target. We are confident that we will surpass these figures in 2012. International institutions and global investors are very sanguine about Turkey's potential to attract FDI. For example, according to the IMF's projections, Turkey is expected to attract more than $110 billion worth of FDI over the next five years. Turkey ranks as the 13th most attractive and confident investment destination in the world in 2012, according to the Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, a survey conducted by A.T. Kearney among multinational companies. We are developing specific strategies for certain countries, investors, and sectors. Furthermore, we are detailing these studies and customizing them according to Turkey's needs.</p><h4>What opportunities does Turkey's high-tech education initiative, the Fatİh Project, offer foreign investors?</h4><p>The Fatİh Project is full of opportunities for technology companies thanks to its large scale and high market value. Spanning four years, the Fatİh Project envisions the utilization of cutting-edge educational technology to increase the quality of public education. This involves equipping pre-school, primary, and secondary school students with tablet PCs and classrooms with smart electronic boards. The project is estimated to create a market of about $7 billion over the first four years. The Fatİh Project presents opportunities on such a scale that a technology firm can potentially leap ahead of its competitors. At least 15 million tablet PCs will be distributed to students nationwide within the first four years, and this will be followed by the introduction of at least 1.5 million units per year afterward. The project includes the installation of smart boards and touch panel LCDs in 620,000 classrooms. Foreign investors can both contribute to and benefit from such a promising project.</p><h4>The Turkish economy is projected to grow at a slower rate in 2012. How do you expect this to impact the level of FDI?</h4><p>The Turkish economy has been robustly growing in recent years, with 9.2% growth in 2010 and 8.5% in 2011, thus becoming one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The official estimate for Turkey's economic growth in 2012 is comparatively moderate. The Turkish government expects 4% growth in 2012 and 5% in 2013. These figures are very close to the OECD's recent assessment, according to which Turkey is set to grow by 3.3% in 2012 and 4.6% in 2013. The economic slowdown is a concern not only for Turkey but also for the global economy. In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the IMF predicted that the global economy would grow by 3.5% in 2012, down from 3.8% in 2011, while the eurozone will contract by 0.3% after expanding by 1.4% in 2011, and the EU 27 will barely grow. Similarly, emerging and developing economies are expected to grow by 5.7% in 2012, down from 6.2% in 2011. These predictions are mainly due to the economic uncertainty following the eurozone debt crisis. However, once the dust settles, the world economy will be back on track, and Turkey will continue to grow robustly. We don't expect that it will have a negative impact on the level of FDI, as the nature of FDI is based on long-term outlooks rather than short-term business cycles. Meanwhile, in the medium and long run, Turkey is expected to grow robustly. According to the OECD, Turkey is expected to grow by 6.7% between 2011 and 2017, standing out as the fastest growing economy amongst the OECD members. Therefore, global investors are investing in the future of Turkey, a country that is promising growth and more business opportunities.</p><h4>What is the anticipated impact of the new Turkish Commercial Code (TCC) on M&amp;A activity?</h4><p>The new TCC is a landmark development in the country's commercial life. It aligns Turkey's business legislation with international standards, in particular with EU legislation, by incorporating internationally accepted accounting standards into domestic legislation, increasing the transparency of enterprises and preventing unfair competition. The new law will revolutionize Turkish business life and change the dynamics of M&amp;As in Turkey. Company mergers, divisions, and conversions are all regulated in accordance with EU law. The law will radically boost auditing standards and transparency, eventually increasing the number of investment and acquisition targets in the M&amp;A market. In a recent survey among corporate executives, private equity practitioners, financial advisors, and legal advisors based in Turkey, around 92% said that the new TCC would play a crucial role in facilitating M&amp;A activity.</p><h4>Which sectors offer the most opportunity for investment in 2012?</h4><p>Abundant investment opportunities are available in many sectors, ranging from energy, finance, automotive, ICT, food and beverage, agriculture, renewable energy, iron and steel, to petrochemicals and real estate. More opportunities will come with the realization of Turkey's ambitious targets for 2023, the centennial celebration of the foundation of the republic. Turkey has set specific targets to achieve by 2023, from health care to the economy and from defense to education. The country has several aims: to become one of the world's top 10 economies with a GDP of $2 trillion; to increase its export volume to $500 million; to upgrade the country's energy, transportation, and health infrastructure through the construction of hospital cities; to more than double electricity generation; and to build new bridges on the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits. It is also a national target for Turkey to make Istanbul an international financial center. Having been tested by the global economic crisis, Turkey has one of the most solid and promising financial sectors in the region. The Turkish government's Istanbul International Finance Center (IFC) project offers global companies a chance to run their regional financial operations through Istanbul thanks to various incentives, a skilled workforce, and a global, cosmopolitan city with a vibrant local economy.</p><h4>What investment incentives can ISPAT highlight?</h4><p>In addition to promising sectorial opportunities, global investors can also benefit from lucrative incentives, including favorable tax deductions, special investment zones, exclusive R&amp;D and innovation support, and staff training. What we would like to highlight is that Turkey has recently introduced a new incentives scheme that aims to cure Turkey's current account deficit. Investments in sectors with considerable trade deficits are viewed as strategically important and thus will be supported throughout Turkey, especially through the new regional and sectorial incentive system. Similarly, large-scale investments with high value-added are also supported. Moreover, regionally offered incentives create more opportunities for investors. Another unique incentive Turkey presents to global investors is the service offered by ISPAT, the official organization for promoting Turkey's investment opportunities to the global business community and providing assistance to investors before, during, and after their entry into Turkey. The agency serves as a reference and a contact point for all global investors by linking them with both the government and businesses in Turkey. All of our services come free of charge, and they include providing market information, site selection, B2B meetings, and coordination with relevant governmental institutions, as well as facilitating legal procedures and applications, such as establishing companies, incentive applications, and obtaining licenses and work permits.</p><h4>Which legislative reforms will have the most  impact on Turkey's investment environment?</h4><p>Turkey has already reformed its investment environment; all bureaucratic hurdles have been removed, investment procedures have been streamlined, and red tape has been reduced. The Coordination Council for the Improvement of the Investment Climate (YOİKK) was specifically established for this purpose. The Council continues to work to improve the investment climate in line with global developments. A new draft law regulating the real estate sector in Turkey is currently pending approval from Parliament. Once enacted, this law will boost foreign investment in the Turkish real estate sector, which is one of the most attractive in the world. Turkey ranks as the third most attractive real estate investment destination among emerging countries in 2012, according to a survey conducted by the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate. Istanbul's rapid rise as a lucrative property investment location has left behind the likes of London, Paris, and Madrid, with the city emerging as the top growth market in Europe's real estate industry, according to “Emerging Trends in Real Estate Europe," a survey conducted jointly by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and the Urban Land Institute (ULI).</p><h4>Is Turkey seeing increased interest from South America, China, and the GCC region? What areas are seeing the most investment?</h4><p>The recent global financial crisis, which deeply affected the world's economy, has also changed the landscape of global FDI. Until very recently, more than half of global FDI was flowing to advanced economies; however, for the first time, more than half of global FDI went to developing economies in 2010, and this trend continued in 2011. Another change in the nature of global FDI is that some emerging economies such as the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries and GCC states have been emerging as new sources of global FDI. In such a changing global environment, the nature of FDI inflows to Turkey has also changed. The EU is still dominating FDI inflows to Turkey, but its share decreased from 86% in 2004 to 71% in 2011, while other countries have been increasing their investments in Turkey. For example, by the end of 2010, the stock value of GCC region FDI in Turkey exceeded $13 billion, up from $234 million in 2002. Russia and Azerbaijan have also increased their investments in Turkey; just last year we received $700 million from Russia and $1.2 billion from Azerbaijan alone. US companies have also been boosting their investments in Turkey, investing around $1.4 billion in 2011, which corresponds to a 334% year-on-year increase. Similarly, we have recently witnessed a greenfield investment by Indian investors and M&amp;A activities from Chinese investors. They are all investing in a rapidly growing and promising Turkey. The sectorial breakdown of FDI inflows indicates that the country is attracting more production-based investments, which heavily contribute to the economy. For example, Turkey attracted $4.3 billion to the energy sector in 2011 and $3.4 billion to the manufacturing sector. Petrochemicals alone attracted $1.2 billion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>DHL Express Turkey continues growing rapidly in the country, despite the challenging global economic conditions. Our journey in Turkey started in 1981, and led us along a path to offer comprehensive services to our customers in many different industries, such as textiles, banking, IT, automotive, and construction. We cover a geography of 44 cities. We work through 16 service centers and 13 agency points, with more than 700 expert staff. DHL Express Turkey is a successful example of management in terms of fulfilling the objectives and expectations of the DPDHL group, in areas such as sales and business development, customer relationship management, operational excellence, and employee satisfaction. We therefore stand as one of the key markets among 220 countries in DHL's global network. We position ourselves as a company strongly contributing to Turkey's high growth rate by addressing the needs and expectations of local companies and helping them become efficient exporters as they operate in international markets.<br></p><p>We always work hard to go above and beyond the achievement levels of the axis of our services by investing heavily in infrastructure, our employees, and the DHL brand, as well as expanding our capacity. Undoubtedly, such a customer-oriented business approach coupled with a corporate culture based on a “can-do" spirit results in success and shareholder value. In Turkey, we have a market share of over 50%, and we want to sustain this leading position in the industry by continuing to be the provider, employer, and investment of choice.</p><h4>TRAFFIC AS A BAROMETER</h4><p>Like a barometer that keeps a track of climate change, our traffic is a major indicator of foreign trade at large. By carrying the largest number of documents and order-generating samples for local exporters, we are paving the way for the larger cargo movements that follow. In this manner, we monitor the pulse of business. As is already well known by the Turkish public and the country's business circles, Turkey has set an ambitious export volume target of $500 billion by 2023. This objective has come in addition to Turkey's already groundbreaking economic performance over the past eight years, which has turned the country into one of the world's major emerging nations. Considering its economic power, demographic dynamism, and political influence, I believe that Turkey will remain a focus country and a bridge between cultures, religions, and trade zones.</p><h4>CLOSE TO EUROPE</h4><p>In international trade, it is very important that samples are delivered quickly, safely, and undamaged to their destinations. Especially after the crisis in 2008, Turkey has been able hold its position against China as a location of production. In comparison to China, Turkey can produce both small- and mid-scale orders, as well as dispatch them more quickly, thanks to its geographic proximity to Europe. At this point, we make door-to-door deliveries to almost every postal code in Europe with equal efficiency. Banking documents are extremely important for exporters as they fund their transactions. We contribute greatly to this process by transporting these documents in a timely and safe manner. Among others, the automotive industry has become the leading sector of Turkey in recent years.</p><p>Managing these streams on time is more than crucial in the production phase. We are happy to see our operational power and reach contributing to the development of the Turkish automotive industry in various links of the supply chain, from parts to finished products.</p><h4>ACTIVE PARTNER</h4><p>DHL Express Turkey has always been an active partner in development. The company has long aligned customs rules and practices regarding the function of air express service providers in Turkey with those of the EU and US by taking various initiatives and becoming a pilot institution. In doing so, we test new developments and systems before they are introduced officially to the industry. The transition to Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) at Turkish customs was one example of DHL Express Turkey as a pilot company, not only volunteering to test the new IT system at the site, but also facilitating the entire process by sharing the company's technical know-how and global experience with the related government authorities.</p><h4>DYNAMISM FOR SMEs</h4><p>SMEs, as in many other economies of the world, form a dynamic core of Turkish industry and trade. This dynamism automatically reflects the role and contribution to the development of Turkish exports as well. Although they are very agile in adapting themselves to new production processes and finding innovative ways of reaching out to new foreign buyers, this particular segment of customers generally needs support in areas such as global sales and marketing experience, customer relationship management (CRM), IT systems, foreign trade financing, and corporate governance. DHL Express Turkey has always recognized the special needs and expectations of Turkish SMEs, and has come to position its core service offering for SMEs in a way that extends pricing flexibility for each geographic zone, country, and weight. In addition, we support SME export efforts by providing these companies with state-of-the-art packaging such as Textile Express, which is a specially designed box or tube for textile samples, Bottle Express for samples containing liquids, Stone Express for marble, mosaic, and porcelain samples, and Worldwide Medical Express (WMX), a temperature-controlled box system for blood and tissue samples for medical diagnostics. This adds value to our customers' own offerings by professionally displaying their products to potential buyers in various parts of the world. DHL Fair Express enables our clients to take part in major international fairs and exhibitions with ease and efficiency, where we offer specialized delivery solutions at very reasonable costs in addition to a group of expert DHL employees being physically available for support at fairgrounds. These representatives are able to solve all types of problems easily. DHL Gift Express is a catalogue product that allows customers to ship corporate gifts for their existing and potential customers overseas, which enhances their CRM efforts at the international level. Through the preparation and launch of corporate social responsibility campaigns such as “Buy now from Turkey," with stickers on our shipments carrying a campaign slogan, artwork, and coordinates of business-sourcing websites, DHL Express is serving first and foremost Turkish SMEs, to sell their products throughout the world. Last but not least, through the DHL Academy we intend to train local SME employees about various topics in the management of international trade and global marketing. This is a platform in which we share our global expertise and know-how on global trade with our customers to better prepare them as they compete with rivals in the global market.</p><h4>RISING TREND</h4><p>The current leading trend in the world is that economic growth is moving from the advanced economies to the emerging economies, led by Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). Turkey is one of these emerging economies, and considering the country's developments in recent years, I can say with confidence that in addition to its traditional foreign trade partners of Europe and the US, Turkey has started moving the country's foreign trade operations successfully to emerging economies, especially to its neighboring countries. I believe that Turkey will be more active in the world's rising economies, and begin entertaining a larger share of these newly emerging markets. DHL Express Turkey will do its part to accelerate the economic growth of Turkey and its exporters by connecting the dots on the world map.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent has the eurozone crisis presented an opportunity for Turkish business?</h4><p>The eurozone crisis represents an opportunity for Turkey in the sense that Turkey and a few BRIC countries will be the sites of growth for corporations. However, because of the eurozone crisis, the banks will have to withdraw themselves from Europe as well as the BRIC countries because the European banks have constraints on adequate capital and funding for 2012 and perhaps 2013 as well. It will be negative for Turkey and the BRICs in the sense that they will not be able to borrow as much from the banks, and corporations will not be able to borrow as much from European banks. At the same time, cash-rich corporations can invest in Turkey, because it's a growing country with certain industries that are very attractive for investors. The most prominent is energy.</p><p>The Turkish economy has been called a "catch-up" economy by economists in the sense that a lot of things that have already developed in Western countries are just developing in Turkey. One example is shopping centers and the retail business. These did not exist in Turkey 15 or 20 years ago. Now, these businesses—as well as real estate—are driving Turkey's growth.</p><h4>With inflation now approaching 10%, the current account deficit is, in real terms, the second largest in the world. Is the Turkish economy in danger of overheating?</h4><p>The Turkish economy may have overheated, but I have full confidence in the economic team of our government. They have taken quite a few measures to cool the economy. They are trying to balance what I call the “Bermuda Triangle": the foreign exchange price, the current account deficit, and interest rates. The current account deficit is coming down and the economy is cooling. I think in the last quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 this will be more evident. Turkey cannot manage an $80 billion or $90 billion account deficit, but it can manage a $40 billion to $50 billion deficit. In other words, $50 billion to $60 billion is a maximum, though $40 billion to $50 billion is better. Our energy bill is that much—about $50 billion per year. Our current account deficit should not be more than our energy bill. It should be less than our energy bill. This is how the math works.</p><h4>Fiba Group is investing in energy—especially renewables. Why is this such an attractive market?</h4><p>Energy is one of the most exciting growing businesses here. We're becoming involved with renewable energy, especially wind. Turkey actually has the second highest wind capacity in Europe after Scotland. Germany only has a 25% to 30% wind load factor potential, depending on the location. In Turkey our potential is 35% to 45%. This makes a big difference in the renewable energy business. Turkey also has the second highest solar capacity after Spain. Solar energy technology is still expensive, but it has room to come down. The government doesn't want to subsidize solar energy until technology prices are lower.</p><h4>What is the potential for Turkey to start contributing to renewable energy technology?</h4><p>At the moment, Turkey imports all of the necessary materials. At the same time, some companies in Turkey are beginning to produce the parts. Turkey is making in-roads in this industry. It'll take some time, but production has started. Now, companies are trying to certify the parts with the large companies that assemble these components: GE, Vestas, and Nordex. They have to be internationally certified so that they can use these components in the production of wind plants. This is the stage we are at right now in terms of technology.</p><h4>With the current economic crisis in Europe, how does Fiba Group's Credit Europe Bank stay competitive?</h4><p>Credit Europe Bank operates in several countries, so it has the opportunity to move its business from one country to another in terms of funding and banking. We are fortunate in Russia and in Turkey as they are two growth markets. Russia grew 4.2% in the last nine months, and Turkey grew more than 8%. When a country grows at 5% per year, the banking industry grows by 25% to 30%. Romania is not growing, and we had a bank there as well. We stopped lending there and are currently putting our resources in Russia and Turkey. When you diversify as far as the countries you are invested in, you can come up with the optimal mix.</p><h4>What about Fibabank in Turkey? What role can it play in the very competitive Turkish banking market?</h4><p>The banking market is competitive, but it's also growing and there are a lot of opportunities. Since we just re-entered this market about a year ago, we don't try to do everything. We are only involved in the SME business, commercial business, and client-related treasury activities. We plan to go into retail banking slowly in 2012 when our IT infrastructure is complete. As a commercial bank, you must have very flexible and scalable technology.</p><h4>What do you think that the future of banking technology will be in Turkey?</h4><p>I think the technology of the Turkish banking sector should be commended. The use of technology by Turkish banks ranks among the top two or three in the world. I'm very proud of the fact that Turkish banks are so successful with technology.</p><h4>What do you think drives that success?</h4><p>I think it's the people in the industry. The banking system hires university graduates and trains them to keep up with what's happening in the world. It uses good consultants and technology providers. We have very successful GSM and telecommunications companies, which is very important. Turkcell, Türk Telekom, and Vodafone are some of the leading companies in the world in terms of technology. We have good partners like Cisco and IBM. We can invest in our technological sophistication. The banking industry uses these advisors, consultants, and equipment manufacturers in an effective way.</p><h4>You mentioned university graduates. As the founder of Özyeğin University, what impact will the school have as an entrepreneurial incubator?</h4><p>We don't just try to give our students an academic education, we want them to be extroverted and curious. Between high school and business life, university is a passageway. We want to make that very rewarding. We are the first university that has an undergraduate program in entrepreneurship. I think that the whole world thinks that the saviors of the world economy will be entrepreneurs. If you look at the US, the major companies shed 3 million employees in 2010 because they discovered that during the crisis they can produce the same goods and services with fewer employees. Three million became unemployed from major industrial corporations, and entrepreneurs and small businesses then hired these 3 million. That's why US unemployment is still around the 9% level and it didn't go up. Entrepreneurship in Turkey, in the past two or three years, has grown exponentially. There have been more write-ups, conferences, and articles than in the previous few decades. I think people caught on to this and the government, universities, and private sector have caught on to this as well. I think that universities are the catalyst between the government, the private sector, and entrepreneurs. At Özyeğin University we try to couple with industry, and namely TÜBİTAK, which funds R&amp;D. We also try to encourage students to become entrepreneurs. That's why we have what we call an entrepreneurship factory in the university. Young men and women apply with their projects, and if these projects are found to be worthwhile then successful entrepreneurs and professors mentor them to move their projects forward. If they can reach a level where they can be commercialized, then we find angel investors to support them further. We try to bring their ideas to a more advanced stage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The 18.5% rise in exports between December 2010 and December 2011 to reach $135 billion was unprecedented. What is behind this success?<br></h4><p>In the past, there were no expectations for Turkey; however, now we are looking to the future. There have been huge changes within Turkey and Turkish society. At first, we were fighting a large inflation rate, and nobody could make any long-term investments or plans. Turkey did not attract much FDI. Within the past 10 years, we have achieved a measure of stability, and foreign investors now have trust in Turkey and its businessmen. Inflation rates have dropped, as have interest rates. FDI has doubled in the past eight years. Through both economic and democratic developments, we have a newly created middle class that is more interested in consuming and doing business by exporting Turkish goods. Also, another very important factor is our application to become a member of the EU, and part of the process is meeting the Maastricht Criteria. Compared to some other countries in Europe, Turkey is far ahead in those criteria. In addition, Turkey is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.</p><h4>In what areas have exports increased of late?</h4><p>The most significant increase we have seen is in the Iraqi market. We reached about $8.2 billion at the end of 2011, which is a 37% increase from the previous year. Aside from that, the country we exported to most in 2011 was Germany, at around $13.8 billion, which marks a 10% increase. The top countries we export to are Germany, Iraq, Italy, France, Russia, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands, and Iran.</p><h4>Given that five of your top export destinations are in the eurozone, what sort of an impact do you think will be seen on Turkish exports over 2012?</h4><p>There might be some difficulties over 2012, and that is why we are trying to open up new markets. We are shifting focus somewhat to areas such as Africa and the Asia-Pacific, including China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Taiwan, and also Latin America. These are our new target markets. In 2010 we were able to send trade delegations to over 30 countries with the President, the Prime Minister, and the Minister of Economy. In 2011, we made trips to 17 different countries and during those visits we conducted over 30,000 business meetings.</p><h4>With respect to these value-added products, what is the Turkish Exporters Assembly (TİM) doing to support innovation?</h4><p>In order to support innovation, TİM has paid more attention and interest to the R&amp;D, design, and branding side of companies' activities. In order to support our R&amp;D development we are carrying out R&amp;D projects in six different sectors, and we are organizing design competition awards in all exporting sectors. We are going to build on these efforts throughout 2012.</p><h4>And within those six sectors that you have identified to concentrate on R&amp;D, which would you say has the most potential to be realized?</h4><p>The foremost is automotive, then chemicals, machinery, food processing, ready-to-wear textiles, and electronics. The automotive sector doesn't have good growth projections for 2012, as its main market is the EU. In that regard, manufacturers are working to maintain their present sales figures, which total around $20 billion.</p><h4>What impact will Turkey's shifting foreign policy focus have on Turkish exports?</h4><p>In the short term, we are experiencing some difficulties, especially with Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and Syria, as they had been some of our main markets. However, our exports are already starting to recover in Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia. We believe that human rights and the welfare of the people are more important issues than exports or economic figures right now, and that if democracy can flourish then it will be better for all of us economically in the long term. Turkish businessmen currently have around $2 billion worth of investments in Egypt, they create jobs for over 50,000 Egyptians, and 90% of their production is exported from Egypt, meaning this is also supporting the Egyptian economy in export terms. We hope that this is going to be the same for Libya and Syria.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The IMF has predicted that Turkey's rate of growth will be 2.5% in 2012, contrary to competing forecasts. What would you say is behind the difference in projections?<br></h4><p>We project 2.5% for 2012, which is close to the market consensus. The authorities in their recent Medium-term Program project 4%, so there has been some debate about whether we have a different view on Turkey's economic prospects. To this I would say two things. One is that Turkey sees very large swings in GDP. In 2007, real GDP growth was about 5%, in 2008 it was 0.5%, and in 2009 it was -5%, while in 2010 it was over 9%, and we project close to 8% for 2011. With these types of swings, the difference between 2.5% and 4% is not very much. In other countries that have much more stable GDP growth, the difference between 2.5% and 4% is more dramatic, but in Turkey it is less so. The second point is that compared to observers with higher GDP estimates, our projections reflect important concerns about Europe and the external environment, as well as a need to see Turkey's current account deficit decline, which we project to happen in 2012. It's also worth saying that in terms of estimates for 2012, there are other estimates that project even slower growth than the IMF.</p><h4>How would you assess government measures to address the current account deficit?</h4><p>The current account deficit does need to come down and that's in Turkey's long-term interests because the higher the current account deficit, the more financing is needed, and more financing means more debt in the system. Eventually you don't want the external debt, in this case of the private sector, to build up too rapidly or too high. Otherwise, it becomes a risk. In terms of the policies the authorities have implemented, there has been some success. More may be needed, and we hope it succeeds. Public finances here are strong, public debt is falling, and the government deficit is improving. From a macroeconomic perspective, public finances could probably do more to boost government savings, which would help to manage domestic demand and thus reduce the current account deficit. A second actor is the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA). It has taken some steps to control areas where credit increase and borrowing is increasing very rapidly, and those steps have been effective, but there may be additional things it could do. In terms of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT), there may be steps it can take also. It has taken useful steps to tighten liquidity conditions recently and obviously policy will need to adjust based on how economic conditions evolve.</p><h4>Do you support the CBRT's unorthodox monetary policy?</h4><p>Much of what it has done has been successful in containing the particular pressures that Turkey faces. The authorities' approach has been going on for about a year and a half now and the challenges and the global environment has shifted. Earlier, there was a problem of how to manage large capital inflows, and then the current account deficit. Later, the authorities became concerned about growth, and now the issue is inflation and the exchange rate. The CBRT has adjusted its policies to address the challenges as they change, and I think that it has had some success with that in what is a very difficult environment. From our standpoint, we would just encourage it to remain vigilant, and as conditions change be ready to use all of its policy tools, which it hasn't used yet. It hasn't used the one-week repo rate, which is a key tool and one of its principal tools, and it has been reluctant to use it. In particular, we would see a return to the single policy rate in the near future as helpful for reducing uncertainty in the economy and boosting financial sector development. There are times when that has been difficult to do, but there have been times more recently when it might have helped.</p><h4>Can Turkey become the world's 10th biggest economy by 2023?</h4><p>It is possible, but will require important increases in savings and investment and an acceleration of structural reforms to boost productivity in the economy. From the IMF's 2011 Article IV Consultation, I would highlight that economic performance has been strong, and macroeconomic policies have generally been good. Turkey has demonstrated its ability to adjust to a difficult and changing external environment. Looking ahead from a macroeconomic perspective, it will be important to use fiscal policy as a demand management tool to manage domestic economic conditions. Continued vigilance on inflation will be important as will continued strong supervision of the financial sector. The financial sector is in good shape, but we want to make sure it remains that way. Finally, structural reforms to boost the competitiveness and productivity of the Turkish economy will be essential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have announced that you're anticipating 4% GDP growth in 2012. What steps are being taken to ensure a “soft landing"?<br></h4><p>We have taken a number of measures to manage the “soft landing," which entails a combination of decent growth and the narrowing of the current account deficit. After the global economic crisis, Turkey staged a very strong recovery. In 2010, we experienced 9.2% real GDP growth, followed by 8.5% in 2011. The recovery coincided with a relatively weak external backdrop. The sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone, our main export destination, constrained Turkey's export growth. The Arab Spring, while positive in the long term, also weakened our external position. Another cyclical factor contributing to the current account deficit has been rising commodity prices. In 2012, we are hoping that the gap will begin to narrow from 10% of GDP to around 8%. As far as growth is concerned, we are forecasting a more modest 4%. Turkey has created a net 3.7 million jobs since 2007. In 2011 alone, 1.5 million jobs were created. This is supportive of continued growth.</p><h4>In policy terms, how do you plan to offset the external variables that are driving up the current account deficit?</h4><p>First we have taken measures to moderate the pace of domestic demand and rebalance growth. This should cap the current account deficit. Unfortunately, rising international oil and gas prices are given to us. In 2011, Turkey's oil and gas import bill was about $54 billion. Higher oil prices are likely to increase the bill further, and there isn't too much we can do about it.</p><p>In the medium-to-long term, we have a well-thought strategy in place to deal with the current account deficit. We are boosting R&amp;D spending to move up the value chain. We are making better use of local and renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydro, and solar power. We are also in the process of developing nuclear power sources.</p><h4>What is your reform agenda?</h4><p>We are now looking at making the labor market more flexible, which is critical to boosting employment, reducing informality, and increasing prosperity.</p><p>We are also working on financial sector reform. This entails the provision of more incentives to increase savings and strengthen Istanbul's position as a regional financial center. We will also make it easier for asset management and capital assets to develop in Turkey, sparking the addition of more listed companies. We just announced measures to increase incentives for private pensions, venture capital, and business angels.</p><p>We adopted a new Commercial Code, which comes into effect in 2012. The reform is very important for SMEs and other Turkish companies to produce financial reports that meet international standards, become more transparent, and make it easier to establish a business. This is an important micro-level reform that should help Turkish companies' access to credit and increase scale.</p><p>We are also working on education reforms. Parliament has recently approved a bill increasing the length of compulsory education to 12 years. The average length of schooling for the population above 25 is only 6.5 years. In other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the average is 11 years. We want to boost the compulsory education period to 12 years, and this is a very critical priority. We are also working on income tax reform, scheduled to be submitted to the parliament in the first half of 2012. This includes a new investment incentive scheme, which aims to narrow the developmental gap between different regions and bridge the gap for strategic sectors that have large account or trade deficits.</p><h4>In 2012 you are targeting TL10 billion in privatization revenue after stalled projects in the last two years. Is the market ready this year?</h4><p>We consider privatizations as an important structural reform. Our focus is on increasing market efficiency. That's why we have prioritized the divestiture of energy assets. It is true that over the past year we have failed to attain our revenue targets. Companies could not come up with the financing. It was a market-driven issue, and targets were not met because of the inability of companies to deliver on their commitments. In 2012, we have another ambitious target, reflected by the privatizations that were concluded and are still waiting for the transfer of payments. Another portion of the figure is reflected by transactions we hope to complete in 2012. The energy sector remains a priority; we are not doing them simply because we need revenues. We treat them as structural reforms.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the competitive strengths of your firm's legal practice in Turkey?<br></h4><p>Paksoy is one of the leading independent law firms in Turkey and enjoys an extensive competitive edge over its rivals through its excellent reputation, strong relationship with clients and regulators, and its vast experience in a broad array of legal issues related to foreign investment transactions. The firm has over 40 fee earners, along with experienced senior partners and members who have the skill and ability to deliver robust, creative, and result-oriented advice to clients. A solid testimony to its transactional capabilities is Paksoy's representation of high-profile investors in big-ticket, cross-border transactions since its inception in 1997. With an excellent track record, extensive resources, tenacity, and organizational skills, Paksoy has proven its ability as a full-service law firm to provide advice in a broad range of sectors and issues, acting as a one-stop shop for its clients as a result of its diversified practice groups such as corporate and M&amp;A, employment, energy, infrastructure, finance, regulatory issues, competition, securities, tax, and dispute resolution. Our experienced team of lawyers with in-depth knowledge and hands-on capabilities in various sectors, including financial services, energy, tax, and securities, are able to provide the best know-how and legal solutions for complex transactions.</p><h4>What have been some of the flagship transactions your firm has been involved in?</h4><p>We have acted for many high-profile and complex transactions in a wide spectrum, some of which have been extensively covered in the international media. These include Amgen's acquisition of a controlling stake in Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals in a competitive tender process worth $700 million; Turkish PE Turkven's acquisition of a 50% stake in Koton, a leading Turkish textile retailer with over 300 outlets; and US Dow Chemical's major joint venture planned in carbon-fiber production with an investment worth $1 billion. In the financial arena we acted for US insurance giant MetLife in its acquisition of a controlling stake in Deniz Emeklilik, a Turkish pension company, in a competitive process worth ‚¬162 million; the first direct Eurobond offering from a Turkish bank, Akbank; a 144A and Reg S $500 million 5.75% five-year Eurobond offering from VakıfBank, the first ever senior unsecured bond offering from a deposit-taking state bank; a Reg S sukuk offering from Kuveyt Türk, a participation bank, which marks the first ever sukuk offering from a Turkish entity; ArcelorMittal's sale of shares and a series of warrants in respect of shares in the Turkish steelmaker Erdemir by way of an offering; and Citigroup's sale of a 10% stake in Akbank, off the exchange.</p><h4>What are the strengths and challenges of Turkey's regulatory environment for foreign investment?</h4><p>In the last decade, Turkey has adopted an investor-friendly attitude to all foreign and domestic businesses, having ratified several significant regulatory changes, such as the liberalization of markets, while easing red tape, formalities, and procedures in setting up companies as well as improving corporate governance standards. The Turkish government and regulators of various sectors including telecommunications, media, securities, and banking enacted significant regulations to ensure and oversee a reliable, transparent, and efficient market for investors. These were very positive steps taken along the way by Turkish lawmakers and watchdogs, to improve the country's legal, tax, and regulatory framework in a vast array of sectors, thus facilitating an investment environment aligned with EU standards. Therefore, since the early 2000s, we have witnessed an increasing flow of foreign investment in grand capacities in almost every sector, creating a substantial business potential parallel to Turkey's economic growth average of 5%.</p><h4></h4><h4>What is your outlook for M&amp;A activity in Turkey?</h4><p>The first half of 2012 has proven to be very positive with increasing activity in M&amp;A despite the financial and political predicament in eurozone countries, including Turkey's main trading partners, such as Greece, Italy, and Spain. I expect more M&amp;A activity by private equity and strategic investors from all over the globe, and particularly from countries such as China, Korea, and Japan, in the second half of the year, with incrementally more of a focus on energy, infrastructure, financial services, and retail.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the resilience of the Turkish banking sector?<br></h4><p>Thanks to solid capital cushions, lack of exposure to toxic assets, prudent regulatory oversight, and a flexible liquidity management framework, the banking sector was able to support the rapid recovery in the aftermath of the Lehman crisis. Lately, as the worries surrounding European banks regarding the tightening strains on funding and capital adequacy escalate, Turkish banks remain relatively safe from these concerns. Despite having close financial connections with the European banking sector, Turkish banks could comfortably roll over their external debt in excess of 100%. Turkish banks enjoy a large domestic market, rapid population growth, and low penetration, providing reasonable growth prospects. In addition, the new policy mix implemented by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) led to the longer maturity of banking system liabilities and supported financial stability via tools used to restrain excessive credit growth. These prudent policies will serve as a buffer in the face of rapidly changing global market conditions.</p><h4>What steps is the CBRT taking to mitigate excessive exchange rate volatility?</h4><p>The depreciation of the Turkish lira observed until August 2011 was initiated by the new policy mix of low short-term rates and high reserve requirements. This has contributed significantly to our export competitiveness, the rebalancing of the economy, and the normalization of the current account deficit. Following escalating concerns on financial strains in Europe around August 2011, international investors resorted to the safe haven of US-dollar assets. This trend led to a rapid depreciation in all emerging market currencies and a further undesired depreciation of the Turkish lira. The policy measures taken by the CBRT since August have alleviated the adverse effects of global fluctuations on the Turkish economy, which emerged in parallel to uncertainties in the European economy. The CBRT's measures regarding foreign exchange liquidity and decisions related to hikes in the interest rate corridor in August and October reduced the extent of volatility in the exchange rate compared to that of other emerging market economies.</p><h4>Turkey's current account deficit is a noted concern for foreign investors. Can the deficit be reasonably reduced and sustained at a level to moderate these concerns?</h4><p>The outcome of the policy measures that we have taken so far is becoming more visible, as can be seen through recent data releases. The rebalancing between domestic and external demand is ongoing as envisaged. Final domestic demand is decelerating and the contribution of net external demand to growth is increasing. Accordingly, the rebalancing process and the improvement in the current account deficit is expected to continue in the coming months.</p><h4>Foreign investors around the world are apprehensive about the possibility of a new financial crisis in the international market. How do you reassure them that Turkey is a secure place for investment?</h4><p>Solid fundamentals, robust growth, and prudent macroeconomic and financial sector policies could be the key for a successful de-coupling of emerging market economies in 2012. For the Turkish economy in particular, we think the 4% growth of the Medium Term Plan for this year is achievable thanks to the success of our exporters through improved market diversification and enhanced competitiveness provided by the exchange rates. Considering the monetary policy measures taken to bring inflation back to its 5% target, the rebalancing of external and domestic demand, a robust financial system, and prudent policies, Turkey will continue to perform well in 2012.</p><h4>What are your monetary policy priorities looking forward?</h4><p>Policies implemented by the CBRT since the last quarter of 2010 have mitigated macro financial risks and contributed to the rebalancing of the economy. Still, the intensification of the financial turmoil in August 2011 led to excessive volatility in emerging market currencies and created inflationary pressures despite a global slowdown. In order to prevent the worsening of the price setting behavior due to surging inflation, the CBRT has delivered strong monetary tightening since October 2011. Accordingly, the interest rate corridor was widened upward and the cost of funding provided to the market was raised significantly. Moreover, with the aim of minimizing the adverse effects of abrupt changes in capital flows due to uncertainties regarding the global economic outlook, a flexible liquidity management strategy was designed and implemented. These measures limited the excessive depreciation of the Turkish lira while containing inflation expectations. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability while preserving financial stability as a supplementary objective. The CBRT will do its best to mitigate the adverse effects of volatility in capital flows.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the impact of the eurozone crisis on the Turkish financial sector?</h4><p>During the year 2011, some of the eurozone countries have struggled with sovereign debt crises, which was something like a perfect storm. Turkey has close economic ties with Europe, especially Germany. Despite having close links with eurozone countries, Turkey has weathered the storm quite well, just like it did during the previous episode of global financial crisis in 2008. I believe, however, that the negative impact of the crisis will be observed in 2012, and the economy will experience a “soft landing." In this context, Turkey exceeded growth expectations in 2010 and 2011. In 2011, Turkey's economy grew by 8.3%, demonstrating that the country is capable of growing as strongly as China and will experience much better GDP growth than the BRIC countries' average going forward. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve provided a large amount of liquidity to the financial system aimed at improving market conditions and supporting confidence in wider economies. It is highly probable that extra liquidity in the Western financial system may improve the situation there and, also, have a positive impact on emerging markets in the form of fund inflows.</p><h4>How effective were the 2001 banking reforms for state banks such as Halkbank?</h4><p>In the aftermath of the 2001 financial crisis in Turkey, we established the best supervision system of its kind—the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA). Both the functions of regulation and supervision have been equally focused on by the BRSA over the last decade, and it has manifested itself through banking reform and restructuring. The state banks were particular victims of the financial crisis in 2001. They incurred heavy losses and were deprived of capital during this crisis. Post-crisis restructuring made these banks much more effective in terms of adherence to market practices. Previously, the state banks were subject to public law, and they now enjoy private legislation. Only after new regulations and a restructuring process could the state banks compete with their private peers. More competition in the financial system made it much more resilient. Additionally, there have also been some newly adopted regulations that required banks to collect much more capital and liquidity, abolishing bad lending practices at the same time. More prudent and conservative policies were also adopted by the BRSA to prevent currency mismatches in the financial system. The Basel Committee on Banking is currently updating its approach toward capital requirements. The BRSA has always been cautious in terms of capital, and this strategy paid off, especially during and after the global financial crisis.</p><h4>Halkbank has a strong history of serving tradesmen, artisans, and SMEs. What trends can you identify with regards to business growth?</h4><p>Halkbank was established in 1938 with the mission of providing services to SMEs, including artisans and craftsmen. We have focused on this segment for more than 70 years, and now the Halkbank brand is associated with SME businesses. The share of SME loans at Halkbank weighs in at 36%, whereas the industry average is 24%. The SME share has decreased, however, due to the substantial growth in overall lending activities in the last couple of years. Many of our SME customers have grown, and are now categorized as commercial or corporate enterprises. We continue to focus on the SME segment—99% of companies in Turkey are considered SMEs, and employment and exports are very much reliant on this segment. We are well positioned as an SME bank; we focus on growth and have an extensive geographic distribution network. Moreover, Halkbank is much better represented in rural areas, where conditions have improved significantly. There are good indicators that income distribution has also improved around the country. We have registered much higher growth due to our proximity to SMEs.</p><h4>What new products does Halkbank offer to increase competition and efficiency?</h4><p>Turkey suffers from a long-lasting current account deficit issue and also a scarcity of savings. We, as financial players, feel obliged to address these problems. Turkey is heavily dependent on energy imports, and that creates a huge bill that swells the deficit. In one way or another, we need to reduce our dependency on energy imports. We are marketing a loan product with favorable conditions for our customer base, which consequently reduces energy consumption and increases savings. In this context, we enjoy close collaboration with international financial institutions such as the European Investment Bank, World Bank, and French Development Agency. We receive a number of loan facilities from these institutions and utilize these funds in servicing our SME customer needs. We are now marketing a variety of loan products and services aimed at supporting energy efficient investment.</p><p>We believe green energy is also crucial for us and deserves support. Turkey enjoys a huge amount of sun, and it is logical that solar energy could well be a substitute for fossil fuel resources. We are doing our part in terms of energy efficiency and renewable energy, by introducing new concepts to the market segments we are involved with. Fortunately, we have sufficient funding available at the moment.</p><h4>What is the current appetite for foreign investment in the Turkish banking sector?</h4><p>Foreign investment participation in the Istanbul Stock Exchange (İMKB) comprises approximately 63%, and has been range-bound for years. When it comes to the banking sector, foreign appetite is much higher. Halkbank launched an IPO in 2007, with approximately 25% of the shares listed on the İMKB. Roughly 70% of the shares were allocated to foreign investors, and after the IPO, the foreign share of investors peaked at about 94% or 95%. As of today, the figure stands at 88%, demonstrating the robust foreign appetite. This is largely due to the low penetration level of the banking sector and the young age of the country, which makes it attractive for investors. Halkbank is one of the best in its class, performing exceptionally well over the course of the past few years. In 2009, we had a return on equity (ROE) of 32.5%, one of the highest figures throughout the world. In 2010 and 2011, we achieved an ROE of 30.5% and 25.4%, respectively, placing us substantially ahead of our peers, which is why foreign investors are happy to invest in Halkbank.</p><h4>What are you expecting for 2012?</h4><p>We are expecting at least 15% asset growth, 18% loan growth, and at least 10% earnings growth. We expect the Turkish economy to grow at about 4% with inflation of about 6%-7%. In this environment, I believe that our targets can be easily achieved.</p><h4>What are your aspirations for the international banking sector?</h4><p>We are striving to increase our international presence. We have a 30% share of Demir-Halk Bank, operating in the Netherlands, as well as an offshore banking unit in Bahrain that we hope to expand. Other opportunities may open up in the Gulf region, but more importantly we have acquired 98% of a bank in Skopje, Macedonia, which has 21 branches, and we are currently working on a merger with Ziraat Bank Skopje, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2012. The Balkan region provides cultural and geographic proximity, and therefore we are planning to expand our operations in other parts of the Balkans; Skopje is just the beginning. We are seeking more opportunities in the region. We will be capitalizing on our strengths in the SME segment, and exporting this success abroad.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you forecast will be the impact of the eurozone crisis on the Turkish financial sector?</h4><p>Turkey's financial markets and banking sector had the ability to not only withstand the effects of the 2001 crisis, but to also recover fairly quickly in 2010 and 2011. Our financial performance made the country home to one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Recently, concerns about debt sustainability in the eurozone have intensified, and there are increased risks regarding global economic activity. During a recession in Europe, the Turkish economy is adversely affected through various channels. The decline in risk appetite is thought to limit capital inflows toward emerging countries, including Turkey. Accordingly, we expect a growth rate of around 3.5% in 2012 for the Turkish economy, which grew 8.5% in 2011. The narrowing of economic growth is also reflected in the financial sector. However, Turkish banks are less reliant on foreign funding than many other emerging markets. As of 2011, customer deposits, the majority of which are domestic, constitute 57.1% of our total liabilities. Compared to 2010, the total funds raised by the banking sector via foreign banks increased by 20.3% in 2011 to $98.2 billion. The amount of loans from abroad increased by $5.8 billion, whereas funds from repo transactions, deposits, and syndicated loans grew by $5.7 billion, $3.7 billion, and $1.6 billion, respectively. However, the volume of securitization loans decreased by $0.9 billion, due to installment payments on principal balances. In terms of credits, the Turkish banking sector performed well thanks to its sound and stable structure, with high capital adequacy ratios. In recent years, long-term credit rollover ratios have stood generally above 100%, with the exception of 2009, when the Turkish banking sector achieved a rollover of slightly lower than 78% of its long-term credits. In 2011, the long-term debt rollover ratio for the Turkish banking system was 177%, which indicates that the problems in the international markets have not yet been reflected on the external financing channel. Considering the fact that countries with a major share in funding are relatively more stable, the rollover ratio of the banking sector is expected to remain at or above 130% in 2012. In terms of short-term funding, we have observed a downward trend in foreign borrowing in the form of syndication and securitization loans since 2008, due to the diversification of funding sources. On the other hand, fundraising via collateralized loans and non-collateralized bilateral loans has registered increases. In 2011, bond issuances in the international markets with maturities of five or more years have been another important tool for widening the funding base. We forecast that this style of financing will expand during 2012. International institutions have been another financing source for funding over the past couple of years. Since 2009, institutions such as the European Investment Bank (EIB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the French Agency for Development (AFD) have supported the private sector in Turkey, with an ongoing emphasis on promoting sustainable energy efficiency, renewable energy, and agribusiness. This funding mechanism has been mainly secured through Turkish local commercial banks. Bearing in mind the possible cost increases, we don't anticipate a sudden stop in short-term funding. So far, İş Bank has not seen any funding difficulties or pressures emanating from eurozone concerns or deleveraging, although there are clear and present risks associated with global risk aversion and the lack of steady funding.</p><h4>Growth in assets and loans in Turkey's banking sector has been projected to slow down, and bank profits are set to decline in 2012. Do you support the unorthodox monetary policies of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT)?</h4><p>With the divergence between domestic and foreign demand conditions, the current account deficit has widened significantly over the post-crisis period. The CBRT stated that financial stability risks were evident as the rapidly increasing current account deficit was fueled by short-term capital inflows. The capital inflows toward Turkey have intensified as the developed economies' central banks have continued their very loose monetary policies. Strong domestic demand coupled with relatively weak foreign demand put pressure on the current account deficit. The CBRT lowered policy rates in order to combat increasing short-term capital inflows, while differentiating the required reserve ratios for lira deposits. This was done according to maturities, in order to slow down credit growth by raising the funding costs of the banks. The CBRT has been following a very active policy in line with the increasing uncertainties in the global markets. The measures taken by the CBRT are effective in decreasing the fragility of the Turkish economy. With its tightening liquidity and financial sector policies, the CBRT aims to minimize risks regarding the current account deficit and inflation. At the same time, by keeping the policy rate low, the CBRT is preventing a potentially hard landing. Naturally, the hike in required reserve ratios puts pressure on profitability. However, we firmly believe that the measures being implemented to slow down the economy had several negative effects on the banking sector in the short term. In the long term, sustaining financial stability is much more important than a slight decline in profitability over the course of one year.</p><h4>What is your view of the regulatory framework for banking in Turkey, and do you anticipate further significant changes in the near future?</h4><p>Turkey has steadily improved its regulatory framework for banking by introducing new regulations in diverse areas since the 2001 crisis. The current regulatory framework ensures that the Turkish banking system complies with international standards. One of the most significant changes to be made in the near future is the transition to the Basel II framework. The change is set to occur in mid-2012, and will fundamentally alter the capital adequacy calculations of Turkish banks and may lead to the restructuring of balance sheets. Furthermore, the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) has not yet announced its schedule for the implementation of Basel III, but a gradual transition is highly anticipated in order to achieve a stronger alignment with EU directives. The new Commercial Code in 2012 is also a major reform with many implications, particularly for corporate governance issues such as transparency, management accountability, and minority rights.</p><h4>What is the appetite for financial services among foreign capital firms?</h4><p>Although the Turkish financial sector is developing rapidly, when compared with EU figures such as total credits, household indebtedness, and total deposits to GDP ratios, we can see that there is still significant untapped potential in the sector. For example, an analysis in 2010 shows that the ratio of the total assets of the banking sector to GDP was 365% in the EU. In Turkey, the same ratio was 89%. Thus, in the long term we can expect to see significantly more bank penetration, owing to the sector's dynamics, as capital markets continue to deepen and the informal economy comes under greater control. The growth potential in the financial sector also attracted significant FDI, especially in the pre-crisis period. Between 2005 and 2011, FDI inflows to Turkey totaled $105 billion, with $37 billion of this amount aimed at the financial sector. In the post-crisis period, FDI to Turkey slowed as a result of the problems in the European banking sector and rising capital needs—foreign interest in the Turkish banking sector also decreased. However, $8 billion in FDI still flowed into the financial sector between 2009 and 2011.</p><h4>What are the bank's growth targets in the international arena?</h4><p>Our bank shapes its international presence according to the globalization of the Turkish economy, seeking to become a regional bank and positioning itself as a global player through the continuous expansion of its overseas network. In addition to our representative offices, affiliates, and branches abroad, our priority is to expand in markets with close economic and commercial ties with Turkey. In this context, we plan to take new initiatives in Georgia, Kosovo, Pakistan, and Iraq in the near future. We are also interested in launching initiatives in Azerbaijan and Egypt, where big potential for development is present in the economy, particularly in the banking sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the business environment for foreign investors in Turkey?<br></h4><p>It's definitely an attractive market for foreign investors. Turkey has a large population base and a significantly expanding middle class with greater spending power. For any consumer-based company in Europe, it is beneficial to base operations in Turkey. Outside of consumer markets, Turkey is also starting to develop, particularly in financial services—different products are being introduced into the market that weren't here previously. Regulatory changes will also assist foreign investors and help to clarify some of the historical issues foreign investors have faced in coming to Turkey.</p><h4>Is confidence increasing for long-term investments?</h4><p>Much of our client base is made up of international investors who have invested in Turkey and have been here for a long time. Many of them have seen significant changes in the way that business is conducted in Turkey, and Turkish partners are becoming more reliable and easier for foreign investors to work with. The more foreign investors come to Turkey, the easier it becomes for the next group of investors that arrive.</p><h4>How would you characterize the private equity environment in Turkey?</h4><p>Relatively speaking, there is very little private equity in Turkey. For the size of the market, when compared to Europe and the US, it's very small, but it is increasing. There is an increasing number of local funds being raised, but it's still a difficult market. As fund returns around the world have been producing diminishing returns in the last five years, LPs are being more selective on where they place their money. However, there are some very good local funds like Actera, Turkven, and Mediterra Capital, which are all fundraising or have recently announced funds. There are also the international funds with a local representative office and/or regional funds. The number of these funds looking at Turkey is ever increasing because they already have established funds and their structures allow for Turkish investment. We are seeing the likes of TPG, KKR, Blackstone, and Premiera active in the local market.</p><h4>What are the most important changes to the Turkish Commercial Code that foreign investors should be aware of?</h4><p>The main alterations are changes to financial reporting requirements and changes to corporate governance. Moving to IFRS will be a significant development for Turkey. The changes will require audits and oblige companies to place their accounts in the public domain. The changes to corporate governance requirements will also be a significant improvement, although it will be somewhat more difficult to implement in practice. Turkey is slightly odd compared to the rest of Europe, where audits are required for most medium to large businesses. Previously, Turkey had weak audit requirements, covering largely only financial services businesses and registered or listed entities. This previously reduced the quality of company reporting for un-audited businesses. This is a significant change for corporate culture in Turkey. I believe that many of the local companies will be afraid of the changes that are coming and don't know how to handle them. From the government's perspective, this demonstrates a genuine desire for change. It should help to reduce the unregistered economy in Turkey, as well as improve transparency, help openness, and assist foreign direct investment, all to support a growing economy.</p><h4>What are your expectations for M&amp;A activity in Turkey?</h4><p>M&amp;A activity is going to be very widespread and cover many sectors. The two main sectors that are seeing increased activity at the moment are the energy and consumer sectors. In the energy sector, there is a deficit between future consumption and total capacity, even with the new capacity currently being brought online. This gap needs to be filled. The only way to really fill this gap is through FDI—the government cannot fund the levels of investment required. Its privatization program is trying to liberalize the market and ultimately provide better pricing for the consumer. This is encouraging foreign energy businesses to move into the market. One such example is the joint venture between AES and Koç: AES Entek. Sabancı also works with Verbund in Enerjisa. RWE also has a strong presence, as does Norwegian renewables firm Statkraft. We have also recently seen the announcement of a large joint venture between E.ON and Doğuş Group. Many of our European clients have Turkey high up on the agenda. We are also seeing a lot of M&amp;A activity in the consumer market. This activity is largely driven by macroeconomic factors—Turkey has a large population with growing wealth and spending habits. The deals we are seeing range from retail to FMCG.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the concierge market changed in Turkey since Back-Up was founded?<br></h4><p>Times have changed since Back-Up started its operations in 2003. The market conditions in 2003 compared to today are totally different. Back then, it was not as easy to reach information, or to get assistance. Now, it is total different. With the rise of social media, smartphones, and the internet, you have to change your offerings according to the market if you want to survive or be successful. If you want to have sustainability, you have to change your value proposition. To address these changes we started working with the Boston Consulting Group to first run a diagnostic on the company—to discover its core abilities, trends, and weaknesses, plus what should be changed in these new marketing conditions. Back-Up is a very well-known brand in the country. We are the clear market leader, with more than an 80% market share. We created the concierge and assistance sector in Turkey, but we are facing increasing competition both domestically and from abroad as well as from changing technology. You have to be proactive, not reactive. We are trying to create a new generation of Back-Up—a back-up for the future. We appreciate our values, but we want to build on them. We will invest more in people, and in systems. There will be a different Back-Up in the future.</p><h4>How does Back-Up reach the international market in Turkey?</h4><p>The employee benefits line is a small business in Turkey, but in the international arena it is huge. At some point, people working in a company will not want to be rewarded only with money or bonuses. You have to provide some non-monetary benefits. At that point Back-Up comes into the picture. We wanted to separate our brands, because they require totally different strategy positioning and different dynamics. We created the corporate brand in March 2011. We work with a number of multinational companies, and many other enterprises, banks, and telecoms firms. We usually work with companies that have a big customer database. They want to retain their customers. In banking, for example, where giving banking-related services, such as higher interest rates will help you, you also have to provide some other benefits. We work with those companies to create their own loyalty programs. We give concierge services and assistance to thousands of individuals. We work with corporations to provide these services to their clients and customers.</p><h4>What is the potential for growth on the individual client side of the business?</h4><p>We provide services to residences, malls, and especially to office buildings. There are huge opportunities in Turkey, as you can see from the vast scale of construction. The demand is increasing significantly. The construction sector is one of the top sectors in Turkey, and in Istanbul there are about 180,000 modern residences, either recently opened, or set to be opened within three months, with 250,000 more in the pipeline. These residences are not like classic apartment buildings. You need a professional concierge, because the people that will be living there demand these kinds of services. This might be because of the organization, the rise of this modern accommodation, plus changing family sizes or structure. We serve a lot of small families and single-parent families. Istanbul is a hectic city, where time is crucial. Construction is more than just about building the building, but about adding value through the additional services that we provide.</p><h4>What is the split between corporate and residential in terms of volumes?</h4><p>Until 2009, all of our revenue came from memberships sold to individuals. The corporate side did not exist. The corporate share in the revenue has now increased to 10%. The number of customers, both corporate and concierge, was 15,000 in 2009, and today it is closer to 200,000, so we are growing rapidly. And we will keep investing in our corporate side. What we do best is give these services. We are experts at that. And of course we keep creating different memberships for our individual customers, and we will keep investing there as well. However, for the corporates, due to many issues such as economic instability, growing GDP per capita, and increases in disposable income, there is huge potential. We are well aware of it, and we believe that the corporate share of 10% will become 20% or more within a few years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[On the Bill]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[on-the-bill]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key points of the new capital markets bill that international investors should be aware of?<br></h4><p>The new Capital Markets Law will probably be the most up-to-date securities law in the world. The new bill has two major contributions. Since the crisis in 2009, the protection of consumers and investors has become a key issue—if institutions go under, people get hurt. In this regard, the new draft law has a very broad coverage and a very clear statement as to what is a capital market crime and what should be done to correct any issues. The law is very clear and not open to interpretation. Part of the law involves a very strong code in terms of corporate governance, meaning transparency and accountability. The second major theme in the bill is that it is very open to financial innovation. We have tried to define financial assets and financial institutions in a way that facilitates the process. For both domestic and international investors, be they institutional or retail oriented, I think the bill will be very accommodating. The Capital Markets Board is very active in international organizations, especially as part of the International Organization for Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and we are chairing a number of committees. Through the IOSCO, we are active on the Financial Stability Board (FSB). For the last three years during my term in office we have mainly discussed the crisis; why it happened and what we should do. We recognize the problems in our country and in other developed, emerging, and undeveloped areas. This has been a source of information for us. The current law is about 25 years old, and although it has been revised from time to time, our core values remain the same. Hopefully, with the new law and the follow-up secondary regulations, the Turkish financial markets will be very interesting and beneficial to a variety of investors. Despite our efforts, the share of the unregulated market in the overall landscape has increased significantly. This means that the markets are moving fast, but governments and regulators are operating slowly. This could be the forecast for a new crisis not too far off from now, and that is why we are aiming to pick up the pace in Turkey.</p><h4>What is the anticipated impact of the new regulations for investment funds in Turkey?</h4><p>Unfortunately, the funds industry in Turkey is undeveloped. It represents 1% of GDP, which is not acceptable, and it should grow by at least 10 times. We have approved many secondary regulations to help expand the funds industry, and this new law will make it even more pronounced. There is interest from many investors from other countries. We have seen interest from London, New York, the Gulf, China, and the Far East, as people visit Turkey and ask us questions about how to do things and what is possible. There is also some activity in the marketplace. A number of brokerage companies in Turkey have been sold out to international institutions. A number of countries in Europe have applied to our board to issue securities in the Turkish market.</p><h4>How would you characterize the development of funds in Turkey?</h4><p>The funds industry in Turkey has historically been dominated by commercial banks, which is not good because their business is different. For example, a fund owned by a commercial bank cannot invest in a fund owned by another commercial bank because they are competitors. We have done everything possible to get the banks out of this business, and it has started to work. We have to show people and investors that there are successful funds. The only way that we can convey this opinion is to let the funds demonstrate how successful they are. We hope that successful small fund managers become more popular. The year 2012 will be a transition period for the funds industry, which we expect grow very fast by the end of the year and the beginning of 2013. However, funds are only part of the game; the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) is working on a new structure for exchanges in Turkey. We want to tie them together under one technological platform, so that investors will be able to access the Turkish exchanges more easily: stock exchange, gold exchange, commodities exchange, and energy exchange. Investors will have access to everything through one screen, platform, and interface. This will offer people a more diverse range of products and a more liquid platform.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what do you attribute The House Group's incredible success in such a short period of time?<br></h4><p>We saw a distinct gap in the market when we established the business. There were no cafés comparable to The House Café. Although we cannot say that we were the very first, in terms of style we are pioneers. Our initial vision was not to be a chain, but instead create a stylish and relaxed environment with a friendly and comfortable atmosphere for people to socialize and feel at home. My partners and I were looking for a new challenge and felt the timing was right.</p><h4>Was there a similar gap in the boutique hotel market?</h4><p>The House Hotel is a similar case to the cafés—we realized that there was a niche in Istanbul for a fresh and design-driven boutique concept. In 2007, we launched the hotel business, which began with serviced apartments. Initially we bought a few buildings in Taksim, the downtown area of Istanbul, where we found a number of nice properties and saw vast potential for investment. The serviced apartment concept already existed in Turkey, but the competition was operating at a much lower standard than ours. Our initial plan was to restore older buildings and rent them out long term, but instead we decided to market serviced apartments on short-term rentals internationally. The design was simple; however, it reflected the café's design and style. We also ensured that the apartments had all the facilities one would expect at home. Istanbul was seeing massive year-on-year growth in the tourism market, so we felt confident to expand to 40 apartments in quick succession. During our expansion we saw that the business was growing very rapidly, therefore we bought a historic building in Galatasaray that would become the home of our first boutique hotel. Everything was preserved when we acquired this historic building, and the kitchen was over 100 years old. We worked with the award-wining Turkish architectural design company Autoban for all three of our hotels, which gives us a unique identity. There were only a few boutique hotels when we entered that market, but this segment has now become crowded in Istanbul. Our three present locations have been extremely successful. In 2010, we sold 50% of the accommodation side of our group to the private equity company Kerten.</p><h4>The brand is extremely strong, but how important is it to connect the two segments?</h4><p>For both the café and hospitality arms of The House Group we have worked with the same architect. The company has been working with Autoban since the beginning. Although it did not design our first café location, we decided to remodel it with Autoban recently. In April 2012, we celebrated our 10-year anniversary, and to commemorate the event we redesigned the first The House Café completely. The work has turned out beautifully. Autoban is a joy to work with—the company is able to upgrade and renovate very quickly. It is very important for us to be unique. When people visit Tünel, they feel a sort of ambience that is different from visiting our branch in Ortaköy. There are certain trends and design philosophy patterns that remind our customers of the brand. This environment is what we were aiming to create with Autoban. This is the unique atmosphere that connects every part of the group.</p><h4>What are your plans to export the brand abroad?</h4><p>The House Café Baku is set to open in summer 2012. Autoban has already started the project that will be operated as a franchise. We have given franchises to Ankara, Izmir, and Antalya, because we believe that having a local operator is very important. The partner should be someone who knows the local community and has experience in the restaurant sector as well as the financial capabilities to support the business. This system works well as long as you create clear franchise control points. We are planning to grow in other capital cities such as London and New York as part of joint ventures in the future. Once again, we believe that when we open a store in these places, a partnership with someone based in that location is very important. We are looking to grow around Europe in the next two years and also beyond. We are seriously considering the Middle East as well, in locations such as Beirut, Dubai, and Kuwait.</p><h4>What is the occupancy rate?</h4><p>Of our 100 rooms, usually 85% are occupied throughout the year. We have a good design, prime locations, and excellent service. Our guests are satisfied, and we have many repeat customers.</p><h4>Do you cater mostly to business or leisure clients?</h4><p>We have a client ratio of 60% leisure and 40% for business purposes. Istanbul has become a connected city. Previously, foreigners would come to engage in textile business transactions, and now they are coming for fashion, art, and festivals. Foreign visitors understand and appreciate quality and design.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize activity on the Istanbul Borsası (İMKB) over the past year?<br></h4><p>After the outperformance of 2010, the İMKB had a challenging year in 2011. Given the problems associated with the eurozone and global liquidity, the value of the İMKB has declined as have those of many emerging market exchanges. However, despite the adverse conditions, the capital markets in Turkey could remain one of the most liquid exchanges in the region. The İMKB, as one of its region's leading exchanges in terms of turnover and market capitalization, has been passing through a revolutionary restructuring process since 2011. The organization has started to change the structure of the Board of Directors and the relative departments so that the management gains more flexibility. For the rest of 2012, what we expect is the legislation of the new Capital Market Law that is currently in the Parliament. After the completion of the legislation, the structuring of the İMKB as a joint-stock company is planned to be complete. In addition, important steps are being taken to accomplish the horizontal and vertical integration of the Turkish capital markets.</p><p>The authorities are aiming to trade all financial products including derivatives, commodities, and energy contracts via a single technological platform and a single investor account at the Settlement and Custody Bank (Takasbank). These changes are in compliance with our medium- and long-term goals to increase the number of listed companies, diversify traded products, and define market capitalization relative to GDP. Furthermore, aware of its pivotal role in the Istanbul International Financial Center (IFC) Project, the İMKB has continued cooperating with regional and global stock exchanges to enable cross connectivity.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to establish strategic links with regional stock exchanges?</h4><p>The organization is a member of the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE). Additionally, the İMKB is the founder and holds the Presidency of the Federation of Eurasian Stock Exchanges (FEAS). Founded in 1995, FEAS has 32 member stock exchanges from 29 different countries and seven affiliate members. The İMKB is also the coordinator of the OIC Member States' Stock Exchanges Forum, which consists of 57 stock exchanges. Furthermore, the İMKB has equity investments in the Kyrgyz (24.5%), Baku (5.55%), and Sarajevo (5%) stock exchanges. We believe that further strategic partnerships will create meaningful synergies. Our recent focus has been on capital market linkages and order routing mechanisms with regional markets. At the September 2011 Meeting of the OIC Member States' Stock Exchanges Forum, the İMKB, Egyptian Exchange, Dubai Financial Market, Qatar Exchange, Tehran Stock Exchange, and Lahore Stock Exchange decided to set bilateral and multilateral linkages. Following this decision, the potential of the markets has been analyzed and views have been exchanged within the market participants. Alternative linkage models have been studied to a great extent, and the work on the proper model design continues.</p><h4>How are you looking to attract more local companies and to list on the İMKB?</h4><p>The İMKB is working to utilize the great potential of the Turkish economy, committed to maintain efforts to increase the number of listed companies. The high growth performance of the economy, sound financial system, and regulations encouraging initial public offerings (IPOs) and corporate governance practices will provide the ground for the success of our vision. The İMKB has established close ties with the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) and other local chambers to attract the top 1,000 firms and SMEs in the country. The IPO campaign that began in 2008 also continues, with effects observed in 2010 and 2011. The annual average number of IPOs, which was just six between 2003 and 2009, has reached 25 in the past two years. Moreover, the major target of the İMKB's Emerging Companies Market (ECM) is to enable SMEs to raise funds from the capital markets. Joint-stock companies that do not meet the quantitative listing criteria of the İMKB are traded in the National Markets, but their growth and development potential can be traded on the ECM. The Small and Medium Industry Development Organization (KOSGEB) has also put into force the “Emerging Companies Market SME Support Program," with which the IPO costs are financed through non-repayable funds. As an additional incentive to the public offerings initiative, the İMKB is applying a discount of 25% on initial listing fees, which will be in effect until the end of 2012.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is TÜSİAD's strategy to ensure a sustainable Turkey by 2050?<br></h4><p>The Turkish economy has been moving toward the top ranks of the world economies since the beginning of the 21st century, and has set the goal of being amongst the top 10 world economies by 2023. This goal can only be accomplished through sustainable development policies. In order to implement the sustainable development vision, a platform for dialogue must be established by creating awareness among all members of society, such as the state, civil society, and the business world. The business community, which already possesses the know-how, technology, skills, financial resources, and necessary means for spreading sustainable development principles to society, has a significant role to play in leading the sustainable development vision to success. Therefore, the sustainable development vision cannot be achieved without the inclusion of the business world in a participatory process.</p><p>TÜSİAD attaches special importance to sustainability and has therefore launched the “Vision 2050 Turkey" project, aiming to shed light on the next 40 years with a vision of sustainable development. The first phase of this project was preparing the “Vision 2050 Turkey" report, which provides universal coverage and assessment of sustainability issues from the perspective of businesses and other stakeholders. The report develops recommendations for the achievement of a sustainable Turkey by 2050 and assesses Turkey's future opportunities as well as the potential risks that may arise along the way. Entrepreneurs who foresee these opportunities will gain a competitive advantage. We believe that increasing the awareness of the business world, especially focusing on the opportunities of sustainability, is crucially important. In light of this, TÜSİAD will continue to work on issues pertaining to sustainability. The “Vision 2050 Turkey" project will be enhanced with studies on “Energy Efficiency in Buildings," “Sustainable Tourism," and “Mobility" in 2012, as well as “Energy Efficiency in Industry," and “Sustainable Agriculture" in 2013 and beyond.</p><h4>What are the most significant constraints on growth for Turkish businesses?</h4><p>While strong growth and a sound fiscal stance are Turkey's strengths, the widening current account deficit is the soft spot. More specifically, Turkey's weakness is its structural trade deficit. With a relatively low level of savings, its growth is dependent upon the availability of foreign savings. Turkey is a net energy importer—energy imports account for roughly two-thirds of the trade deficit—and the manufacturing industry is mainly import dependent, while the current account inevitably reflects GDP growth.</p><h4>How important would Turkey's accession to the EU be?</h4><p>Turkey, Europe, and the world will experience important changes in the upcoming period. From this perspective, the EU has the challenge of enhancing its global economic competitiveness, institutional efficiency, political integrity, and democratic credibility. Each of these points will be strengthened with the accession of Turkey.</p><h4>How would you assess government measures to address the current account deficit?</h4><p>Although there is still a long way to go in terms of fixing structural weaknesses, massive GDP growth rates above 8% per annum in 2010 and 2011 placed Turkey as one of the top growth countries in the world after fast growers like China and Argentina. However, in the existing macroeconomic framework, high growth rates have some costs, especially in terms of the current account balance and, naturally, the savings-investment balance. Until the Turkish economy finds a way to shift into higher value-added exports, the most credible way to smooth the business cycle and slow down the widening of the current account deficit in the short term is to formulate the right macroeconomic policy mix that helps the rebalancing of demand, while focusing on structural reforms. In the medium to long term, high and sustainable growth rates require substantial structural reforms to improve productivity and enhance competitiveness.</p><h4>What are the most important changes to the Turkish Commercial Code (TCC) that foreign investors should be aware of?</h4><p>The new TCC brings a whole new structure to the business world; therefore, there are several articles that both foreign and local investors should be aware of. The new TCC is based on the corporate governance approach. The regulations parallel to the corporate governance principles regarding transparency, management, and control mechanisms will definitely improve the business and investment environment in Turkey for foreign investors.</p><p>The new TCC requires at least one board member to be a Turkish citizen and resident in Turkey. This means that a new Turkish member must be appointed to the board of directors if all the board members of the company are currently foreign. Secondly, the new code allows for “one-man companies." The former code requires at least five shareholders, both for limited and incorporated companies. In other words, the main shareholders will not be obliged to distribute small amounts of shares to establish a limited or incorporated company. One man can also be a legal entity.</p><p>The new code will set out a more transparent business world both for local and foreign investors. We believe that the regulatory framework is crucial to improve the business and investment environment in Turkey. Therefore, we have strongly supported the enactment of the TCC and continue our support for secondary legislation. We believe that there is still room for improvement in legislation of this magnitude. For that reason, we continue to work on our position in the due process.</p><h4>What sort of regulatory changes still need to be made to improve the business environment in Turkey?</h4><p>Unemployment still ranks as one of the top priorities in Turkey. In order to fight unemployment, the burdens on employment should be decreased further. Decreasing non-wage labor costs will also contribute to efforts to integrate the informal economy into the formal economy. In order to satisfy this objective, we believe that efforts aimed at decreasing non-wage labor costs and increasing the transition to a formal economy should be implemented simultaneously.</p><p>On the other hand, laws regulating work life should be consistent with and respond to the needs of the labor force. Flexible working methods, which were included in the revised Labor Law in 2003, are not common in practice. The “flexicurity" approach can contribute to the maintenance and improvement of employment, the reduction of the informal economy, and the creation of jobs for specific groups like women, the young, and the disabled.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the Turkish entrepreneurial spirit?<br></h4><p>Turkey is an emerging economy that has experienced an average annual economic growth of 6% over the last seven years. It owes its economic achievements to the entrepreneurial culture of the Turkish people. Turkey does not have oil or natural gas like many of its neighbors, but one of its greatest resources is its entrepreneurship. Aware of this fascinating potential, TOBB has established two very active groups: the Women Entrepreneurs Board in 2007 and the Young Entrepreneurs Board in 2009. These groups were created to promote entrepreneurship and encourage potential businesspeople to turn into active entrepreneurs. According to an international survey in Europe, Turks top the list for entrepreneurial spirit in Europe. The research indicates that half of the Turkish population has a positive attitude toward establishing their own businesses. This clearly shows that Turks are born with a great gift, and the Turkish government has also been promoting entrepreneurs effectively. Thanks to the improvement in business regulations, most of the antiquated bureaucratic barriers have been lifted. Now, a business enterprise can be set up as part of a six-stage process in less than a week, while in 2001 an entrepreneur needed to go through 19 stages, which would take about two-and-a-half months. The regulations have borne fruit; the rate of institutional entrepreneurs in the 18-64 age group has more than doubled, up from 4.8% in 2008 to 10.7% in 2010.</p><h4>What role can TOBB take in leading other similar associations in the Middle East, given that the private sector drives much of Turkey's bilateral relations?</h4><p>Since its foundation, Turkey has been a role model for countries in the Middle East, with its stable democracy, distinct history, and close ties to Europe. Today, Turkey's reputation for stability is burnished by economic prosperity, and our regional role has positively affected TOBB's relationship with its counterparts in the Middle East. Enhancing bilateral and multilateral economic relations has always been an important aspect of our international agenda. For the same reason, TOBB has established the Chamber Academy to develop the capacity of chambers of commerce and industry of Middle Eastern countries. In the process, we have hosted 22 high-level chamber representatives from 20 Islamic countries in order to exchange our knowledge and experiences.</p><h4>What are the most significant achievements of TOBB and its business councils?</h4><p>Our grassroots chamber network has been among the catalysts of the private sector-led transformation. The chambers are the main representation mechanism for the business community, and TOBB is the highest-level body of the Turkish private sector. The 1.4 million members of TOBB are served through 365 local chambers and commodity exchanges, as well as 59 assemblies. Moreover, via the Women Entrepreneurs Board and Young Entrepreneurs Board, TOBB plays an important role in the future of entrepreneurship in Turkey.</p><p>In addition to supporting domestic, political, and economic reforms, TOBB has always been an outward-looking actor while developing sound regional integration policies. Our objective is to increase the visibility of the Turkish private sector. This is a branding issue. The more people trust in the virtues of Turkish entrepreneurs, the easier it will be for us to do business abroad. Enhancing bilateral and multilateral economic relations is also an important aspect of our international agenda. The Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey (DEİK) and its bilateral business councils with 101 countries have been the driving force behind our market development and penetration strategies. In line with this strategy, DEİK also started to establish sectorial business councils to provide guidance to market players in the international arena. In cooperation with public authorities, we successfully adopted the Asia-Pacific Strategy, the Latin America Strategy, and the Opening Up To Africa Strategy.</p><h4>What role do you believe female entrepreneurs play in sustaining economic growth?</h4><p>We understand that without this important half of our labor force we cannot be one of the 10 largest economies in the world. TOBB established the Women Entrepreneurs Board to develop the profiles of women entrepreneurs, both in quality and quantity. Nowadays, we support around 4,000 businesswomen who are organized in all 81 provinces of Turkey.</p><p>By the end of 2012, we are aiming to exceed 10,000, thereby reinforcing our council as one of the largest women entrepreneurs' organizations in the world. Nationwide calls for women to join the labor force have driven the employment rate of women up from 27% in 2010 to 31% in 2011. However, this rate is still too low for an entrepreneur-spirited country, and we still have a lot of work to do.</p><h4>What are the greatest challenges facing Turkish business?</h4><p>The challenge for our business is rooted abroad, specifically in Europe. The eurozone crisis has severely affected Turkey's trade and capital inflows potential. We are trying to diversify our markets, which will eventually make the Turkish economy stronger. Over the last few years in particular, we have taken steps to enter the markets of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.</p><h4>How can the pieces of the Turkish diaspora fit together?</h4><p>The key to Turkey's successful and rapid economic progress is the number of Turkish-origin businessmen operating abroad. The economy has grown strong, and now is the time for a strong diaspora. Today, we  resemble a jigsaw puzzle; I use this metaphor to highlight the divided structure of Turkish people living abroad. Although each of us holds one piece, we are disorganized, and cannot form a complete picture. This hampers the mutual benefits that we could provide to the Turkish business community domestically and abroad. Fortunately, we have started to put the pieces back together. In doing so, we have established the World Turkish Business Council, which was attended by more than 2,200 Turkish-originated business people from 81 countries in 2011.</p><p>Moreover, we are developing a diaspora strategy with the relevant government authorities. In the near future, I firmly believe we will be stronger.</p><h4>How are Turkish industries balancing the power shift from the eurozone to the Middle East?</h4><p>Thanks to the reform process initiated by Turgut Özal in the 1980s and accelerated after 2001, Turkey has become the most important economy in the region. The EU has been of critical importance to Turkey's progress over the last 15 years. The role of the Customs Union between EU and Turkey is also a significant factor that helps us to become an important actor in the global economy. Today, Turkey is a three-hour flight away from most countries between Italy and China, and Turkish industry stands as the largest in this $10 trillion region. This attests to the increasing organizational capability of the business community, which has greatly broadened the country's regional influence.</p><p>As the dominant industrial power in the region, our FDI has recently become more concentrated on Middle Eastern countries. After 2009, Turkish FDI doubled to reach $7 billion, and our companies have been investing millions of euros across the Balkans. Our investments have been focused mainly on ICT, transportation, and banking, with the total amount exceeding $22 billion over the past decade. Between 2000 and 2010, more than 3,000 Turkish companies invested abroad, striking a balance between Europe and the Middle East, in terms of our industrial investments in the region.</p><h4>How would you assess the government's measures to address the informal economy and meet EU standards?</h4><p>Informality is still a significant issue, despite recent declining trends in the share of informal workers. We are pleased to see that the government has started to implement an action plan to fight the informal economy with the support of the business community.</p><p>This action plan aims to implement several legal, financial, and administrative measures to eliminate the informal economy, achieving policy priorities that comply with EU standards.</p><h4>What changes to the Turkish Commercial Code (TCC) should foreign investors be aware of?</h4><p>The new TCC is not simply a change of the law; it is a change of mentality, understanding, and approach in our commercial activities. International standards will rule the country's business life. The new code integrates Turkish commercial regulations with EU legislation, and puts into effect a number of generally accepted financial reporting and auditing principles. These guidelines pave the way for democracy among shareholders, introduce new concepts such as transaction auditors, and facilitate the use of IT tools. Company mergers, divisions, and conversions are all to be regulated in accordance with EU law, which will benefit both foreign and domestic investors.</p><p>The position of minority shareholders will also change drastically. Each shareholder in a company will have inspection rights for major transactions. The law will boost auditing standards and transparency, eventually increasing the number of investment and acquisition targets in a market where, historically, private equity funds have found themselves chasing a limited field of targets. Compliance with the new law, as well as trends in renegotiations, buyouts, consolidation, and stock market activism, are expected to attract more business opportunities for foreign investors.</p><h4>What measures is TOBB taking to lobby for changes on behalf of SMEs?</h4><p>TOBB has initiated many projects and lobbied for a variety of regulations for SMEs. Firstly, a considerable service capacity was built for SMEs within the Business Development Center's project, with the financial support of the EU. Today, these centers are located across 19 provinces in Turkey, and they help SMEs to gain access to funds, find new markets, enhance their capacity for innovation and project planning, and provide necessary training and expertise. Secondly, TOBB supported the creation of a credit guarantee system with the goal of increasing access to credit for SMEs. This scheme provides credit guarantees for bank loans.</p><p>Moreover, we are working with the government to design and implement an “SME Strategy and Action Plan," which formulates a road map for SMEs with the aim of applying policies at a national level and enhancing the competitive power of SMEs as Turkey harmonizes with the EU. Finally, we are lobbying for a new issue called “think small first." This legislation takes SMEs' interests into account at the very early stages of policymaking.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Have government privatization policies succeeded in keeping up with growing energy demands?<br></h4><p>Privatization in the energy sector is an important part of our liberalization policy, and that's why we will continue with energy privatization policies. As the government, we have to focus and invest more on education, health, and justice. In the last nine years, we have increased the share of the private sector from 34% to 54% in energy generation. We want to boost this rate to 75% over the short and medium term.</p><h4>Energy imports have significantly contributed to Turkey's current account deficit. What role will the energy sector play in reducing the deficit while meeting Turkey's growing energy needs?</h4><p>Turkey imports nearly 93% of its oil and 98% of its gas, which we need for energy. This is one of the big contributors to the current account deficit. We aim to reduce the portion of energy we import. In this regard, we encourage the sector to invest in domestic and renewable resources. This is an important project to be applied because we aim to reach 30% for natural gas, petrol, and renewables, and 10% for nuclear power by the time of the Turkish Republic's 100th anniversary in 2023.</p><h4>As Turkey's economy and population continues to grow, what are the policy measures being taken to prevent an electricity deficit?</h4><p>Turkey will be able to meet its electricity demand in 2015 when the new generation facilities currently under construction will be completed and start to produce electricity. Rising electricity demand will not create any threat to Turkey since power plants currently under construction and additional energy projects will produce more electricity than needed.</p><h4>What are the practical implications of the latest Shah Deniz II gas agreement signed between Prime Minister Erdoğan and Azerbaijani President Aliyev?</h4><p>Gas from the Azerbaijani Shah Deniz field can be transported to Turkey's western borders via the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP), and then be delivered to the European markets via a new version of the Nabucco pipeline. A merger between TANAP and the Nabucco pipeline may be possible. It is possible link the two projects, and this is already being discussed. Turkey is one of the six partners in Nabucco. We are not the only responsible country for gas in this project; Turkey will undertake its duties as it is able.</p><h4>What role do you envision renewable energy will play in meeting Turkey's energy needs?</h4><p>Turkey is rich in terms of renewable resources. In geothermal energy resources, for example, Turkey ranks first in Europe and seventh in the world. Regarding wind energy, a rapid increase in terms of installed capacity—from 20 MW in 2002 to 1,800 MW today—has taken place. With the projects ongoing and in the pipeline, wind energy capacity will most likely demonstrate a further rapid and sharp increase. With a 132% increase from 2008 to 2009 in installed wind capacity, Turkey ranked second after Mexico according to the World Wind Energy Association. We believe that renewable energy will be the most important resource for Turkey and the world. We are planning to increase the portion of renewables in the energy mix to 30% by 2023.</p><h4>What portion of energy does the government envision nuclear will provide?</h4><p>Making use of safe, low-cost, and environmentally friendly energy resources is the focus of our development strategies. Turkey's first nuclear power plant will be built by a Russian company in Akkuyu, near the southern port city of Mersin. The second nuclear plant, slated for the Sinop region on Turkey's Black Sea coast, is still up for grabs. Turkey has launched its ambitions for a nuclear program. We aim to meet the country's energy needs sustainably. We will take the precautions needed after the Fukushima disaster, but continue to show determination on nuclear power. In this context, we intend to set up two nuclear plants that will meet 10% of Turkey's energy demand by 2023.</p><h4>Turkey is actively seeking oil and gas in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. What are the anticipated results of exploration in those regions?</h4><p>Oil and gas exploration will begin in the Mediterranean in the Gulf of Mersin and Iskenderun with a company selected by the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO). We are considering proposals now. I hope we will decide which company is more suitable and sign agreement in 2012. TPAO and Shell signed a farm-in and joint operating agreement (FJOA) covering offshore Antalya on November 23, 2011. In the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, TPAO may begin exploration for oil at any moment. And also, we will continue to seek oil and gas in the Black Sea. We are hopeful that there is oil and gas in these regions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In light of the current sovereign debt crisis in Europe, many are questioning Turkey's bid to join the EU. Does Turkey's future still lie in  economic and diplomatic union with Europe?<br></h4><p>It depends on how Turkish people perceive the EU. We see the EU project as “the grandest peace project in the history of mankind." When we go back to the main rationale behind the EU project, we see that it originated from the idea to build a peaceful relationship between nations at war for centuries. Therefore, it is inherently an inclusive, not exclusive project. Those who share the values enshrined in Article 49 in the Treaty on the EU can join the bloc. It is a value-oriented project, and these values have derived from the shared experiences of humankind. When the EU project is described as such, there is no doubt that Turkey's future definitely lies in Europe. We belong to Europe. And why should we stay outside of it? Moreover, Turkey's EU membership process has tested in real terms the potential of Europe as a multicultural, peaceful, and economically prosperous union.</p><h4>Is Cyprus the biggest barrier to EU membership?</h4><p>At first glance, the Cyprus issue seems to be one of the biggest obstacles standing before Turkey's EU membership. Currently, only 13 chapters have been opened to negotiations, one of which was provisionally closed. Since the opening of the chapter on Food Safety, Veterinary, and Phytosanitary Policy under the Spanish Presidency in 2010, no new chapters could be opened. It is argued that what can be labeled as a stalemate in Turkey-EU accession negotiations mostly stems from the Cyprus problem. At present, eight chapters are suspended due to the decision taken by the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council on November 11, 2006 with regard to the implementation of the Additional Protocol. Due to the very same decision, the rest of the negotiation chapters cannot be closed even if all the technical harmonization procedures have been completed. The above-mentioned portrait reflects the Cyprus problem as the greatest barrier ahead of Turkey's EU membership. However, the truth is not always as it seems. Sometimes, realities are veiled behind superstitious covers. Indeed, if we were to perceive the EU as an actor working within the established rules and policies, we would have failed to notice the fact that a divided island was accepted to the bloc. Today, even EU officials admit that it was a failure to grant the Greek Cypriot Administration membership at that time. As you might remember, through the “Annan Plan" prepared under the auspices of UN, a peaceful solution was targeted that would have united the island so as to enable both sides to have an equal say over their destiny. The idea was to make a united Cyprus a member of the EU, free of all its problems. However, the plan did not work out because of the unexpected “no" vote by the Greek Cypriots in the referendum held in April 2004. The reluctance of the Greek Cypriot side to reunify and its unwillingness to reach a resolution contributed to the continuation of the problem. Therefore, the Greek Cypriot Administration, which in essence was the real source of the puzzle that was placed on Turkey's table, was let in to the EU together with all its unresolved problems. Just one week after the referendum, the Greek side was awarded with EU membership, whereas the Turkish Cypriots, who were striving for a solution, were left isolated outside the EU. Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus have always been the most vigorous supporters of peace on the island. As I have stated before, the results of the referendum on the Annan Plan clearly demonstrated to the international community that the Turkish side was in favor of a comprehensive settlement.</p><h4>What will be the main issues under negotiation in 2012 and 2013?</h4><p>The years 2012 and 2013 will be ones in which Turkey will strive to unblock the deadlock in EU accession negotiations, as it has already taken the initial steps. Against all our efforts, the negotiation process is not proceeding as it ought to be. Even though the case for Turkey's membership is such a strong argument, the accession process has been facing resistance, particularly from certain member states, and 18 out of 22 chapters, which are pending to be opened, are blocked on political grounds. However, we are fully committed to the accession process, and for us 2012 and 2013 will be the years of striking reforms. EU membership is a strategic objective for Turkey, and we are determined to continue the negotiations with the shared objective of full membership as is stated in our Negotiating Framework. Therefore, we continue our reform process patiently in every field of the acquis communautaire. In the last year alone, 14 primary and 150 secondary pieces of legislation have been enacted within the framework of the EU harmonization process. In this respect, our main objective is in raising the level of Turkey's alignment with the EU acquis to the upmost until the beginning of 2014. I would like to stress that, for some people, the EU Presidency of the Greek Cypriot Administration is one of the big issues for negotiations in 2012. However, for us it is not, as we will not change our position. We will continue our relations with EU institutions and organs as usual.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Turkey is a country close to my heart.</p><p>I have established close contacts and excellent working relationships with my main interlocutors, and would call Minister Bağış as much an advisor as a good friend. I am also glad to have been able to further deepen my contacts with the Joint Parliamentary Committee, which I had the pleasure to address in October 2011.</p><p>The aim of today's positive agenda is precisely to build on the achievements of the accession process and our joint interest, and thus give new momentum to our relations, which have passed through a difficult phase.</p><p>This means renewed efforts and cooperation in a number of key areas where there is still room for progress and where we have much more to gain by working together than arguing. These areas include support for political reforms in Turkey, the continued alignment of Turkey's legislation with the EU acquis, addressing important trade issues, closer cooperation on visas and migration, a closer dialogue on foreign policy, energy, and the fight against terrorism, and the enhanced participation of Turkey in EU programs.</p><p>First, we want to convince Member States to put short-term measures into practice to improve visa issuance to Turkish applicants, and I am aware of the impatience of the Turkish business community on further progress in this area. Under the existing EU Visa Code that is being implemented, measures such as the harmonization of supporting documents; visa fee exemptions for certain categories; extended consular coverage in Turkey by Schengen member states, and a more consistent delivery of multiple entry visas can already bring very concrete benefits to Turkish citizens wishing to travel to the EU.</p><p>In parallel, we encourage Turkey to develop a dialogue with the EU on visa policy, mobility, and migration, including illegal migration, to finalize working arrangements with FRONTEX and to initial and sign the readmission agreement that was negotiated with the EU.</p><p>Secondly, we aim to take a good look at the Customs Union, and see how we can take concrete steps to have a more effective functioning Customs Union. We need to ensure the Customs Union can remain a key part of our strong fundamentals by addressing in parallel both the current trade irritants (including a more effective way we settle any disputes) as well as Turkey's concerns regarding the free trade agreements that the EU concludes with third countries.</p><p>Thirdly, we want to strengthen our cooperation in combating terrorism. The EU strongly condemns terrorist acts and understands Turkey's concerns. Turkey too needs to take steps to intensify cooperation with the EU. For example, a proper law on the protection of personal data would open the door to an effective cooperation with Europol, the EU's police cooperation, and Eurojust, which promotes coordination between judiciaries. In addition, Turkey still lacks proper legislation against the financing of terrorism, in line with international requirements.</p><p>The one issue that will greatly benefit all Turkish citizens is constitutional reform. Turkey has a truly historic opportunity; the opportunity to upgrade the constitution to the standards of a modern democracy and to shape a framework that will protect all citizens of Turkey and guarantee their freedoms, whatever their ethnicity, creed, beliefs, and lifestyles. Or, as Prime Minister Erdoğan has stated, the new constitution should bring “the individual, the citizen, and freedoms to the forefront."</p><p>I welcome the progress made on constitutional reform, with work having now started in earnest, based on a constructive collaboration among the four main political parties represented in the Grand National Assembly. I have the feeling all are aware of the historic opportunity that is presented, and of the responsibility to make good use of it.</p><p>Beyond work on the new constitution, there are other important matters that Turkey needs to address in urgency. The European Commission's recent progress report identified the right to freedom of expression in practice, and the Kurdish issue and the dangerous situation prevailing in the southeast of the country.</p><p>On the issue of freedom of expression, the sources of our current concerns in Turkey are well known: a widespread judicial culture that has insufficiently integrated a number of human rights standards as defined by the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights, as well as the legislative framework, in particular the Turkish criminal code and the Anti-Terror Law, which lead to abuses and do not adequately protect freedom of expression in practice.</p><p>It is such common goals that make me confident we have a common future; one we can and must shape together, based on a positive agenda.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>It gave me great pleasure to welcome President Gül to the Netherlands this year. The reason for his visit was a gratifying one, 400 years of diplomatic relations between our two countries. This takes us back to the year 1612, when contacts between the Ottoman Empire and the Netherlands had become so important that for the first time, a Dutch envoy, Cornelis Haga, was accredited to the Sublime Porte. The cooperation between our countries thus gained official recognition. The activities we had in common at the time were trade in the Mediterranean and the protection of our interests against interference from other great powers. The offices of the Levant Trading Company, an eminent association of Amsterdam merchants, were established in the former Town Hall of Amsterdam. It is remarkable that in the 400 years that have since passed, a period in which our continent exhausted itself in armed conflicts, relations between our two countries have always been peaceful. This is yet another reason to dwell at length on this anniversary.<br></p><p>In Turkey and the Netherlands alone, more than 300 cultural events have been organized to mark this anniversary, in fields such as the creative industries: music, theatre, literature, and the exchange of art collections. In this way, we hope to increase awareness of our respective cultural treasures and to enhance cooperation and exchange in these areas. A good example is the exhibition of modern art from Turkey in the Boijmans Van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam and in the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht.</p><p>In general, the Dutch know relatively little about modern Turkey, and I could imagine the converse is also true. The great number of contacts, exchanges, and events taking place this year will provide ample opportunity to become better acquainted with one another and to review the image we have of each other in light of today's reality.</p><p>Turkey can look back on a proud past and today too plays an important role in the region and on the world stage. It is a stable factor in a turbulent area where existing powers and relations are being challenged on all sides. For many people, Turkey is an inspiration and an example. Its influential position is based on a long history, which has gradually led to greater international involvement and alliances with other nations. It joined NATO at an early stage and has always been known as a strong and reliable partner. Turkey is a cofounder of the OECD, an active member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, and a candidate for EU membership. It plays a prominent role in the international arena. It takes part in various NATO missions, for example in Kosovo, off the Somalian coast, and in Afghanistan.</p><p>Our countries work together in various international organizations. In addition, they engage in bilateral political consultations at the Wittenburg Conference. In 2011, the annual meeting was held in Ankara, and in Rotterdam in March 2012. Alongside the Conference sessions, working groups at official levels address issues such as energy, migration and integration, counterterrorism, and cultural cooperation. These frequent meetings illustrate our close and varied contacts.</p><p>The importance of Turkey's position in the world is to a large extent determined by its strong and rapidly growing economy. More recently, modern industry has taken its place alongside traditional crafts and agriculture. However, whenever Turkey is mentioned nowadays, youth and entrepreneurship come to mind. The young population is a sign that the country has the future on its side.</p><p>The dynamism of the Turkish economy has an impact on our country as well. For many years now the Dutch business sector, including both large, internationally oriented companies and SMEs, have found their way to Turkey. They are attracted by the favorable investment climate and a growing consumer market with considerable purchasing power. What is more, the substantial number of tourists from our country contributes to the Turkish economy. They are drawn by the stories they have heard about its rich historical heritage, the pleasant Mediterranean climate, and the legendary hospitality.</p><p>Conversely, Turkish compatriots have contributed a great deal to the Dutch economy. In the early 1960s, they came to the Netherlands in great numbers to work in industry. Many stayed here and others came to join them. There are now almost 400,000 people of Turkish descent living in the Netherlands, spread over different regions and active in all kinds of sectors. Their entrepreneurial spirit is a welcome contribution to our society.</p><p>Relations between Turkey and the Netherlands have never been limited to interstate contacts. From the very beginning, they included the exchange of people, goods, and ideas. This is a story not only of states and diplomats, but also of inquisitive travellers and acquisitive traders as well as scholars and artists. This is what makes the history of our relations so fascinating and this festive occasion so well worth celebrating.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Of all the populations that have come to settle in the northeast African continent, only two have not been considered by the Tunisian people as invaders: the Arabs and the Ottomans. Indeed, the Ottomans came to Tunisia to enrich the Arab-Muslim heritage and contribute to an open culture. It is not by chance that Tunisia was the first country to have followed Turkey's example when a modern constitution was adopted. It is also not by chance that the first two populations that abolished slavery, long before many occidental countries, were the Turks and the Tunisians. The first countries to abolish polygamy in the Muslim world were Turkey and Tunisia. Our history is full of similarities that reflect the choices made by the two countries, which reinforces our strategic partnership. Partnership is the key word that both countries have been repeating since the revolution in Tunisia. The visits made by both Turkish and Tunisian officials since January 2011, and especially the day after the elections on October 23, hold the hope of deeper cooperation.<br></p><p>Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and Habib Bourguiba are, respectively, the two figureheads of modern Turkey and Tunisia. They established republican values and thoughts and spread free and obligatory education. At that time, these were revolutionary measures, which tells us a lot about the common vision shared by both men.</p><p>Today, both countries share much more than the color of their flags and their founding fathers' vision of the state. In this post-Kemalist era, Turkey has experienced instability and military coups that have complicated the political landscape but gave way to an appeased multi-party system and a politically, economically, and socially stable state. Ennahda, the Islamic party in Tunisia, is strongly inspired by this Turkish model, and has chosen to ally itself with secular parties. The political, secular, and religious components of Tunisia can learn from Turkey, a country that was able to maintain a secular and republican state, whilst guaranteeing individual liberties, a multi-party system, and a stable model for economic development.</p><p>In light of this common platform, it is in our best interest to reinforce economic cooperation between Turkey and Tunisia. The economies of the two countries have followed common trajectories, be it in terms of GDP structuring or opening up to foreign markets. However, today the Turkish economy comprises a greater number of enterprises and is characterized by larger industrial groups with a greater economic reach at the international level. The commercial relationships between Tunisia and Turkey are governed by the agreement instituting a zone of free exchange, which was signed in Tunis on the November 21, 2004. It allowed us to achieve a global volume of trade equivalent to ‚¬700 million.</p><p>We are convinced that the Tunisian and Turkish economies are complementary, both in terms of the range of goods and services, and market segments. A judicious partnership between the economic operators of both countries on the one side, together with our market prospects and the promotion of exports on the other, will no doubt promote the strengthening of regular and meaningful contracts.</p><p>The influx of Tunisian travelers to Turkey has increased significantly over the last 10 years, surpassing 100,000 tourists per year. Turkish tourists visiting Tunisia are not as plentiful. Promoting Tunisia's cultural and archeological sites should definitely increase the number of Turkish visitors to the country, while strengthening our understanding of our respective common Ottoman, Islamic, and Mediterranean cultures.</p><p>Regarding academic and professional relations, Turkish establishments are inspired by the Anglo-Saxon higher education model and by German models for vocational training. On the other hand, Tunisian establishments are modeled on French structures, known for the predominance of fundamental sciences in all experimental approaches. Therefore, cooperation regarding professional formations would be beneficial, especially for Tunisia, which is currently going through a re-adaptation phase regarding its professional formations to respond to the needs of enterprises.</p><p>After 23 years of dictatorship, Tunisia is free and experimenting with democracy. Conscious of the challenges that the country faces, Tunisia is convinced that it must tie a bond of close cooperation with countries such as Turkey, which understand economic prosperity in a context where they have managed to harmoniously reconcile Islam, democracy, and modernity.</p><p>Both countries share a common vision in establishing a regional foreign policy that avoids conflicts and emphasizes economic cooperation. Tunisia sees the Arab Spring as an opportunity to establish a new strategic relational network between Arabs and their neighbors. Turkey stands as a central pillar in this perspective.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Turkey to UK business?<br></h4><p>It's very important. The relationship has taken a great step forward in the last eight months or so, partly because of the new information partnership and partly due to the state visit of President Gül, and my own visit with a business delegation; I was the first Business Secretary to visit Turkey for 10 years. On the ground, UK exports are up nearly 30% and imports from Turkey up by around 10% in the last year. It's one of the areas of rapid growth of trade and business generally, something that we have committed to strengthening in the future as part of our strategic partnership. We are committed to doubling bilateral trade by 2015, and we're well on track to achieve that.</p><h4>How would you characterize economic relations between the two countries?</h4><p>I think you can legitimately criticize the UK for not having paid more attention to Turkey's emergence as a highly successful economy and a very successful democracy. Both of those things are now apparent. While this may not have been fully appreciated in the past decade, a lot of work has been going on to build a relationship with Turkey. The most important issue, which was brought to the forefront by the previous government and is a position maintained by the current UK government, is our support for Turkey's accession to the EU, which hasn't been so popular with other European countries. However, we continue to make the case for Turkey's membership.</p><h4>What would be the impact of Turkey's accession to the EU for British business?</h4><p>It would be good for Turkey, and it would be good for the UK. It would remove a lot of trade barriers in tariffed and non-tariff areas, and it would mean that Turkey would be joining the single market, which is a much more integrated grouping of countries with common standards. Trade would increase very rapidly. There would be a big incentive for investment flows. We're already getting British companies investing in Turkey. There's quite a lot of Turkish capital coming into the UK as well. Once economies become integrated through a customs union or a deeper relationship, then trade and investment flows operate much more substantially.</p><h4>What is the level of integration of British companies in Turkey?</h4><p>I believe there are more than 2,000 British companies investing in Turkey—not just the big names like BP, Shell, and Rolls-Royce, but many smaller companies have moved in, and there are several SMEs within the group. When we speak about British SMEs in Turkey, it is mostly the “M" rather than the “S"—there aren't many one-person companies. We're talking about the medium-sized companies, which in many ways are the basis of growth in our economy and in Turkey. One of the reasons that Turkey is such a successful and growing economy is because of the large numbers of entrepreneurs, initially quite small, but who have gone on to grow very rapidly—not just in textiles and traditional sectors, but also in much more sophisticated industries. It's the medium-sized companies where much of the growth and innovation is. One of the things we've realized in the UK is that compared to a country like Germany we haven't done enough to encourage the SME sector in international trade. My colleague, the Trade Minister Lord Green, who has worked on this issue full time, accepts that an absolutely key part of his mandate is to build up trade involving SMEs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Domestic stability is a key demand for foreign investors. How do you respond to this sensitivity?</h4><p>If you look at political stability in Turkey over the past nine years, it has been remarkable—especially given the fact that we had major economic crises in 1999 and 2001. Political stability and strong leadership have supported and strengthened economic development in Turkey. The government has been able to overcome not just the global financial crisis but also the ups and downs of the Turkish economy by taking a number of measures in such areas as investing in research and development, increasing production, securing the banking system, diversifying trade, finding new areas of investment, and attracting FDI.</p><h4>How significant is the establishment of a new constitution in promoting Turkey's democratic values internationally?</h4><p>It's one of the most important and ambitious national projects we've had in a long time in Turkey. We have had three constitutions in the Republican period: 1924, 1960, and 1982. The 1982 constitution was written after the military coup of 1980 and no longer caters to the needs of the new Turkey in the 21st century. In addition, that constitution has been amended so many times that it has lost its internal coherence.</p><p>It is crucial for Turkey's future to write a new, modern, and civilian constitution. It is key for the new Turkey that is emerging with its democratic institutions, economy, new infrastructure, young population, and its new foreign policy. The needs and aspirations of the new Turkey will be reflected in the new constitution and it will boost Turkey's development and remove many of the bureaucratic obstacles that concern business communities and investors. It will expand the areas of freedoms and civil liberties and establish the principles of equality, justice, and constitutional citizenship for all Turkish citizens. This is one area in which other nations, especially in the Arab world, have taken a keen interest. They, too, want to live in a system of democracy, under the rule of law and with transparency, and they look to Turkey as a source of inspiration and as an experience to be shared in terms of how the country has overcome years of military tutelage and resolved issues that have been on our agenda for many years: democratization, pluralism, religious minorities, human  rights, civil liberties, and economic development. Therefore, our democracy is key to our political stability and economic development.</p><h4>How do you envision Turkey's role in the transition to democracy for countries involved in the Arab spring?</h4><p>From the outset, we have supported the people's demand for democracy, rule of law, justice, and transparency in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and in Syria, Yemen, and other places. Leaders should listen to their people's legitimate demands. We believe this is in their national interest as well as in the interest of the region. When Prime Minister Erdoğan visited Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya in September 2011, he was received as an embodiment these core messages. There is major interest in improving bilateral relations with Turkey. Of course, we already have wide-ranging relations with all the countries in the Arab world. But there is always room for wider and deeper relations in all sectors of life. We will continue to cooperate with these countries and increase our diplomatic, cultural, and economic relations. We know that we cannot maintain a stable environment when our neighbors are unstable, weak, or economically lagging behind. A democratic and prosperous Arab world is possible and the Arab people have shown that it is possible to attain.</p><h4>Turkey sits on a strategically important geographic location between East and West. Is there a conflict in promoting Turkey to Europe, the US, and the Middle East?</h4><p>A businessman in Cairo, an executive in London, or an academic in New York obviously look at things from different angles. As far as Turkey is concerned, the image comes through all of these different perspectives. Turkey has changed tremendously and at a rapid pace. I would say that in some parts of the world that pace has not been fully understood—some people still have the image of Turkey in the 1970s or the 1980s. However, when they come to Turkey and they study Turkish culture, economy, and so on, they realize that Turkey has made a quantum leap in the past decade and in many areas, from building healthier cities and a cleaner environment to investing in infrastructure and protecting human rights and civil liberties. Just to give you one figure as an example, the number of tourists visiting Turkey in 2002 was about 12 million. This year, it's reaching 30 million.</p><p>That said, we still have a lot of work to do. Turkey's identity is dynamic, multi-dimensional, and colorful. On the one hand you have an incredibly rich historical heritage and cultural tradition, and on the other hand a critical geopolitical position, which makes Turkey a unique country with tremendous possibilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey's economic history is full of periods of rapid growth and long stagnations. What is different about the latest period of growth?</h4><p>During the last nine years, Turkey has gone through a period of strong political stability, and we benefited from this. The Justice and Development (AK) Party government has successfully implemented political and economic reforms in a timely manner. Turkey has been continuously upgrading itself when it comes to its democratic standards. This is a really important source of strength for us, as we base our policies on the aspirations and will of the people. Putting individuals' and citizens' welfare at the core of our policies has paved the way to strong growth and employment generation.</p><p>When the AK Party came to power, Turkey's budget deficit was 12% of GDP, and its debt-to-GDP ratio was 74% at the end of 2002. Looking at the latest fiscal figures, we expect our budget deficit to decelerate to 1.7% of GDP in 2011. In parallel with this decline, our debt-to-GDP ratio will be below 40%. The fiscal adjustment process was very important for Turkey.</p><p>On the monetary policy side, our central bank has been very successful in fighting the chronic problem of inflation. For 34 years in Turkey, the inflation rate has been in double-digit territory. However, during our term, it has dropped to single-digit levels. We are targeting even lower single-digit figures for the coming years.</p><p>In terms of structural reforms, we were able to make comprehensive social security reforms, including pension reforms. We were able to perform healthcare reform with a wide coverage. Furthermore, our banking system went through a significant reform process, enabling our banks to be quite strong compared to most other countries.</p><p>Turkey has undergone timely reforms in all of the areas that developed economies are now struggling with. The structural change that Turkey has gone through is now a very important source of strength for us, and one that we will have on our agenda for the years to come. In this regard, we are aiming toward attaining sustainable growth, enhancing the investment environment, labor market reforms, tax reform, and dealing with the informal economy. Reforms in the finance sector are aimed at making Istanbul one of the top 10 financial centers globally; these are some of the key agenda items for us.</p><h4>Turkey's current account deficit is a noted concern. What sort of measures may be necessary to keep the deficit under control?</h4><p>Strong economic performance on one hand and high dependency on oil and natural gas imports on the other have brought about a relatively high current account deficit. Bearing this problem in mind, we are designing and implementing fiscal and monetary policies so as to gradually bring down the current account deficit. Furthermore, we are aware of the importance of targeted structural reforms to fight this problem. This may require more R&amp;D spending, more innovation, more high-tech production, higher value-added production in Turkey, and even better education policies, which will ultimately help generate yet higher value-added production.</p><p>On the fiscal policy side, we are determined to maintain our tight policy stance. Generating a primary surplus is not an easy thing to do during turbulent times, but we were able to do this in 2011 and will continue to do so until 2014. A tight fiscal policy stance is going to be one of our most important tools. Another important tool is going to be proactive measures by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) to maintain financial stability. Without these necessary measures, some negative consequences for financial stability might occur. The CBRT is also looking from that perspective. Furthermore, increasing R&amp;D spending in Turkey, and moving to higher value-added production is going to be important. In 2010, our R&amp;D spending was 0.8% of GDP. For the year 2023, our target is to reach an R&amp;D spending level of 3% of GDP, where 1% comes from the public sector and 2% comes from the private sector.</p><h4>After GDP growth of 8.5% in 2011, what are some of the key measures that the government's Medium-term Program is looking to introduce regarding growth?</h4><p>The Medium-term Program covers the period between 2012 and 2014. The next three years, as signaled by the global economic outlook or the European economic outlook, are not going to be easy. Our Medium-term Program is in line with a mediocre medium-term outlook for the global economy. We are targeting growth rates of 4% for 2012, and 5% for 2013 and 2014. Compared with many countries, it is probably still a relatively high rate of growth, though below our potential. Turkey's growth potential is much higher. Although a better outcome than projected would be much appreciated, we also need to be prepared for the worst global scenario. This was our motivation when preparing our Medium-term Program.</p><p>In the area of fiscal policies, the target deficit for 2014 is 1%, and now we are at 1.7%. Thus, we will gradually go down from 1.7% to 1%. On the monetary policy side, we have a similar picture. The central bank is independent, and its first priority is price stability. As long as it does not conflict with that priority, the central bank will also take into account the government's growth targets. However, let me underscore one more time that the number one priority for the CBRT is price stability. The CBRT is also going to contribute to financial stability. It will cooperate with other government departments for particular measures on financial stability.</p><p>Regarding the banking system, we are several steps ahead of Europe. However, we want to be ready. Macroeconomic issues, such as production or other financial aspects regarding our banking system, are essential parts of our macroeconomic approach. Further reform areas for the medium term include the labor market, an improved investment environment, financial sector, and taxation policies.</p><h4>What measures are being taken to reduce Turkey's reliance on imports and improve its export performance?</h4><p>We are looking at schemes to produce imported products, for which we have a sustainable competitive advantage in Turkey. It is very important to exclude those products or sectors for which we don't have a sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, we are going to be very picky in that respect.</p><p>Furthermore, we are moving into alternative energy resources. Currently, Turkey is highly dependent on fossil fuels. However, we are putting more emphasis on renewable energy sources. In this regard, literally speaking, hundreds of licenses have been issued for wind power and hydro energy, which have significant amounts of investment. Additionally, solar energy is just starting up. Despite the ongoing debates started after the Fukushima incident, we still think that nuclear energy is crucial for Turkey, as we are not sure whether renewables will be sufficient for our future energy needs. We need at least three nuclear plants in Turkey by the year 2023 in order for nuclear energy to constitute a major part of our energy resources.</p><p>In addition to our energy policy, Turkey needs to be more competitive in the labor market and have better labor-market strategies. Judicial reform to make our courts more efficient, more predictable, and more reliable is going to be very important in making Turkey an easy environment for investors, so that we will have more international investment, especially in terms of FDI. Compared with previous periods, FDI is high, but we think that we can do better.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the key measures that the government's Medium-term Economic Program is looking to achieve?<br></h4><p>The government's main objective during the 2012-2014 period is to increase employment and sustain high-quality growth. In line with our predictions put forward in the Medium-term Economic Program, we expect our economy to grow by 4%, total national income to reach $822 billion, and income per capita to rise to $10,973 in 2012. Furthermore, it is anticipated that our exports and imports will amount to $148.5 billion and $248 billion, respectively. It is also expected that the current account deficit will be $65.4 billion, falling by  $6.3 billion, while the ratio of the current account deficit to GDP will recede to 8%.</p><h4>How can you reassure foreign investors that Turkey remains a secure destination for trade and investment?</h4><p>Our government's policies and attitudes toward investments have received positive feedback from both domestic and foreign investors. Investment incentive statistics, including data for FDI and domestic investments, verify this view. Between 1990 and 2000, Turkey attracted FDI worth $8.7 billion. Between 2001 and 2011, on the other hand, this amount increased more than 13 fold, reaching a total of $114 billion. This rate of increase was above the world average, as well as the relevant increase in developing countries, which was around three fold.</p><p>In 2011, Turkey received FDI worth $15.9 billion, exceeding the $9 billion awarded in 2010. This upward trend in FDI, in an era of negative economic circumstances and global crisis, is a good indication of investor confidence in Turkey.</p><p>In 2011, 71% of capital inflows originated from EU countries. This shows that European investors did not lose confidence in the Turkish market, despite the eurozone crisis. According to United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) statistics, Turkey attracted one-third of the investments that were destined for the politically and economically turbulent North African and Middle Eastern countries. Consequently, I am proud to say that Turkey has a strong potential to become the world leader in terms of foreign investment.</p><h4>Turkey's current account deficit is a noted concern. What measures are necessary to keep the deficit under control?</h4><p>The current account deficit is an issue that we carefully study. The issue stems from the structural features of the Turkish economy. The foreign trade deficit, which is the main determinant of the current account deficit, rises in periods of economic growth depending on issues such as domestic and foreign demand, as well as the value of the Turkish lira.</p><p>We focus on what we should do beyond our short-term measures. In this context, we analyzed the import intensive industries, executed the Input Supply Strategy (GİTES), and employed structural solutions. This strategy targets increasing the efficiency in production and the capability of our industry as well as enhancing export-oriented production. We seek to reduce the dependence of our exports on intermediate goods, such as energy and non-energy raw materials. This will improve the value-added generated in Turkey. The main goals of GİTES are to ensure continuity and to increase the efficiency and security of the supplies needed by the industry. Once these goals are attained, a more balanced relationship between growth and the current account deficit will be maintained.</p><p>The new incentive package is one of the most concrete results of GİTES, which aims to find a permanent solution to the current account deficit so as to maintain development in our country. The new incentive scheme is designed to serve three main needs of our economy: the integration of investment-production-employment-export policies; the production of imported intermediate goods; and the transition from labor-intensive technology to knowledge-intensive technology for exports. In this context, the new incentive scheme consists of four main components: general, regional, large-scale, and strategic investment incentives. These are expected to reduce the imported inputs that aggravate our current account issue, and increase the production of high value-added and competitive goods on the domestic market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures are being taken to reduce Turkey's reliance on imports and improve its export performance?<br></h4><p>The export volume of Turkey for January-November 2011 has increased by 20% compared to the same period in previous years, and eventually reached a level of $122.5 billion. Import volumes have increased by 33.5% and reached a level of $220 billion. These figures represent a trade deficit of some $97.5 billion.</p><p>These figures indicate a foreign trade and current account deficit in Turkey. This problem cannot be resolved in the short term because of cyclical and structural causes that underlie the foreign trade deficit, and thus the current account deficit. The foreign trade deficit is on a rapid rise as a result of the fast increase in imports and weak domestic demand in our traditional export markets, as well as by robust domestic consumption, investment demands, and the high dependency of production on the importation of intermediate goods. However, there is no need to fear. Our government has taken and will continue to take the necessary measures. In this framework, we will continue to implement action plans for the improvement of the investment climate; resolutely fight the informal economy; complete the Strategies for the Diversification of Export-Oriented Production, Input Procurement, and Export Markets; continue to take further steps to reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources; and ensure the effective application of programs for the development of R&amp;D and innovation.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to offset the rise of iron and steel prices as a result of the depreciating lira?</h4><p>Iron and steel products may be classified among the product groups that are of the greatest importance for Turkey's exports and imports. For example, global iron and steel exports totaled $387 billion in 2010. With its iron and steel export valued at $8 billion for that year, Turkey ranked 15th as a global exporter. The iron and steel import volume of Turkey is $16 billion, and Turkey ranks among the world's top six importers. Iron and steel ranks as the third largest item in Turkey's export and import mix. Iron and steel exports were valued around $10 billion and the import volume was $18 billion in 2011. These foreign trade figures show that iron and steel import and export volumes are increasing despite the depreciation of the Turkish lira. However, we never consider the growth of our foreign trade as a “finished process." On the contrary, we are currently striving to find an appropriate answer to the question of how we may further enhance our economy and trade. In this respect, increasing iron and steel prices is on the agenda of our Ministry. We aim to create a joint platform to bring together iron and steel producers, traders, and contractors to discuss existing problems. We are trying to ensure that sectorial representatives develop solutions to these issues, and these will be further discussed at a participatory platform under the coordination of our Ministry.</p><h4>How has the Ministry of Customs and Trade improved intellectual property rights laws in Turkey?</h4><p>Our Ministry aims to increase the efficiency of the customs offices, both in respect to legislation and practice, with an ultimate view of preventing the breach of intellectual and industrial rights in the domain of foreign trade. In line with this aim, we exhaustively amended the current legislation in 2009.</p><p>Owing to the legislative amendments of October 2009 in the customs area, Turkey's current legislation became mostly harmonized with the relevant regulations of the EU.</p><p>Software aimed at preserving intellectual and industrial rights was also developed in October 2009. A database has been developed based on this software, and it covers the contact details and the information and illustrations relating to the comparisons of original and counterfeit products. The information and documents digitally uploaded to this database may now be rapidly and accurately accessed by all customs officials nationwide.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As one of the first investment companies to come to Turkey from the GCC, what have been your most successful investments?<br></h4><p>This is Turkapital's fourth year—we started operations in 2008. Given the circumstances and the environment globally, ours has been a success story. We're seeing that many of our peers, investment houses, and companies operating in the same market have lost their capital. In our case our capital has been preserved and we're growing. Over the last four years of operations we have acquired an auto fleet and leasing company, Autoland. It began 2012 with 3,500 cars, but when we bought it in 2008, it had only 150 cars.</p><p>We acquired it with very a small investment of around $1 million. We injected the capital and then grew the company. Our plans for 2012 and beyond are to grow and reach 5,000 more cars.</p><h4>What about other fields?</h4><p>We have established an insurance company called Neova. This has been a huge challenge, but I think it will be one of the best performers under Turkapital. The company's first year of operation was 2010, and we closed 2010 with about TL60 million in revenues and premiums. For 2011, we closed with about TL90 million in revenues.</p><h4>What's behind this success?</h4><p>We have an edge, and it's helping, which is that we use Kuveyt Türk's branches as our sales points, but we're also accessing the other participation banks and their branches.</p><p>We have signed with alBaraka, which means 150 branches, and Türkiye Finans (120 branches), and so on. We have almost 400 branches that Neova uses as its sales points. In addition, there are around 300-400 agents nation wide. It is this network that has yielded such incredible results.</p><h4>In which other countries in the region does Turkapital have significant investment?</h4><p>We use Turkey as our base, but we have been looking at Central Asia, and we have acquired a shopping mall in Azerbaijan, which is performing very well. We have an office in Baku, and we are looking at more assets to book and to expand. We also have an office in Tatarstan. Russia is a little bit challenging—we have been there for about three years and we haven't booked any assets.</p><p>Luckily, the office is small, so we don't incur many costs; we hope to see something happening in Russia and Tatarstan, especially over the next six months to a year. There is good potential, and Tatarstan will also host the 2013 World Student Games, which opens a lot of potential for development. We hadn't looked at Eastern Europe in our first four years, so we did a fact-finding trip to Bosnia and Croatia, and there are some good opportunities there.We are now studying, but we haven't committed or decided what to do yet. However, there are some good opportunities coming up, hopefully.</p><h4>How does Turkapital work with Turkey's dynamic economy?</h4><p>As far as the Turkish lira and the other economical ups and downs are concerned, this is part of the market dynamic, and we do what it takes to adapt whether it's hedging or whatever else it takes. We are part of the market, and we are living with the market—we try and take good advantage of any opportunities we see, but at this point we see everything as an opportunity.</p><p>In 2001 when the major crisis hit Turkey, Kuveyt Türk came out winning and gaining as there was a run on the banks and people wanted their money and deposits. The banks were so scared and concerned that they were losing their funds. In our case, we paid every single penny to every depositor. Even those whose deposits were not mature wanted their money before time, and we gave it to them. It gave our clients confidence and it showed them our strength. We try to take advantage of all the opportunities and also to be prepared for any crisis or hiccup in the market.</p><h4>Are you still looking for new projects within Turkey?</h4><p>In general terms, our interest in private equity and real estate will continue. We also see more sectors opening up to private equity.</p><p>Istanbul is almost like a country on its own. There is always demand for improved living standards, housing standards, and so on. Smaller housing units for families are in demand near shopping centers, and we will also be looking into opportunities there.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the business environment for foreign investors in Turkey?<br></h4><p>In 2009, Turkey's economy managed to grow by 9% and became the fastest growing economy in its region. In the first half of 2011, we grew by 10.2% and became the fastest growing economy in the world, surpassing China, India and, Argentina.</p><p>Our FDI laws grant national treatment to foreign investors. There are no limitations, no restrictions, and no permissions required, except in a few specific sectors. Investors are subject to the same rules, laws, and regulations as local companies. Entering and exiting the Turkish market is quite easy. We have a very liberal business environment. Furthermore, company establishment procedures were simplified remarkably. Foreign investors can register their companies in five or six days at the most and start doing business shortly thereafter. Investors are also granted quite generous investment incentives. Thus, we highly recommend to our foreign friends that they consider Turkey as a serious option in their search for new markets.</p><h4>The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (İTO) is one of the largest of its kind in the world. How significant is its role within the Turkish economy?</h4><p>İTO represents a considerably large portion of the Turkish business community. Before anything else, this stems from Istanbul's great share and weight in the Turkish economy. With more than 25% of total GDP, around 50% of total external trade volume, nearly 28% of total industrial value added, a sixth of Turkey's population, 43% of the state's total tax revenues, 50% of all foreign investments, and one-quarter of all commercial companies, we call Istanbul “the heart and the brain" of the Turkish economy. As a result, İTO is one the largest chambers in the world with more than 300,000 active members. This puts great responsibility on our shoulders, and we try to actively participate in reshaping the Turkish economy and business environment in parallel with the needs and demands of our members.</p><p>We develop big projects not only for Istanbul, but also for the whole country. Several years ago, we developed the “Eastern Anatolia Tourism Focused Development Project" in cooperation with other public institutions. One of our biggest and most recent projects is the “Istanbul Technology Development Zone," which is expected to become operational in 2013, attract 1,000 companies, and create $10 billion worth of value-added in high-tech industries.</p><p>We also focus heavily on improving Turkey's foreign economic and commercial relations.</p><h4>What sort of regulatory changes do you think still need to be made to improve the business environment in Turkey?</h4><p>Although the Turkish business environment has improved remarkably over the last decade, I believe there are still some urgent issues ahead of us. Reducing the tax burdens on employment further, increasing the flexibility of the labor market, combating the informal economy, substantially reforming our judicial system, making the intellectual property rights system more effective, and eliminating some bureaucratic procedures will improve Turkey's business environment much further and make the country more attractive and competitive for doing business.</p><h4>What are the most important recent changes to the Turkish Commercial Code that foreign investors should be aware of?</h4><p>From July 2012, it will be possible to establish a joint stock company with only one shareholder, as opposed to the five shareholders required in the current law. This shift represents an attitude in favor of SMEs, which will have the opportunity to be discharged from unlimited responsibility by forming a joint stock company. It has some important implications for foreign investors as well, since they no longer have to find partners in order to fulfill the minimum partner requirement. There is also a possibility for existing companies to restructure as single shareholder companies without the risk of dissolution.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey currently imports 75% of its energy, which is equivalent to 99 million tons of oil annually, and it is expected to need 218 million tons of oil by 2020. How do you see current geopolitical situations affecting Turkey's energy needs?<br></h4><p>Our understanding of the future of our domestic market is based on a stable, predictable, vivid market with well-defined rules open to all investors. Therefore, our neighbors as well as overseas investors are welcome. When we draft our regulations, we don't discriminate against investors according to their nationalities, but we are witnessing mutually beneficial energy relations with the countries close to us. While Turkish energy firms are investing in Iraq and Georgia, European energy investors are increasingly participating in the Turkish energy market. We believe that this trend will continue evenly at an increasing pace because every regulation we have put in place is creating a more stable, predictable, open, and transparent market. The increasing number of foreign firms operating in the Turkish energy market is a clear indicator of this fact. The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources has the primary responsibility of determining energy policies and dealing with the geopolitical environment. In this respect, the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) doesn't have any direct responsibility regarding geopolitical situations. However, the purpose of the law is to ensure the delivery of sufficient, high-quality, low-cost, and environmentally friendly electricity. Hence, the aim of EMRA is to ensure a sound legal framework for the development of the energy market and form a more liberal trading environment in which every market participant bears its own costs. Under these conditions, market participants will display the necessary elasticity to find the most appropriate supply resources for themselves. As we saw during the last natural gas bottleneck, in a competitive market environment the market responded to rising electricity market prices, and more capacity became more readily available. However, we can work closely with the Ministry to prepare the relevant policies and seek the implementation of these policies in the market environment.</p><h4>What necessary steps need to be taken to prevent electricity shortages?</h4><p>We have to make sure that we have a thorough understanding of why electricity shortages occur. Is it because of capacity, infrastructure, or an unpredictable balancing issue? Each reason has different solutions. I believe efficiency is extremely important. Turkey has published a new Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper, not because of shortages but because we want to make sure that every lira consumers spend on energy results in maximum utility. In addition to that, Demand Side Management (DSM) in the EU or Demand Response (DR) in the US are also important. As a short-term solution, smart grids can provide a solution as “grid-friendly" household appliances switch their electricity needs automatically with price signals. The lack of capacity is also another major reason for electricity shortages. As the regulatory authority, we are implementing some significant regulations. Licensing procedures are being simplified. It is expected that through the encouragement of private sector investment, the necessary capacity will be utilized.</p><h4>What are the prospects for nuclear energy in the country?</h4><p>Nuclear energy needs very detailed regulation and the Turkish Atomic Energy Agency (TAEK) handles these regulations. As stated by International Energy Agency (IEA) Chief Economist Fatih Birol, “Turkey has to commission multiple nuclear power plants." Our government is also decisive on this issue. I personally believe there are very good prospects for nuclear energy in Turkey. However, security is the primary concern.</p><h4>How will the continuing privatization of the electricity generation sector impact Turkey's current account deficit?</h4><p>Imports related to the energy sector are one of the most important lines in the current account balance. Turkey is dependent on imports, especially in its primary energy needs such as oil and natural gas. Gas is predominantly used in power generation. I do believe that the privatized electricity generation industry in Turkey will be able to receive the right price signals so that new investments will be in close harmony with the strategic objectives of the government. In addition to that, we expect plants will be operated more efficiently. The existing capacity will then be used more efficiently and the investment requirement will be decreased. In a more liberal investment environment, investors will have trust and they will be able to invest in technologies with higher capital expenditure such as hydro and coal, which will reduce the deficit.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Bank Audi's development strategy revolves around pursuing cross-border expansion toward new, promising, and captive markets both in the region and outside it. Within this environment, the group added an important milestone to its expansion overseas by getting a license to establish a banking entity in Turkey on October 27, 2011. The fact that Bank Audi was privileged to be the first entity in 12 years to be granted a license by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) is an acknowledgment of its strong financial standing and eligibility. The importance of this development, with what it entails in terms of promising growth prospects, is tied to its expected impact on further consolidating the group's leading regional position and strengthening its competitive standing.<br></p><p>Bank Audi's interest in expanding its banking operations in Turkey is based on the strong historic ties between Turkey and the Arab world, supported by an increasing annual trade turnover, reaching $40 billion in 2011, of which an important share is with countries where Bank Audi is present, offering enticing opportunities for cross-border transactions between the two geographic areas.</p><p>The Turkish expansion will particularly drive the bank toward the fast developing middle corporate segment, offering important lending potential. In addition, the group, which enjoys a high level of liquidity, will benefit from the high-quality financing opportunities that large creditworthy Turkish corporations provide, allowing the bank to build a captive market share. In the longer run, the group will explore the possibility of developing targeted retail products for specific segments, which would build a new value-added franchise.</p><p>Bank Audi intends to develop commercial banking activities in Turkey along five business segments, consisting mainly of cash and payroll management, treasury services, working capital financing to SMEs and family businesses, and project financing. In addition, the bank will participate in the financing of Turkish international trade, in particular inter-Arab trade through the issuance of letters of credits and letters of guarantee. The bank targets a network of 50-60 branches in a few years' time, mainly in big cities, and this will be critical to capturing such lucrative financing opportunities.</p><p>We will adopt a strategy of targeting relationships with a selection of companies as well as the acquisition of related market shares in commercial banking.</p><p>Beyond corporate banking, the bank will target the financing of medium-sized enterprises with low turnovers that are in need of financing to accomplish their projects. That segment comprises, essentially, industries of average sizes, regional sub-contractors of large importers, and retail businesses. The development of that type of clientele will mainly depend on the rollout of branches in various Turkish cities. The bank will also target small enterprises to which it will be catering cash management services and short-term working capital financing. At the international level, the subsidiary in Turkey will benefit from the presence of Bank Audi in many countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe, to offer to the companies that are present in the region various services including trade financing and project financing.</p><p>Bank Audi has developed important resources in the fields of commercial and corporate banking that will be at the disposal of the Turkish subsidiary.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Turkey to Visa Europe and the company's global operations?<br></h4><p>Turkey has been part of Visa Europe from the very beginning, and over the years it has become one of Visa's most critical markets. It is strong in terms of size—the Turkish market has the largest number of cards within Visa Europe. We have 79 million cards, 30 million of which are credit cards, and 49 million are debit cards. In terms of total usage, we are fourth after the UK, France, and Spain. In terms of credit card usage, we are number one in Europe. In Turkey, we have generated ‚¬63 billion worth of sales volumes in 2011. Not only do we have card numbers that are of a significant size for Visa Europe, we also bring major volumes to the table. On top of that, Turkey is a high-growth market, and we have achieved an annual growth rate of 25% in terms of sales volume. We are also an important market because Turkey has become an innovation hub. Our center of excellence is working on R&amp;D projects and cutting-edge payment solutions.</p><h4>How will Visa tap into Turkey's growth potential given that roughly 50% of the population is unbanked?</h4><p>If you look at personal consumption in Turkey, 16% of expenditure is made via a Visa card. Our competition is centered on the use of cash. To compete with cash, we have to do several things. We need to reach more people and places where cards can be used. For the unbanked, we need to find channels and products that reach them. We are considering pre-paid and mobile options, as many of the unbanked use cell phones. Financial awareness and literacy is very important in Turkey, and to support this, we are working with the Ministry of Development, the UNDP, and the Habitat Center for Development and Governance. We have collectively started a corporate social responsibility project called “I Can Manage My Money" with the support of our member banks. Since its inception in 2009, the main objective has been to raise the financial awareness of young people, increase their levels of financial literacy, and assist them in contributing to a more sustainable economy. Also, the project will enhance the socio-economic empowerment of young people and assist Turkey in reaching its Millennium Development Goals. At the end of its second year, the training sessions are being delivered by 234 trainers in 59 cities, reaching 13,000 young people directly from all across Turkey.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in Turkey's payment sector?</h4><p>We have many debit cards that are not being used at the point of sale. In fact, 95% of people use their debit cards at ATMs, which leaves a gap and a big opportunity—as big as the opportunity for credit cards to perform direct purchases. It is a really simple product; people have money on their cards and the money is in the bank. It is important to note that taking out cash does not benefit the consumer or the economy; when cash is in your pocket, it cannot become investment or credit. This creates an environment that is prone to an unregistered economy. Turkey represents the most exciting debit growth opportunity in Europe, as one in seven card transactions are done via debit cards. In September 2011 we launched a cash-back service that was designed to grow debit card usage in Turkey. Cashback was launched on Visa Electron debit cards in leading super markets chains and bookstores. By the end of 2012, the service will be available at 1,800 sales points. Later in 2012, we will commence Balance Checker, an SMS balance service to help consumers stay in control. Also, e-commerce is opening up to debit on popular online shopping web sites, and we will start rolling out contactless cards. In terms of credit, Turkey has traditionally been a credit market. However, there are more than 1 million SMEs in Turkey, and the right product for them is a commercial card with an improved management information system (MIS) and more control. In 2011, we saw a growth in debit card usage of more than 50%, and 50% in e-commerce and commercial usage. Our total growth was 25%, and debit cards, commercial solutions, and e-commerce are becoming strong growth drivers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures is the Ministry of Tourism taking to ensure that growth is sustainable and on track to meet the 2023 targets?<br></h4><p>Turkey is grabbing a slice of history as a rapidly growing country and is strengthening its brand value in the world tourism market. There is no doubt that this achievement is not a coincidence. Turkey came to this point through our ministry's politics, strategies, and promotional activities. Despite the heavy global economic crisis in the past few years, Turkey has maintained consistent tourism growth. In 2011, we reached seventh place in the World Tourism Organization's ranking, showing a 10% rate of growth. In 2012, with the same consistent growth, we reached sixth place. We still have faith that in 2023, which is the 100th anniversary of the Turkish Republic, we will achieve our goal to reach 50 million tourists and $50 billion in tourism income. We continue our work to make this target sustainable.</p><h4>Which segments of Turkey's tourism and hospitality sector saw the largest investments over the past few years?</h4><p>Since the 1980s, important infrastructure and superstructure investments have been made in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions. By developing infrastructure opportunities, service quality, and luxurious hotels, these regions have become two of the most important sea tourism centers in the world. In accordance with our goal to spread tourism throughout the country and boost the tourism potential we have, new investments are being made. Through the Tourism Development Regions, Tourism Cities, Eco-tourism Areas, and Brand Cities programs, regions that have tourism potential are treated through an integrated approach. Our approach to tourism is integrated with incentives for private sector investments, tourism infrastructure, donations for archeological digs and research, new cultural centers, and promotions. We have begun to realize urban tourism projects in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, and Antalya. We also have work aimed at cultural and faith tourism, especially in Adıyaman, Amasya, Bursa, Edirne, Mardin, Åžanlıurfa, Nevşehir, Gaziantep, Trabzon, Kars, Kütahya, and Konya. The purpose of this work is to increase the number of arrivals, so we improved our air transportation network and accommodation facilities in order to meet the demand.</p><h4>What are the incentives for FDI in Turkey's tourism sector?</h4><p>We take various economic measures to attract foreign capital to our country. Prime Minister Erdoğan has highlighted many new investment areas in Turkey. Needless to say, tourism is becoming one of our most important sectors. There is a directorate at the Ministry of Economy for foreign investment incentives, and our ministry continues to improve infrastructure and superstructure.</p><h4></h4><h4>What steps are being taken to promote MICE tourism in Turkey?</h4><p>MICE tourism is growing at 5% annually.  It is a fast-growing, open-ended sector. Its most important advantages are that it can be active throughout the year, and one congress participant spends three times more money than the average tourist. MICE tourism requires long-term planning; it ensures sustainability during sudden economic crises. Meanwhile, it plays a major role in terms of contribution to the country's intellectual life and the communication between businesspeople. Turkey is a convenient MICE tourism center in terms of its geographical position, transportation capacity, new accommodation facilities, climate, and natural and historical wealth. Those travelling for congress tourism are opinion leaders in their own countries. In this sense, it contributes to the promotion of our country. We are trying to improve MICE tourism by highlighting our rich resources. In 2008, we were ranked 28th, but in 2010, we moved up to the 20th position. Istanbul hosts important annual meetings for international organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank, and NATO. The International Congress and Convention Association decided to hold their 2014 congress in Antalya, and 3,500 professionals are expected to attend. The general congresses for travel association ABTA and textile organization ITAA will take place in Antalya in 2012, and ANRV's general congress is set to take place in Istanbul. The World Botanic Expo 2016 is also set to be held in Antalya, and the UEFA Congress 2012 took place in Istanbul.</p><h4>Istanbul was selected as the 2010 European Capital of Culture and is the European Capital of Sport in 2012. What is the significance of holding these titles?</h4><p>Istanbul has hosted many important organizations and has become the European Capital of Sport in 2012. We have made all the necessary preparations and promotion in cooperation with the European Capital of Culture Agency. These international titles strengthen our present brand position and foster international cooperation and communication channels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate the EBRD's contribution to the development of Turkey since its entrance into the country?<br></h4><p>We have been here for three years. Turkey is a new country of operations for the EBRD outside of the former communist block, so it was a different country for us and we deliberately had a modest investment of ‚¬150 million in the first year, ‚¬500 million in the second year, increasing to ‚¬1 billion in 2011. That's supplemented by co-financing. We have been focused on key areas, including sustainable energy, which is very important for Turkey. We've put quite a lot of money into things like renewable energy as well as energy efficiency for industries and for small businesses, and I think that has made quite a good impact. The EBRD has been able to give resources to banks to use in areas that they would not have looked at otherwise. Small business finance, for example, is another area where we have been able to make a difference. The EBRD has also been supporting privatization. We have provided financing for a privatized power distribution company and a privatized gas distribution company. As well, we have been looking at ports and supporting large public-private partnership (PPP) projects.</p><h4>How do you assess overall financing for renewable energy companies, and how is the EBRD co-financing this sector?</h4><p>The lack of medium- and long-term resources in the banks is a big issue. They do not have any access to longer-term debt financing in Turkish lira, and that's one issue in the country that everybody is concerned about and must work on. However, the banks also do not receive significant medium- or longer-term resources from the international market. This is important because renewable projects need funding for 10 to 12 years, and Turkish banks typically can't provide 12-year financing without running a maturity mismatch. Alongside that, we have a strong consultancy group in place to advise on financing structures for renewable projects, environmental issues, and social due diligence. Our project is very focused on those three things: delivering expertise for structuring, delivering expertise for environmental due diligence, and delivering longer-term money. So far we have co-financed ‚¬900 million. We are in the process of delivering this through the banks, and although it isn't much, it is enough to make a difference. We have also financed some larger renewable projects directly with Turkish sponsors.</p><h4>What is the level of awareness of the EBRD's activities among Turkish banks?</h4><p>The Turkish banking sector knows us very well and actively seeks our finance. In 2011, around 40% of the funding to Turkey will go through banks. Within the corporate sector we are getting a few high-profile transactions. When we arrived in Turkey, Turkish business already knew us quite well because we had invested and supported a number of Turkish investors in other countries and there was a queue of people at our door immediately. Our issue was more how to squeeze significant business potential into the available funding envelope rather than developing a deeper market. The target regions for us are the south and east—the most difficult parts of the country. We'd like to make a real difference, and so it has taken a lot of time going out and meeting with businesses, business associations, development agencies, and regional development agencies, trying to build a profile. It's a big country. Mining is fairly big down in these areas as well as manufacturing, but agribusiness has the most potential. That's what we are trying to target with our money.</p><h4>How would you say transparency among corporate business has improved in Turkey since the EBRD started operations here?</h4><p>We are getting a lot of interest from mid-sized, family-owned companies that are going through a transition themselves. Turkish businesses are dominated by family ownership, and after two or three generations they are growing aware of all sorts of things: raising capital, listing publicly, and dealing with the markets in general in a transparent way. One of the main reasons for coming to work with the EBRD is that companies can use our approaches to present themselves internationally in a transparent manner. There is a good attitude, and there is certainly a lot of demand for our involvement for those reasons.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What drove the 9.5% growth in the ICT sector last year?</h4><p>We experienced remarkable growth in the ICT sector in 2011. The objective of President Santos in ICT is simple: to use the internet to reduce poverty and create jobs. That's the focus. We want to expand internet penetration at the bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid. We are installing internet access in a large number of schools. We are also focusing on increasing technological awareness and teaching technological skills to teachers, students, and citizens. Thanks to our policies, Colombia is the fastest growing market in terms of internet penetration and computer sales in Latin America. The government's aim is to increase internet connectivity four fold by 2014. In the first two years of this administration, internet use increased from 2.2 million to 5.5 million connections. If we continue at this pace, we will achieve our goal.</p><h4>How is the ministry planning its ambitious connectivity targets?</h4><p>We see the industry as an ecosystem with several elements. Our aim is to make that ecosystem grow. The first element of the ecosystem is infrastructure. Every country needs permanent investment in ICT infrastructure. At the beginning of this administration, only 200 towns had fiber-optic connections. Less than 20% of the municipalities were connected to the fiber-optic network. Fiber-optic technology is what we need to transmit the media we use today for videos, images, and teleconferencing. For us, the key was to expand the network. Now we have the network connected to 100% of all municipalities. Building a fiber-optic network depends on economic feasibility as well, and sometimes the government has to subsidize the network, which is what we do here.</p><div class="quote">“In five years, I see Colombia as a leader in the region in terms of application development."</div><h4>What role do public-private partnerships (PPP) play in developing this infrastructure?</h4><p>Initially, it is not a very profitable business, and so the best way to go about it was through public-private partnerships (PPPs). We put $230 million on the table, and we auctioned the money to the private company that offered the highest number of municipalities that would be connected to that network. Several international companies participated, and a Mexican company got the job. For every peso we put into this program, the private sector puts in four pesos. The PPP model is very important for the success of our efforts.</p><h4>How is the government pushing to develop the ICT sector further?</h4><p>The government is helping the industry grow through subsidies. Our first goal was to have the cheapest computers in Latin America so that more households have computer access. Now Colombia has much cheaper computers than the US, and we accomplished this by eliminating taxes on computers. There are no duties or VAT, and anyone can sell computers in Colombia; it's a very open market. Colombia now has the fastest growing market for computers in Latin America. Fiscally speaking, reducing taxes for technological development increases revenues in the long run. If technology is cheaper, the economy moves faster and produces more revenue. This is why we eliminated VAT for computers at the base of the pyramid. We know that making the internet cheaper has both economic and social benefits.</p><h4>The Ministry is focusing on increasing internet usage in schools. How are you going to achieve this?</h4><p>We have attached great importance to spreading the internet and improving computer penetration in schools. Our Computadoras Para Educar program won a prize for being one of the most innovative programs in the world in 2012. We buy a lot of computers at auction and get the best prices. We aim for the most efficient procurement process possible, and we get those computers at half the market price. The Ministry also offers teacher-training programs, and a certification program called the Digital Citizen, which teachers receive upon passing a test. By the first quarter of 2014, 1 million children will have tablets provided by those operators, which is one of the conditions of these license auctions.</p><h4>What other initiatives is the Ministry involved in?</h4><p>The role of the government is to generate demand. We have a very comprehensive e-government plan for Colombia. We will have e-defense, e-justice, and other e-portals for government ministries. All ministries will be accessible by the internet for citizens. Other projects we are focusing on are mobile coverage and social penetration in the mobile phone industry as well as increasing internet use through for the mobile segment. We are replicating the telephony model for the internet. The way to increase internet use further will be through wireless. In 2012, 70% of rural communities were connected to the internet, and in 2013 it will be 100%. At the same time we are also supporting the development and use of applications for teachers, homemakers, public servants, and others.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Colombia's ICT sector in the medium term?</h4><p>In five years, I see Colombia as a leader in the region in terms of application development. We have the people, the talent, the demographics, and we are strengthening that through our training programs. The government is also currently auctioning five licenses for 4G bandwidth. Colombia is growing in terms of data centers—the country is increasingly well connected. We have five sub-marine cables connecting Colombia to the world, and two new ones under construction, meaning we have excellent international connectivity.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the achievements of the Five-Year Development Plan, and has it changed the landscape of the insurance industry?</h4><p>Stable countries generally maintain programs for the insurance industry that have a good outlook for the future. Having been stable, Iran also has not only a Five-Year Development Plan, but also a 20-Year Outlook, both approved by our Great Leader, the Iranian Parliament, and the cabinet. Accordingly, the Five-Year Development Plan has been devised and, currently speaking, we are implementing Phase 5. So far, we have carried out many programs through this platform in order to develop the industry, and the performance of the insurance market has been fine. Our targets in the insurance sector have been achieved, and now we are shifting our focus to long-term goals. Under the guidelines of the Development Plan agenda, we have launched a new approach to the insurance sector that will make the market more competitive and increase the insurance penetration rate. In addition, through the Development Plan, we are investigating strategies that will support the expansion of the sector and promote the regulatory and supervisory position of Bimeh Markazi.</p><h4>How is Bimeh Markazi expanding the Iranian insurance market by encouraging private sector participation?</h4><p>The Iranian insurance industry dates back more than 80 years. As for the Iranian civilization, that goes back 4,000 years ago. There have always been traces of insurance in our culture, which is why I firmly believe that our people have been accustomed to different types of insurance. As far as religious jurisprudence is concerned, insurance was backed by our Great Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, and until recently it has been completely dominated by the government. However, according to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, our country has launched a program that contributes to the privatization of many companies in the realm of the insurance industry. At present, a growing number of private players are involved in the insurance market. Insurance is a religious and legal contract that has its basis in ethics. As the regulator of the Iranian insurance market, we issue licenses and facilitate the entrance of private insurance companies into the market. There are now 25 insurance companies in Iran, and only one of them is owned by the government—the rest are non-governmental.</p><div class="quote">“So far in 2012, the insurance market has grown by 45% in terms of total insurance portfolios."</div><h4>How is Bimeh Markazi acting in order to increase insurance penetration rates?</h4><p>The whole market is worth approximately $10 billion. However, there are challenges that deprive people from enjoying the insurance market to its full extent. In that sense, our aim is to open up the market to allow Iranians to benefit from insurance products for the purpose of appreciating the value of their lives and belongings. We are primarily focusing on life assurance and we intend to expand it to a greater extent. Bimeh Markazi is implementing strategies in order to enhance consumers' interest in life assurance. As an example, we are in the process of developing annuity, disability insurance, housewives' annuity, as well as insurance for artists, musicians, and national heroes, in addition to other segments that can be covered by life assurance policies. We also attempt to enhance public awareness to persuade Iranians to benefit from insurance and guarantee and secure their future. Considering our strategy, life assurance is of prime importance and our staff and team is carefully exploring the trends of life insurance in foreign markets in order to demonstrate how our people can take care of their health and wealth. Currently, various classes of insurance are growing rapidly, including life assurance, household annuity, and disability insurance. As for non-life insurance, we have made considerable efforts concerning factory workers' risks, the development of rural areas, land vehicle transportation, industry, and mining. We invest in financial services as well, which paves the way to increase penetration rates and the further expansion of the ever-increasing market. So far in 2012, the insurance market has grown by 45% in terms of total insurance portfolios, with a 100% increase in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.</p><h4>The Ministry of Petroleum, the Ministry of Industries and Mines, and Bimeh Markazi have announced that they will insure oil tankers traveling from abroad to Iran. What benefits will this bring to the country?</h4><p>Insurance is the messenger of peace. The challenges we are facing have a negative impact on the economy, especially if there is a spillover to insurance companies. As an insurance entity, it is typical to rely on other insurance and reinsurance companies around the world. The international relationship between insurance companies is at risk at the moment, but we are strong and peaceful and continue cooperating with our neighbors and fellow companies. That is why we are insuring oil tankers. Holding such capacity, we welcome any insurance company throughout the world to establish joint cooperation with us. International entities show ever-increasing interest in our market. We have resolved all insurance-related problems internally, and now Bimeh Markazi is able to cover international activities.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the real estate and construction sector evolved since you first became involved in Dubai?</h4><p>We arrived in September 2005 as one of the first British developers since the Dubai freehold market was opened to foreign investors in 2002. It's been a real privilege to actively contribute to the growth of the real estate and construction sector in the Dubai. The Emirate has seen unrivaled development, not just in the quantity but also the quality and creativity of projects.</p><h4>What was your initial strategy when The First Group (TFG) entered the market?</h4><p>Throughout our network, our strategy remains unchanged: deliver quality projects that ensure worry-free returns for our investors. We do our research so we can provide our clients with all the information they need to make informed decisions that meet their investment requirements.</p><div class="quote">“With one-third of the world's population based just four hours away, Dubai is a key hub for global business and travel."</div><h4>What role does Dubai play in TFG's regional operations?</h4><p>With one-third of the world's population based just four hours away, Dubai is a key hub for global business and travel. Its accessibility to the world's business nerve centers has made it a must for most multinational corporations to have headquarters here.</p><h4>What has attracted high-profile investors to work with TFG?</h4><p>A commitment to excellence is part of our corporate DNA, and this shows as we continue to deliver innovative projects in the most desirable locations throughout the world. TFG's team provides investors with the most reliable and up-to-date market information, instilling in them the confidence that we are working with their best interests at heart. Most of all, investors see TFG as a strong, independent organization that has grown throughout the years without compromising its values.</p><h4>What are some of the larger projects that TFG has been involved in?</h4><p>With every project we set out to create an iconic development that delivers the maximum level of returns for our investors. We've most recently handed over premier projects in the TECOM district, the up and coming central business district in Dubai, and are happy to report that the First Central and Metro Central projects are now running at a very high occupancy rate. Investor interest has also increased in commercial properties in Dubai, and so we have introduced the Service Office Leaseback Opportunity (SOLO) to offer straightforward investment solutions in this sector. With SOLO, investors can expect high capital growth whilst they benefit from a share in the exclusive commercial property's rental yield. SOLO offices are serviced and self-contained and will be operated and managed by the Links Group; they will feature contemporary office spaces that run on SMART technology.</p><h4>Will TFG be looking to capitalize on growth in the tourism and hospitality sector?</h4><p>TFG is mostly concerned with developing and managing luxury hotel apartments, the demand for which—with the increase in tourist arrivals in Dubai—is constantly growing. We've also announced a new flagship project, TFG Marina Hotel, which will be located in the amazing Dubai Marina. We not only develop iconic properties, we also manage them for our clients through the dedicated TFG Asset Management division. Our aim is to continuously improve each project's day-to-day operations while safeguarding owners' interests and enhancing their returns.</p><h4>How have you innovated in the market through your direct marketing initiatives?</h4><p>To paraphrase Victor Kiam, “a great product without marketing equals scrap." The key to success is first building a great product and supporting it with good sales and marketing. One of the things we pride ourselves on is our reputation as a trustworthy developer that delivers quality projects with great returns for our clients.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has BCI developed since its restructuring in 2007?</h4><p>Five years ago, the country's top-ranking bank occupied a 47% market share, while we had a 22% share of the market. At the moment, we are still in second place. However, the top-ranking bank currently has just 34% of the market, and BCI now has 30%, so the difference is narrowing. Naturally, our competitors are not sleeping—they are seeking to match our development. If we continue to make investments, offer services that local people demand, and serve SMEs, we are confident that we can become first in the market. I believe that we are already the best bank in terms of services. My shareholders are pressing us to be the top bank in Mozambique, and I think that it will be possible in the medium term.</p><h4>How do financial problems in Portugal affect BCI and its shareholders?</h4><p>Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD) is the biggest bank in Portugal, and it is a state bank. That is a minor problem because it owns 51% of our shares. Another bank in Portugal is BPI, an investment bank chaired by La Caxia from Spain, Itaú from Brazil, and now Isabel Dos Santos from Angola. It owns 30% of BCI's shares. Of the other 19% of the shares, 18% is owned by INSITEC Group and 1% is owned by individual shareholders. In terms of how the situation in Portugal impacts us, for the entire five years we have been targeting important goals to make up for the fact that the shareholders do not invest fresh money. Shareholders have to leave 75% of the dividends in Mozambique. With that money, we are banking in Mozambique. Therefore, we have not felt any impact from the situation in Europe. However, we are managing the bank bearing in mind that we do not have backup funds. As a result, we have to be prudent with our management.</p><div class="quote">“The financial system is very well guided by the Bank of Mozambique."</div><h4>To what extent do you attribute the success of Mozambique's banking sector to sound regulations?</h4><p>The financial system is very well guided by the Bank of Mozambique. I consider it one of the best central banks in the region and one of the best in Africa. Historically, banks in the area have experienced some problems, which led the World Bank and the IMF to force them to build a supervisory bank system. I believe that we have achieved a good system. We are very confident because we have very good regulators and we function as an advisor to the system.</p><h4>How is BCI working to increase the penetration of financial services in Mozambique?</h4><p>BCI is a private and commercial bank that encourages SMEs to grow. We are orienting the bank in terms of local necessities, building a variety of products that are tailored depending on the region. The country is very large and the people come from different backgrounds—residents in Maputo are very different from those in Nampula. We tailor our branch services according to the region, whether the demand is related to agriculture or mining. We offer products suited to the local people and train employees for different regions. Normally, two or three of our people are from the same region, which helps the bank better serve local people. Our motto is “Eu sou daqui," which means “I am from here." We also involve local content in terms of advertising. We have 1,800 people at the company and only 12 are expatriates. However, this system is not easy—we invest heavily in training and travel so that we can learn about each of the regions. Currently, all of my directors except three are from Mozambique. They know what local people want and how we can serve them. I think that this makes a difference.</p><h4>With more than 70% of Mozambique's workforce in the agricultural sector, how is BCI aiming to penetrate the underserved SME market?</h4><p>More than 73% of people in Mozambique are living in rural areas dedicated to subsistence agriculture, and it is not easy to put these people in the banking system. For us, it is a cost. None of the commercial banks want to give credit to the agricultural sector because the risk is very high, the return is very slow, and the profit is very small. People from the agriculture sector cannot develop at the same pace as commercial interest rates, which are very high. However, we are the first bank in Mozambique to have experience in two or three specific projects with USAID, AFD, AICEP, and the Italian government. Five years ago, USAID told us that it wanted some help from commercial banks to support the agricultural sector for the production of crops such as cashews and tomatoes, for example. We told officials that we would join the project under two conditions. One was to share the risk and present it to our shareholders. We took 50% of the risk and invested $20 million. Now, in Nampula, the cashew sector is completely developed. We also have five or six factories for the production of cashews. Of the total $20 million, we only spent $500,000 on this project, which has been very successful. However, it is a risk and there are some problems. In my opinion, the government should create a development bank to play this role.</p><h4>What impact have BCI's partnerships with international finance development organizations made on Mozambique's finance sector?</h4><p>All of the programs with organizations such as USAID, the French Development Bank, and the IFC are dedicated to SMEs. We have one specific program with the IFC, which is for women who run SMEs. It has been a complete success. The IFC in the US told us that we have the best program for women in Mozambique. Unfortunately, there are still commercial issues, which are mainly interest related. We have a specific program that supports women by training them, but the interest rate is high. Regardless, the BCI, the city, and the country believe in the program and this is why we continue to invest here. In addition, we are convincing the shareholders to invest more. We currently operate from 130 branches. Five years ago, we had 41 branches, with no specific credits for the bank. Now, we are number one in the country in terms of credit and we issue cards to everyone. In addition, we facilitate the credit card process and we are monitoring the system and training more people. On August 1, 2012 we launched a completely new innovation to the market—the possibility to transfer money from your account to anywhere else. The recipient of the money does not have to have an account with BCI. You send the money from your mobile, and as long as I receive the code I can go to the ATM and take out the money. We will be the first bank to do this in Mozambique and it will benefit everyone—from an agriculture company in the interior of the country to teachers and health workers in places where it is difficult to get their salary.</p><h4>What role do you think these technological advances will have?</h4><p>There are two major issues we face when developing new technology, which are not associated with the technology itself. One is with electricity—in terms of quantity and quality—and another is with the level and quality of communications. When we install ATMs in the middle of the country, we do not have the comfort of energy from electricity companies. We have to install our own generators. We do not have the comfort of communications technology from communications companies. We have to establish our own satellite dishes. You cannot imagine the challenge it is to set up even one ATM. That is why some of our banking services are more costly.</p><h4>What is your portfolio of international companies that have already signed up with BCI?</h4><p>We received a few companies from our shareholders. I think that the services of BCI locally are attracting all companies from a variety of sectors. We have some international companies that work with other banks internationally, but work with us here because they appreciate our services. We also have some international institutions here working with us. However, the bank has a disadvantage when compared with other banks because we are not in every region of the world. One year after arriving in Mozambique, large organizations are looking to work with us; we are working now with Anadarko, Rio Tinto, and South African Breweries and others. BCI enjoys a good relationship with these big companies, and through them we are serving the company itself and its employees.</p><h4>What are BCI's chief targets for the medium term?</h4><p>We are currently drafting a plan for the next three years. We are focused on growth, which we want to be at least 20% per year. It is a challenge, but when I started this project at BCI the shareholders told me that in the first three years there would be no bonus. The company would invest in the first three years, without expecting any profits. However, in the first year we duplicated profits, seeing 50% growth. In the third year, we grew by 20%. I believe in this country, in the banking system, and in my people. I think that we have the best people in Mozambique working at the bank, with 82% of our workforce under 33 years old. The potential is enormous, albeit risky, but the next three years will be crucial and we will continue to grow. The growth is based on the development of the retail bank, which relies on SMEs and individuals. When we started the program the company was composed of 10% retail and 90% corporate business. Now it is at 30% retail and individual and 70% corporate. We want to make the ratio 50/50 and see profits increase.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Iran Air become one of the leading airlines in the region?</h4><p>Iran Air is Iran's national air carrier. The airline was created by a merger of two companies before the revolution, and our experience goes back to about 70 years. We provide a benchmark and an exclusive model for air carriers domestically, regionally, and internationally. Iran Air was the first airline in Iran to operate jet aircraft. We were also the first to fly to the US with the 747-SB, from Tehran to New York via London, and we have now expanded to approximately 32 destinations internationally. We are the first airline in the region to provide our own training services for our personnel, including but not limited to operations, maintenance, and customer service. Iran Air has a well-organized human resource and training center, and we offer programs in two languages: Farsi and English. In 2011, Iran Air's training center was selected as one of the top 10 training centers in the region by IATA. In terms of safety and passenger loyalty and satisfaction, Iran Air is also a leading airline in the region according to IATA audits. Iran Air has a well-planned integrated network and has done its best under difficult conditions to expand. Today we have 52 aircraft, up from just a dozen or so at the time of the revolution.</p><h4>Iran Air is part of the divestment project run by the government. What opportunities do you see emerging from the privatization project?</h4><p>Iran Air had two subsidiaries: Iran Airtour and Homa Hotel Group, which includes five hotels in Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Bandar Abbas. Iran Airtour carries 2.5 million passengers a year, about 20% of which is on international routes. Iran Airtour previously operated Tupolevs, which are now grounded. It now operates Boeing MD-83 aircraft. Iran Airtour was 100% privatized and separated from Iran Air, and it is doing very well. The Homa Hotel Group will also be privatized. About 90% of the revenue from the hotels comes to Iran Air, which owns the company. Iran Air itself will probably remain about 15% in government hands and be 80% held by private investors. The remaining 5% will go to company employees. Foreign companies are legally prohibited from becoming shareholders of Iran Air unless they are approved by the government.</p><div class="quote">“We want to expand the company, add new routes, and provide better service domestically and internationally."</div><h4>How have you expanded your destinations over the last few years?</h4><p>New destinations depend on demand and company policy. In the past two years, we expanded our routes mostly to our neighbors, such as Iraq, where a lot of our citizens want to go to on holy pilgrimages. We fly to Baghdad and Najaf, two very important cities. There is good demand for those destinations. Sometimes we add destinations based on the government demands as well.</p><h4>How many passengers do you carry annually?</h4><p>We carry 6 million passengers per year, or about 8.7 million including Iran Airtour, which is now a separate company. About 6.2 million passengers are domestic and the rest are international. We have about 100 domestic flights a day to some 28 destinations. Internationally, we have 32 destinations. The highest demand these days is on the Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, route, for which we have five or six flights a week with Boeing 747s. It is one of our longest routes: an eight-hour flight time. One reason for such a high demand is that Iranian nationals do not need visas to go there. Domestically, Tehran-Mashhad is important, since it's a holy city. Flights between Tehran and Bandar Abbas, as well as Tabriz, Shiraz, Ahvaz, Rasht, and Isfahan see large passenger volumes. Domestic fares are regulated by the government, but this isn't the case with the international fares. Due to strong competition among foreign and domestic airlines, supply and demand controls the international fares. We believe most of our international passengers prefer to fly with Iranian carriers because they get a chance to communicate in their own native tongue during their flight and have Iranian cuisine. When given a choice, I think Iranians, including Iranians living abroad, prefer to travel overseas with their own national carrier.</p><h4>Which innovations would you like to see in the aviation infrastructure in Iran in the future?</h4><p>We want to expand the company, add new routes, and provide better service domestically and internationally. Until 10 years ago, we sent our aircraft abroad for maintenance and overhaul; however, we are now more self sufficient and perform 100% of our maintenance and overhaul in Iran in our own hangars, from light checks to heavy checks. The company is not 100% self-reliant when it comes to aircraft components, but we are working to improve our proficiency in this area. We are able to lease aircraft from abroad and operate them here, but I believe we should buy and have our own aircraft and train our own pilots and technicians as well. Leasing aircraft takes care of short-term business needs, but I think this isn't enough for Iran. We need to transfer technology to Iran and build up the airline industry here. Our objective should be to invest as much in the technical side as in the commercial side. Iran Air provides services to 85% of the airlines that fly to Iran. In Mashhad, there are six or seven foreign airlines operating, and they are efficiently serviced by Iran Air. Also, when you look at other smaller airline companies in Iran, you'll find that they are mostly staffed by retired and former Iran Air personnel. This is a source of pride for us, and it is a consequential result of nearly 70 years of field experience.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DEKA's mission is “to foster innovation." What is the history of the company in that regard?</h4><p>I founded DEKA 30 years ago after I sold my first business, AutoSyringe. I wanted to create a company that was focused completely on the research and development of new technologies, and I'm proud to say that in the decades since, my engineers and I have dedicated ourselves to redefining “state-of-the-art" in a number of different areas. There are always challenges and frustrations, but DEKA only takes on projects that will directly benefit our end-users. Knowing that our technologies will improve lives is an excellent motivator.</p><h4>What have been some your proudest achievements in technological innovation?</h4><p>Asking me what invention I'm most proud of is like asking a parent which of their children is their favorite. I'm very proud of all of DEKA's inventions because each has brought its own set of challenges and rewards. However, I am particularly encouraged by the growth of our FIRST robotics program, which inspires kids to become excited about pursuing careers in science and technology. Each young innovator we inspire will go on to create incredible inventions, so in that sense FIRST is the gift that keeps on giving.</p><div class="quote">“Asking me what invention I'm most proud of is like asking a parent which of their children is their favorite."</div><h4>Where are you currently focusing your design disciplines, and where does the future lie for DEKA?</h4><p>We are currently working on a range of projects, from medical devices and prosthetic limbs to water purifiers and Stirling engines. I don't know what the future holds, but given the great challenges of the 21st century, there is no shortage of new technologies we'll have the opportunity to work on.</p><h4>You have been quoted as saying: "You have teenagers thinking they're going to make millions as NBA stars when that's not realistic for even 1% of them. Becoming a scientist or engineer is." What would you like young entrepreneurs to understand about the opportunities that contribute to real economic growth?</h4><p>The benefits of choosing a career in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math exist on both the personal level and the large scale. For a young man or woman, a career in technology will not only provide challenges and intellectual stimulation but also contribute to a productive and successful lifestyle. For a nation, having a population that is developing the next generation of breakthrough technologies will ensure economic growth and global competitiveness. In short, there is no better source of wealth for an individual or for a nation than technology.</p><h4>What is the ethos of the FIRST campaign and how could it be implemented in Mexico to help foster an entrepreneurial spirit?</h4><p>FIRST is not only dedicated to inspiring kids to get excited about science and technology but also aims to teach them the importance of cooperation and collaboration. In Mexico, we already have FIRST teams that are impacting many students and giving them the opportunity to pursue careers in the vital STEM fields. A combination of big ideas and a collaborative mindset is at the heart of entrepreneurship, and FIRST promotes both of these key ingredients.</p><h4>What opportunities of particular interest exist in Mexico for technological development and innovation, and how can these contribute to the growth of the country?</h4><p>The opportunities in Mexico, and in any country for that matter, depend entirely on fostering the spirit of innovation in young people. Kids today are the leaders of tomorrow, and if young people are excited about becoming engineers and technologists, they will be able to provide a strong economy for the future. The key is to inspire them at a young age, and that's exactly what FIRST does.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of MetLife?</h4><p>MetLife held strong leadership positions in the US, Mexico, South Korea, and Chile for many years prior to the Alico acquisition in 2010. The transaction provided MetLife with a significant global footprint reaching into more than 50 countries around the globe with substantial earnings and distribution power. I would say that historically, around 85% of MetLife's earnings used to come from the US. This figure has come down to about 60% after Alico's acquisition, with over 40% coming now from the international operations as a direct result of this acquisition. In the Middle East, MetLife was branded “MetLife Alico" due to the strong presence of Alico's operations in this part of the world. The operation celebrates its 50th anniversary in UAE this year, with its diversified product offerings, a variety of distribution channels, and a talented team working together to create the best and most innovative value-added services for its loyal customers. A key component for success is a strong commitment to delivering superior value to the market and our customers, both individual and corporate. It takes a company with the experience, expertise, and a wide product range to understand the market and the particular needs varying from protection, retirement, and savings solutions to help individuals reach the financial goals they envision.</p><h4>What are the benefits of operating from Dubai as a hub for the insurance sector?</h4><p>Historically our regional Middle East headquarters were based in Beirut. However, when unfortunate events took place in the country in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a need to identify a regional headquarters that made more sense not only from a security perspective, but also from the perspective of having infrastructure that would facilitate our operations, allow us to attract talent, and offer all the facilities to be able to conduct business efficiently and successfully. The UAE, being our biggest operation in the region, it only made sense to relocate here, with our regional headquarters being set up at the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the gateway for capital and investment. In addition, the UAE's track record of business innovation and excellence, as well as the government's forward thinking ideology paired with its geographical location, provides us with a gateway to the wider region. We have pride in being been part of the social fabric of the region for decades.</p><div class="quote">“New products have appeared that were not present on the market a decade ago or even a few years ago."</div><h4>How would you characterize the local market in comparison to other markets you are familiar with?</h4><p>There are a number of local, regional, and national companies present in the market, which makes it very competitive. But when you look at the levels of penetration on the life side, you find that those are still relatively low, especially when you compare them to Western and developed economies. This is still an emerging market in many respects. In recent years, we have seen the development of a number of new channels that give customers better access to insurance products of different natures. We have also seen many new products appear on the market. These are all very positive developments. However, it doesn't characterize the market as saturated in any way. This is a market full of significant opportunities for our industry to grow and prosper, and life insurers can play a vital role in contributing to the economic growth and development</p><h4>Are you developing any new insurance products for the local market?</h4><p>We are constantly reviewing our product offerings, and we are also in touch with the market to determine the emerging needs and areas that require additional focus. To give you an example, early in 2011 we launched a whole series of new products focused on education because we feel that is an area that, obviously, everyone cares about in terms of their children's future and education, so there is a need to make sure that there are products out there that fulfill this particular need. People want portability. If they leave, they want to be able to continue to enjoy these products, and to make sure that the products provide them with the benefit that they were intended to provide.</p><h4>How has the insurance industry transformed locally over the past decade?</h4><p>New products have appeared that were not present on the market a decade ago or even a few years ago. I think the most important and significant change is that the channels that offer insurance products have also evolved significantly. Banks were not major distributors of insurance products in this part of the world 10 years ago, but that is a trend that followed Western Europe and other markets. Now banks are very important distributors of insurance products. Also a few years ago a channel like direct marketing was not really existent in this market. Now this channel is growing at a fast rate. These complement some of the more traditional channels such as agency, face-to-face, direct and broker distributions, which continue to be very important and significant.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the insurance sector in the Middle East in 2012?</h4><p>I am bullish and positive. Obviously there are challenges, and we are dependent to some degree on the global environment, what happens in Europe, and what happens elsewhere, but I think, provided there are no major events, we are going to continue to see growth in the markets here and positive development of the sector. With the regulatory environment also evolving we should look at it as a facilitator, not an impediment. We remain optimistic, we had a good year last year, and we think this year will be good as well.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the regulatory mandate of the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) cover?</h4><p>The DFSA's regulatory mandate covers all financial and related activities conducted in or from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), including asset management, banking and credit services, securities, collective investment funds, custody and trust services, commodities futures trading, Islamic finance, insurance, an international equities exchange, and an international commodities derivatives exchange. In addition, the DFSA registers auditors, ancillary service providers (law firms and accountants), and is responsible for anti-money laundering supervision in the DIFC.</p><h4>Creating a financial hub in Dubai has been part of the ongoing vision for the long-term prosperity of the city. What are the strengths of the Emirate in this regard?</h4><p>The Emirate of Dubai, through its Ruler His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, has created by means of legislation a modern financial and business hub connecting the region's emerging markets with the developed markets of Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Since 2004, Dubai has been committed to encouraging economic growth and development in the UAE and the region through its strong financial and business infrastructure, such as the creation of the DIFC. For example, the DIFC offers its member companies benefits such as 100% foreign ownership and a 0% tax rate with no restriction on capital convertibility or profit repatriation. Furthermore, the DIFC has its own independent common law judiciary, namely the DIFC Courts. The Emirate continues to enhance its infrastructure. For example, it has recently enacted legislation to extend the jurisdiction of these courts to enable the benefits of the DIFC Courts to be more widely available. Combining all of these attributes, including the fact that financial institutions find that Dubai offers a high standard of living for their employees as well as modern office space, the Emirate positions itself as the appropriate and first-in-mind location attracting and retaining businesses and talent.</p><div class="quote">“The 2011 period was a time of growth in the DIFC, with the number of authorized firms increasing by 8%."</div><h4>What have been the most significant recent developments in terms of the DFSA's regulation?</h4><p>There have been two recent significant developments. The first development was the enlargement of the DFSA's regulatory remit to make it responsible for all anti-money laundering supervision across the DIFC rather than, as was previously the case, in respect only of firms it regulates for conducting financial and other related activities. The second development was the acceptance by the DFSA of a delegation of power from the Registrar of Companies to be responsible for investigations and conducting enforcement action in respect of breaches of DIFC laws administered by the Registrar of Companies, such as the Companies Law.</p><h4>Financial services companies wishing to obtain a license to operate within the DIFC are processed through the DFSA. What kind of trends have you witnessed in terms of applications?</h4><p>The 2011 period was a time of growth in the DIFC, with the number of authorized firms increasing by 8% after two years of consolidation and following the rapid growth experienced in 2005-2008. In 2012, this momentum is continuing with applications 80% higher than for the same period last year. The DIFC is being selected as a hub to offer products and services to clients in the GCC, wider Middle East, and North Africa and Asia. In terms of specific growth drivers, we see banks—particularly from China and India—increasing their presence and offering their commercial lending and trade finance services, wealth managers from Europe seeking to enhance and grow institutional and private banking relationships in the region, and global investment banks and other wholesale intermediaries migrating trading teams to the center.</p><h4>You have recently visited China, where the DFSA signed an updated Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the China Banking Regulatory Commission and then travelled to Hong Kong and Singapore. What are the benefits of such cooperation agreements and high-level visits?</h4><p>Cooperation among regulators has always been important, but at a time where so much activity and capital flows are across borders, it is even more so. In that regard, we are pleased to have updated our cooperation agreements with the Chinese regulator. Also, as the center of global wealth and activity moves eastward, the DIFC is well placed. We further cemented our strong relationships with the Hong Kong and Singapore authorities and met with leading government and industry identities. We have much to consider from how Hong Kong and Singapore have developed as financial centers. It was also pleasing for us to hear from them.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main factors have driven the development of your solutions portfolio?</h4><p>Principally it has been the market and its trends. When we started, the Mexican market needed diagnosis and environmental controls for exploration-related operations. Over time the market has changed drastically as well as its need for technology, and this has played a key role; the specialization of services offered in the marketplace has been adapted to this new demand. For this reason, we decided to turn Geo Estratos into a company dedicated to the development of new technologies, applications, and solutions to improve the productivity of oil exploration and production (E&amp;P) companies through strategic investments in technology, training our staff, and working hard. We are now able to offer cost- effective and high-technology solutions and are obtaining increasing market shares in Latin America and the Middle East.</p><h4>How would you describe your current participation in PEMEX's projects?</h4><p>We are currently developing studies and research projects related to PEMEX's oil exploration activities. We are also providing it with technological solutions to control environmental externalities, improving production volumes as well as their quality, guaranteeing the elimination of oil spills and pipeline leakages, and ensuring the restoration of soil.</p><h4>What main reasons led Geo Estratos to create its own research institute for training and technological development?</h4><p>Over our history of offering services, we have sometimes needed to import technologies from abroad because the market didn't offer adequate solutions. This situation affected the cost of services as well as restricted the technology we had on offer, and so we decided to develop a new R&amp;D center to concentrate all our efforts on developing new, high-level technology to offer to our clients. We are now a pioneer in oil and gas technology development in Mexico, using Mexican technology developed directly by us that is cost-effective and widely available.</p><h4>What main new technologies is Geo Estratos bringing to Mexico?</h4><p>Just to give you an example, we design and develop new technology that can improve the productivity of oil fields by injecting them with special bio-reducing viscosity materials that we create. This kind of operation can improve the production of fields by about 20% per day. Our research center is constantly working on improving the technologies we sell at present and to develop new ones that can significantly improve oil and gas field operations. R&amp;D is one of the most important recipients of our investment practices, and we have developed a huge variety of technological solutions.</p><h4>What main operations is Geo Estratos performing in Colombia and Oman?</h4><p>Over the last few years we have established an increasing presence in these markets, and we have created bio-reducing   viscosity plants in those countries, which have increased our participation in the E&amp;P segments dramatically. In Colombia we partner with a Canadian company called Regent Energy in order to increase our market share. In this Latin American market, new and interesting projects are taking place due to the oil and gas reforms passed in 2010, and we are offering our solutions. In Oman we have just finished a processing plant commissioned in 2010 and we are working to achieve stronger penetration in this market, offering a wide range of services and patented products in a region where the opportunities are huge in the oil and gas sector.</p><h4>What is the most promising international market?</h4><p>I think that Colombia is the environment where we have the most promising opportunities. The government is business friendly and domestic regulation in the oil and gas sector allows the participation of international companies in this sector, offering good opportunities for companies like ours.</p><h4>How have technological advances changed the relative attractiveness and economic feasibility of the most important fields in Mexico?</h4><p>I think that technology development is one of the most important challenges for Mexico's oil and gas sector. PEMEX is working with different technological partners, and a law introduced in 2008 for oil and gas services contractors has helped competition in the market and consequently contributed to the improvement of services offered in general.</p><p>The problem is that deepwater operations need high levels of technology as well as serious amounts of investment. PEMEX's plan in this segment is strong, but I think that it could be improved through other oil and gas-related laws that would allow fresh investment to be raised in this area as well as the participation of new players with state-of-the-art technology and know-how. Deepwater production should be improved through strategic technology investments.</p><h4>What main operations have been implemented in the Ebano-Páuco-Cacalilao complex in order to increase the production from 5,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) to 8,200 bbl/d?</h4><p>Initially we supported PEMEX to understand the mechanism of the reservoir's fluid movements through different studies, and that diagnosis helped to reclassify the previous resource estimation—tripling it, in fact. Production areas have since been extended in terms of dimension. Secondly, we have helped, through the injection of special liquid material solutions developed in-company, to increase production at  the field.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[show-a-bit-of-pride]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What's the significance of the Chihuahua Corridor pipeline project?</h4><p>At full capacity this pipeline will be transporting one-fifth of the national consumption of gas. I think it's going to be the most important corridor in terms of gas. It's a 400-kilometer pipe, 36 inches in diameter, and represents an investment of around $500 million over 18 months. This year and the following one are going to be the most important for our company.</p><h4>This project was awarded following a highly competitive international tender. What did Fermaca bring to the table to allow it to win the contract?</h4><p>We're locals, and we know our market. Fermaca is not the size of TransCanada or Sempra Energy. In truth, we bid for this contract against the state. PEMEX has a company with Sempra that is called Gasoductos de Chihuahua, and it bid. This was not fair. We were swimming against the current, and swimming against sharks. So, what's the Fermaca formula? This industry opened up only 15 years ago to the private sector. It's regulated in terms of gas transportation, distribution, and storage. Marketing, however, is unregulated. Being a fairly new industry, and competing against a monopoly, it was difficult, but PEMEX is not very competitive. We knew we could beat it because cost or making a profit is not an issue. It has a mandate from the constitution to supply gasoline, crude oil, and natural gas, and it doesn't care about costs. As Fermaca, we have no corporation that allows us to borrow money at 2%, so how could we be competitive? We began investing four years ago in this project in Chihuahua to get the regulatory permits, to get options on the right of way, and to get presidential permission in the US and in Mexico. We were investing $5 million to $10 million up front in each project, which no one else was crazy enough to do. This way we minimized the contingencies in our projects and were able to give a better and more competitive price. We allocated our risks. We replicated this formula in many projects. Finally, we were lucky enough to build a good financial package with our banks and offer very competitive numbers. I believe we have a very good business model.</p><h4>How did Fermaca enter the energy business?</h4><p>Fermaca turned 50 last year, and the roots of the company were in contracting. We are in energy because of the crisis. We were in such a crisis in 1994; the US dollar went from Ps3 to Ps11.50 overnight. Imagine that you wake up and realize that the politicians devalued the currency while everyone was sleeping. Suddenly you owe $50 million or $100 million because of financing in turnkey projects, and you're practically broke. When Mexico signed the NAFTA agreement, EPC companies came to Mexico better prepared and with solid finances, and they were in better shape than we were. We really had to reinvent ourselves, and we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time when the energy industry opened up to private investment in the natural gas sector. I was Vice-President of the Mexican Gas Association at the time, and so I had the opportunity to promote the industry. I had a good view of what was coming. We partnered with US companies, and with the help of my former partners we built the first pipeline in 2000. We bought it from Shell because it could not build it. When you want build a 122-kilometer pipe, with 1,600 landowners, imagine what it's like. We bought the project from them, and 14 months later our first pipeline was in operation. It took us another 10 years to get this project. In the last project, we were the only Mexican pipeline company, though we are not in distribution. However, with this 388 kilometers we will be transporting almost one-fifth of the gas in this country. This means that Fermaca is now a big player in the business.</p><h4>What is the timeframe for the construction of the pipeline?</h4><p>We will invest $500 million over the next 18 months to build it. We already provided advanced payments to start producing the pipe, and we expect to start laying it by July this year. In July 2013 we will open the valve to supply the northern half of the electricity market for the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE).</p><h4>How will that actually impact the electricity market?</h4><p>The rate that we will offer is 50% less than what the CFE pays today. I think this will be the most competitive rate that the CFE has ever seen. Just imagine the impact. Gas today is $2.50 per million BTU in the US, and it will provide a lot of savings. We have to lower our expectations because we have a view of the long term. Naturally, we have already laid the foundations to have other pipelines interconnect with our system. For us, operating one or operating five pipelines has a minimum cost compared to a new operator. We already have the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system here, we already own satellite time, and we need only two or three people to be in the field. We have also learnt many painful lessons. For example, we lost three topographical engineers last July, in Chihuahua. The security situation in the country has been challenging, but being local helps.</p><h4>Are there challenges for the company as it becomes a major player?</h4><p>With this project, we hope our company will have $600 million in assets. That's not minor. In the energy business our main focus will be pipelines. I'm quite positive that sooner or later the production of shale gas will end up in the hands of private Mexican companies. We're looking to buy small drilling companies in the US that have a small amount of gas production. A year and a half ago we opened the gas and power division, and we will most likely build our first project next year. It will be a 75-MW cogeneration project to supply gas and heating for a AAA company. We expect that in the next three or four years we will be investing around $2 billion in projects in our country, and this demonstrates the growing credibility of Fermaca. This year we are facing $10 billion projects in tenders; we're talking about huge pipelines of 700 to 1,500 kilometers. There are some other smaller pipelines, but to get these projects activated will take a long time. It's not easy, especially the larger projects. Fermaca will likely be looking to form an alliance with another company. However, there are no local companies that build pipelines the length that we are interested in. There are some international competitors, but the situation in our country doesn't benefit them a lot. They are not very active. In the global economic crisis, companies from the US returned back to their local market, and I believe something similar will happen if the euro collapses—European companies will go back to their local markets and not take on risks elsewhere. In the last 10 or 12 years, I have seen this cycle of companies leaving and returning. In terms of the energy sector, we have the best team. I'm very proud to be a Mexican company, and I'm very proud of Fermaca.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is the Mexican market to Yokogawa?<br></h4><p>It's very important. We expect Mexico to be among the top 10 economies in the world by 2020, even in the worst-case scenario. Whatever happens with the forecast, the reality is that we were glad to see that the economy has grown by 4.5% in 3Q2011. The economy is very robust, and the right macroeconomic decisions are being made. We believe that Mexico is in the right position economically. Some sectors are our targets and our core business, such as energy, particularly oil and gas. Based on the population and the modernization needs of the country, we can contribute to Mexico's growth, as it becomes one of the great emerging countries. This is why we decided to invest in Mexico and to place our headquarters here for Central America and the Caribbean.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the demand for your products and services here in Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico has a great need to decouple the safety functions that are typically embedded in traditional control systems. To follow the current best practices worldwide, these should be installed as a separate system in order to protect assets and employees. PEMEX is taking the lead in introducing safety instrument systems to improve security, and in installing gas detection systems. In many cases, the control systems are becoming obsolete due to abandoned R&amp;D and innovation, and so many of our customers cannot maintain operational continuity and they have to replace them earlier.</p><h4>What are the pillars of your business model, and how is it responding to the Mexican environment?</h4><p>Our execution methodology is unique. Globally, we are moving from being a hardware manufacturer to a solutions provider with a strong focus on the capability to offer our customers an extended range of solutions in the test and measurement, industrial automation and control, and information systems segments. This represents the core philosophy of Yokogawa's value proposition called Vigilant Plant, which aims to provide customers with the best solutions and services to allow our customers to reach operational excellence. We began operations in Mexico in 2009, carrying out this business model. We are pleased to report that we quadrupled our traditional instrument business in the fiscal year 2011. We are planning for sustainable double-digit growth by 2015, and to become the preferred automation partner.</p><h4>How will your mid-term strategic growth plan be implemented in Mexico?</h4><p>By the end of January 2012, we had opened our first service center in Coatzacoalcos for downstream oil and gas, and by mid-year we expect to open another in Monterrey through joint development with our business partners. We aim to deploy an offshore oil and gas service center in Ciudad del Carmen by 2013, and that will be a good foundation for us as a service-oriented company. Our customers are moving to deep water as the industry moves in that direction. Mexico is doing a good job of assessing the potential of both deep and shallow water, but there continues to be developmental needs.</p><h4>How has Yokogawa adapted to the environment, and what competitive advantages does Mexico offer international companies?</h4><p>Mexico is an environment that is aware of international standards and best practices. I believe that the fact that Mexico is a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum is creating good momentum. The concern for everyone is security, though we have noticed improvements over time. Multinational companies are transitioning from manufacturing to more service-oriented operations, and Mexico is no exception. It is important to explain to the customers that the service is the product. Now that a new generation of young Mexicans is being educated in great universities, the country can support services for all of North America. The company expects that by 2020, 50% of the professionals in the oil and gas industry in the US will have retired. The experts we have relied on in this industry are leaving, and there is no upcoming generation in the US. I believe that Mexico will be more prepared to face the challenges in this field in the next few decades than any other  country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DuPont has been operating in Mexico for 86 years, and has achieved a strong reputation in this market. What has made DuPont so successful locally?</h4><p>Our core values enable us to manage the business and focus on the right things. You don't exist in a country for 86 years—and globally for 209 years—without strong values to guide you. We always make sure to stay true to our four core values: safety, respect for the environment, respect for people, and ethical business operations. We are also defined by our strong tradition of science-based innovation. Our company has very strong scientific capabilities that enable us to innovate as the market changes so that we can identify and respond to our customers' needs. That emphasis on innovation has manifested itself in the strong growth we've experienced in Mexico over the last 86 years.</p><h4>What is the strategic importance of Mexico for DuPont?</h4><p>Mexico was DuPont's first international operation outside the US and Canada. Our total value as part of DuPont in terms of sales is about $1.7 billion annually out of $5 billion worth of sales in Latin America. That includes exports as well. We're growing at a rate of over 30% in 2011 in comparison to 2010, when we reached historical high levels in sales and earnings. We have a diversified business in Mexico, with all of our 13 strategic business units (SBUs) represented in the country, including seeds (corn and sorghum), food ingredients, coatings, polymers, and imaging and electronics, among others. We have a strong manufacturing base in Mexico, with seven operations in total. We also have seven R&amp;D and application centers in the country, with 3,000 employees. We consider ourselves a high-tech producer, since we're heavily automated in our facilities. DuPont continues to invest in Mexico. Our geographic location here is perfect for North-South and East-West transactions, nestled between the biggest economy in the world, the US, and Latin America to the south.</p><h4>In your opinion, what is the most innovative product DuPont has developed, and what made that possible?</h4><p>We've produced many innovative products throughout our history, from the protective layers on astronauts' uniforms, to materials used in the Mars landing module. We've developed technologies to improve everyday life and comfort, such as the discovery of innovative fabrics, as well as for their use in industrial applications, to modern breakthroughs in the synthetic production of Omega-3 using sugar cane as basic feed material, or latest generation crop protection products and biofuel technology, to name a few. We've had Nobel laureates working for our company. DuPont has contributed a great deal to food production and food safety technologies. We've also been a significant contributor to advancing the energy and transportation industries, and have significant innovation research in the field of alternative energy.</p><h4>What other investment plans do you have on the horizon?</h4><p>DuPont will invest around $300 million-$350 million per year over the next three years, including the Altamira expansion. One recent investment involved the acquisition in June 2010 of the Danish food ingredients and enzymes company Danisco, which has a global reach and 400 employees in Mexico. Its sales in Mexico are close to $100 million.</p><h4>What role do you envision for DuPont in the housing sector after the completion of the sustainable housing project with your partner, Industrias Repshel?</h4><p>Housing is one of those sectors where we seek partnerships with companies that engage in that sector as their core business. When we become active in a segment, we first identify unmet needs in that particular market, and then work collaboratively with some partners—like Repshel in this case—to develop a solution. Besides being a good business opportunity, I think this fills an important social need in terms of providing affordable, clean housing. It's the right thing to do, because there is a global housing deficit.</p><p>DuPont has partnered with Repshel to provide the science and technology to create a complete polymer-cement encapsulated solution that is self-constructed by the family, can be built in five to seven days, includes running water and electricity, and is by the far the most affordable option on the market. Repshel is in the business of extrusion, which can be used to build not only houses, but schoolrooms, small rural clinics, and so on. Our contribution is titanium dioxide technology as well as other polymer technology and additives, which gives the material resistance, durability, and the necessary refraction required during summer. Besides being a reality in Mexico, the project has already been exported to Argentina and Chile, and is perfect for areas afflicted by natural disasters where you need durable affordable housing for the victims of floods, earthquakes, mudslides, and other natural disasters. They are very solid, and can even resist hurricanes. We also offer coatings for the housing industry.</p><h4>How would you rate Mexico in terms of technological and scientific development?</h4><p>I believe Mexico has the potential to grow in that area. We're still far from fully realizing that potential. When you look at the number of patents in Mexico as a percentage of overall patents globally and in Latin America, it is very low. We have some good initiatives coming through, and government efforts too, but we need a good, long-term collaboration between government, the private sector, and academia if Mexico is to advance in terms of technological and scientific development. We have the right demographics and quality educational institutions. We graduate a high number of engineers from multiple disciplines every year, and have a very skilled workforce. Mexico's potential is being acknowledged if you consider the number of multinational companies investing in the country. DuPont is developing an innovation center in Mexico to connect with all its main global R&amp;D centers as well as to coordinate with its seven R&amp;D and application centers around Mexico and leverage DuPont technology for the benefit of its customers in the region.</p><h4>What role do you envision for the future of DuPont in the Mexican market and Latin America?</h4><p>Latin America has great potential. DuPont's sales in Latin America in 2002 were $1.2 billion; in 2011 they are expected to reach $5 billion, and by 2019 about $10 billion. Our average rate of growth over the next few years will be two to three times higher than GDP in the region. We expect to double our sales over the next five years, and we've tripled our sales over the last seven or eight years. DuPont's role in Mexico's development will grow in the areas of the three identified megatrends I mentioned: food production, alternative energy sources, and the protection of people and the  environment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which Grupo EULEN business lines are experiencing the highest growth rate in the Mexican market?<br></h4><p>The business line that has the greatest short-term growth possibility is security. Mexican companies are not developed sufficiently to offer security solutions. These solutions are principally provided by international companies, and we are one of them. In addition, from our point of view, at the strategic level non-conventional business lines also have future possibilities for development. Those are those that aim to grab the attention of elderly people and public health. It's called the “social services" line, and it is aimed at providing health and general services to multinationals, financial entities, and corporate employees. In a context where the middle class is growing and the need for new healthcare services are expanding, Grupo EULEN thinks that it is a must to act preventively and facilitate a high quality of life for this population through services for the public administration or through private companies; this is a niche of strategic, important, and future business. The public administration in Mexico does not have the resources necessary to take care of the health needs of a population of 120 million inhabitants. For that reason, it is a strategic niche of future business for a company with services like ours.</p><h4>How would you describe the main pillars of your business model?</h4><p>Our business model is very generic; to help our customers turn their fixed costs into variables. Within that concept, one of the main pillars is to diminish the variable costs of the client being sold a service, that is to say, to offer solutions although they are solved by manpower.</p><h4>How important is the Mexican market for Grupo EULEN' s global operations?</h4><p>Grupo EULEN's turnover is ‚¬1.5 billion, of which ‚¬300 million corresponds to Latin America and the US. Mexico's turnover is ‚¬100 million, and it is the most important country in Latin America and North America in terms of business opportunities.</p><h4>What is the position of the group in the multiservice segment in Mexico?</h4><p>It is the leading multiservice group in the country in terms of janitorial services, maintenance and facilities, security, gardening, temporary workers, and social services. It is also number one by number of employees.</p><h4>What main expansion projects do you plan to implement in Mexico in 2012?</h4><p>The first objective project is to improve quality and to strengthen ourselves with our most important clients; that is to say, to maintain what we have despite the difficulties. The second level of our development plan is to aim at lines of strategic development, considering that is a mixture between the way to provide services and products. Our idea is to give to the public administration a preventive treatment that will allow for the saving of important resources.</p><h4>How would you assess Grupo EULEN's environmental commitment to quality and concerns?</h4><p>It is a sector that has a very clear demand, but has a small problem of competition. This issue revolved around the public security system's legal power to sell services. This means that our main competition in private security is the state itself. In social security there is an essential problem, and that is that minimum wages are too low for the personnel that are used for private security services. Our objective is to look for higher profile workers with higher wages and to provide a better quality of service.</p><h4>How would you rate Mexico as an investment destination and as a place to do business?</h4><p>I think that it is easy to do business in countries with an emerging middle class and political stability that encourage the entrance of multinational enterprises. Mexico has these features. The lower-middle class Mexican has a concept of life in the short term that promotes consumerism, and this makes the economy robust.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The year 2012 will be a special one for both Denmark and Mexico. Denmark is currently hosting the Presidency of the Council of the EU for the first six months of the year, while Mexico is hosting the G20 presidency. This provides opportunities to strengthen our bi-lateral relations and to further our common agendas on climate change and green growth. The common position on these global issues has laid the foundations for a strong partnership between our two countries. Together with South Korea this strategic partnership has led to a joint partnership around the Global Green Growth Forum (3GF) initiative. The 3GF is an annual high-level public-private partnership that brings together global leaders from government, business, finance, and civil society to collectively spur green growth and design the architecture for a green economy. Green growth is not only a way of ensuring that future growth will be sustainable, but it also promotes growth in itself by promoting job creation and investment in areas of green tech.<br></p><p>I would like to congratulate Mexico on its efforts and the leadership role it has taken on the international climate change agenda. This role is illustrated by its sturdy leadership hosting COP16 in Cancún in 2010 and by the importance that Mexico has placed on green growth, making it one of the priorities of its G20 presidency. Nationally, Mexico has set serious targets, setting the pace for the rest of Latin America. Mexico's recently-launched National Energy Strategy aims to scale up power supply from non-fossil fuel energy to 35% by 2026. If the political will is there, this is good for investments.</p><p>Needless to say, the transition from conventional to non-conventional energy requires non-conventional ways of thinking. In Denmark, 25% of our power supply today comes from wind. No other country in the world can match that. And our ambitions do not stop there: We have a clear strategy for turning our dreams of a fossil-free society into a concrete long-term action plan. By 2020, 50% of our electricity will come from wind power and 20% from biomass. By 2050, we will be 100% fossil fuel free. This requires vision, guts, and innovation. I believe that is the reason why Denmark was recently nominated the leading green innovator in the world by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).</p><p>I see strong possibilities for expanding our partnership in green energy. Denmark's competency and experience in wind, coupled with the high wind energy potential in Mexico, makes this an ideal sector for cooperation. During my recent visit to Mexico in April 2011, I had the pleasure to discuss the opportunities and challenges in Mexico with key Mexican stakeholders and the Danish turbine manufacturer, Vestas. Vestas will be constructing Latin America's largest wind park in the state of Oaxaca. The 132 windmills will have a total capacity of 396 MW.</p><p>In general, I am pleased to see our commercial ties strengthening. Trade between Denmark and Mexico has seen a steep increase of over 200% in the last 10 years, and Denmark is the fourth largest EU investor in Mexico. I believe the best is yet to come.</p><p>The Vestas agreement comes on the back of two other recent announcements by Danish toy manufacturer LEGO, and Maersk Terminals. LEGO, in late 2011, announced a $100 million expansion of its factory in Monterrey, making it the largest in the world. The factory, which takes advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to export to the US, will also be the center of production for all of the Americas. This was followed by the announcement by Maersk Terminals to invest $900 million to develop a new container facility at the port of Lázaro Cárdenas on Mexico's west coast. Our pharmaceutical sector also has a strong presence in Mexico, and I am convinced that experiences from our welfare state and life sciences can be valuable to increasing demand from the Mexican people. Mexico is growing into one of the world's top 10 economies, laying the foundation for lifting more Mexicans out of poverty. New demands will require investments and new technology. We have it.</p><p>Therefore, though our relationship is strong and trade is increasing, there is room for improvement. I want to ensure that we stay among the top investors in Mexico.  Therefore, I would like to see more Danish companies discover Mexico. But we also need to see more Mexican companies finding Denmark on the world map.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mexico accounts for the highest number of GE plants outside of the US. How does Mexico figure in GE's overall Latin American and global operations?</h4><p>We are the biggest manufacturing platform outside the US, with 21 manufacturing plants, including three new acquisitions. We also have eight service centers, 51 sites in total with offices around the country, almost 11,000 employees, and 35,000 with joint ventures, of which we have four very important ones in Mexico. In revenues, unfortunately, we've been losing our position. We used to be number one in Latin America, but Brazil has caught up with us and will surpass us in 2011. In 2010 we closed with total sales of $1.9 billion. However, 2011 is a tough call, but we should be growing in double digits. Revenues in Mexico come from GE Capital, which accounts for around 40%. This is a difference since in the past it represented more than 50% of revenue. We are focusing all our efforts to grow our industrial operations, while GE Capital will continue to be an important business.</p><h4>How will the introduction of “DuraStation„¢" in partnership with GDF SUEZ lead to the utilization of electric cars in the Mexican market, and how will this new technology improve the electrical infrastructure in Mexico?</h4><p>We were the first company to set up electric vehicle charging stations in Latin America. That sends out a very positive signal, namely that of the utilization and development of clean energy. These DuraStations„¢ will be partly loaded by solar power. We have the technology. We're already in the second generation of DuraStation„¢; the new product is called Wattstation„¢. The new stations charge in four to eight hours, whereas in the previous stations a car had to be charged for 12-18 hours. With this technology you can remotely interact with the charging station via cell phone. You are also informed if your car is ever disconnected. Also, the price of electricity is very competitive, and cheaper than gasoline. The electric cars produced right now are not the lowest priced, because it's a new technology. However, once the market expands and the infrastructure is in place, prices will naturally come down. We have built 400 stations of this type in the US and have an order for 400 stations more, which puts us in the number one position. General Electric is a company founded by Thomas Edison, and we carry on that innovative tradition, applying the necessary research, development, design, and initiative to produce new technology that will benefit all segments of the population and improve people's quality of life.</p><h4>Do you use mainly wind and solar, or does hydropower still play the dominant role?</h4><p>Gas is growing most rapidly now. That's a reality. The fact is that fossil fuel use will not go away as rapidly as we might hope. However, renewables will be growing, and the government has set a target for renewable energy use.</p><h4>How does the acquisition of Lineage Power and Dresser fit within your plant-expansion strategy in Mexico?</h4><p>Lineage is about industrial solutions, and it complements some of our solutions for electrical installations. From Wood Group we only acquired the “Well Support" business. Dresser and Wood Group complement our portfolio in oil and gas. The acquisitions were made with a worldwide strategy in mind, not just limited to Mexico. These acquisitions now enable us to take care of the whole process from beginning to end for our customers. We can now do everything from extracting oil to distributing it, thanks to these companies. Lineage does that in the electrical sector. These companies have enabled us to achieve a fully integrated solution for our customers. That's the name of the game today. It's all about solutions. You have to provide a whole solution, not just a part of it.</p><h4>In your opinion, what are the main reasons why the Critikon plant won the award for best plant of GE Healthcare globally?</h4><p>Mexico has a very rich reservoir of talent—human talent. It's not about cheap labor or low costs anymore. It's about having a talented workforce. In the 1980s and 1990s it was about affordable labor, which is what brought about the existence of maquiladoras. However, Mexico is now at a different stage. We are now positioned as the top country in the global GE network in terms of environmental health and safety (EHS) practices with our 21 manufacturing plants. We have very high standards—even higher than that which is required by law—and that has to do with talented people who can run a plant efficiently and lower the cost of manufacturing. It's all about performance and sustainability, building rigor and operating systems along with innovation and contributing on a global basis. This mentality of continuous improvement in product performance and superb customer service is entrenched in Mexico's manufacturing culture, and with our operating system we assure continuous seed planting for a bright and sustained future. The best plants have the best people and we make sure that people growth is always a top priority. Mexico produces about 90,000 engineering graduates a year, more than the US. We started tapping into that talent in the universities, and are doing the same thing in management. We find talented students in universities and even in high school, and have all types of learning programs and training centers. The company invests $1 billion per year in training worldwide, and considers training as an investment, not a cost.</p><h4>How will the new investment of $24 million for the GE Infrastructure complex in Querétaro, the biggest in the aviation segment complex outside the US, affect overall operations for GE Mexico?</h4><p>That money is for the expansion of the design complex. We're designing not just for Mexico there, but for GE worldwide. We have teams there that are working with customers in Mexico and the rest of Latin America. They customize solutions for our clients and take solutions to our customers. Another factor is that they are right here and they can travel anywhere quickly. In 2011, for example, GEIQ supported engineering projects in Latin America worth over $2 billion.</p><h4>In April 2011, GE USA announced its partnership with Google for the construction of the biggest wind park in the world, which will be built in the US. What main objectives do you have for the development of this renewable source in Mexico?</h4><p>As yet, GE is not a big player in the wind sector in Mexico, but we have large projects in line to position ourselves in wind energy. The reason we haven't focused as much on wind until now is because we didn't have the technology locally. Class 1 winds are the winds you get in Oaxaca, which are very strong. That means you don't need such a big turbine or rotor at that level. We were, however, well positioned in Class 2, which is why we're number one in the US, and number two in Europe. Those involve bigger rotors and higher capacity turbines to generate the electricity. Now we have the technology for Class 1 and are very strong in Class 2. We're well positioned in the overall wind-energy sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the principal characteristics of the new wind farm you are developing in Puebla State?</h4><p>First of all, the wind farm is an idea that we decided to develop according to the environmental concerns we have at PI Mabe Group. The group has always sought ecological and sustainable products. For example, we developed the “bio-baby" diaper, the first biodegradable diaper in Mexico and in the world. We joined forces with APIA XXI Group, which is a Spanish company with its headquarters in Santander, in order to explore opportunities in the renewable energy sector. It has many years of experience in the renewable energy field, and has installed wind farms in Chile and Spain, as well as in Central Europe. We joined with them, and we began to monitor the principal wind zones in Puebla. We know that Oaxaca has the best winds in the country, but we prefer Puebla because it has similar winds, but is closer to Mexico City, meaning additional logistical benefits. We began with measurement towers two years ago, and we had the support of President Calderón and his government.</p><h4>What unique capabilities did APIA XXI bring to the table to make it the company of choice for the development of the facilities, and how would you describe the creation of this joint venture?</h4><p>APIA XXI is a company that works remarkably faster than many other companies in the field. It has agile processes and impressive response times to any kind of issue in terms of project management and maintenance. It also has strong expertise as well as a good reputation in the wind segment. Instead of partnering with a big, slow, and expensive wind park development company, we preferred the efficiency of APIA XXI. I think it was a good choice according to the job it is doing in developing our wind park.</p><h4>What impact will this project have on national energy production from renewable resources?</h4><p>I think it will have an important impact because we plan to generate 364 MW in total. At present, wind power generation accounts for 509 MW in Oaxaca and 10 MW in Baja California. The state of Puebla didn't have a wind farm before we came along. We will cut the cost of energy coming from the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE). Mexico needs a stronger production capacity in order to meet the future needs of our industries, and we have the opportunity to provide a stable supply of cost-effective energy to fuel their development.</p><h4>How will this new park positively affect the local communities where it will be built, and what impact will the new plant have on local power production?</h4><p>We instigated a large number of social studies at the local community level about how to involve the people of the area in this project. We focused our attention on the educational aspect, and we consider our project to be a driver of tourism and infrastructure development. We will be providing a bus system for children, and they can visit the park and attend special classrooms where we provide knowledge about the wind farm as well as present environmental issues and underscore the benefits emanating from the use of renewable energy sources. We are also studying how we can boost agricultural activities in this area by providing expertise and support to the agricultural communities of the region. Of course, from a labor point of view, this project will generate new employment directly for the local community, and it will benefit everyone in Puebla state.</p><h4>Do you plan to develop new wind parks in Mexico or abroad?</h4><p>At present we are concentrating our efforts on this project, and we are analyzing the possibility of building others in Mexico's different states. At the international level, we have a subsidiary in the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>How would you assess the renewable energy sector in Mexico and what potential do you envision in this field?</h4><p>Energy will be a fundamental aspect for Mexico's economic development. At present, the cost of oil is increasing and it is far from being stable. Wind energy has many advantages, and Mexico can be considered one of the most important Latin American countries in terms of wind potential. It will play a fundamental role in meeting the future energy needs of the country. If we compare the current installed capacity and Mexico's potential, there's a large gap and we have to fill this with new projects. The government is aware of these opportunities, and it is pushing the renewable energy agenda. The framework is there, but now it needs investment from the private sector.</p><h4>What role is the private sector playing in the development of the renewable energy sector in Mexico?</h4><p>Most of the wind farms in Mexico have been developed by private initiative. Private industry is playing a fundamental role. I think the government should work on creating a more attractive environment in terms of the legal framework in order to stimulate further investment. A mechanism along the lines of a public-private partnership (PPP) model, which could allow for hybrid participation, could boost the development of new projects.</p><h4>How do you plan to compete with international companies that are currently operating in the wind sector in Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico's energy sector is a very busy market. There are many international players such as Iberdrola and Abengoa, and they have the technology, expertise, and level of investment needed to develop these kinds of projects. Actually, there's a lot of room in the market according to Mexico's potential. However, for us it is better to work with a smaller company instead of a larger company, where all the processes are slow, bureaucratic, and inefficient. We are totally customer oriented, and our response time is extremely rapid. We know the market well because we are local, and we know very well how to do business in this market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the potential for bioenergy and other renewables to play a major role in the Mexican energy market?</h4><p>In terms of renewable energy, Mexico is a “virgin" country. Investment opportunities have only begun to materialize in the past couple of years. The federal government has begun to issue a renewable energy law in Mexico. The laws are not just for the business sector, but also to lower the costs of injecting more power into the grid. We started in the energy business in the early 2000s. Since SEISA's inception in 1992, we have suffered from high fuel costs, devaluations, and barrier implementation. The government has significantly helped companies like ours with the introduction of new legislation, which also extended to cogeneration efficiency projects. In 2012, we have five or six projects underway, most of which are cogeneration projects. SEISA is very well known in the energy sector, since it was the first company in Mexico working in the cogeneration segment. We are also working with other big players in the market, and have projects of the size 5 MW to 10 MW. SEISA has a lot of plans for Mexico, but the energy business is deeply tied to the politicians, and renewable energy projects are connected to the local or state governments. Most of the renewable projects we do need to be carried out through a partnership with the government. We have a good understanding of the situation in Monterrey, because we have been working with the state's officials since 2003. The municipal authority has changed five times since then, but we have provided a number of savings to the government here. The amount the economy can save is driving this sector.</p><h4>What is your relationship with the World Bank?</h4><p>We formed a relationship with the World Bank in 2000 with the construction of our biogas-to-energy facility in Monterrey. The first contact with the World Bank was the grant it offered us to start the project in 2001. We have maintained our relationship with it by supplying Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) and carbon credits that the World Bank conducts through the Clean Development Mechanism. The Kyoto Protocol contracts we signed do not expire for another five years, and we will provide CERs until 2017. Given the opportunity to receive money from the global market, we can continue our operations. We have reached 17 MW in generating capacity using biogas from landfills, and we believe we can increase our capacity to 25 MW over the present decade.</p><h4>What are some of the benefits of biogas?</h4><p>We started operations in 2003 before the Kyoto Protocol was signed, with the goal of reducing carbon emissions. We also wanted to manage the risk of methane explosions from landfill gas. The benefits are largely for public entities, such as government buildings and Monterrey's public squares. We can undercut Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) prices by about 10%-12%. Moreover, the revenues that we collect from our users are generally given back to the government. Without any law supporting or assuring our business, we are a private company successfully working with the public sector.</p><h4>What are your activities outside of Mexico?</h4><p>The core business of our cogeneration sector is based abroad. We have three companies in the US, one in Canada, and a few more in Colombia and India. We manufacture the technology in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In the past, we had an opportunity to invest in companies that could manufacture the equipment that can then be installed in Mexico. We got involved as soon as the law permitted private participation in the energy business in 1992. SEISA provides products and goods to many sectors—economizers, heath recovery systems, and cogeneration packages—for the US and Mexican markets. Most of the businesses are linked to oil and gas sector. It's interesting because most of the companies in Tulsa provide goods to the petrochemicals sector, and Tulsa is a booming city. The economy is quite different from the rest of the US. We also try to invest in own products in our clients' facilities, with the idea to share energy savings. The cogeneration package has more than 70% efficiency, and when companies use it to operate heating and/or cooling systems, they end up saving money. We have some sites abroad where we have provided this service for more than 15 years, and often renew our contracts. SEISA suffered a lot with the devaluation of the peso in 1995, and it also suffered in the recent global crisis and the price of gas. In the next decade, we will see more stable gas prices.</p><h4>How did SEISA's story begin?</h4><p>The founder of SEISA, Don Javier Garza Sepúlveda, was a visionary member of one of the regional industrial families of Monterrey. He always viewed the laws passed in the energy business as huge opportunities to increase his business portfolio. Fortunately, the company decided to enter the renewable energy market because the price of gas was rising. He decided that the way business was conducted needed to transition to greener alternatives. The opportunity in the early 2000s was when the World Bank showed interest in SEISA. At that time, it was also very difficult to get government approval and negotiate with the CFE to connect our projects to the grid. However, it tried to direct future investment to the private sector and to provide subsidies to part of the population. If you see that gas costs are low, and the tariff is high, there is a huge margin to provide savings to your customers. We have a lot of opportunities here.</p><h4>What is the future of your company?</h4><p>This is our moment to grow, and become a larger market player. We are advising major companies that want work with cogeneration products as well. We have the know-how, people, and operational experience. We have also invested in our customers for close to 20 years. We can provide support to other companies, in terms of selecting the right turbine or engines, helping them select the right equipment, and make the right decisions. The energy business is not very well publicized in Mexico—everyone knows they should participate, but they are afraid of making huge investments, and the returns take time. We are working toward higher exposure in the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the sectors you primarily target for fire security measures in Mexico? What factors affect the market here?</h4><p>We look at the industry from two primary segments: the private sector and energy. Under the private sector category, we have defined various sub-segments such as commercial, industrial, and residential, while the energy segment mainly concerns the oil and gas industry. Each segment has a different set of fire detection and suppression products and systems that we need to integrate to offer the best fire safety solutions to our customers. In the energy segment, we have a contract with PEMEX to maintain and support offshore rigs and many of their onshore facilities, which accounts for a significant portion of our business. Other growth areas for our business include tourism infrastructure, government buildings, and historic buildings. The market in Mexico is not as well regulated as other areas of the world with regard to fire safety, although the regulations have improved over the past few years. Regulation is important because it sets safety standards and promotes the use of fire safety technologies to protect people, property, and the environment.</p><h4>What challenges remain to improve fire safety regulations?</h4><p>As leaders in the fire safety industry in Mexico, we actively participate in committees to promote changes in regulations that will lead to higher safety standards. We support new amendments addressing fire protection in the federal civil protection law, which is a very complex process and can take years to implement. One of the key aspects of our business in Mexico is to differentiate ourselves through the training and specialization of our technical staff, thus raising the overall standards and fire safety awareness of industry.</p><h4>What is your strategy to increase the demand for your products in the Mexican market?</h4><p>Kidde Mexico began as a local safety service provider. In 2005, it was acquired by United Technologies and began its transformation into a leading supplier of fire detection and suppression systems. We changed management, changed processes, and started changing the company's culture. We implemented a market segmentation strategy that has worked well to help us sustain growth and expand our sales numbers. We believe we have an operational process that is reliable in terms of delivering what we want. In addition, as a company, we have been actively working with our partners, customers, and other stakeholders to help develop enhanced safety standards that will benefit the entire industry. As a result, Kidde is recognized as one of the leaders and promoters of fire safety norms and standards in the country.</p><h4>What are the benefits of operating in Mexico?</h4><p>We believe we have significant opportunities in Mexico as the fire safety market is still developing. Another benefit of operating in Mexico is the free trade agreements that exist between Mexico and other South American countries, such as Brazil and Argentina. For example, if products are produced in Mexico there is a discount of 50% on the import duties to export them to Argentina. This works to our advantage when exporting products from Mexico. However, exports are a small part of our business, as our main focus is the Mexican market.</p><h4>What do you expect from the local market in the long term?</h4><p>Over the long term, I expect stronger fire safety regulations. Kidde is already participating in committees and is taking a lead position to promote fire safety standards locally. In addition, the technical staff we are training and developing will help drive our growth, and raise awareness of overall safety standards in industry. As United Technologies has grown in the last few years, we have gained access to new products and technologies. For example, Marioff Corporation is an important brand based in Finland, and is a leading provider of the HI-FOG® water mist fire protection system. We are in the process of customizing that system for the local market, and obtaining regulatory approvals. HI-FOG® could be especially useful for hotels, data or communications centers, and cultural-heritage sites, as it uses significantly less water than traditional sprinklers, resulting in less water damage and faster business recovery.</p><h4>What is your assessment of Mexico's workforce?</h4><p>Since 2005, Kidde has invested heavily in training and in developing our workforce. Last year we introduced a certification program for our technicians. This program provides intensive training on all our products, systems, and procedures. We also bring in experts from all over the world to train our staff. This training has been very effective in developing our local Kidde workforce. In addition, through United Technologies' Employee Scholar Program, we can offer tuition, books, and academic fees for employees to pursue college degrees. This program is helping create an educated workforce, and I believe it is the right way to retain and develop talent.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main pillars of the GM production system in Mexico?</h4><p>At GM Mexico we rely on standardized work, and work under GM's global quality guidelines. Mexico represents one of the best examples of the standardization of processes and the work environment. In addition, we work under the “lean concept," which means we have very small structures and we apply automation just in the processes where it is absolutely necessary. This organizational concept gives our company great advantages in terms of cost, quality standards, and delivery. In addition, we put strong attention on our human resources. We make sure our staff work in a safe environment, and we also pay attention to recruitment processes, training programs, and on ensuring we attract, develop, and retain highly skilled personnel. We have also implemented other initiatives here in Mexico that involve plant personnel, making the plants strong participants in their local communities.</p><h4>How extensive is GM's production capacity in Mexico?</h4><p>Our production capacity in Mexico is 605,000 vehicles per year, 1.2 million engines, and around 1 million transmissions. We have four manufacturing complexes in the country, with different combinations of engine, foundry, assembly, stamping, and transmission plants. This organization is very flexible and allows us to maintain high levels of production on all of our lines. We continuously monitor market conditions to improve or grow production levels.</p><h4>What main fundamentals will characterize your plan to increase production in 2012?</h4><p>Our investment plan to increase our production capacity is a combination of three factors. The first one is new capital investment to improve our production quality and standardization in terms of processes. The second is to fund new projects, and the third is to constantly analyze line rates to make sure we are always responding to market needs</p><h4>What are GM Mexico's main export markets, and what market share do your vehicles have on the local market?</h4><p>Around 70% of our production goes to the US and Canada. We also export to South America, and to a lesser extent to other regions, depending on specific requests. The rest goes to the domestic market. We hold a 17%-18% market share in Mexico with our portfolio of both imported and domestic vehicles. The market share is obviously the output of something you do, and this performance is a combination of many factors, including ability to respond to demand fluctuations and having products that can compete in the marketplace in terms of price, technology, quality, and other demand expectations.</p><h4>How did the global economic crisis affect your product lines, and what lines are currently produced in Mexico?</h4><p>The global financial crisis has had a deep impact on the US economy, on the automotive industry, and consequently on GM Mexico. In that regard, we have had to make difficult decisions and adjustments. We redesigned our commercial strategy in terms of product offering in the Mexican market, and we decided to eliminate two of the six brands that we had competing in the market. Today, we offer Chevrolet, which is our core brand, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac. We stopped producing Pontiac and Hummer. Regarding specific models, affordability is what leads the highest demand in Mexico, and we compete for this portion of the market with vehicles like the Aveo, Sonic, Spark, Matiz, and Cruze.</p><h4>What potential does Mexico hold as a production base?</h4><p>To rank the production base of a country, several factors must be taken into consideration. These are principally (1) access to distribution centers, (2) government and community relations, and (3) market coverage. According to these factors, Mexico is in a good position. Nevertheless, there are some changes that I would like to see happening, but unfortunately they do not depend on GM but on the general environment where vehicles are being produced. We would like to see better distribution centers, and better infrastructure that can assist us in our operations. Mexico has the potential to become one of the most competitive countries in terms of manufacturing competitiveness, but it still needs some improvement.</p><h4>What challenges does the automotive sector face in Mexico?</h4><p>Every industry is linked to the performance of the national economy. Obtaining a good output is a mix of several factors. Mexico's economy, and especially domestic demand, is also impacted by exogenous factors, such as US economic conditions and international prices for components and raw materials, which shape expectations on pricing and demand. These are some of the factors that can affect the performance of the automotive industry in this country. Around 70% of our production goes to the US. If the US economy is facing a recession period, it will obviously affect Mexico's production activities.</p><h4>How important is the automotive segment for the Mexican economy?</h4><p>Putting aside the oil and gas industry, the automotive industry is the primary driver of Mexico's economy. Its magnitude is critical in terms of employment generation, exports, creation of human wellbeing in society, and generation of taxes. The automotive industry is bringing technological innovation and the taxes positively benefit government revenues, which are then spent on improving living standards. The automotive sector is a big player in Mexico's economy and it will play this role for a long time, contributing even more to the welfare of the population and the economy.</p><h4>What main trends did you identify over the last few years in the automotive segment in Mexico?</h4><p>First of all, I have to say that the Mexican consumer is demanding and looking for the best alternatives, but is always concerned about the price and affordability of a product. The automotive industry in the country is moving to meet the needs of this price-conscious customer base, and it is producing vehicles in concert with the capability of consumers. In Mexico, basic transportation is one of the most important factors, and for this reason automotive producers are basically focused on this segment. Another trend is the growing concern over the use of fossil fuels and its impact on the environment. The industry is moving to adopt new technologies that can mitigate this concern. There is also an augmenting concern over security and safety, especially from a regulatory point of view.</p><h4>What will constitute the most effective actions that could improve the country's industrial performance?</h4><p>I believe that all participants in the automotive industry should align their agendas. The manufacturers, dealers, the government, and all components of the supply chain need to come together with common themes. This will ensure that we are speaking the same language. If we can improve the output and quality of the automotive industry, and make integrated efforts with the different levels of government in terms of regulations and incentives, as well as with suppliers and dealers, we will all participate in the generation of employment, conversion of the vehicle park, and in general, the improvement of the economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[on-the-right-path]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did your close relationship with Oracle come about?<br></h4><p>Brio Mexico was founded in 2000. Our core business was focused on implementing business intelligence solutions throughout the different accounts we managed. Our relationship with Oracle began in 2007, after the company acquired Hyperion Solutions and we became Oracle's software integrator. With 11 years of experience, Brio has become one of Oracle's top three partners in Mexico. The focus of our company is to understand the business strategies of our clients in order to facilitate the implementation of any information technology solutions that can add value. Brio currently manages operations in Mexico's three main cities: Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara. We focus on the government, finance, distribution, service, and manufacturing sectors.</p><h4>Where do you see the most demand?</h4><p>Since the beginning, the government segment has been an important sector with high potential for us. The financial services segment is another sector that has always been very stable and reliable for us. Finally, we are active in the healthcare segment, which has been growing over the last couple of years. The companies in the healthcare segment require technology solutions that will improve their competitiveness and harness control over their internal processes. Furthermore, the government has a very large initiative to establish an electronic health record across the country. This will open up very good opportunities for our business.</p><h4>What does it mean to be a partner of Oracle?</h4><p>Brio is an Oracle Platinum Certified Partner. This achievement was obtained given the solid understanding and commitment we provide to our customers and partners. Our relationships are based on trust and high-performance results, which earns us a very solid reputation. Oracle sees this reputation as one of Brio's main assets. We have made a full commitment to promote Oracle's software licenses. As Oracle's partner, we successfully develop consulting projects as well as participate in an education and training initiative. Over the last three years, we have carried out an increasing number of software education and training programs in Latin America. We export services to Central America, Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil.</p><h4>How would you rank the technological infrastructure within the business landscape in Mexico?</h4><p>The US has tended to lead the world in technological infrastructure, but Mexico has a huge advantage compared to other regions of the world. Mexico has become a center for much of the technology demanded by the US. Over time, the demand for technology services has shifted to Mexico. We have also directed our company toward the Hispanic market in the US. The southern markets of Texas, California, and Florida are excellent opportunities for Mexican companies.</p><h4>Is Brio Software Mexico considering entry to any new markets?</h4><p>Brio is determined to innovate, start new business partnerships, and enter new markets. Therefore, we are constantly looking for new opportunities to diversify our portfolio. Our goal is to be able to determine what new technology can be applied to a specific market through research and development. We see great opportunities for applied technology within the social networking, healthcare, and security segments. We will evaluate radio frequency identification (RFID) in the coming years in order to identify if and when it could be used. The Mexican market requires new technology in order to be more competitive.</p><h4>What are some examples of your clients?</h4><p>We work with several state-owned companies, including the Mexican Social Security Agency (IMSS), the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), and PEMEX. We also work with the state governments of Jalisco, Veracruz, Sinaloa, and Nuevo León. In the financial sector, we work with BBVA-Bancomer, Santander, and Grupo Financiero Interacciones. In the service and distribution sectors, our main client is Grupo Alsea, which has legal rights to establish a number of franchises including Starbucks, Domino's Pizza, and Chili's. Other important clients in this segment are 7-Eleven and Comex. In total, Brio has more than 350 clients.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of the company?</h4><p>I believe that Brio is on the right path. In the coming years, we'd like to expand outside of Mexico and try to consolidate our business in the US. We will maintain our strong relationship with Oracle and our other partners, innovating and forming solutions that add value to the market. We want to emphasize our vision to integrate our services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The support programs of the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA) include investment development, risk prevention, knowledge transfer, sustainability, and PROCAMPO. Which of these has been the most successful in improving local agriculture?<br></h4><p>I think that the policies that Mexico implements are aligned with international trade regulations. At a global level, the World Trade Organization (WTO) regulates the amount of subsidies that a government channels to the agriculture sector, as well as the type of subsidies. Not all varieties of subsidies are allowed. For example, export restrictions are not permitted, and export subsidies are also prohibited. Mexico upholds these commitments. PROCAMPO is a subsidy for farmers that is expensive, but generalized. The WTO considers PROCAMPO a “green" subsidy, because we do not distort the market or force farmers to produce a particular product. Under PROCAMPO, farmers have the absolute freedom to produce whatever they wish. We do not encourage production by giving production subsidies. In 2011, we began a rural extension program that links universities and research centers to farmers in order to better understand how 21st-century agriculture should be practiced. Students receive technical knowledge, as well as training in economics and environmental protection. We also have programs for migrants residing in the US who send remittances to their families in Mexico's rural areas. We encourage them to use these remittances to improve productivity, and thereby create jobs.</p><h4>How important is SAGARPA's geographical range in terms of exports?</h4><p>Our range is very important because Mexico has historically depended on the US, in both imports and exports, and now we are seeking more dynamic markets, such as China, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia. A number of countries in Latin American and the Middle East are also potential markets for Mexico. Japan is a country that imports billions of dollars worth of food every year. Mexico and Japan have signed an economic partnership agreement (EPA), and thus we have preferential access to the Japanese market. Mexican products such as avocado, pork, and beef have been very successful in Japan. We have a large number of free trade agreements (FTAs) with several countries, and this definitely helps our export diversification.</p><h4>In your opinion, what role could biotechnological applications play in the agricultural sector and what degree of penetration do these applications currently have?</h4><p>We have been making progress in the application of genetically modified cotton, soybean, and canola. We are about to begin planting genetically modified corn in some regions, especially in the northern irrigated areas where there are opportunities to strictly control crops. Mexico needs to increase its production, and to do so we have to incorporate new technology. In terms of biotechnology, we have developed various fertilizers for crops and medication for livestock. This branch of science is developing very fast, and it affects two aspects of the production chain, whether they are organic products or genetically modified inputs.</p><h4>How is SAGARPA creating financial schemes that will increase the level of investment in the agricultural sector?</h4><p>Mexico has a sui generis system of land ownership. There are private landowners, and ejidos, or cooperatives. SAGARPA has guarantee funds from the National Guarantee Fund for Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, and Rural Areas (FONAGA) that support banks in financing small producers. We also offer the banks a guarantee credit for primeras pérdidas, or first losses. SAGARPA provides insurance schemes and programs that provide a subsidy for the acquisition of certain assets that improve the productivity of a farmer or rancher.</p><h4>What role does Central America play in Mexican exports, and what strategy has SAGARPA implemented to increase exports to this region?</h4><p>Central America is a very interesting market, as it requires inputs or raw materials to develop and process its primary products such as fruits, coffee, rubber, and vegetables. Mexico is able to provide the markets of Central America with machinery and manufacturing tools. We also export cheese, yogurt, and bread, and other retail goods. Mexican retailers are beginning to enter Central America, such as OXXO and 7-Eleven Mexico. Central America is also becoming very attractive for global companies, such as Nestlé, which is establishing large factories in Mexico in order to export products to Central America. On November 22, 2011 we signed a new FTA with five Central American nations (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua), which will boost Mexican exports to the region.</p><h4>In what way is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) benefitting agricultural activities in Mexico?</h4><p>NAFTA assists in two different ways. Such as with the case of Central America, it allows us to import machinery, equipment, and supplies practically without any tax expenses and at a lower cost. Also, it allows us to access the markets of the US and Canada with perishable products, for the most part, that North America has gradually stopped producing. For example, the US has abandoned the production of avocados, citrus fruit, and tomatoes because it is easier to find a less expensive source in Mexico that can produce year round. Therefore, the integration grows deeper day by day. There is also the fact that in Mexico, as well as in the US, we have a huge market that we call the “nostalgia market." For example, there are those Mexicans who have emigrated but maintain their eating habits and look forward to enjoying Mexican cuisine. They have excellent purchasing power, and can have a huge influence on their home communities. These are the sort of consumers who have also been extending their consumption habits to other communities in the US. For example, Tex-Mex cuisine is now found in all parts of the US, and this is creating opportunities that our producers are capturing. I have been in large supermarket chains, such as Fiesta Mart in the US, where perhaps 30% or 40% of the products are manufactured in Mexico or have labels in Spanish. It is like walking into a Mexican grocery store and realizing the power of nostalgia that drives consumers to demand our products.</p><h4>The agriculture sector comprises 5% of Mexico's GDP. In your opinion, what role will this sector play in five years?</h4><p>The ratio of agricultural activity as a component of global GDP is decreasing. For example, agriculture in the US has only a 2.8% share of the economy, despite it being a very powerful segment. The same is happening in Mexico; agriculture will lose its share of GDP. However, I believe that the value-added of agricultural production and industry will grow, especially as Mexican food products become more popular around the world. UNESCO added traditional Mexican cuisine to its World Heritage list, and this opens up market opportunities for our producers. We're seeing more and more Mexican cuisine offerings turn up in Russia, China, and South America, and it's an interesting opportunity for development.</p><h4>Mexico imports 30% of its food production needs. How is SAGARPA promoting food security in Mexico?</h4><p>I believe we have a serious productivity issue because many of the small producers are members of cooperatives. In 2012, President Calderón began a program called Masagro, focusing on the vast majority of Mexican producers who own five hectares or less. To reduce poverty levels in this sector, Masagro will provide technical education. Mexico also heavily depends on vegetable oil imports, purchasing 95% from other countries. We are striving to begin local production in the southeast of the country. We are also promoting the planting of oil palm, as well as the cropping of canola and safflower. We continue to improve our technological development. Mexico is extending its pork and beef exports to markets around the world, and very soon we will be present in China. The final arrangements to export pork to this country are almost complete. If we continue to import low-cost products for our population, we can carry on exporting high-cost products to markets with the right purchasing power. We will not stop importing; Mexico will continue to be one of the major importers of food. However, as we become a stronger exporter, we will surely balance the  equation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the penetration of your agrochemical products in the local marketplace?<br></h4><p>Velsimex is ranked as  the sixth largest company in the agrochemical sector, and is the largest Mexican company. We began operations by acquiring products that Velsicol Chemical Corporation did not sell to Sandoz. In 1988, we started distributing those products. We used the profits to purchase other products from independent manufacturing companies around the world, and we developed their registration and commercialized them under our label. In general, there is no publication that says exactly where our company ranks. Our marketing teams can only estimate the market share of top -level companies and study our level of sales in comparison to other companies in the sector. Today, we have more than 100 registered products. There are eight other top multinational companies, including Syngenta, Bayer, DuPont, Dow, BASF, Monsanto, FMC, and Arista involved in agrochemicals, of which five are performing original research. We could add UP as a relatively new player in Mexico. Velsimex is in the market for products that are out of patent, and it is the leader in Mexico for that market. We purchased leftover products from Velsicol Chemical Corporation and sold those products until they were off the shelves. Since then, we have been focused on the formulation of technical products sold under our own label. Now we are starting to synthesize molecules from the beginning. We are set to synthesize two fungicides, five insecticides, and perform the final part of the synthesis process in two herbicides.</p><h4>What are some of Velsimex's other strengths?</h4><p>We have 20 warehouses positioned all over Mexico, and this has helped us get products to the place they will be used on time. We have a strategy of offering competitive prices compared to the offerings of multinational companies and we try to match their quality. The major difference is that multinationals always have a new product to launch, work on research, and enter the market with new promises. We do not perform research. If we commit to do something, we do exactly what we promise. People trust us, because we always keep our promises. We also try to offer the largest portfolio of products. For our distributors, it is an advantage—they can purchase all the products they need from us, and only go to multinational companies for special components still under patent. We have 350 distributors, and about 90 of them represent 90% of our sales. Of those 90 distributors, Velsimex comprises more than 60% of their sales. We have tried to create agreements with our distributors in order to develop through them.</p><h4>What is your international expansion strategy?</h4><p>We are physically in Guatemala and Panama. First, we develop all the necessary registrations in a new country. Once we have the right registrations, we establish a subsidiary in order to start selling our products. We try to do a lot of business in Central America, because it is close to Mexico. We also export to Colombia and Argentina. Once we start synthesizing, we are looking  for opportunities all over the Americas.</p><h4>How would you characterize the current progress of the agriculture sector?</h4><p>In vegetables, Mexico performs as well as any other country. In the northwest of Mexico, the farmers there are using the best methods for cropping vegetables. In corn, in the western part of the country, irrigation is not needed due to favorable weather conditions. There is a production rate between 12 and 16 tons of corn per hectare. Compared to the US, this is very good. Mexico had a revolutionary war, and because of that, land holdings were broken up. People own 20 or 50 hectares maximum, and it's really hard to combine huge amounts of land as the US does. Jalisco is one state that could compete with the US in terms of production capacity. In general, it's a good area for cropping sorghum or corn. In the northwest, wheat is also produced in large quantities, but there is still the small landholding issue. You can obtain just 800 kilograms of corn per hectare in some areas of Chiapas.</p><h4>What has been your experience as President of “Campo Limpio"?</h4><p>Mexican manufacturing companies of phytosanitary products such as Velsimex and Agrí­cola Innovación and others, as well as the subsidiaries of multinational companies in Mexico such as, Arista, Bayer, DuPont, FMC, UP, and others created an association whose main objective is to collect and recycle all the packaging used in the Mexican agrochemicals market. During 2012, this association will collect and recycle 50% of the total packaging that this industry generates, which represents 2,800 tons of empty used packages.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your Vision 2030 aims to create an integrated and universal healthcare system, granting access to all Mexicans. What strategy has been implemented by the Secretariat to achieve the goals expressed in your long-term plan?<br></h4><p>The path toward an integrated healthcare system starts with the consolidation of universal coverage so that all Mexicans have guaranteed equal access to high-quality services, regardless of their labor status. This will become a reality in 2012. Additionally, we have worked with the social security institutions to develop clinical guidelines, a single-cost methodology underpinning exchange prices, electronic files in each institution with common characteristics, and a sectoral framework for exchanging services that facilitate the optimal use of public infrastructure through specific agreements in each of the 32 federal entities. There are also general exchange frameworks in operation, such as one concerning obstetric emergencies. Consolidating these efforts will allow for a comprehensive integration of the healthcare system.</p><h4>What strengths would you identify in Mexico's healthcare system, especially in terms of infrastructure and human capital quality?</h4><p>During this administration, Mexico has made significant efforts to expand and consolidate its infrastructure. We are proud of our human resources and can confirm that a great number of our doctors are considered globally competitive. Additionally, we have regularized over 70,000 workers to guarantee that our staff have the best possible working conditions.</p><h4>How do you strike a balance between dedication to quality standards, pragmatism, and budgetary concerns?</h4><p>We are proud that the budget for the healthcare sector has been constantly increasing since 2004, particularly with the introduction of the social protection system, Seguro Popular. As a result, health care currently composes almost 7% of GDP.  While this is a historical effort, we are still facing challenges in terms of achieving the best use of our resources. Quality is extremely important to obtain real benefits from these efforts, and it will be constantly improved upon. We are thus developing and implementing clinical guidelines as well as guaranteeing evidence-based medicine.</p><h4>How significant is nanotechnology in Mexico's healthcare sector?</h4><p>Nanotechnology is very relevant for the healthcare sector. Promising results in new molecular diagnostic systems such as nanorays, nanopharmaceuticals, cell therapy and tissue regeneration, and nanobiomimetics are key areas in which to conduct medical R&amp;D in the future.</p><h4>What are Mexico's strengths in terms of clinical research?</h4><p>Mexico has 10 national health institutes devoted to medical education, research, and excellence in health care, which comprises the network of public clinics and hospitals across the country. These institutes contribute to R&amp;D in collaboration with public universities. Over 70% of clinical trials occur in public medical units, which is a direct result of our human resource training.</p><h4>How has the Secretariat worked to create a legal framework that allows the participation of the private sector in the Mexican health system?</h4><p>The best use of resources has sometimes meant that public health institutions could provide treatments to more patients if they outsource certain services to the private sector. While the federal and local governments are fully responsible for providing health care to the entire population, a variety of services are sometimes bought from private institutions in order to obtain the best possible results. This is completely acceptable within our current legal framework, and remains a possibility.</p><h4>Mexico ranks first in obesity globally. How is the Secretariat working to reduce the impact of this chronic disease?</h4><p>A variety of actions have been taken to reduce obesity and its impact. We are promoting care through specialized health clinics offering a multidisciplinary approach, and consolidating prevention campaigns through public media and focusing on children in an effort to promote healthier nutrition in schools. Our aim for healthier life choices started with the available information regarding chronic diseases and their impact. Significant efforts are being made to consolidate preventive actions with the support of organizations such as Consulta Segura, PrevenIMSS, and PrevenISSSTE, as well as teaching the key skills for healthier life choices.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the generics market in Mexico, taking into account the current income levels of Mexicans? How is the Secretariat ensuring that access to medicines and medical attention is affordable?</h4><p>Mexico invests much of its resources in medicines, more than similar income countries or our commercial partners in some cases. This effort is necessary to ensure that the best possible pharmaceutical alternatives reach the population. When this is not the case, we are working hard to promote a strong bioequivalent generic market so that medicines are more affordable. Since October 2011, we have accelerated the process to provide pharmaceutical registration for medicines that compete with those that recently lost their patent. This particular action has resulted in around $76 million worth of savings per year, allowing us to treat more patients with the same budget. The impact of this administrative effort has been fairly surprising, and pushes innovator prices down by 50%. Our key challenge is to decrease our out-of-pocket expenditure through fully accessible public services, including free medical attention and medicines.</p><h4>What is your specific strategy to ensure healthcare access in remote areas of the country?</h4><p>We have taken several actions to provide health care in remote areas, including the installation of mobile units that reach even the most isolated communities where over 3.5 million Mexicans live. These small locations would not otherwise have permanent health units due to their size. Additionally, we work together with the Opportunities Program to guarantee that health is a pillar toward social development as a whole in most rural areas.</p><h4>What structural reforms should be implemented to improve the public healthcare sector in Mexico?</h4><p>The main long-term structural reform regarding health care is a transition toward general tax funding. This would be the last step of our integration-universalization process, and would imply that all Mexicans have equal access to equal services. Our current effort to guarantee coverage and financing is the first step toward equal spending per capita, but the process will be completed when there are no differences in amount or source.</p><h4>In which ways can a high-level health system boost the performance of Mexico's economy as a whole?</h4><p>It has been proven that over one-third of long-term growth can be associated with better health. We are certain that our current investment and efforts will encourage a healthier and more productive workforce that will contribute to overall economic and social development. However, it is not a matter of performance, but a matter of being committed to a comprehensive, high-quality, and sustainable healthcare system for all Mexicans, regardless of income or labor status.</p><h4>What is your outlook beyond 2012 for the health sector?</h4><p>The Mexican health sector will achieve universal coverage and higher quality standards through a better use of resources and a comprehensive understanding of the permanent right to health care. Those are the milestones for the creation of a universal healthcare system, based on a wide social protection approach.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pushing-the-limits]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Liomont has entered several new markets since 1997. What strategy has guided your expansion?<br></h4><p>We are constantly contacting local distributors to represent us in different international markets, and we have a strong partner in Venezuela, our base in South America. This arm of the company does marketing, distribution, and retailing through its local sales force. That has been the strategy; finding good local partners in every one of these countries, including Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru.</p><h4>Your plant currently has the capacity to produce 120 million medical units per year. Are you planning to increase your production in 2012?</h4><p>At present, we have the capacity to manufacture 120 million units; however, we are currently manufacturing approximately 65 million units. This means that we have the capacity to expand and ramp up production. We are expanding a number of our production lines, especially in the steroid facility at Cuajimalpa. However, we are working on a master plan for a new site outside of Mexico City, and we're working with a Spanish company to develop and design the plant. It will include facilities dedicated to the areas of hormones, antibiotics, high-potency products, and biotechnology. At the moment we have enough capacity to keep growing, and we'd like to push our capacity to the limit.</p><h4>How have your export operations expanded over the last year?</h4><p>In 2011 we saw growth in our exports of around 20%. Exports are growing at a faster pace than domestic sales, which grew at around 2% in 2011. We are currently entering Chile, and we're in the process of filing products with a partner in the US, and we are also entering Europe through a partner in Spain called Esteve. Growth in Mexico has been extraordinary in the past 20 years, but it has slowed down recently, particularly since 2009, when there was an economic crisis worldwide.</p><h4>How would you assess your penetration rate in the Mexican pharmaceutical market?</h4><p>We have very strong penetration in terms of prescriptions. For 20 years we've focused on detailing our generic branded products and innovative licenses. We've been visiting doctors with our sales force, which totals around 1,000 representatives throughout the country. Our strategy has been mainly focused on manufacturing branded generics. We have focused on introducing the medical community to Liomont, a company that is outstanding in quality and trust. By following this strategy, we're now the seventh most prescribed company in Mexico. Furthermore, we rank ninth in volume and 18th in value, which means that our products are more affordable.</p><h4>What are your strongest products in the Mexican market?</h4><p>Our best-selling product is the strong analgesic Supradol. Redustat, which is a weight-loss product, has also experienced an incredible growth in sales. We have strong sales with Inhibitron, which is  for ulcers and stomach acidity. Cicloferon is also a very strong product, which is used for cold sores and herpes. We are also launching new products like Thoreva (anti-cholesterol), Degregan (anti-platelet), Go, and Everest (anti-asthmatic), which are expected to be well received in the market. Overall, we have around 60 brand names and over 200 products.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the quality of R&amp;D in Mexico?</h4><p>This is a huge area to be developed. Although there is outstanding talent, Mexico is behind other countries in terms of R&amp;D. We need to use R&amp;D infrastructure to produce goods that can be commercialized and marketed. One problem exists in that researchers gain incentives when they publish their findings, and thus it becomes part of the public domain and cannot be patented. This creates barriers between the industry and researchers. However, I believe there is huge potential for Mexico to become an important center for clinical research. Due to the structure of national health institutions, there is a huge opportunity to carry out clinical tests, trials, and research.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the Mexico Tourism Board's strategy to accomplish the goal of being the ranked as the number five tourist destination by 2018?<br></h4><p>In 2011, we received 22.7 million tourists. That number represents a 1.9% increase since 2010, surpassing the volume we received in 2008, the banner year for Mexico and the world in terms of tourism. Considering the complex global economic circumstances, we are satisfied with the number. Two years ago, we embarked on a very aggressive diversification strategy in terms of our tourism product portfolio. We saw that the US market—our primary customer base—was experiencing a downturn; US citizens were traveling less. Through the end of November 2011, the Department of Commerce released numbers that indicated that the number of travelers from the US had fallen by 4.3%. To combat this decline, we implemented a very aggressive strategy to gain market shares in the rest of the international market. In 2011, we were able to grow business from Canada by 7%, from Brazil 67%, from Argentina 18%, from Colombia 23%, from Peru 37%, from China 30%, and from Russia 55%. From a mathematical point of view, air arrivals from the US decreased by 3% at the end of 2011 as compared to 2010, but we were able to offset that drop and exceed it in terms of a net increase. This growth corresponds with the vision we had two years ago. We are continuing to use this strategy in 2012, but there is a difference now—the US market is recovering. Over the last four months of 2011, air arrivals from the US have registered double-digit growth. As a result, we are able to simultaneously develop our international markets and enjoy the recuperation of business from the US, and we are on the right path to see exponential growth over the next five years. This growth correlates with our objective to become one of the top five countries in the world in terms of tourism. Furthermore, we have launched a new products and services initiative. Mexico has always been a favored beach destination, but we decided to start promoting the country as an attractive cultural location. We aim to enhance the exposure of our many archeological sites, gastronomy, folklore, art, music, history, and traditions. The multi-faceted qualities of the tourism business are what will propel exponential growth. We boast amazing beach resorts that continue to improve, coupled with our cultural wealth and held together by Mexican hospitality. Few countries in the world have this advantage.</p><h4>Within this diversification model, where does business travel fit in?</h4><p>Business travel is an important component of our model. Foreign investment in Mexico continues to grow, and investors see the country as an easy place to do business. More importantly, the profitability of the major corporations that conduct business in Mexico is above average, compared to the rest of the world. This confidence that corporations have in Mexico stimulates business travel. We work very closely with the major cities in the country, such as the local tourism departments of Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. In addition, meetings, incentives, conferences, and events (MICE) travel is a critical segment of business tourism. We have an organization that is specialized in MICE tourism, operating from Washington, D.C. Our focus on MICE tourism is beneficial, because the level of spending that the business segment injects into the market is high. In 2011, we decided to conduct a study in collaboration with PricewaterhouseCoopers to gauge the impact of MICE on the overall economy. It was determined that the MICE industry in Mexico represents approximately $80 billion—an important contribution to spending. In response, we announced at the end of 2011 that we are opening a Mexican Tourism Board office in Brussels, boosting our efforts in the world congress sector. We are very eager to promote MICE travel.</p><h4>How does the Mundo Maya 2012 (Mayan World 2012) campaign fit your strategy to promote cultural tourism?</h4><p>We presented our plan last year at the Museum of Anthropology with President Calderón, initiating a program that links the five states to form a center of cultural wealth. Those are Campeche, Chiapas, Tabasco, Quintana Roo, and Yucatán. We have selected two of the most important archeological sites in each state. Furthermore, we have invited our sister countries Honduras, Belize, and Guatemala to join in the presentation of Mayan culture. In January 2012, we initiated a campaign in Spain and Central America. It was a big investment; we have a budget of $10 million to market the Mundo Maya program domestically and internationally, and we have high expectations for the campaign.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Development Factors]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[development-factors]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors are steering the development of the Mexican economy?<br></h4><p>Mexico started 2011 quite well, with 7.4% growth in the manufacturing sector in the first quarter as compared to the same period in 2010. In the second quarter growth dropped below 5%, and the reason for this is Mexico's biggest vulnerability. Mexico manufactures a broad range of products, from traditional products such as textiles, furniture, and food products, to very complex products in the electronics and aerospace sectors, but unfortunately it has only one big client; 85% of Mexico's exports go to the US. When the US has a problem, Mexico automatically has a problem. In the context of newly industrialized countries in the region Mexico is still performing very well, however. Another problem is the internal market. Although Mexico is the 12th largest economy in the world, it depends on oil for income; almost 40% of the federal budget comes from the oil industry. There are great discrepancies in the distribution of wealth, which means purchasing power is not as strong as it could be for a population of 112 million people. The UN's statistics show that 45% of the population, or 49 million people, are living below the relative poverty line. The government is pushing to develop high-tech industries, particularly in the electronics, automotive, and aerospace sectors.</p><h4>What is the state of industrial energy efficiency and sustainable living in Mexico?</h4><p>This issue hadn't been addressed at all before the current government came to power. Mexico has a predominantly petroleum-based economy, which affects the people's mindset, and it is important to maintain the oil industry because it makes up 40% of the government's revenue. President Calderón was previously minister for energy, and he is constantly reiterating that Mexico can only be competitive in the future if it can differentiate its energy sector. He launched two initiatives in 2009 that were unprecedented for this country: one is a law promoting renewable energies, and the other is a law requiring efficient energy use. The result has been that Mexico is already producing about 20% of its energy from renewable sources: wind, solar, and geothermal. Mexico actually has 30 years of experience with geothermal energy, and is the fourth largest producer of geothermal energy in the world. Mexico is a major partner in UNIDO's Energy Program for Latin America thanks to its know-how in this area.</p><p>On the industrial side energy efficiency is not emphasized to the extent we think it should be. This has to do both with mindset and with the need for an even stronger government push to incentivize energy efficiency in the industrial sector. However, I feel that it is at least picking up speed. The landscape is changing and I would say Mexico is doing the right things to become more energy efficient and use more renewable energies.</p><h4>In your opinion what advantages does the Mexican economy have over other Latin American countries?</h4><p>Mexico's greatest advantage is also its greatest weakness, namely its proximity to the US. The US is still the largest economy in the world, and even if it falls to number two, it will still remain a big buyer. Being part of NAFTA is a big advantage. Mexico has a very skilled workforce; it has numerous universities and technical schools, including some very good ones. The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) is the largest and best university in the continent, with some  3,500 researchers. The country's broad industrial base is another asset; Mexico has large supply industries for various industrial sectors, including the electronic, automotive, and aerospace sectors as well as traditional sectors like wood, food processing, and textiles. In the region only Brazil has the kind of industrial base Mexico has.</p><h4>What do you think about the current performance of Mexico's industrial sector, and what is your outlook for its future?</h4><p>It is going well, better than in many industrialized countries, especially those in Europe. Mexico has its public finances pretty much in order. As we can see in the US and Europe, and as we learned in this region in the 1980s, if a country gets into a debt spiral it can erode economic performance significantly. Mexico is doing well at the macroeconomic level, but it has a number of vulnerabilities. If Mexico continues on the path toward diversifying not only its industries but also its export base, it has an enormous potential to develop further. The inclusion of more of the Mexican population in the development process is an open issue that I know the government is addressing, but we at the UN feel that that will require a stronger approach.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the presence of Coca-Cola in Mexico?<br></h4><p>We operate with 12 bottlers, including Jugos del Valle, which is a joint venture set up three years ago when we bought the company. In total, these bottlers have 64 plants across Mexico and around 385 distribution centers, with 29,000 trucks. We serve about 1.4 million points of sale throughout the country. Our penetration rate in the Mexican market is fairly extensive, and because of that a lot of our business is in the traditional channels—even in small towns around the country. Concerning our labor force, we have 500 employees in our office, 93,000 at our bottlers, and 800,000 indirect employees.</p><h4>How significant is the Mexican market for Coca-Cola's overall global operations?</h4><p>The Mexican market is the second most important for Coca-Cola after the US, and it represents about 12% of worldwide volumes. In addition, Mexicans drink the most Coca-Cola portfolio products per capita in the world. In fact, we are the leader in the market for soft drinks, juice and juice drinks, and in teas. We are third in energy drinks and also third in water, as well as second for sports drinks.</p><h4>In 2009 your company declared its intention to invest $5 billion over five years in order to develop the business. At what stage are these investments?</h4><p>We are on track with our investment plan with an average of $1 billion invested each year. Given the size of the Mexican market and its strong performance in terms of sales, we plan to double our revenues within 10 years—and the only way to maintain the necessary pace of growth is to continue investing in this market.</p><h4>How would you rate Mexico as a production base?</h4><p>We have been doing business in Mexico for 85 years, and from our perspective it has always been a great market to operate in. There's a strong and educated workforce as well as a good level of quality managers. The infrastructure is very good in the country, and the distribution system is highly developed. It is also a great base for companies producing for export due to the country's location close to the US.</p><h4>Domestic demand is one of the engines of the Mexican economy. How do you see its performance changing in the long term?</h4><p>The internal market in Mexico includes more than 100 million people—with the average age standing at 27 years. Having a young population means that the workforce will benefit, while from a company point of view it represents a very good opportunity because domestic demand can sustain the growth path of every business. In that respect, over 99% of our production is destined for the domestic market.</p><h4>What are the country's advantages over other Latin American countries?</h4><p>Its proximity to the US and the fact that Mexico has coasts on the Pacific and Atlantic oceans are its main advantages. Secondly, macroeconomic policies over the last five years have been consistent. Inflation is under control and the government is working to maintain a predictable and sustainable growth rate. The environment for doing business and openness to new businesses is very comfortable, and the government is open to the participation of foreign companies and capital in the territory. The labor force is highly skilled, and there is a huge availability of raw materials. Mexico is not experiencing explosive growth like Brazil or China, but if you look at the country's economic performance from a historical perspective, you can see that growth has been strong and predictable over the years.</p><h4>What are the main challenges in the distribution segment?</h4><p>I firmly believe that Mexico should continue to channel more into infrastructure development. This will improve the environment for companies looking to set up in the country. Any investment in this sector will certainly pay off.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Always Be Prepared]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[always-be-prepared]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies did Ford Mexico implemented during the recent global economic crisis?</h4><p>The reason why Ford didn't ask for support in terms of cash grants was because we had already raised enough funds to confront the storm by the time the crisis hit the US. We knew that something was coming; the economy was spiraling downward in many countries, not just in the US. We predicted that there would be a slowdown in the market, and that a major restructuring would be required. In 2006-2007 we raised enough money to resize our company and survive the crisis. Fortunately, we choose the correct strategy and obtained the results we were expecting. We had excess capacity, particularly in the US. Therefore, we decided to shut down some plants. This action took place during 2007 and 2008. In total we shut down 16 plants in the US. As you can imagine, that required a lot of negotiations with the trade unions. We had to renegotiate our contract with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union. The UAW recognized that restructuring was required in order to survive. The conclusion we obtained from this was that it is better to have a smaller company than a bankrupt company. We put together the right plan that we shared with our stakeholders, and we managed to come back earlier and stronger than our two key competitors in the US, GM and Chrysler. Our competitors had a harder time in obtaining money and support from the government, and make key decisions with their stakeholders. It was painful and difficult, but we gained market share in the US.</p><h4>What are the key elements of the “One Ford" initiative, and how is its implementation influencing your growth path?</h4><p>The plan is rather simple. When we restructured the company, we put together a five-year business plan. We set a series of intermediate goals for the period. We were rather conservative in our economic assumptions, and we created a very strong product plan. Through One Ford, we'll have a global team making decisions and plans. We have one goal for everybody. Our team is looking for automotive leadership based on customer, dealer, shareholder, and employee satisfaction. The team goes beyond the boundaries and limits for the company. The plan is also very simple: restructure the company to a size that can deal with the realities of the industry, make the company buyable, accelerate the development of new products, and raise the funds required to finance the restructuring of the company. We also have a set of values that conducts the way we behave and do business.</p><h4>Ford in Mexico has registered consistent growth over recent quarters. What market segments are driving this growth?</h4><p>We report as a region and as a company. In our reports, Mexico is included as a part of North America—besides this, there are three other regions around the world. We also have a consolidated report. We were expecting to repeat this growth in the fourth quarter of 2011, despite the difficulties that we were facing toward the end of that year, especially in Europe. In Mexico, we have been fairly stable over the past three years. We have restructured the company in order to operate more profitably. Most of the investment in Mexico has been dedicated to producing vehicles more efficiently, and meeting world-class standards in terms of safety, fuel efficiency, and design. In 2008, we announced an investment program worth $5 billion, which this year is about to come to an end. It was based on increasing the capacity of the Hermosillo plant, the launch of the 2009 Fusion model, and a complete revamping of Cuautitlán, a plant to the north of Mexico City. Vehicles that are exported to other countries across the Americas are built at our Cuautitlán assembly facility. We completely restored the plant and installed new systems and equipment. It's almost completely new, even though it has been open for 50 years now. We produce 32 vehicles per hour, in two shifts, which cover 16 hours a day. Hermosillo almost doubles that capacity. It can produce 58 vehicles per hour over three shifts, six days a week. In 2011 Hermosillo produced approximately 320,000 units, and we are planning to increase production to between 345,000 and 350,000 units in 2012. This plant is the largest in Mexico, and it produces primarily for the US market. In 2009, we also built a second engine plant in Chihuahua, which we opened in 2009. Nowadays, we have two plants there that produce diesel engines.</p><h4>Why has Mexico become such a successful base for production?</h4><p>One factor is labor quality. Mexicans are very well educated, and it is very easy to get high-quality labor to operate the plants. A second factor is that labor costs are very competitive. As a result, Hermosillo has been used as a business model for the new plants that are being constructed by the company around the globe. We are building several plants in Asia, and a couple more in India and China. They will be built in the same manner as the one in Hermosillo, where the Fusion model is produced and has become one of the most successful vehicles in the US.</p><h4>How is Ford's vehicle financing program assisting your sales?</h4><p>In 2009 we signed an agreement with BBVA Bancomer, and it performs all our vehicle financing. In terms of credit assistance, we operate a wholesale financing arrangement with our dealers. This is an alliance we have been running for a little over a year. Financing as a percentage of total sales is growing, although not at the speed we would like it to. This has nothing to do with our ambitions or performance, but has more to do with the way the market is structured. Many things have to happen in order for the market to achieve a financing rate of 80%-90%, like in Brazil, the US, or Europe. It has to do with the level of access to banking services for both industry and the population.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the development of the hybrid and electric vehicle segment?</h4><p>Making our operations sustainable is key for our future. We need to fight global warming, and we should support the efforts that governments around the world are making. We also believe that there will be important purchasing decisions to be made in some markets, but we know that not all markets are the same. Some will take longer to make these decisions, depending on the level of sophistication, purchasing power, and income. Unfortunately, new technologies are not cheap. In 2010 the entire world produced 75 million vehicles, out of which just 1 million were hybrid or electric. Imagine the difference in economies of scale; we know how to produce a conventional vehicle cheaply, but we don't know how to produce an affordable hybrid. Until the scale of production grows, it will take a while before we can offer a competitive cost. That's why we have dedicated so much money and resources to improving the fuel efficiency and emission levels of conventional vehicles. We can do a lot more for the environment by simultaneously investing in hybrid technology and greener engines. It will be a while before hybrid and electric vehicles take a higher portion of vehicle sales.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main steps has Grupo Mexico-Minera Mexico (GM-MM) taken to become one of the largest resource companies globally?</h4><p>Grupo Mexico has 65.4 million tons of copper reserves, and we are the fifth largest copper and the third largest molybdenum producer in the world. We have achieved this position because we have excellent methods to calculate our reserves, moreover we are continuously investing and exploring. The innovation applications in our operational model and the utilization of best practices are the key elements behind GM-MM's positioning as one of the largest mining corporations in the world. Hard work and strict planning are also key elements that have made Grupo Mexico what it is today.</p><h4>What is the distribution of your operations across Mexico, Peru, and the US?</h4><p>Around 80% of our revenue comes from copper, 7% comes from molybdenum, and the rest is derived from silver, zinc, and other metals. In the US we have three large open-pit mines, and we operate four open-pit mines in Peru and Mexico. The largest open-pit mine is Buenavista del Cobre in the northern part of Sonora, Mexico. The Quajone mine in Peru is about the same size. In addition to these, we have five underground mines in Mexico.</p><h4>What is the production capacity of the Buenavista del Cobre copper mine?</h4><p>It's operating at full capacity, with additional projects to bring the total capacity of the mine from 190,000 tons of copper a year to 450,000 tons in the next four years. Around $3 billion will be invested in the expansion project. Buenavista del Cobre alone holds 25 million tons worth of copper reserves.</p><h4>How does Grupo Mexico contribute to the international mining industry in terms of best practice and innovation?</h4><p>We extensively consider benchmarking an important way to control and improve our operations, and we constantly invest in new technologies. We always follow the best practices and apply the latest techniques and methods; one of our core characteristics is our efficiency. As a result, our cost of production is one of the lowest in the world.</p><h4>How do you see the demand for resources evolving in the next five years, and what main trends can you identify?</h4><p>There will continue to be growth in demand for commodities in the developing world and China. Another factor is that the grade of ore is going down and reserves are falling. As a result, I think we have a bright future and that prices will rise as a result.</p><h4>How has Grupo Mexico developed over the years and what was its main strategy?</h4><p>In the past we were just a local mining company. Our plan was to first complete our program of integration to become a more balanced company that produced not only minerals, but also fine metals. We completed this part of our strategy in the 1990s. Then our goal was to diversify, so we entered the railroad business, becoming the largest railroad company in Mexico with 10,000 kilometers of main railroad tracks. Our final goal was to become international; we achieved this by acquiring ASARCO, which in 1965 owned 100% of Grupo Mexico. Today, Grupo Mexico owns 100% of ASARCO. One of ASARCO's principal assets was its Peruvian mines, which were included in the acquisition.</p><h4>What main benefit did the acquisition of ASARCO and its Peruvian mining assets bring to Grupo Mexico?</h4><p>As a result of acquiring ASARCO, the value of Grupo Mexico grew organically. The acquisition of new assets improved our performance in terms of production and capacity. Consequently, the company's shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV), and the Lima Stock Exchange.</p><h4>How would you assess the participation of foreign mining companies in Mexico's mining sector?</h4><p>There are about 230 Canadian companies performing exploration in Mexico, not to mention US, Australian, and other Mexican companies.</p><h4>Do you think Grupo Mexico is creating a Mexican model in the mining sector that could be exported to other countries?</h4><p>Mexico is number one in Latin America in terms of exploration. There are new lines and projects coming on stream as well. Mexico is open to investments in this industry; the taxation regimen for companies operating in this sector is very competitive, and many foreign companies are interested in the market. There's also a friendly social environment for mining companies here, despite ongoing problems of security throughout the country. It's a country where you can work hand-in-hand with local communities. This enables a kind of sustainable development, which is part of our long-term strategy as Grupo Mexico. By sustainable, I mean not just economically, but also socially and environmentally. This is very important to Grupo Mexico. Furthermore, we look toward contributing to the development of communities and to the development of human resources.</p><h4>How much of Mexico's mining and mineral resource potential do you think has been tapped?</h4><p>I would say around less than 30%. Around 70% remains to be discovered. That's why Mexico has so much potential for foreign companies, because there is a lot to discover, and therefore a big opportunity for growth and development in the mining sector.</p><h4>How do you think the mining sector will evolve in Mexico and internationally?</h4><p>Mexico is constantly increasing its position in the international market, and therefore its importance. For the first time ever, mining now brings in more foreign cash flow than tourism and remittances, and it's now the third biggest export industry in Mexico after the oil and automotive  sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As voice technology gives way to data, how is América Móvil adjusting to worldwide trends toward mobile computing?</h4><p>Voice is moving to data. We are investing heavily in data networks and content. Our approach is three pronged: voice, data, and broadband video. We are thus creating networks capable of providing all three at once. It is a huge investment for América Móvil to be making in Latin America. In that respect, América Móvil is the leading investor in the region. Our investment is focused not only on the big cities, but also on small towns in order to provide not only voice but data services as well. Moreover, I believe that data developments are going to change the world. Your cell phone will be your computer, without the limitations of current smart phones. This will open up the sector to all kinds of changes, such as our Banca Móvil service, which allows the user to perform e-banking on the move.</p><h4>How has your acquisition of Telmex changed your operations?</h4><p>We acquired 61% of Telmex around one year ago, and are making an offer to buy the remaining shares. Technology is becoming more convergent, and so it made sense for us to acquire Telmex. This has been a strategy we have employed across Latin America, and it has been very successful.</p><h4>What factors allowed América Móvil to remain resilient over the course of the global economic crisis?</h4><p>There have been difficult years and I think there are more to come, but we are ready. We make sound investments and operate with the best technology, and this allows us to remain competitive in the market. The data segment is growing, and there is still a lot of room to grow. This will drive growth no matter what. Only 10% of our wireless subscribers have a smartphone. We want 50% to 60% or more to have a smartphone, and then use data. There is still a lot of work to do to move more and more people onto using data. To achieve this goal a large network is necessary and the right investments must be made. Except for Mexico and Argentina we provide all services, including wireless and fixed broadband and satellite and cable TV across our operations in Latin America.</p><h4>What has been the net impact of your international pact with Vodafone in 2005?</h4><p>This was a positive deal as Vodafone is a world-class company. In the markets where it is not present, we are there, and vice versa. This pact more or less provides for roaming possibilities. We also share some corporate customers.</p><h4>How do you see the company growing in Latin America?</h4><p>The current mobile penetration rate is around 80% in Mexico, so there is room to grow on that front. We are present in almost every country, and so we expect a lot of organic growth. There is one more acquisition pending in El Salvador, but other than that no large acquisitions will be made. The rest of the growth is going to be mostly organic. We also provide internet in Brazil through a cable company. We own 92% of the company, and will possibly buy the rest. On top of that, we will continue investing in the networks of the countries we are already present in.</p><h4>How do you see TV and broadband penetration changing?</h4><p>Telmex does not have a license to provide television services; however, if it did we believe penetration would increase as a result of competition. A lot of firms are investing in broadband, and as computers come down in price the penetration rate will increase. Tablet computer use will also increase the penetration rate of wireless broadband. Through Telmex we sell computers and provide comfortable payment options, and this is helping to increase the penetration rate, as it is currently low.</p><h4>How significant is Mexico to América Móvil's overall operations?</h4><p>We are growing more in the rest of Latin America than in Mexico at the moment. We operate in a total of 18 countries, and most markets are growing at a faster rate than Mexico. Brazil is currently showing strong growth.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the Mexican economy, and what does it signal for the future of América Móvil?</h4><p>These are tough times, as the US and Europe have both been affected by the global economic crisis. Latin America is in a much better position, but I predict we will also be affected by a slowdown in growth in Europe and the US. We need to be prepared for this. América Móvil doesn't hire too many people or increase costs when times are good as costs then need to be decreased when tough times are faced. Today, we are in good shape. We need to be prepared for the slowdown in Latin America, but I think we are still going to emerge in better shape than much of the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Mexico represent for Movistar's global operations?<br></h4><p>It is an important operation in terms of clients. We have close to 21 million customers, which is about 22% of the Mexican mobile market. Movistar is the second largest operator in Mexico. Mobile penetration rates in Central American countries and South America are about 100%. We have not reached those percentages yet, meaning there is an opportunity in terms of market growth. Ours is also an underdeveloped market, considering smartphones and data. Data is the future of telecommunications, and this sector is still in its infancy in Mexico; there is a lot of room to grow. Despite the fact that we have a smaller operation than, for example, Brazil, and despite the fact that our market share is smaller than in most other South American countries, in terms of potential Mexico is a very important country. It is the second largest economy in Latin America with a lot of opportunity for growth.</p><h4>What has been the significance of 3G in the local market?</h4><p>If one service provider has 3G then everybody has to have it. The difficulty for us—and fortunately we were able to overcome it—was that we did not have enough frequency, or enough spectrum in the metropolitan zone of Mexico City. If you want to have good wireless broadband access for your smartphone, you need 3G. LTE is the next step—we expect to provide it throughout Latin America. We are just waiting for the terminals that are needed to offer a sufficiently low price. The iPad now comes available with a 4G-type connection, but smartphones are still too expensive for our market. It is going to take some time. If anybody dives into 4G, that will pull everybody else into the new technology.</p><h4>You recently presented the BlackBerry Curve 9380 and the BlackBerry Bold 9790 in Mexico. What has been the reception among Mexican consumers?</h4><p>We have had good a reception to all our smartphone launches. What we are trying to do now is find the most inexpensive smartphones because the purchasing power of the Mexican population is not comparable to European or US customers. We are trying to convince the manufacturers to bring the prices down. Movistar is already providing a reasonably low-priced smartphone, as most people want to be able to use messaging services, access the internet, and download music and videos. We do not want this to be something that is limited to wealthy consumers.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the local ICT sector?</h4><p>There is a need for fiber-optic backbones to be constructed all over the country. We teamed up with Televisa and Megacable in order to bid for fiber-optic lines from the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), because the backbone provided by Telmex is expensive. For many applications, mostly industrial, technological, and scientific, you need a considerable amount of broadband. We still have a long way to go in Mexico in terms of infrastructure needs. We need to be able to have a broad enough market for the population to be able to acquire tablets or PCs. The population in Mexico is, to a considerable degree, urbanized, but there are parts of the population that are still rural. That rural population does not have sufficient coverage or none at all. That is another challenge for the future, especially for educational purposes. To improve coverage, satellites are part of the answer.</p><h4>What financial performance are you expecting for 2012?</h4><p>We have a very reasonable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) figure, considering the challenges we have faced. We have been able to control our costs and cut our administrative and operational expenditure substantially over time. At the same time, our customer base has been expanding. We are happy that our results have been improving and we are projecting a continuous improvement in the future, mostly because of data. Voice is becoming more and more an IP-type of connectivity and, therefore, less attractive, and more like a commodity. The percentage of post-paid to pre-paid services, as well as the percentage of smartphones and tablets, is expected to increase. That's where the future lies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the 2007-2012 sectorial communications and transport program fit into the government's “Vision 2030"?<br></h4><p>The telecommunications and transportation projects for 2007-2012 are part of Vision 2030. They are consistent with the goal to position Mexico among the top 20% of countries with the best infrastructure development and competitiveness by the end of 2030. In order to achieve this goal, we have established objectives, actions, and projects in three critical areas: connectivity of the transportation system, integration and modernization of logistic chains, and greater use and coverage for high-tech applications in the telecoms sector. During this administration, we have invested more than $45 billion in the development of road, railway, airport, ports, and communications infrastructure. This is an unprecedented investment. In fact, during this administration, the investment in all infrastructure sectors was close to 5% of GDP, which is considerably more than Mexico used to invest. For instance, 10 years ago investments were slightly above 3%.</p><h4>What main projects has the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) implemented to improve infrastructure development in the areas most critical to Mexico's social and economic development?</h4><p>Transport infrastructure is vital for economic and social development. It facilitates the movement of goods and allows people to get to school, work, and leisure activities. The current administration has focused on providing infrastructure in strategic locations to improve people's standard of living. In terms of road infrastructure, we have built or modernized more than 18,500 kilometers of roads and highways. The Durango-Mazatlán highway, a 230-kilometer road, is one of our main road projects. It consists of a new 75-kilometer segment that forms part of a corridor linking Mexico's Pacific and Atlantic coasts. It reduces travel times up to six hours for freight vehicles and 2.5 for private cars. It is a very complex and challenging project because it goes through the mountains, which are particularly difficult and expensive to access. It has 115 bridges, 61 tunnels, and includes the tallest cable-stayed bridge in the world; the Baluarte Bicentennial Bridge, valued at $1.5 billion. Another main project is the Mexico City Northern Bypass ($548 million). It is a 224-kilometer road that avoids traffic entering the city thereby easing congestion and reducing the environmental impact. Thanks to this project, about 1 million cars will no longer have to drive through Mexico City. With regards to rail infrastructure, we have built 24 railway underpasses to keep freight trains from having to run through major urban areas. We have also built the first suburban railway in the Mexico City metropolitan area; it started operations in 2008, and transports more than 130,000 passengers per day. Regarding airport infrastructure, we have built four new terminals in Mexico City, Monterrey, San José del Cabo, and Cuernavaca. We have also modernized 13 terminals across the country, built a second runway at the Cancún airport, and built a new airport in Puerto Peñasco. This administration has also updated Mexico's port infrastructure. We have invested in specialized terminals and industrial facilities at five ports (Altamira, Tampico, Lázaro Cárdenas, Manzanillo, and Guaymas) and have built five specialized docks for cruises.</p><p>In terms of telecoms, we auctioned a pair of dark-fiber strands from Mexico's electricity utility, amounting to more than 20,000 kilometers, which allows for the possibility of a third national broadband network for data, voice, and video. We allocated 30 MHz in the 1.9 GHz band and 90 MHz in the 1.7 GHz band. We have reduced interconnection rates for mobile and fixed telephone networks, and we are investing in a satellite system that includes three new satellites that will provide a platform for fixed and mobile communications, and will support the national security infrastructure, allow better natural disaster planning, and bring communications services to 70,000 communities with fewer than 500 inhabitants. The first satellite (for fixed satellite services) will be delivered to the SCT during the last quarter of 2012. The second satellite (for mobile satellite services) is planned to be delivered by the end of 2013 and the third satellite (for mobile satellite services) is scheduled to arrive during the second half of 2014.</p><h4>How has private investment contributed to the development of infrastructure in the transportation sector?</h4><p>Private investment has played a crucial role in improving the quality and quantity of infrastructure in Mexico. In the period between 2007 and 2011, the private sector invested more than $22 billion in transport infrastructure. To boost private investment in road construction, Mexico has set  up various public-private partnership (PPP) schemes. We grant concessions to bidders who request the least financial assistance from the federal government to build, operate, and maintain new highways. We also use Project Finance Initiatives (PPS) with which the government grants a concession to a private company to design, finance, build, maintain, and operate a road, again awarding it to the bidder who requests the least amount of federal funding, and the government pays them an amount that includes the amortization of the investment plus the amount necessary for the maintenance of the road.</p><h4>According to the Competitiveness Index from the World Economic Forum, Mexico ranks 58th, gaining eight positions from 2010 to 2011. What measures should be taken in the communications and transportation sectors to keep improving Mexico's position?</h4><p>Over the past few years, Mexico has undergone important actions leading to a stronger and more competitive economy. With regards to communications and transportation, this administration has maintained steady levels of investments and has provided better regulations. In addition, new    PPP legislation has recently been approved by Congress. Even though the PPP schemes in place today have brought about excellent results, now that this legislation has been passed we will be able to do much more. This legislation increases legal certainty for investors, which we expect will expedite the development of infrastructure projects in order to continue investing in infrastructure in the range of 5% of GDP annually.</p><h4>How has the telecommunications sector evolved in the last 5 years in terms of regulatory framework?</h4><p>I see the transportation and communication sectors increasing as a percentage of GDP. The telecommunications sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors in Mexico; it's a very dynamic sector. As we continue to set the right regulatory framework and establish the right conditions to attract investment, we expect to see higher growth. From a regulatory perspective, we have already been working on the reduction of interconnection rates, publishing a fundamental technical plan for interconnection and interoperability, as well as guidelines for the formulation of cost models to resolve disagreements about interconnection between operators, and the portability of numbers. All of these regulatory decisions strengthen the sector and instill more confidence in potential investors. I expect there to be growth in that sector in terms of labor and employment as well. We also see the transport industry playing an important role. Over 70% of our exports to the US, for example, are transported by heavy weight vehicles, a sector that is being modernized. We are taking important steps to keep renovating and updating the truck fleet.</p><h4>How is the SCT promoting competitive tariffs and a broader geographic coverage in order to improve service access to the general population?</h4><p>Between 2007 and 2011, the prices of telecommunications services have dropped: broadband internet rates by about 37%, mobile phone rates by about 55%, and fixed residential phone lines by 24%. We have also increased coverage; for example, in terms of mobile telephone subscriptions, we have increased by 75.2%, today we have 97 million mobile telephone lines registered in Mexico, out of a total population of 112 million. In addition, COFETEL, the telecoms regulatory agency, promoted a drop in fixed and mobile interconnection rates by 68% and 57% respectively, for 2011 in comparison with 2010. We are doing quite well with regard to this comparison with other Latin American countries, but if you compare us with OECD countries we still need to keep going. The growth of mobile networks has allowed 73% of people living in areas with a population of less than 2,500 inhabitants to have access to telephone and internet services. We have a program to supply pre-paid residential telephone services for nearly 9,000 rural communities of between 500 and 2,200 inhabitants, covering a total of close to 8 million people, and another program for smaller communities, which provides service for nearly 13,000 communities with less than 500 inhabitants. Furthermore, by the end of 2012 we hope to have 24,000 Digital Community Centers, which will provide free internet access to close to 10 million people. Nowadays we have 6,788 centers located in areas with difficult access.</p><h4>What actions has the Secretariat taken to turn Mexico into a logistical platform in the region, leveraging its strong geographic position and links with international markets?</h4><p>The strategy we have followed is to complete the corridors linking Mexico from East to West, so that our Pacific ports can compete with others. Before this administration, some of these corridors were not complete, and some were incompletely modernized. We are trying to get them all modernized. That is the key focus of the development of roads. We have been working on nine vertical and six horizontal corridors that altogether amount to more than 18,500 kilometers of roads. We are also trying to invest in ports, so that they are in a better condition to receive merchandise, and thus better able to exploit the intermodal transportation system. The criteria used to define the longitudinal and cross-regional corridors include the integration of more population centers with main tourist destinations in Mexico, building direct communication and connectivity among states, linking capital cities, coast roads, and borders, and building lines of communication between seaports and inland ports. Related to this, between September 2010 and July 2011 we promoted the development of four intermodal terminals located in Querétaro, Nuevo León, and Aguascalientes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Estafeta is currently investing heavily. In which sectors are investments being channeled?</h4><p>With the exception of 2009, we have invested in Mexico every year since the company began. On average, we invest $25 million per year, and this year we aim to increase the amount to $35 million. The majority of our investments are made in infrastructure, and we operate a fleet of trucks. We also own distribution centers, which sets us apart from the competition as well enhances our security and the quality of our services. Our image and reputation for quality has improved, owing to our company's flexibility.</p><h4>Which segments are driving demand for Estafeta's services?</h4><p>The courier segment is growing. The sectors experiencing the most demand are IT, computer parts, automobile spare parts, and textile components for clothing and shoes. In Mexico, e-commerce continues to be underdeveloped. We do not have an Amazon.com in Mexico, and we cannot order from department stores through websites. In the US and Europe, the online sector is motivating the courier business. We see this changing and having a major impact on the courier sector.</p><h4>Is Estafeta outpacing its competitors?</h4><p>The speed of growth is changing every year. The competition is very strong in Mexico, and much stronger here than in other Latin American countries, such as Colombia. However, 2011 went better for us than for a number of our counterparts. In 2011, we grew by 9%.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of being a local company?</h4><p>Our main advantage is our wide coverage—it is the broadest network in Mexico. We cover 15%-20% more postal codes than our competitors, and we can reach any location in Mexico. Another advantage is that we boast a very broad portfolio of products. Aside from our main courier services, we have entered new sectors of logistics such as warehousing and freight services. Currently, we can ship anything palletized in terms of the less-than-truckload (LTL) segment, as well as large-scale freight. Essentially, we can move everything.</p><h4>Do you see the ratio of courier business changing as you develop logistics infrastructure?</h4><p>The courier business comprises 80% of our sales. The rest of our sales are in airfreight, the LTL business, and warehousing. We do see the ratio shifting as LTL, freight, and warehousing register rapid growth, and the courier service continues to encounter competition. Currently in Mexico, many companies independently carry out freight and warehousing, with their own feed for distribution. Most pharmaceutical companies do not use third-party logistics (3PL) companies for warehousing and logistics; only 20% of healthcare firms choose to utilize 3PL. However, this situation has been changing over the past three or four years, and we are now observing increased demand. Companies are beginning to realize that they have more of an opportunity to excel in their core businesses when logistics are handled by a third party.</p><h4>Which main industries are demanding 3PL in Mexico?</h4><p>International companies mainly demand 3PL, and they understand how to contract a 3PL partner. Mexican companies have not been quick to follow this trend, because they tend to want control of the logistics process. For example, we suggested to a customer the establishment of a warehouse in a location that minimizes the distance required to transport its goods. However, the customer wanted the warehouse in the same city as the main office, in order to observe the facility firsthand. We are encouraging a cultural change that will take time to implement.</p><h4>How do you characterize the US economy's influence on Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico is beginning to depend less on markets such as the US. We do enjoy a very strong connection to the US, and if the economy in the US declines, Mexico experiences large problems. During the economic crisis, Mexico was one of the most affected countries. However, this will be less and less the case. The local market is growing stronger every year, and there are industries such as e-commerce that will gain headway in the future. When individual income increases, people consume more goods. When people consume more goods, there are more movements for a courier company.</p><h4>What is your ultimate vision for the company?</h4><p>I firmly believe that we can strengthen our position in the market. Locally, we can act faster than the competition. Internationally, I feel there is room for growth. In the courier segment, it is not possible to compete internationally, but in freight we can perform better than UPS or FedEx. We can be faster and cheaper by moving the goods directly.</p><p>For international freight from China, Japan, or Europe, freight can travel directly to Mexico. In some recent bids, we have recognized our great advantage in this respect. We can be more flexible, faster, cheaper, and better in quality than the large companies. We can grow the international segment of our company, as well as our freight and warehousing activities. These new initiatives will secure larger revenues in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Mexico a unique market for parking services?</h4><p>When we were established in 1994, a number of large buildings were being constructed in Mexico City and people began to consider the management of parking lots. After conducting research, the construction companies brought in Central Parking from the US as a partner, thereby establishing the company's first international operations. Following this event, Central Parking started to launch different operations around the world. In 2005, it decided to come back to the US and divested from its international subsidiaries. When Actinver offered to invest with AMB, we began as an independent company: CENTRAL. Mexico City is an important market with approximately 25 million people (including the suburbs) and over 5 million cars, which is unusual around the world. In other large cities, such as Tokyo, there are barely 5 million cars. European infrastructure is designed for cities of 5 million people who own a total of 1 million cars. Here, there are 1 million cars in just one area of the city, which is completely different. Parking equipment can require more maintenance than usual, and the computers' capacity may be overloaded. We are facing a great challenge, and we have to be very technologically advanced.</p><h4>How do you adapt technology to this environment?</h4><p>The technology we use is based on the demand we experience. Mexico is a country that changes its physical currency relatively frequently. That sounds normal, but the issue is that every time the currency changes, we have to reprogram the ATMs and retrain people. We are a third-world country with a devaluation issue. We anticipated these challenges, and our equipment has to work in different conditions. There are also environmental factors. We have deserts, jungles, and humidity on the beaches, and 40°C heat in the north of the country. On top of that, we have more external installations than Europe. Our equipment is not ready for these challenges. Therefore, we have been developing innovative technology that will accomplish these tasks. We have also been working to solve a number of problems. Due to security reasons, people want to go to commercial locations where there is heavy security around the buildings. We are bringing banking technology to these parking lots, which will allow users to pay for parking time, telephone services, electricity bills, as well as recharge their cell phones. We already have 7.5 million operations per month and we aim to add a variety of services for our clients. Currently, clients have to form a line to pay for parking, and we want to make that line disappear. We are creating a card that people can use in multiple parking lots, which will facilitate the process. That is the technology we are introducing, and we believe it has the potential for worldwide application, especially in developing economies that have parking issues.</p><h4>What additional services are you looking to get involved in?</h4><p>We are looking to add a variety of services to our portfolio. A car in an emerging country is the first or second most important thing a person can own, and may be one of the most expensive investments. The right cities for us have a huge amount of traffic and we want to help our clients save time. If we can offer services while the customer is at work, there is value-added. CENTRAL provides services such as valet parking, parking equipment maintenance, and consulting. We have been seeking entry into new markets and are conducting test versions of services such as car washing and advertising in parking lots.</p><h4>What did Actinver and AMB see in CENTRAL that made it attractive as a private equity investment?</h4><p>Parking in Mexico was a highly fragmented market, with a scarcity of technology and low standards. In other words, there was an opportunity to grow. Now, technology is part of our business and CENTRAL has established high standards in service, giving confidence to its clients and users. In Mexico, there are 11,000 parking lots and 1 million parking spaces. It is a $3 billion business that provides 30,000 jobs. Today, we earn about $100 million from the market on an annual basis, with more than 150 parking lots and more than 150,000 spaces, as well as 1,500 employees. We believe we can double our size in the coming years. This growth potential is what attracts capital from investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[land-of-opportunity]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What circumstances led to the creation of Grupo SIM in 2004?<br></h4><p>I started out very young as an entrepreneur. I began developing service companies from scratch, taking advantage of market conditions. Mexico was meant to be a supplier for different countries, and many big transnational companies were looking to come into the Mexican market and establish operations. I found that it wasn't necessary to risk a lot of money to start a general services company, which would be of interest to all those big companies coming into Mexico. We're going strong, and in 2010 we sold services worth $100 million.</p><h4>How do you assess the services sector in Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico is a service-based economy, and I have been focusing on services since the beginning, which is where I feel comfortable. Mexico has now developed successful financial and IT services, as well as a host of other services. We have 130 people on our corporate staff, and a total of 20,000 employees.</p><h4>How is your client portfolio evolving?</h4><p>We have many large firms on our books, and we have also begun to get contracts from the government. When the government needs to diagnose issues in its human resources or payroll operations, it contracts us as consultants. Large companies also contract us to provide manpower for interim positions. For example, we are developing a product for retail companies around which they will be able to base their growth. We provide people for interim jobs over a few months, and once their training is complete and the company is sure they have the right person for the job, they can be hired permanently. We also help big companies execute payroll operations; they simply send us the information and we do the rest. I think the strength of Grupo SIM is that we have a deep service vocation. We are really proud to be at the service of our clients, and we are concerned about their wellbeing and growth. Another important factor is that we have no direct competition; no one else does what we do. We have people that perform human resources management functions, including accountants. We also have companies that manage funds that provide loans to SMEs. We have different competition in different areas of our business, but there is no one company that provides the same comprehensive list of services we do.</p><h4>In your view, how is Grupo SIM contributing to the development of human capital and to Mexico's economy?</h4><p>Developing human capital is the main philosophy of the company. Everyone on the board of directors, including myself, feels indebted to this country. We have had so many opportunities. I've heard it said many times that the US is the land of opportunity, but I couldn't disagree more. I think Mexico is the land of opportunity. While people can eventually be replaced, we need long-term procedures to ensure the best human resources. We believe that a happy employee is a productive employee.</p><h4>How does Grupo SIM work with universities to source human capital?</h4><p>We work closely with young people who are still studying at a wide variety of universities in a diverse range of fields. We bring them on board with part-time contracts, introduce them to different areas of the company, try to understand where their abilities lie, and try to improve their strengths in those areas.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Grupo SIM over the next five years?</h4><p>First of all, our main target is to see the companies that are already our clients grow 40% a year. They are small companies with small volumes now, so 40% growth is an achievable goal. This is my main desire.</p><h4>How many clients do you have currently?</h4><p>We have more than 200. I would like to see this number grow by 40% a year. We are also running a program to convince young entrepreneurs in Spain to establish businesses in Mexico. We already have five Spanish partners here in Mexico we have invested with, and we assist them with their business and run their back office and financing operations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has ICA evolved since it was established in 1947?</h4><p>ICA is a public company originally founded by my grandfather, and there has always been a family influence. There is a strong tradition in our family of promoting infrastructure projects, which my grandfather was very skilled at. He was the first Mexican civil engineer that was able to build and create a team large enough to take on huge infrastructure projects for the country. Before his time, foreign companies tended to lead these projects. With a team of young engineers, he was able to build a group based on partnerships. Many of the engineers would become partners and hold stock in the company. That was a way to ensure that their incentives were aligned with the prosperity of the company. Our company has never been a one-man show; in order to build these huge projects, we have needed many engineers. My grandfather was able to establish and lead this group, making it the most important infrastructure company in the country. Since its inception, ICA has been a very important tool for the government to develop and promote the infrastructure Mexico has needed.</p><p>Part of our curriculum is the construction of most of the subway system in Mexico City. For 20 years, there had been no investments in the subway. In this new era, my generation is taking on renovation projects. For example, we were in charge of building the drainage system in the 1970s in Mexico City, and now we are extending the system to double its capacity. We have been able to maintain this reputation and image of a capable engineering firm by delivering complex projects that Mexico has benefitted from.</p><p>However, there have been some changes. At the beginning of ICA's activities, these projects were carried out through a government “pay-as-you-go" plan. Now, ICA is truly an integrator of projects; we build, but we also structure financing and innovate new ways of contracting, to put less stress on government resources. A company like ours is not only a builder, but is also a large sponsor. There has been huge progress in this sense, and much of the infrastructure is now private. For example, we own and operate 13 airports, a number of road concessions, and many water projects over the long term. We built these projects, but we also committed to operating the infrastructure, for periods of 20, 25, or 50 years, in the case of airports. Very recently, a law covering public-private partnerships (PPPs) was approved. This law is working toward forming better partnerships between the private sector and the government. For a private player like ICA, the law means having a more transparent view of the long term and partnerships with the government, as well as incentives to bring together funds and invest our capital in long-term infrastructure projects.</p><h4>Are there any particular areas that ICA would like to expand into?</h4><p>This company is 65 years old, and we have worked in almost every sector, building roads, airports, tunnels, bridges, and even gas pipelines and oil platforms. We have an almost 18-year-old partnership with Fluor Corporation of the US, which helps us target projects from PEMEX, such as oil refineries, platforms, and combined-cycle power plants. This work is not simple civil construction, but engineering procurement and construction (EPC) work. We would like to expand through that into EPC work, for example, in the mining sector. We have just begun work with mining companies, and we expect future growth in that business. In addition, PEMEX has always been a large client, and is undergoing a transformation process. Even though the company is not fully open, which would make us more competitive as a country, it is changing. There are more gas pipeline concessions now, and we have the chance to evaluate how to get more involved in the business. We see a variety of work from PEMEX on the horizon, with more upstream projects such as on- and offshore oil pipeline work.</p><h4>What projects do you think have had the most significant impact in Mexico?</h4><p>La Yesca Dam is definitely one of the most important renewable energy projects. Another is the construction of one of the longest water tunnels, which will be part of the drainage system in Mexico City and stretches 60 kilometers across the region. We still face the challenge of floods, and the capacity of the drainage system we built in the city in the 1970s was appropriate for a population of 7 million or 8 million. With the population more than tripling since then, we realized the need for expansion.</p><p>To carry out the construction, we have acquired six tunnel-boring machines, which are approximately 100 meters long and 12 meters wide. This equipment is mainly used for drilling. The project will continue for six years, and we are two years into it already. We will probably finish the first 10 kilometers in 2012. Although it won't be totally finished, we can expect to put a number of completed sections into use in late 2012.</p><p>At the end of the 60-kilometer tunnel, we are building the largest water treatment plant in Latin America—and one of the largest in the world—which is a long-term concession that will be able to treat all the water at the end of the tunnel, which is fairly emblematic. The project is being carried out in partnership with Impulsora del Desarrollo y el Empleo en America Latina (IDEAL), an investment agency focused on the development of the region and employment of Latin Americans.</p><h4>Which countries is ICA considering for international expansion and why?</h4><p>We are looking at Panama, Peru, and Costa Rica. These countries are all becoming more stable, with investment-grade companies, good economies, and no deficits, like Mexico seven or eight years ago. These countries are beginning to demand the kind of projects we have carried out in Mexico, such as hydropower dams, roads, water tunnels, and subway systems. We believe that we can bring experience to these countries that are drafting their infrastructure plans. These areas are a good place to find work, and we have developed a solid reputation in some of these countries, such as Panama, where we have built major roads. We are receiving new road projects in Panama, and mining projects in Peru. We also foresee the expansion of many ports, and we are involved in the expansion of the Panama Canal. As the canal receives larger boats, the widening of the canal has sparked the rebuilding of ports. In fact, much of our recent investments have been directed toward ports, both in Mexico and in Panama.</p><h4>To what extent does ICA cooperate with the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT)?</h4><p>We collaborate heavily on our airport projects, and the master plan for the airport business has to be approved by the SCT. Moreover, how much we can charge the airlines is regulated, and it depends on our investment plans. We also cooperate in terms of roads. ICA is building many roads that will become concessions, and our cooperation with the SCT does not end when the project is finished; we work together for the life of the concession. We do most of our work with the SCT solely due to the sheer size of the projects. Through our airport group, we own commercial spaces in Terminal 2 at Mexico City International Airport. There is an NH Hotel, which we are responsible for. The airport business is two fold; one is the regulating business, which is charged to the airlines, and the other is commercial, such as the way the airport interior is utilized.</p><h4>What are Mexico's infrastructure needs?</h4><p>There has been very heavy investment in roads, but there remains room for growth. Very little has been done in terms of port connectivity. PEMEX has a long way to go. ICA is currently engineering a seventh refinery in Mexico, as well as expanding the existing six facilities. We are involved in the building of the new refinery, but we believe that PEMEX must go deeper in terms of offshore drilling. There has been increased activity, and we expect to see even more investments in the oil industry in the coming years. Renewable energy is another sector that needs diversification. We do have hydropower projects, but there are many opportunities in wind power. There are more renewable energy projects on the horizon. Mexico's demographics are driving the country to increase development: more cities, airports, roads, and housing. We are awaiting new infrastructure plans from the government, which may choose to invest around $45 billion per year in infrastructure. This figure could increase to $60 billion or $70 billion as water drainage projects take priority throughout the country.</p><h4>How was ICA's financial performance in 2011 compared to the previous year?</h4><p>We grew more than 15% in sales, and around 40% in earnings before depreciation and amortization (EBDA). ICA has a huge pipeline of projects in its backlog—the year 2011 was excellent for the company. We have been growing, and with our international expansion and the government's infrastructure plans, we are anticipating very interesting years to come.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of ICA?</h4><p>The ICA of the future will boast even better engineering in its projects. We hope to be leaner in assets and quicker on returns. The company will be younger and even more dynamic, with very motivated engineers and top project managers. Through the ICA Foundation, we will encourage more students to study engineering. Without a doubt, our international presence will increase.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Tradeco developed since its establishment in 1992?<br></h4><p>Since 1995, we have been working all over the Americas, including Colombia and the US. The 1995 crisis pushed us to branch out outside of Mexico, and we took advantage of that. After President Zedillo's administration, the new government invested a lot of money in infrastructure, but had many troubles. During President Fox's administration, our economy began to grow in 2003, and we have been very active over the last decade. Our company's story is 20 years old in February 2012. We can thank our country's government for improving the economy in the early 2000s, and our business is doing much better.</p><h4>The Baluarte Bridge is the world's highest cable-stayed bridge. What are the main challenges you faced in this project?</h4><p>The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation hired us to build a bridge starting from nothing. When we arrived, we had to build 25 kilometers of access roads to get to the site. We had to build a small city there to house the more than 2,500 workers and engineers for the project and supply sleeping facilities. After the roads and the city, the bridge itself was still the toughest challenge. Construction started in May 2007, and the bridge was finished in February 2012.</p><h4>What did President Calderón mean when he described the bridge as symbol of prosperity?</h4><p>In politics in Mexico and worldwide, a huge challenge is metaphorically building bridges between parties. He took this metaphor of building a bridge to indicate that we should begin to build bridges between the parties here in Mexico. This bridge won the Guinness World Record, but he is using the bridge as a symbol beyond its technical greatness; he's not talking about the concrete or the steel.</p><h4>How will the construction of the superhighway attract investment to the area?</h4><p>I believe that there will be a lot of investment in Durango, a state that had been isolated from the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico and is now well connected both ways. There will be a lot of investments in dry customs, where logistics companies will build huge hubs ready to store dry goods and redistribute them to the north, to places such as Texas and Arizona. There will also be a lot of investments in Mazatlán, which needs a larger seaport. The government should invest around $10 billion in the harbor. We need to build new facilities that can handle imports from Asia.</p><h4>What are some of your other projects?</h4><p>Tradeco is building a large gasoline and jet fuel storage facility in Veracruz, and building tanks for PEMEX to guarantee the storage of fuel for the Mexico City region. Our group is also building a large crude oil splitting facility for PEMEX in Cárdenas, Tabasco, in order to separate crude oil from salt and water that we can then export and sell. We are also building the largest jail in Mexico, with the capacity to hold 2,700 inmates to be completed in Veracruz in March 2012. Tradeco is also involved in a private-public venture to operate a jail with the capacity to hold 500 women in Coahuila, which will be open in March 2013.</p><h4>How do you assess the infrastructure needs of Mexico?</h4><p>We need to build 10 times more in the next 20 years than we built in the last 30. Our economic growth and the government's new public policies will allow for the investment of more that 5% of GDP in infrastructure. If you do the math, we will have enough money. There also needs to be a method to combine retirement funds with private investments. The biggest challenge will be to continue pushing the government to make investments.</p><h4>What trends do you identify in the construction sector in Mexico?</h4><p>With 25 years of constant investment infrastructure, you can have a company making revenues of between ‚¬6 billion and ‚¬20 billion as they do in Spain. In Mexico, the top two companies combined are not that large. I firmly believe that we will develop strong construction companies in Mexico that can reach those kinds of figures in the next 20 years. We are going to have a lot of good opportunities, and can start with Mexico as a platform and move to other countries as our construction company grows.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[deal-maker]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main services offered by your firm to investors and foreign companies?<br></h4><p>We are a leading team of legal experts with a wide variety of areas of expertise, including the fields of general corporate practice, domestic and cross-border M&amp;A, private equity, banking, securities, insurance, finance, real estate, hospitality, litigation, tax, project finance, antitrust, energy, sports and entertainment, intellectual property, environmental and gaming, and are recognized both domestically and internationally as a top-notch firm in Mexico.<br></p><h4>What should foreign companies be aware of before engaging in their start-up phase?</h4><p>Foreign companies should understand that Mexico is a mature and sophisticated market, more open than most in the world and relatively well regulated in most sectors—although improvements are always attainable. Mexico is no longer a “wild west"-type of place, an “unexplored territory", as many would have considered it—with reason—in the 1970s and 1980s, and changes have been dramatic; mostly for the best. Back then lawyers played a significant role as consiglieri, and despite the fact that we sometimes continue to act in that capacity for some clients, today's legal advice is more technical, more business oriented, and less political and dependent on government contacts. Given the country's history, a foreigner should know that the Mexican psyche does not welcome a “conquistador" approach from a buyer or potential business partner. And although there is no magic trick to doing business in Mexico, it pays to follow some common sense strategies that could generally be applied elsewhere: (a) choose your partners carefully, not quickly; I know of some sad stories; (b) do not stampede into a definitive agreement thinking it will save you time and money; most times it is best to execute a reasonably detailed letter of intent or memorandum of understanding, even if non-binding, that sets forth the agreed upon deal terms; try to have the tough discussions upfront; it could save you a lot of troubles and disillusionment down the road; (c) if entering into a regulated activity, be sure you are well aware of the approval process your investment will involve; (d) no matter what you are told, there is no such thing as a perfectly well kept, riskless company; if you are buying or joint venturing with a family-owned company, multiply the foregoing statement by at least 10; and (e) hire a good lawyer and involve him  early on.</p><h4>What regulatory changes are we likely to see over the medium term?</h4><p>Although during the last few years investments by foreigners have been constantly stimulated by Mexican macroeconomic strength and a promising regulatory environment in Mexico, changes in laws, regulations, public policies, and government programs are likely to continue happening in the medium and long term to keep promoting Mexico as a healthy and secure investment destination. Pending legal changes that will need to be made to ensure greater growth include a revamped Federal Labor Law, a drastic change and openness in the oil and gas and energy sectors generally, and changes to a number of tax laws, including levying value-added taxes on food and medicines, an unpopular but clearly necessary measure. These changes are all politically charged, but it would appear that a majority of political figures recognize the need for regulatory change in this regard.</p><h4>What is your outlook for M&amp;A activity in Mexico in 2012?</h4><p>Generally positive, although clearly not as strong as it was prior to 2009, when the US crisis actually hit Mexico. The economic and political situation in Mexico are, to varying degrees, affected by economic and market conditions in other emerging market countries and in the US. Although economic and political conditions in other emerging market countries and in the US may differ significantly from economic conditions in Mexico, investors' reactions to developments in any of these other countries may have a positive effect on the M&amp;A sector. I even dare sat that, speaking from experience, the real security problems that we face in Mexico have not, even remotely, brought M&amp;A activity to a halt.</p><h4>How would you describe Mexico's private equity landscape and its legal environment?</h4><p>In recent years, Mexico has made great strides in the development of a compre­hensive body of corporate governance laws. The revamped Securities Market Law (LMV) that came into effect in 2006 made huge improvements to corporate governance standards for publicly traded companies, and it created Investment Promotion Companies (SAPIs), that have set forth the basis for much more flexible investment structures in non-public companies. Indeed, most private equity investors in Mexico are using SAPIs as the investment vehicle of choice to ensure a higher level of corporate governance standards as well as to allow the parties to agree on a distinct number of covenants involving shareholders' undertakings, veto rights, distribution arrangements, directors' liability, and exit alternatives, among others, which were not previously available for traditional Sociedades Anónimas (SAs) under the Commercial Companies General Law. All of this has a much larger degree of legal certainty as to its enforceability.  I do believe the flexibility afforded by the SAPIs is almost limitless, and it will become a tremendous tool for creative lawyering in years to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do CEOs feel about the global economy's landscape?<br></h4><p>Uncertainty dampens the outlook for 2012, but confidence in company revenue growth remains ahead of 2009. Nearly half (48%) of the CEOs polled worldwide believe that the global economy will decline even further in the next 12 months. However, 40% of CEOs said they are “very confident" about revenue growth for their companies in the next 12 months.</p><h4>What actions are CEOs taking regarding the work force?</h4><p>More than half of CEOs worldwide expect to increase headcount in the next 12 months, although the picture changes from sector to sector with hiring much more likely in the entertainment and media segments.</p><h4>How do CEOs perceive the eurozone crisis?</h4><p>Unsurprisingly, the largest decline in confidence was found in Western Europe. Just a quarter of European CEOs said they were very confident of revenue growth, down sharply from nearly 40% last year. While 56% of CEOs said their company had been financially affected by the sovereign debt crisis, 45% said they had taken steps to respond.</p><h4>What are the main concerns for global CEOs?</h4><p>Looking at what is worrying CEOs, 80% had some concerns about uncertain economic growth, 64% about instability in capital markets, 66% about government responses to fiscal deficits and debt burden, 58% about exchange rate volatility, and 56% about over regulation.</p><h4>Where do CEOs foresee the main growth opportunities?</h4><p>According to the CEOs we surveyed, the best strategic growth opportunities in the next 12 months will come from increasing their share in existing markets and from developing new products and services, both cited by nearly one-third of respondents. Top growth targets were the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), joined by the US and Germany.</p><h4>How do CEOs feel about finding the right talent?</h4><p>Finding and keeping the right talent remains a top concern for CEOs. Only 30% said they are “very confident" they will have access to the talent needed to execute their company's strategy, and 43% believe that it has become more difficult to hire workers in their industry. Recruiting and retaining high potential middle managers is the largest talent challenge, CEOs said, followed by hiring skilled production employees and younger workers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the American€Colombian commercial relationship?</h4><p>The US-Colombia commercial relationship is very promising as a result of the entry into force of our free trade agreement (FTA) on May 15, 2012. This marks the beginning of a new chapter for both countries in terms of trade and investment. Both of our economies gain from trade. For example, Colombia is a large importer of grains from the US, while it exports a number of tropical fruits to our country. Also, US cotton, yarn, and fabric exports to Colombia are used in many items that Colombia exports to the US. Now that our trade agreement has entered into force, key US exports receive duty-free access to Colombia, including most products in agriculture and construction equipment, aircraft and parts, auto parts, fertilizers and agro-chemicals, information technology equipment, medical and scientific equipment, and wood.</p><p>With more than 46 million consumers, Colombia is a fast-growing market for US businesses. Even before May 15, Colombia was the third largest market for US exports in South and Central America, with over $14 billion in exports last year.</p><div class="quote">“The political stability, growing middle class, and improved security have created an economic boom in Colombia."</div><h4>The World Bank's 2011 Doing Business report classifies Colombia as the fifth country in the world and first in Latin America that best protects foreign investors. What other advantages does Colombia offer US investors?</h4><p>Colombia offers a level playing field for US investors. Our trade agreement provides guarantees that US companies in Colombia are protected against discriminatory or unlawful treatment, and it grants them recourse to a neutral and transparent mechanism for settlement of investment disputes. Colombia also offers US investors a prime location for international trade. Colombia is the only country in South America that has coasts on both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, which give it a shipping advantage in today's global market. Aided by major security improvements, steady economic growth, and moderate inflation, Colombia has become a free market economy with major commercial and investment ties to the US, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Plus, the past ten years have brought extraordinary change to the country in terms of economic development and improvements in national safety and security. The political stability, growing middle class, and improved security have created an economic boom in Colombia that has lessened the impact of the global economic crisis.</p><h4>What will be the medium term impact of the recently ratified FTA between Colombia and the US, and what main challenges does it face?</h4><p>In the medium term, this comprehensive trade agreement will eliminate all tariffs on US exports to Colombia, which will promote further economic growth and continue the expansion of trade between our two countries. A US International Trade Commission study estimates that US exports to Colombia will be $1.1 billion higher once the trade agreement is fully implemented, supporting thousands of additional US jobs. The US Department of Agriculture has projected that US farmers and ranchers can expect to see their exports grow by more than $370 million, or more than one-third of the current total. One challenge lies in the area of Colombian infrastructure, which President Santos has committed to addressing through an investment and infrastructure plan. However, this also presents an exciting opportunity for US infrastructure-related exporters as well as construction and engineering companies seeking to expand their businesses.</p><h4>The US is Colombia's largest trading partner, representing about 42% of Colombia's exports and 26% of its imports as of November 2011. What is your outlook for US€Colombian trade levels in the medium term?</h4><p>We expect a substantial increase in US exports to Colombia across many sectors. While the US-Colombia Agreement only went into effect in the middle of May, our trade data already shows that US goods exports are up 28% compared to those of May of 2011. In addition, the open-skies aviation agreement will be fully in place in January 2013. This will give US and Colombian airlines further flexibility to transport additional goods and passengers between the two countries.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With an investment near $4 billion, the Pueblo Viejo mine will allow the Dominican Republic to participate in today's global gold market. How much has Barrick Gold invested so far and in which areas?</h4><p>At the end of 2011, we had invested over $3.2 billion, and we're moving closer to the inauguration date, which is slated for September 2012. The exact number will be determined by an external auditor: SGS/FGS. This is a very large and complex mine, especially from the point of view of production capacity and physical size; it will be mining gold, silver, and copper while displaying a showcase of best practices in the industry. The other issue that makes the mine special and complex is that the original tender posted by the government for this project started out as a remediation of the area of Pueblo Viejo. The mine was closed for 14 years, and during that time, acid rock drainage from the site was very significant and contamination from metals and other chemicals was present. In 2006, Barrick Gold took on the project, which was only on paper, and redefined the project using new technology. Under that redefinition and renegotiation of the contract, investment was increased significantly, but the reserves were doubled. Total reserves and forecasted revenues from the mine grew by almost 100%.</p><h4>What state-of-the-art technology will Barrick Gold introduce to Pueblo Viejo?</h4><p>The technology was selected considering environmental impact. We selected a technology that, for mining our specific types of ores, has the least potential impact on the environment—autoclave technology. This is the fifth mine in the world that uses autoclave technology, and here we have the biggest autoclaves in the world. This marks a very interesting step forward for Barrick Gold. Since this plant is so new and complex we have brought a significant number of expatriates here for the start of operations and to train local employees that are now learning about autoclave technology. At the scale we are operating it, it is something totally new. The land on which the plant is now located was heavily contaminated and has been cleaned up. About 115,000 cubic meters of contaminated soil was collected and removed, most of which was treated locally, and the rest was packaged to be shipped and treated at international facilities. We have already improved the water quality in the area by removing those contaminants. Our plant is a very large operational, as it uses state-of-the-art equipment and will become Barrick Gold's global flagship mine, with the latest technology in terms of environmental protection and extraction methods, as well as its relevance for the company.</p><div class="quote">“Within the next five to ten years, we will see improvements in the quality of life in the area surrounding the mine."</div><h4>Barrick Gold's social investments will help local farmers by improving health, nutrition, and education. How much has the company invested in social responsibility initiatives to date?</h4><p>Within the next five to ten years, we will see improvements in the quality of life in the area surrounding the mine, which is a very deprived area. The levels of education and income in the area are below the national average. One of the things we've been doing, as part of our focus on sustainability, is linking all projects to local branches of government and agencies to build the local capacity to generate development with both company and government funds. In addition, we're investing in a number of small projects around the mine related to environmental care, management, and education. That's because environmental remediation was our main priority when taking on the mine. In everything we do, we remember that environmental remediation and stewardship are our guidelines. To develop an area, you need education. Development without education simply will not work. These are the points that we support on every project that we undertake, in addition to the funds we offer to municipalities.</p><h4>What are the most innovative aspects and long-term benefits for the community of Pueblo?</h4><p>We are working with institutions in the Dominican Republic, the municipalities, and their mayors. Often there are accusations that money from these projects is misappropriated by local governments, but the real issue is that many of these mayors have never had any training on how to deal with this amount of money—they are very small towns, with limited experience managing these kinds of budgets. We've started conducting workshops with people and authorities to discuss the types of projects that could be launched with these funds—their impacts and potential costs—and worked with them to implement abandoned legislation: laws 170 and 176 from 2007, and law 340 from the year 2000. However, we're not just doing CSR, and instead of offering this money without guidance we're expecting that our contribution will improve the institutionalization of the regional governments.</p><h4>What infrastructure projects have you invested in?</h4><p>For a mining project you need a series of basic elements, the first being access. In this case, access existed, but the roads needed to be improved. Simply transporting the equipment to the site was an engineering feat. Conditions of the road, bridges, electric wiring, and commercial signage needed upgrades to able to get the extra large and heavy equipment through. A ship had to be specially designed just to bring the autoclaves to the site because there wasn't a ship in the world that could handle them. Now, these upgrades are permanent parts of the infrastructure of the country, and a few other companies, such as power companies, have passed equipment along these roads that previously would not have accommodated their needs. That investment was made entirely by Barrick Pueblo Viejo, because it was originally for our purposes. We also invested in upgrading power capacity. We are building a 430-MW plant divided in two groups—two 215-MW plants side by side as a long-term energy solution for Pueblo Viejo.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the quality and eagerness of the Dominican labor force, and has it been challenging to find well-trained people in the country?</h4><p>We've had mixed results. Because mining is not a traditional activity in the country, there is a lack of mining experts. However, we have found many employees of different levels, from professionals such as engineers and geologists, down to technicians who had no prior experience but are being trained. Probably within two or three years we will begin exporting staff to mines across the world. We understand that we need people with the right attitude and basic education who are ready to do further training. Our workforce will become around 1,200 people on a permanent basis. We have around 1,650 today, with 450 in training. Over the next 15 years, we will reduce our expatriate force to about 10% of its current size.</p><h4>What is your expected production in gold by the end of 2012?</h4><p>Our target for 2012 is around 200,000 ounces. We know that in the first year we may reach 25% above or below that target because there are so many variables. We're talking about four months worth of production in 2012, from September to December. That's our target, and it may be subject to variations. We will go into production with maybe two autoclaves, but there are two more that are not yet operational. Once we go into production from 2013 onward, we will be able to very accurately forecast our results. We will also be doing a full exploration of the area to determine our exact reserves. We have the potential to extend production. We may be able to extend from 25 years of production to maybe 40 years, depending on additional reserves. However, extending the length of the project is something we probably won't consider for at least three or four years, until we've fully started production and have resources dedicated to further exploration. Right now, we have confirmed the presence of 23.7 million ounces of gold.</p><h4>How do you see the development of the mining industry in the country in the future?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic certainly has potential to be a mining country. I believe that there will be further significant mines in the country, but they will come over time. Significant exploration started a few years ago and it will take a long time to develop that. If these mines are operated with the view of making stewardship of the environment the prime focus, then they can operate in the country along with agriculture and tourism, which are our main industries. In this regard, mining could support the development of these other industries in a positive way.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mexico is going through a complex time in terms of security. What is the Mexican government doing to guarantee public security?</h4><p>Security is, indeed, the main challenge we are facing, which is why instead of ignoring it, we have decided to tackle it head on. To do so, we have a comprehensive security policy that includes three basic components: first, to fight and subdue criminals, for which our soldiers, marines, and police officers have come to the aid of the population in those areas where criminals do most harm to society. Our determination has already yielded positive results, such as important arrests and unprecedented seizures of weapons, illicit money, and drugs. Second, we have begun important reforms to purge and strengthen the institutions responsible for security, justice enforcement, and administration. We now have professional police officers and judges who are truly at the service of the public. And third, we are rebuilding the social fabric to offer more scholarships and open more schools for our students, bringing public services to communities that were previously excluded, opening recreational spaces where coexistence will bring society together, and implementing other actions aimed at improving the quality of life of the Mexican people. To summarize, we are tackling this issue from every perspective to build a real rule of law that gives families security and investors legal certainty.</p><h4>What is the economic outlook in Mexico?</h4><p>Since the beginning of my administration at the end of 2006 we began to transform our economy to accelerate growth and increase competitiveness. Thanks to these efforts, Mexico currently has a solid and stable economy, despite the difficult global situation. To give you three important facts: average inflation in the last five years has been less than 5%, which has been the lowest in over four decades. Public debt is approximately 32% of GDP, half the average of Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. And international reserves are $152 billion, enough to cover the federal government's foreign debt 2.5 times over. Mexico is currently in a position to grow and face any possible global financial turbulence.</p><h4>As you mention, competitiveness is a key element to being successful in the global economy. What strategy has Mexico followed to increase the competitiveness of its economy?</h4><p>We have a very clear strategy for increasing our competitiveness and being successful in the global economy. An essential part of achieving this goal has been to invest in one of our main assets: our human capital or, as I like to call it, human value. In recent years, we have improved the coverage and quality of education at every level. We have reached universal coverage in elementary education. In addition, in the last five years we have created close to 1,000 high schools and 105 higher education institutions, 90% of which are oriented to training engineers and technicians. Thanks to this, every year close to 122,000 engineers graduate in Mexico, more than in countries such as Germany, Canada, or Brazil. This results in a young, talented, and highly skilled workforce for anyone who wants to open a business in Mexico. Another area in which we have worked hard is health. We are one step away from reaching universal health coverage: to date, 107 million Mexicans have medical insurance. And to cater to this growing demand for health services, since 2007 we have built 1,100 hospitals and refurbished 2,200 more.</p><p>In addition, to increase the competitiveness of our economy, over the last five years we have allocated unprecedented resources to the construction of infrastructure. In 2000, average annual investment was approximately 3% of GDP, the same as the OECD average. Currently, it has reached historical levels of 4.4% of GDP. And recently a new Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Law was approved that opens up great business opportunities for businesses that build infrastructure. As a result of this boost to the sector, many international companies are setting up shop in our country because they know that producing in Mexico to export to the US and Europe is now much more profitable and efficient than doing so, for example, in China or Brazil. Another example of actions to raise competitiveness is the elimination of procedures. Never before has there been such a profound effort to eliminate the bureaucratic red tape that was such an obstacle to doing business. This has meant that now entrepreneurs can open a company in less than 10 days, and not 60 as before.</p><h4>In your opinion, what has been the most important change in Mexican society in recent years?</h4><p>Without a doubt, the first is that we have increased the quality of life of the Mexican people. Programs aimed at increasing the income of the country's poorest families have been crucial. Another important transformation is that thanks to the economic stability of recent years, for the first time in several decades we have strengthened the purchasing power of the minimum wage and increased the number of workers who earn higher salaries. This has resulted in a broadening of the middle class that is evident in various indicators. For example, today more families than ever are buying their own homes. In just five years we have granted 6 million credits to acquire or improve public housing. In addition, Mexican homes are acquiring more and more durable goods: most of them have a refrigerator, television, and washing machine, while almost half have a car and telephone line. In other words, Mexico is a global exporting power, but it also has a domestic market that is expanding and provides great opportunities for doing business.</p><h4>Why should investors around the world choose Mexico as a business destination?</h4><p>Mexico is opportunity. It is a country with a promising future and a modern and competitive economy thanks to the talent and preparation of the Mexican people. I am convinced that this is the best time to invest here because of the great advantages for doing business offered by Mexico. An example is the stability of our economy, which protects us against complex global financial scenarios and, therefore, offers companies an environment of certainty in which to flourish. In addition, we are a real world-class exporting power: in 2011, our exports reached $377 billion, while our share in US imports went from 10.5% in 2005 to approximately 13% in 2011. We are a country that believes in free trade; we have signed free trade agreements with more than 40 countries, gaining preferential access to a potential market of more than 1 billion consumers around the world. Currently, the Mexican government has become an ally for entrepreneurs. Like many other emerging economies that suffer the consequences of insecurity, Mexico has decided to face this challenge and establish lasting solutions. Because of that, what today might be considered an issue for Mexico will be one of its great strengths in the future: a solid rule of law. Furthermore, we go to great lengths to improve the quality of life of all Mexicans, and that means investing in our human capital. Because of all this, Mexico is an opportunity for global companies seeking attractive and profitable investment destinations. It is an opportunity for entrepreneurs who want to expand their businesses. And it is an opportunity to develop businesses that will be successful competitors in the global markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Spain is the leading European investor in Mexico, while Mexico is the fourth most important destination for Spanish investment. How does the new Spanish government assess economic relations between the two countries?</h4><p>Mexico is certainly a strategic economic partner for Spain. On a commercial level, today it is our first export market in Latin America and fifth worldwide, if we exclude Europe. In 2011 about 10,000 Spanish companies exported to Mexico. In terms of investment, Spain has long been established as the second largest investor in Mexico after the US, with investments of more than $40 billion made over the last decade. This investment is also very diversified; it has been distributed in virtually all industries and services across all the states of Mexico. In fact, Mexico is our third most important destination outside the EU, just behind the US and Brazil. This kind of investment creates competition, facilitates technology transfer, and creates jobs across the country. In fact, Spanish companies are perfectly integrated into the economic and trading structure in Mexico, a country that is also a major investor in Spain. Large Mexican companies have invested over ‚¬4 billion in our country over the last decade. Our aim is to further strengthen our economic ties and boost investment from Mexican companies; we are an ideal platform for them to enter the European market.</p><h4>Why is Mexico such an attractive destination for Spanish investment?</h4><p>Mexico is the 14th largest economy in the world and the second largest in Latin America, and it is very attractive for foreign investment, according to the latest UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) figures, which position Mexico as the second best destination for FDI in Latin America, just behind Brazil. The size of the Mexican economy, its population of over 112 million inhabitants, its income per capita, economic stability, and economic openness established through an extensive network of free trade treaties are just some of the factors that explain the extraordinary attractiveness of the country. Along with all these elements, I would like to emphasize that in our particular case, there is a long and extraordinary relationship that unites both countries. Spanish companies see Mexico as a natural commercial destination, where the brand Spain is highly recognized and welcomed. All these factors have encouraged a strong presence of large Spanish companies in Mexico, and are also attracting many SMEs.</p><h4>How has the free trade agreement between the EU and Mexico stimulated relations between Mexico and Spain over the last decade? What impact will the Joint Executive Plan of the Mexico-EU Strategic Partnership have?</h4><p>The entry into force of the agreement between the EU and Mexico opened, without a shadow of a doubt, new perspectives in our bilateral relationship. From an economic and trade point of view, the EU-Mexico free trade treaty has significantly improved the access of goods and services to both markets, considerably increasing trade figures in recent years. For example, at the end of 2011 the EU exported $37.5 billion to Mexico, which represented an increase of up to 45% since 2005, whereas Mexican exports to the EU in the same period grew by 108%. Within the EU, Spain is Mexico's first customer, and in 2011 Mexico purchased goods and services worth $4.9 billion: a figure only behind the US, Canada, and China. We are also the third biggest European provider for Mexico with sales of $3.85 billion in 2011, just behind Germany and Italy. The Joint Executive Plan approved in 2010 will be another step in  bilateral relations between Mexico and the EU, incorporating many priority issues on the international agenda such as climate change, human rights, and security issues.</p><h4>In your opinion, how will Mexico's presidency of the G20 this year improve its international image?</h4><p>Mexico holds all the prerequisites and conditions for its presidency of the G20 to be a complete success. Consistency of macroeconomic management and experience in crisis management provides it with extraordinary credibility. I'm sure it will demonstrate its leadership and its capacity to build a tangible and beneficial consensus to the international community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[common-roots]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Mexico is a partner nation of El Salvador and Central America. We have common roots in the Aztec earth. We share a language, ancient culture, music, beliefs, and geo-environmental characteristics that reflect a very close degree of kinship. However, this kinship has been expanding more in recent decades. Both Central America and Mexico are living with common opportunities and challenges, and from those we have seen the opportunity to establish coordinated policies to address issues such as migration, security, social welfare, cooperation, and economic and trade relations.<br></p><p>It is in this sense that the government of El Salvador's President, Mauricio Funes, and the leaders of the rest of the region are working diligently to establish partnerships that strengthen our links. The most recent result of this has been the coordination between our countries for the establishment of an agreement that, without any doubt, will bring benefits to all its parties: the signing of a single Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Mexico and the countries of Central America.</p><p>This agreement, signed in San Salvador on November 23, 2011, was the result of seven rounds of negotiations that took place for almost three years. It replaces the trade agreements that each of the Central American countries had separately with the Aztec nation. As I said at the time of signing, I'm sure that we all win with this agreement; not only are our commitments on trade renewed, but also the relations between our countries and their economic sectors are strengthened.</p><p>The approval of commercial procedures as a block will ultimately be a competitive advantage that will position us in a country that already registers nearly 113 million habitants, showing an undeniable potential for the placement of our products such as textiles, bottled drinks, fruit juice, cartons, plastics, and pharmaceuticals, among others. The FTA with Mexico is currently in the process of ratification by the various governments of the countries involved, and will inject more dynamism for trade and capital flows that converge between the newly associated countries. This will surely open the doors to promote more investment, businesses, and job creation. For reference on how the FTA will influence the trade relations between Mexico and Central America, observe the 400% growth in the trade exchange between the two territories between 1995 and 2010, from $832 million to more than $4.7 billion, which undoubtedly would have an upward projection with the agreement.</p><p>At the bilateral level, El Salvador exported $76.2 million in 2010 and $86.1 million in 2011 to Mexico, with good positioning in the Mexican market for El Salvador's textiles, which comprised 43.2% of these exports.</p><p>By participating in this commercial endeavor, the Salvadoran government shows its confidence and high willingness to do business with Mexico, a partner country with which we will continue to foster the integration of productive chains and diversification of goods, trade, and services.</p><p>One of the benefits that motivates us to walk hand-in-hand with Mexico on this pathway is the generation of new jobs and the strengthening of SMEs, which are the human bases behind the signing of the document of free association.</p><p>On the other hand, we have also been able to work on other strategies to foster economic development in the region, from spaces such as the Dialogue and Consultation Mechanism of Tuxtla, established in 1991, and the Mesoamerica Project, a high-level political space integrated by Mexico, El Salvador, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic.</p><p>From this forefront, the integrated countries are set to work on the execution of programs and projects that improve the quality of life of the habitants of Mesoamerica, such as the construction of a regional fiber-optic network of over 1,800 kilometers in length, which is slated to begin operation in late 2012. This will allow the reduction of tariffs for internet services and ICT in general.</p><p>By having this network, Mexico and Central America will ultimately be very attractive countries for establishing investment with competitive levels that are consistent with the global market.</p><p>These strong economic ties are part of a broader relationship that the government of the Salvadoran President promotes with the Aztec nation, which also includes efforts and support in areas such as security, consular protection, and humanitarian assistance to our emigrants, and many technical cooperation projects in various fields.</p><p>In analyzing these matches and alliances, we can say that Mexico is closer than ever, an appreciation beyond its geographical location. We recognize this country as a partner and a friend of El Salvador and Central America.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Mexico's experience been during the process of trade liberalization in recent years?</h4><p>Mexico is totally convinced about the benefits of free trade. Although trade liberalization had its criticisms at first, nowadays most countries agree that having an open economy is an opportunity to expand markets for their enterprises and, of course, to create better jobs for nationals. Nowadays, Mexico has 12 free trade agreements (FTAs) involving 44 countries. Such agreements have allowed Mexico not only to increase its exports to all those countries, hence creating new business opportunities for companies established in Mexico, but also to obtain quality inputs for its productive activities at much more competitive prices. Why? Because through trade openness, national economies can focus their production on those goods and services in which they have competitive advantages, so world production becomes more efficient. Since advantages go both ways, free trade is a win-win game for all. In other words, free trade is definitely one of the most effective engines to promote both efficiency and economic development.</p><h4>So, you are saying that “globalization" and open markets are in fact good for those countries committed to efficiency?</h4><p>Absolutely. The fact of the matter is that globalization has integrated societies, countries, and economies through different channels, such as trade, FDI, technology transfer, and knowledge flows, hence bringing about important benefits at a global level such as the expansion of production capacity, employment, human capital enhancement, innovation, and technology diffusion, all of which support growth in overall incomes. Now, one important result of this process of globalization is that it has increased the international fragmentation of production and the rise of trade in intermediate products. For example, in the manufacturing of an automobile, there are at least 50 different countries involved in the supply chain of the various parts, components, and services required for its production. Therefore, thanks to globalization, each day more countries have better opportunities to participate in at least one part of the global production process. But the important point is that, over the last few decades, there is evidence that countries with open markets are precisely those that have been able to focus their production efforts on those activities in which they are relatively more efficient. The reduction in transport costs and the rapid evolution of information technology have indeed made it easier to segment production across a range of countries. In that way, countries with open economies have taken advantage of their specializations in order to develop more competitive production processes, to increase productivity, and to pay better salaries, all of which strengthen their internal markets. At the same time, those countries have benefited from higher efficiency in the economies with which they trade, thereby lowering their input and production costs. We are convinced that free trade is one of the most important tools to take advantage of the globalization process. It is important to mention that the global value of foreign trade transactions made by all those countries with which we have a trade agreement represents today around three-fifths of the world's GDP. Indeed, thanks to the opening up of our economy in the mid-1980s, Mexico began to experience substantial gains in the competitiveness of its exports. Why? Because our producers began to have access to a better range of production inputs, and those were available at a significantly lower price. Our national products became more competitive and our production processes are more efficient every day. We will keep doing the task correctly to continue getting benefits for everyone. For instance, during 2011, according to the competitiveness index of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Mexico scaled up as much as eight positions, more than any other country on the continent. Moreover, according to the World Bank's Doing Business Report, the Mexican economy has consistently done better than any of the BRIC economies. Thanks to the competitive gains Mexico has made since its opening-up of trade policy, foreign trade now represents around 60% of Mexico's GDP, a huge increase from the 25% GDP share observed at the beginning of the 1990s. Also, FDI now amounts to $18.5 billion, six times more than the observed amount two decades ago. In this context, let me give you an example of how the Secretariat of Economy is working to promote efficiency and foreign investment in Mexico. One of the main roles of the Secretariat of  Economy is to ease and simplify foreign trade operations in order to increase the efficiency in the international exchange process and to promote the competitiveness of export and import companies. One important complementary tool to achieve these goals is the Manufacturing, and Export Services Industries Program (IMMEX).</p><p>Thanks to Mexico's FTAs, today nearly 6,800 enterprises are registered with IMMEX, hence creating business opportunities, increasing investment flows, and generating better-paid jobs. In a few words, with the proper tools, globalization and free trade encourage productivity, innovation, and competitiveness, thereby boosting entrepreneurship.</p><h4>So far, you have talked about many benefits for producers and entrepreneurs in Mexico, but what about Mexican workers and consumers?</h4><p>Critics of it usually counter-argue that foreign trade causes business closures and layoffs, but that is definitely not true. On the one hand, the huge increase in Mexico's foreign trade has generated more jobs and better salaries for workers. Indeed, one out of every five jobs in Mexico is provided either by exporting enterprises or by firms that receive FDI. On the other hand, Mexican residents and foreign visitors now have access to a much more extensive range of goods and services, and they can buy those goods at a much better price. And the main reason for such a result is that those goods are now produced more efficiently worldwide, so consumers have a wider choice. Mexico will keep supporting all measures that ease foreign trade and help our country and Latin America be a more competitive region. In conclusion, free trade generates winners everywhere, and it is one of the keys to promoting world economic growth and to strengthen the integration of regional markets.</p><h4>What more has Mexico to do in order to improve its trade agreements?</h4><p>Today, 93% of Mexico's total exports relate to countries part of our FTAs. These countries, however, have been signing new agreements with other countries so our preferences have eroded. In 1994, the US had two signed agreements, but now it has 14; Canada had one in 1994, and now it has 11; the EU and Japan had no FTAs at that time, now they have six and 11, respectively. In response to these challenges, the trade policy objective of this administration has been to strengthen and invigorate export platforms, with the ultimate aim of achieving a greater diversification of exports. For instance, the services trade to North America is a segment that has been scarcely used. Accordingly, Mexico must define specific actions to enhance the export of services. It is also important to mention that Mexico is working hard to be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and President Calderón's government has been very active in promoting Mexico's inclusion in this important agreement.</p><p>However, FTAs by themselves are not enough. For that reason, the administration of President Calderón has pursued Congress' approval of several structural reforms that scale up the benefits of those FTAs. So far, the federal government has already implemented a broad regulatory reform that has reduced the time and transaction costs that firms spend every day in their operations in Mexico. Thanks to that, more than 16,000 internal norms in all the federal public administration were eliminated, and so were more than 2,000 internal procedures. This simplification created a more competitive and straightforward business environment. One important outcome of these measures is the reduction of up to 65% in the administrative costs of starting a business. Another one is the reduction in the time that a business should spend in administrative procedures before starting operations, from 34 days to just a few hours. Nonetheless, we still have a long way to go in order to get the best out of our FTAs. Mexico still needs further economic reforms that enable it to obtain higher GDP growth rates than those it is achieving now.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The international crisis has turned the spotlight on emerging economies. In light of this, what advantages can Mexico offer?</h4><p>As a result of the country's commitment to economic stability and free trade, Mexico has become a strategic platform to reach key markets around the globe. Mexico offers many competitive advantages such as its macroeconomic stability, economic growth, a business-friendly environment, its strategic location, capacity for advanced manufacturing, an open economy, and the availability of skilled human capital. The country's network of trade agreements spans 44 countries, which makes us a platform that reaches far beyond North America, and gives products made in Mexico preferential access to over 1 billion consumers and two-thirds of the world's GDP. Furthermore, the commitment to free trade has made Mexican industries extremely competitive, because goods made in Mexico compete with the best available worldwide. However, market access isn't enough. In fact, according to the Inter-American Development Bank, freight cost as a percentage of exports is 3% lower in Mexico than in Asia. Secondly, Mexico is in the midst of a demographic bonus, full of young and skilled human capital. Each year, over 115,000 engineers complete their higher education at one of Mexico's 2,964 universities and technical institutions. In fact, Mexico has more engineering students than Brazil, the UK, or Germany. This human capital is a cornerstone for Mexico's future economic development. According to the Atlas of Economic Complexity, recently published by Harvard and MIT, Mexico ranks 20th worldwide, well above all of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries. The study shows Mexico's capacity to produce and export numerous sophisticated goods to multiple countries. It further indicates that Mexico is able to harness and transfer a vast amount of productive knowledge, which is a strong indicator of future economic development. This fact is reinforced by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD's) Index of Technological Sophistication, in which Mexican goods rank higher than those produced in India or Brazil. Therefore, we can state that Mexico offers fertile business opportunities based on innovation and R&amp;D. For these and many other reasons, it is not surprising that analysts predict that Mexico will rank between the fifth and eighth largest economy in the world by 2050.</p><h4>How does ProMéxico contribute to the country's success in trade and attracting foreign direct investment?</h4><p>The flow of FDI and international trade are key components of Mexico's economy. To this end, ProMéxico promotes the exports of companies established in Mexico, coordinates actions to attract FDI, and assists Mexican companies to become international firms. ProMéxico has 33 offices in 22 countries, which allows it to reach more than 70% of the world's GDP, in addition to 29 offices in 26 states, and its headquarters in Mexico City. Through our offices, we promote the country and its companies around the globe, advise companies throughout their export or investment process, facilitate doing business either as a foreigner in Mexico or a Mexican abroad, and connect companies as well as private and public institutions to create value-added networks. ProMéxico combines its services into several usage models to be more efficient. Three examples are the Demand Generation, Aftercare, and Alliance with Multinational Companies programs. Our Demand Generation Program connects Mexican suppliers with potential buyers abroad. To do so, our offices detect and contact large potential customers, and evaluate their needs. Based on this confirmed interest, ProMéxico searches for qualified suppliers, facilitates introductions, and works with the companies to help them address the needs of the foreign client. Once a foreign investor initiates operations in Mexico, the Aftercare Program provides ongoing assistance to facilitate optimal performance, thereby creating attractive conditions to re-invest and expand their operations. With the Alliance with Multinational Companies Program, we work with multinationals established in Mexico to identify supply chain needs. Then we collaborate with the company to both introduce them to domestic suppliers and work with their foreign suppliers to help locate operations to Mexico. As a result, the company reduces supply chain gaps and improves its response to market changes. Meanwhile, we increase the local content in final products, and eventually fuel more manufactured exports. In summary, ProMéxico offers both investors and exporters customized support through a wide range of solutions and services to “bring more of Mexico to the world and more of the world to Mexico."</p><h4>You mentioned Mexico's commitment to free trade. What do you see in the country's future in this respect?</h4><p>Since joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1986, Mexico has been a strong promoter of free trade. As a result, Mexico has become a global export powerhouse, renowned for high-quality products, and an important center for advanced manufacturing. Not only have Mexican exports grown by more than 16 times since 1985, but they have increased in sophistication. Today, Mexico is a leading manufacturing exporter with close to 80% of our exports being manufactured goods, compared to only 23% in 1985. In 2011, Mexican exports reached a record high of nearly $350 billion, which is 17% more than in 2010 and 110% when compared to 2000. It is also worth noting that Mexico is the largest exporter in Latin America. In fact, last year we exported the equivalent of Brazil and Argentina combined. Notwithstanding its important network of free trade agreements, Mexico continues to diversify its export markets. We are looking toward Latin America, Africa, Asia, and some European countries. For example, Mexico is promoting joint actions to create synergies in commercial and economic matters within the framework of the Trans-Pacific Alliance as a means to strengthen relations with Asian economies. Closer to home, Mexico promotes further integration with Peru, Chile, and Colombia in order to fortify this region's competitiveness. An alliance between the four countries represents an important opportunity. To give you an idea, these four economies will trade $443 billion, which is more than 1.5 times the size of the Common Southern Market (MERCOSUR), currently at $281 billion. Nonetheless, the future isn't limited to exports. Mexico's domestic industry offers great potential, and internationalization is a natural step after exporting. For this reason, ProMéxico is implementing an aggressive strategy to facilitate this process. In addition to working with the large Mexican conglomerates to further expand their global presence, ProMéxico is increasingly assisting innovative SMEs to venture abroad.</p><h4>What type of FDI is Mexico attracting and how does this contribute to the country's growth?</h4><p>The Atlas of Economic Complexity discusses how a country's ability to amass and transfer know-how allows a society to recombine it in order to create a larger variety of smarter and better products. The evolution of our automotive industry showcases how Mexico has evolved toward increasingly advanced manufacturing, which creates opportunities for other industries. The automotive industry required a supply chain of specialized and certifiable high-precision technologies; which in turn enabled other industries with similar requirements, namely the aerospace, electric/electronic, and medical device industries. We consider high value-added sectors as strategic, because of the domino effect on the country's productive capacity, which in turn translates into more and better-paid jobs, hence creating a virtuous growth cycle.</p><p>The eight strategic sectors we have identified are: automotive, aerospace, electric-electronic, medical devices, creative industries, IT, agribusiness, and renewable energy. Mexico is the fifth largest automotive exporter. Meanwhile, our aerospace exports totaled $4.3 billion in 2011. Our aerospace industry was almost non-existent a decade ago, but has quadrupled since 2005, to currently number 250 companies. The industry also experienced a 19% compounded annual growth for the past seven years. In fact, a plane with Mexican technology takes off every two seconds.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the renewable energy sector in the medium term, and what are ProMéxico's strategies to encourage investment in this sector?</h4><p>Environmental deterioration affects humanity as a whole. The responsible use of natural resources and mitigating the causes of climate change not only makes social sense, but also makes business sense. Green technology is an ocean of opportunities for large, small, and start-up companies alike. Furthermore, Mexico pursues an aggressive green agenda that is ahead of other developing countries. While Mexico has important petroleum reserves, we are also on the forefront of renewable energy. In fact, nearly one-fourth of Mexico's installed electricity generating capacity already comes from renewable sources. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Mexico has one of the most robust potentials for wind, solar and geothermal energy in the world. Wind potential is estimated around 71,000 MW, primarily in locations such as La Ventosa in Oaxaca and La Rumorosa in Baja California, where annual wind hours exceed 3,500—among the highest in the world. There is currently 850 MW of installed capacity that should reach 1,300 MW by the end of 2012, and projects for another 2,000 MW pending final approvals. Meanwhile, solar generation is beginning to take off in Mexico. Being located on the “sun belt," Mexico is one of the countries with the highest levels of solar irradiation. The potential in the northwest of the county can exceed 6 kWh/sqm per day, and most of the rest of the country enjoys between 4.5 and 6.</p><p>Lastly, Mexico is among the top five countries with the most potential for geothermal energy, and we are already the fourth in terms of installed capacity. It's also worth mentioning that in addition to the domestic market; Mexico is in a unique position to export clean energy to the US. For example, California's mandate to source 32% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020 makes projects near the border even more attractive. Thanks to the promotion of these advantages among businesspeople and industry leaders around the globe, ProMéxico has attracted more than 20 green projects, amounting to $7.5 billion in FDI since 2008.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Three risks that might increase the odds of another global economic crisis need to be monitored closely: the unresolved euro zone sovereign debt crisis, the weak economic outlook of advanced economies, and the uncertainty over China's growth sustainability. These translate into lower volumes of trade, risk aversion from investors, and low commodity prices. One exception to the downward risk in commodity prices could come from oil prices rising as a result of tensions in the Middle East.<br></p><p>With that in mind, Mexico confronts two distinct types of vulnerabilities: those caused by outside developments and those emerging from its own internal circumstances.</p><p>From the outside, Mexico is exposed to fluctuations in the US economy due to trade relations and remittances. If a crisis spreads to its next-door neighbor to the north, Mexico's trade is affected due to the fact that the US accounts for 80% of its exports. As most Mexican migrants live in the US, it could also lead to lower remittances, a multi-billion year flow that tends to benefit some of the poorer and more vulnerable sectors of Mexican society.</p><p>A global crisis could also prompt oil prices to decline, dramatically affecting Mexico's public revenues, a third of which depend on oil revenues. On the other hand, the effects on Mexico's trade balance would be moderate because oil exports only represent 13% of total exports and about 1.5% of GDP.</p><p>In the event of another global crisis, external and domestic financing conditions could tighten. Currency depreciation could intensify as flight-to-safety would lead to a reversal in net capital flows. Financial market dislocations could cause strain on investments such as pension funds, or niche banks reliant on wholesale funding. Moreover, foreign-owned banks could curtail credit to allocate capital to the parent bank. Finally, the effect of a new external shock could be amplified through the expectations channel. Heightened uncertainty about the financial and sovereign crisis in Europe could worsen business and consumer sentiment, thus depressing domestic demand. Despite these factors, Mexico is well prepared to respond to external shocks owing to four key reasons. For one, external financing needs are manageable. This is due to a moderate current account deficit, healthy levels of international reserves, a Flexible Credit Line with the IMF, and prudent public debt management. Secondly, inflation remains moderate at below 4%. Nominal policy rates are at 4.5%—lower than their pre-Lehman levels, which stand at 7.5%. However, there is still some scope to reduce real interest rates if needed. A third reason is that the flexible exchange rate is a good shock absorber. It allows the currency to adjust rapidly and helps soften the impact of a reversal in net capital flows. Finally, the banking system is sound. Foreign banks' subsidiaries enjoy strong capitalization and liquidity ratios, and recent tests performed by the World Bank and the IMF found the system to be resilient to a variety of shocks. Internally, however, Mexico is moderately vulnerable on both the fiscal and social fronts. While public debt is low and the country has embarked in recent fiscal consolidation efforts, the fiscal position has deteriorated since 2007. The primary fiscal deficit in 2011 is estimated at 0.3% of GDP in 2011 (compared to a surplus of 1.5% of GDP in 2007). A weaker fiscal position limits the potential for an active fiscal stimulus program and commodity dependence adds fiscal pressures. These risks are mitigated by oil stabilization funds and leveraged by oil price hedges, which could be drawn in the event of a sharp decline in oil prices. Still, fiscal dependence on oil revenues and export dependence on the US market reiterate the need to diversify.</p><p>On the social front, poverty and unemployment have not yet returned to pre-2008 crisis levels and are highly sensitive to economic shocks. Social safety nets are broadly adequate to support the chronic poor. However, the transient poor—the vulnerable households easily driven back into poverty when a crisis hits—may need more social programs to protect them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have driven the Mexican economy's recovery over the last two years?<br></h4><p>In May 2011, we published an economic survey of Mexico. The publication analyzes the economic recovery of Mexico, clearly showing that exports have been the main driver of the economy and its recovery, growing 24% in 2010, while imports grew 22%. Internal demand also grew and product consumption increased by over 5%. In 2011 we estimated moderate GDP growth of around 4.4%, but with all the uncertainties in the world driven by the debt crisis in Europe and the US, this figure may change. It is a moderate figure even in light of the uncertainty.</p><h4>What GDP expectations do you have for 2012?</h4><p>In November 2011, the OECD published the latest version of its Economic Outlook. In this document, a three-case scenario analysis on the world's economic situation is presented, having the European debt crisis and the US fiscal tightening as its main determinants. The moderate and realistic scenario plots a growth slowdown for Mexico, but at a much better level than the rest of the OECD countries estimating the Mexican GDP growth rate at 3.3% for 2012. The average in the eurozone is expected to grow by 0.2% and the US by 2%.</p><h4>What is being done to reduce informality in the economy?</h4><p>It is a huge and complex issue. There are a number of ways to make the formal sector more attractive. Part of this has to do with labor law regulations, which in Mexico don't encourage the employment of young people. This is due to uncertainty about whether any given young person would be a good asset for a company or not. Mexico does not have introductory contracts, and temporary contracts are very restricted, so most contracts have to be permanent. This can result in high costs if the employee turns out to be unsuitable. This is an issue the authorities are trying to solve through a revision of the labor law, which is before Congress. Another recommendation the OECD makes is to continue efforts to reduce the bureaucracy facing firms, and generally reduce the costs incurred by firms in the formal sector. Healthcare packages are also an important feature. The system is fragmented into public, private, and popular packages. It could be better integrated in order to allow the movement of labor between sectors, thus reducing costs and facilitating integration into the formal market.</p><h4>What reforms should be made to promote long-term economic stability?</h4><p>Mexico has advanced significantly in terms of long-term macroeconomic stability thanks to reforms over the last 20 years. Some of the population refuses to believe that the path chosen was the right one, but the way in which Mexico has dealt with the global economic crisis has proven that the country is on the right path. However, the Mexican economy dropped significantly in 2009, meaning that more could be done to reduce volatility in productivity. First, the fiscal policy framework must be improved, with a structural balance rule netting out the cyclical component of tax and oil income. This would help because Mexico is deeply influenced by the global price of oil. If a structural balance rule like the one implemented in Chile were introduced, it would allow Mexico to save more during boom periods and this would allow the country to pass through recessions in better shape. We would also like to see more competition, because it would help monetary policy in the sense that Mexico had a relatively high level of inflation even during the recession due to price rigidities. If there were stronger competition then prices would come down. The OECD has also recommended reforms related to financial supervision and a modernization of the service sector.</p><h4>What sectors of the economy do you believe need more investment?</h4><p>Infrastructure is a key issue. This needs to be tackled through a mix of public and private involvement, and this is a sector that still has to see significant development. Savings rates also need to increase in order to improve investment rates. On the private sector side we believe Mexico has huge potential in transport, energy, and telecommunications. There are estimates that the doubling of the broadband penetration rate from 10% to 20% might imply an additional 1% growth rate in overall GDP in Mexico. Another sector is energy, and it can be a sector in which private investment can generate more capacity and growth. It is also a sector with a huge multiplier effect on the economy. Additionally, tourism has been growing and continues to have great potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your appointment as CEO of UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) coincided with the organization's new five-year strategy to adopt a more entrepreneurial approach. What is the practical impact of this approach in countries such as Mexico?<br></h4><p>The reason we decided to embark on a more entrepreneurial approach at UKTI—and in the government in general—relates to the measures that the authorities have taken to control our domestic debt. Internal demand is inevitably constrained, and we have to support our growth through exports and foreign investments. This approach is also being implemented at a time when traditional markets are weak. For example, we know the issues that the EU and the US are struggling with; there has to be a particularly big shift in terms of attention to the large emerging markets where there is evidence of growth potential in the medium term. At the moment, the UK has obtained a 3.4% share of the imports of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Meanwhile, we have only 1.2% of the share of imports from economies registering huge growth. The principal challenge for the UK is to close the gap and boost the share of our exports to emerging markets, and there is no reason why this should not be the case. As emerging markets develop, their consumption patterns align with those of the markets in which there are already successful exporters. Considering a country like Mexico, it becomes a clear priority in that sense. It has a large emerging economy, sound macroeconomic policies, terrific demographics, and excellent opportunities—not only as a market itself, but also as a springboard to the US and the rest of the region. We have less than a 1% share of Mexico's imports. Although we are starting from a low base, we believe that it is possible to build strong ties from there. We have seen an increase in our exports to Mexico over the last couple of years, and we set the target of doubling our export volumes by 2015.</p><h4>In terms of FDI, which sectors of the Mexican economy do investments from the UK enhance the most?</h4><p>The energy sector is very interesting at the moment. The oil and gas sector in Mexico, which has been fairly closed in the past, is now opening up. There are huge opportunities onshore and offshore as well, particularly in terms of deep-sea exploration and extraction. The UK-based company Petrofac was the recent winner of the first two private contracts for operational rights in a Mexican oil field in more than 70 years. When we move to deep-sea offshore opportunities, which we will be doing over the next year, we will clearly need the technology of major firms such as BP and Shell, and it will be very competitive. I also believe that there are big opportunities in infrastructure. Huge developments are happening in Mexico—new cities, roads, and energy developments. The UK is strong and competitive in these areas. A third sector is retail, where there are a variety of good prospects. We are starting from the beginning, but the large and growing middle class already consumes many of the goods we offer. For example, high-end fashion such as Burberry is already operating in Mexico. Accessorize opened its first store in Mexico City in 2010, and has opened three new stores since then, leading the way for many other companies. Education is the fourth area where there are real opportunities for partnership and collaboration in a broader sense. Of course, we can attract Mexican students to the UK, but cooperation and partnerships between universities and specific areas is another important aspect. For example, we are focused on the energy industry in terms of forming academic partnerships.</p><h4>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has approved £45 million to support SME exports. How does Mexico fit into this strategy?</h4><p>One of the messages that we are trying to get across to SMEs is that it is absolutely possible, with the proper preparation and proper engagement with experts such as ourselves and our trade team in Mexico, to engage in emerging markets like Mexico. There is an understandable fear of looking beyond the traditional markets of Europe and the US among many investors. However, the fact that we have witnessed many successful individual cases demonstrates the ease and opportunity of establishing an SME. Indeed, it is relatively simple to establish a business in Mexico, and tariffs and regulatory demands are relaxed. Therefore, Mexico has taken the center stage of our SME program.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Secretariat contributed to the financial performance of the Mexican economy over the last five years?<br></h4><p>The main contribution of the Secretariat to the Mexican economy has been a solid and prudent management of macroeconomic policy. As a result of the responsible management of fiscal policy in recent years, we were able to implement counter-cyclical policies in response to the global financial crisis, which attenuated the effect of the shock on the welfare of the population, without threatening the sustainability of public finances and the stability of the economy. This was the first time in the recent history of the country that a counter-cyclical fiscal policy was put in place in response to a crisis. In previous decades, the effects of a crisis on welfare were aggravated by the additional tightening of fiscal and monetary policy, in contrast to what was seen recently. The solid stance of our macroeconomic policy has also contributed to the vigorous recovery of the Mexican economy after the global crisis and to the fact that at present the fundamentals of the local economy are very strong, without any sign of the economic imbalances that are currently prevalent in several countries around the world.</p><h4>How could new fiscal reform reducing the federal budget's reliance on oil and gas activities improve the diversification of the Mexican economy?</h4><p>One of the main objectives of the current administration has been precisely to strengthen public finances by reducing their dependence on oil revenues, and in that context two fiscal reforms directed precisely at this objective have been approved in the last four years. The first was approved in 2007 and the second in 2009. The first reform, approved in 2007, was oriented toward broadening the tax base and included measures like the introduction of a minimum income tax and a tax on cash deposits that affected only agents operating in the informal sector of the economy. The second reform, passed by congress in 2009, sought to increase tax revenues by increasing the rates of all major taxes, including income and consumption taxes, in a way that minimized their distorting effects. As a result of these two reforms, non-oil tax revenues have increased by close to two percentage points of GDP once we adjust for the position of the economic cycle. While we should continue with measures along these lines, we think that the medium term trend of non-oil revenues is very encouraging and that substantial progress has recently been achieved.</p><h4>One of your main priorities is managing the public deficit. The reduced figure currently stands at 2.7% of GDP, and you were targeting 2.3% for end-2011. What role is deficit reduction playing in Mexico's economic performance?</h4><p>The framework for fiscal policy in Mexico is established in the fiscal responsibility law, according to which in normal conditions public finances have to be balanced, excluding investment by PEMEX. The law contains an escape clause for extraordinary economic or social circumstances. Given the magnitude of the global financial crisis, at the end of 2009 the federal government prepared a multi-annual fiscal policy strategy that contemplated temporary and moderate fiscal deficits to support economic activity while output was below its potential level. In this context, a deficit of 0.8%, excluding investment by PEMEX (or 2.8% including it), was observed in 2010, a reduction in the deficit for 2011 to 0.5% (or 2.5% including investment by PEMEX) was approved for 2011, and a further reduction to a deficit of 0.4% (or 2.4% including investment by PEMEX) was recently approved for 2012. For 2013 we are projecting a return to a balanced budget. As I mentioned before, this multi-annual fiscal policy strategy has been oriented at providing a stimulus to the economy during the recessionary phase of the economic cycle while preserving the sustainability of public finances.</p><h4>According to Banco de México, the Mexican economy expected a 3.8% GDP growth in 2011 with the inflation rate falling from 5% to 3%. How is this performance affecting the federal budget, and what can we expect from 2012 in terms of Mexico's economic growth as well as budget allocations?</h4><p>At the Secretariat our own projection is that in 2011 the Mexican economy will grow at a pace of 4%, which is entirely consistent with recently released figures of economic activity and with what private sector analysts are expecting. On the inflation front, in recent months inflation has evolved very favorably, to reach levels that are entirely consistent with Banco de México's long-term target of 3%. We regard this as a very welcome development, as it represents an additional factor that contributes to the fundamental strength of the Mexican economy. For 2012, in terms of growth we are projecting that GDP will increase by between 3.3% and 3.5%, a projection that is also consistent with private sector expectations. In line with the positive behavior of the economy, expenditure over recent years has registered positive real growth rates in spite of the fiscal consolidation implied by the decreasing path of the fiscal deficit. For 2012, overall expenditure will increase by 4.1% in real terms and programmable expenditure excluding investment by PEMEX will increase by 6.2%.</p><h4>In addition to oil and gas, manufacturing, and retail services, what other strategic sectors will lead the performance of Mexico's economy in the next five years?</h4><p>I would like to begin by saying that for the sectors you mentioned, which are strategic and have had a very positive evolution recently, there are several reasons to expect that they will continue to show an important dynamism in the near term and that they will continue to be strategic for the entire economy. In the case of manufacturing, we have seen several signs of an important increase in the Mexican economy's competitiveness in recent years, a result of which Mexican exports have gained market share in the main world markets. This explains the fact that Mexican exports have continued to grow at healthy rates even when the world economy is decelerating. In the case of the energy sector, we expect a marked improvement over the next few years associated with the reforms we have made to the regulatory framework of the sector. These reforms include changes to PEMEX's corporate government structure, as well as the “incentive contracts," which allow PEMEX to share the risks of exploration projects with private agents. In addition to these sectors, other sectors that we regard as strategic in terms of their potential to generate employment and trigger regional development are the construction sector, in which housing and infrastructure will play very relevant roles, the science and technology sector, which has seen a very important increase in budgetary resources, and the agricultural sector. In all these cases, we have worked to improve the regulatory framework and we have complemented these legal changes with budgetary resources.</p><h4>According to different international credit rating agencies (Standard &amp; Poor's, Fitch, and Moody's), Mexico's sovereign debt is considered very stable. Do you expect an upgrade in Mexico's sovereign rating in the medium term and what do you envision for investor demand for public debt?</h4><p>The first thing to note with regards to Mexican public debt is that, in sharp contrast to what occurred in previous episodes of international stability, during recent months we have seen that the demand for Mexican debt has been very stable even in the face of acute increases in volatility in international markets. Undoubtedly, this is related to the strength of the fundamentals of the Mexican economy and to the hard-earned credibility of our macroeconomic policy. Looking forward, the fact that there are no signs of imbalances building up and that the macroeconomic stance will continue to be very solid—with inflation converging to its long-term target and with the public deficit at moderate levels and under a decreasing trajectory—lead us to expect the Mexican assets will retain their attractiveness for international investors. Finally, it is relevant to note that according to several indicators, including for example the average maturity of bonds, Mexican public debt compares very favorably with that of other economies that currently have better credit ratings, and while it is difficult to make any specific predictions about the decisions of rating agencies, there are several policies that have been followed such as a more dynamic accumulation of reserves that imply that the fundamentals of the Mexican economy have been  strengthened.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the success of Mexico's monetary policy in recent years, and what elements have contributed to the stability we now see in the economy and financial system?</h4><p>Mexico has made great progress in achieving macroeconomic stability in recent years. A monetary policy framework committed to price stability, supported by prudent fiscal policy, relatively low levels of public debt, a flexible exchange rate regime, and a sound financial system have helped to reduce both inflation and its volatility and to anchor inflation expectations. That is, the progress made in terms of inflation in Mexico has been reached in the context of a strong macroeconomic policy framework and, in general, in an environment of solid economic fundamentals. In this setting, Mexico has significantly moved forward in the process of convergence toward the 3% permanent inflation target and it is expected to follow this direction. Furthermore, in order to reinforce the compromise with price stability, the authorities have strengthened the monetary policy framework in recent years. Since the communication strategy is an important element of the monetary policy regime, Banco de México's Board of Governors considered it convenient to expand the communication mechanisms with the public. From 2011 onwards, the minutes of the Board of Governors' meetings with respect to monetary policy decisions have been published. This aims to increase the central institute's transparency even more, and thereby offer more information to market participants and the public about the monetary policy decision-making process, highlighting the most important factors in the decisions of the Board of Governors. This measure has had a favorable impact on investor sentiment and consequently it has strengthened Banco de México's commitment to price stability. In summary, the increasing credibility of the macroeconomic policy framework and the solid economic fundamentals have significantly improved market participants' confidence in the Mexican economy. These elements have contributed to the stability we currently see in Mexico.</p><h4>What policy measures have been most successful in helping to control the volatility of the peso in the dynamic international foreign exchange market?</h4><p>First, it is important to remember that the foreign exchange policy in Mexico is set by the Foreign Exchange Commission (FEC), which is formed by officials from the Ministry of Finance and from Banco de México, and that since December of 1994 we operate with a free-floating exchange rate regime, which is an important element of the macroeconomic policy framework in Mexico. It can partially absorb external shocks and consequently attenuate the adverse impact on the domestic economy. In this context, due to its stabilizing properties, the floating exchange rate regime has played a key role during the recent period of fluctuation in the international foreign exchange market. In particular, given the confidence in this regime, the depreciation of the nominal exchange rate has allowed a depreciation of the real exchange rate without an effect on inflation or its expectations. Furthermore, in light of the adverse conditions prevailing in international financial markets and with the aim of preserving the orderly functioning of the foreign exchange market, the FEC, decided to implement some preventive measures. First, the FEC decided to temporarily suspend the monthly auction of put options for $600 million among credit institutions that was put in place in March of 2010 to foster the process of the accumulation of international reserves. Second, on November 30, 2011 Banco de México started carrying out daily auctions for a total amount of $400 million among credit institutions with a minimum price of 2% above the immediate previous working day's exchange rate. This mechanism was successfully used in the past to provide liquidity to the foreign exchange market with minimum market distortions. At this point, it is worthwhile to remember that a very important characteristic of all the mechanisms to sell and buy dollars that the Mexican authorities have put in place is that at all times they have never targeted any specific level for the exchange rate. The consistency in terms of the free-floating regime by limiting the interventions in the market to rule-based mechanisms has helped to control volatility over the long run. In fact, this consistency has helped develop a very liquid peso-dollar market, which according to the last triennial survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in 2010. places the Mexican peso as the second most liquid emerging market currency, just below the Korean won. In addition, a tool that has also helped contain volatility has been the communication policy that the authorities have maintained with the market. In that respect, the FEC has made a very important effort to be as transparent as possible in terms of its policy actions. Furthermore, Mexico has a sound macroeconomic framework and solid economic fundamentals, which in the end has determined the performance of the Mexican peso in the long run.</p><h4>Mexico is seeing a steady increase in capital flows. In your opinion, what makes foreign investors confident in directing investments to the country?</h4><p>Since the second half of 2009, the Mexican economy has received important flows of external financial resources. The stock of government bonds held by non-residents increased from Ps260 billion ($19.7 billion) in June 2009 to Ps973 billion ($69.8 billion) at the end of 2011. The pattern of foreign investment flows is explained by structural factors, such as the solid economic fundamentals of the Mexican economy. Another factor is the inclusion of Mexican government long-term bonds into the World Government Bond Index (WGBI) in November 2010. The incorporation of Mexico's government bonds into the WGBI increased these bonds' holdings by non-residents due to the fact that, among other reasons, a considerable number of investment funds worldwide use this index as a reference for their investment portfolio formation. There are other elements related to recent developments that have also supported these flows of foreign financial resources. First, the extraordinary quantitative easing in the US has implied elevated interest rate spreads between Mexico and the US, which led to substantial foreign capital inflows, mainly channeled to government security purchases. Second, in 2009 and 2010, the improvement in the financial systems of the main advanced economies led to increased levels of liquidity in the international financial markets. It is important to mention again that in September 2011 the increasing uncertainty in financial markets as a result of economic and financial problems in the eurozone produced a temporary reversal of investment flows to the Mexican economy. This situation was short lived, and in November and December 2011 the Mexican economy once again received positive flows of external financial resources. These recent events contrast with those at the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009, when a widespread sale of medium- and long-term government securities led to a significant decrease in non-residents' financial savings. Since then, the strengthening of the fundamentals of the Mexican economy has contributed to the expansion of investors in the base that participates in the Mexican bond market. In particular, the number of institutional investors with a longer-term profile has increased. Regarding FDI flows, which are a relevant source of long-term funding for the economy, they have been flowing to Mexico over recent years, despite lower levels of global economic activity. In 2010, FDI amounted to $19.8 billion, up from $15.8 billion the previous year. The trade openness of our economy, the resumption of economic growth in Mexico, and a stable domestic macroeconomic environment have been factors that have supported these flows of FDI.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the main focus of your growth strategy over the last five years?</h4><p>We have focused both on consumers and companies, as a national bank that follows a universal model. Our bank provides a variety of financial services to our customers, becoming a one-stop shop where they can obtain insurance, pension funds, consumer financing, corporate loans, and much more. We like to see ourselves growing steadily in all of our business segments. Over the past few years, we have emphasized personal loans and payroll loans, which have increased significantly. With mortgages, we have followed a strategy different from many of our competitors. We have grown through a program called Infonavit Total Credit, which was formed by a partnership with the government housing authority in order to discount payments for loans according to payroll. This risk profile is different from other mortgage loans. Consequently, we have been able to provide 25% of the mortgage loans issued by the banking sector. Another important point is that we provide financing for our corporate customers. To do that, we use our balance sheet or the market. We have seen important windows of opportunity for our clients to issue debt on the market, and we were able to provide financing of about $23 billion in 2011, largely through placements on the market. We have consistently been ranked as number one in terms of the placement of local debt.</p><h4>Which activities, sectors, and trends are driving demand in lending?</h4><p>Our bank provides financing in every segment, including energy, power, and technology. It would be difficult to say that there has been one area lagging behind. For example, telecommunications has been very active, and although our bank has not been heavily involved in housing development financing, we have made progress when compared to other institutions.</p><h4>SMEs account for more than 5 million companies in Mexico. What do they represent for your lending portfolio?</h4><p>The SME segment is relatively small, but the growth has been significant. We have grown 17% in SME lending. I firmly believe that we have found the right model to continue this growth pattern.</p><h4>In terms of credit supply, which sectors of the economy are you more active in?</h4><p>We have been very active in many sectors, but most recently we have been involved in financing petrochemical operations. Another segment we are working in is channeling the supply of financing, which is comprised of suppliers in various governmental agencies. We are working to be more active in infrastructure, which has slowly picked up. We have been pioneers in infrastructure financing, in some cases in partnership with Mexican development banks.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Banamex's financial performance in 2011?</h4><p>It was a great year for the franchise. In consumer credit, we consistently registered the highest indications of growth. On the other hand, 2011 was a difficult year for many markets. We are probably the most important market maker in Mexico, which leaves us relatively exposed to the movements of the economy. However, we consistently do very well, and although last year was a more difficult year, our performance was excellent in terms of our financial strength and capitalization levels. This was the first time that the market was not moving in line with the strong fundamentals of the Mexican economy, but we remain the strongest bank among the competition in Mexico.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of electronic banking in Mexico?</h4><p>Online banking has been growing more rapidly than other transactions in terms of access over the past few years. We believe that the most important change will happen with the product that we are about to launch, the electronic wallet. This product is more than online banking; it offers the ability to use a mobile phone to make payments and transfers between users. The electronic wallet is also an important tool for financial inclusion in Mexico, which is why we enhanced our partnership with América Móvil. Now, customers can transfer an amount directly to anyone's telephone, which functions as the user's banking account number. Mexico continues to be an economy that is very intensive in the use of cash, but payment methods will change significantly with the introduction of our product. This may be the most important development in terms of the way we do banking, not only in Mexico but also in Latin America.</p><h4>What is your strategy for banking the “unbanked"?</h4><p>The possibility of using mobile phones to do banking is the most important strategy. The other is growing our correspondent network. We are in the process of closing a deal with an important chain of convenience stores, creating an additional 10,000 sales points. With this alliance, we can grow to 14,000 locations in villages or small towns where there are no banks of any kind.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the banking sector in Mexico in the medium term?</h4><p>We were well prepared for the world financial crisis in terms of having the adequate regulatory framework. In any event, the banking system is very well capitalized, with a 50% average of core capital. The system is also well reserved, and the authorities have made adequate risk decisions in terms of exposure. We are prepared to adopt Basel III, which is unusual for the banking system of a country. The Mexican banking system is strong; bearing in mind the behavior of the sector before the crisis, it has been growing steadily in terms of assets, at a double-digit rate in a sustainable way. If we link this trend with the emergence of the middle class in Mexico, I would say that we expect to continue registering adequate growth rates for the economy. We expect that the growth of the banking system will continue to be three or four times more than the growth of the economy, which also means higher penetration. One of the important advantages is that we have had microfinancial stability, which is necessary when growing portfolios such as mortgage loans. It is difficult for customers to take out a long-term loan at a variable rate as was done in the past. Having good prospects of economic growth will spark increased penetration of the banking system, more growth, and the development of new financial products and innovations as well as new ways to provide cheaper financial services to the middle classes and emerging markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bancomer had 12 million customers in 2005, and at present the group has over 18 million. How has your product portfolio evolved, and what has been the main focus of your growth strategy over the last five years?<br></h4><p>I think technology is very relevant to our commercial strategy. Banking today is very different from how it was 15 years ago. It has changed dramatically. In that sense, the way we grow our customer base has also changed. First we talk about “banking the unbanked." Mexico is a country that is growing very fast in terms of access to credit and banking services. We have adapted different solutions for our customers. The key to this is the mobile telephone, and we have been very successful in launching a new program where customers do not need to go to a branch. They can open an account anywhere—it is very easy. The number of the account is the same as their telephone number. This is just an example, but we are using technology a lot, and the opportunity that we have today—to link banking infrastructure with merchants that act as correspondent banks—allows basic transactions to be done outside of a branch. For example, our 15-year partnership with Wal-Mart allows us to issue private label credit cards. It is very challenging, because we issue many cards per year. We need to do it in a way that is profitable for very low-income customers. On the business side, we have been testing different solutions, but now we are able to issue a program called the “MicroNegocios card." It is a credit card for the working capital of very small companies. The difference is that the average loan amount is $3,000. We are really talking about very small companies, or self-employed individuals, with one or two employees only. These are the kinds of things we've been doing in the past few years that have allowed us to double our customer base in a very short period.</p><h4>What is the current position of Bancomer in the different segments of the Mexican market, and in which sector of the economy is Bancomer most active in terms of credit supply?</h4><p>We are very active in every sector, because we are a universal bank. We have a very significant market share, maybe 25%-30% of many markets, so what is important for us is to break up Bancomer into many different representations, according to the types of customers in different distribution channels, using different marketing and sales forces. Credit to small businesses grew 21% in 2011 compared to 2010, and consumer lending grew more than 23% for lending for car loans, personal loans, and payroll loans. Also, mortgage loans are growing at around 6% because the population has become better educated. We are providing one out of three new mortgages in the private sector market, including banks and specialized companies. I would say, across the board, we see very healthy growth because the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) is relatively stable in all of our markets.</p><h4>How would you rate the development of electronic banking in Mexico?</h4><p>In general, I would say it is very important that Mexico improves electronic banking. The payment system is relatively underdeveloped—too much cash and too many checks. The problem is that we have a large customer base trained to use cash and checks. Now it's easier with small companies and new customers, as young people adopt new technologies well. However, there is a challenge to make the economy more electronic—not just in banking, but in all every sector's transactions. The government also uses too much cash and too many checks. We are working toward designing fully electronic solutions that are convenient for the customer. Internet banking has grown significantly, especially in the SME sector, because all of our credit programs are designed to be used on the internet. The government also introduced a positive measure that requires all companies to pay their taxes through the internet. That is also helping with internet adoption rates. I think internet banking is important, but mobile banking is also going to be very significant.</p><h4>What are your main investment plans for 2012?</h4><p>We are constructing two new buildings in Mexico City. In addition to that, we are investing in a new business model. We are making very significant changes to our business model, product distribution methods, and the way we advise and interact with customers. We are also investing in infrastructure. We are opening new branches, but more importantly we are investing in new technology, and new electronic channels. We are installing many point-of-sale (POS) systems for our correspondent merchants, and have around 14,000 at present.</p><h4>Compared to other Latin American countries, the bank penetration rate in Mexico is quite low. Is the dominance of the informal sector the reason for this?</h4><p>The problem is very simple; we are 20 years behind. When Chile and Brazil's credit penetration was growing, Mexico's banks were being nationalized. We lost 10 years in the 1980s, and we faced a crisis in the 1990s after the sector was privatized. Credit almost fell to zero over this period. Currently, Mexico is experiencing one of the most dynamic banking penetration processes in the world. Banking systems have grown significantly over the past seven years to include 42 million customers, up from 22 million. There are also now 500,000 companies with credit, up from 100,000 in the past five years. The base is low compared to other countries, but the dynamics are strong in this healthy banking system. It is very important that this growth be sustainable in the future. We have a system with over a 15% capital adequacy ratio (CAR). It is a very liquid market and a very liquid position for Bancomer. There are, however, some challenges that we need to overcome to grow more, and the informal economy is one of them. It is very difficult to assess the financial capacity of these companies or families. The legal framework has improved, but needs more improvement. The rights that we have as creditors in our loan operations when we need to recover guarantees are very slow processes. In general, the rule of law needs to be more efficient and effective in protecting these rights for the benefit of everybody, especially the investors. Despite that, the environment is very attractive.</p><h4>The National Commission for the Protection of Users of Financial Services (CONDUSEF) published new records concerning credit card usage in Mexico and the interest rates applied. What changes do you envision in the near future in the sector?</h4><p>In the past decade, average interest rates for credit cards have fallen 1,000 basis points (bps). Our strategy is to differentiate prices based on risk. They are risk-adjusted based on the behavior of the customer. We have greatly reduced our interest rate on credit cards in a rational way. The program that has made our idea public is called paga bien, paga menos, (pay well, pay less). Every six months we can reduce 100 bps if the customer regularly pays on time. If he does not pay on time, we can also increase the rate by 100 bps or more. It is a systematic program that is intended to educate the customer as to what is the best way to use a credit card.</p><p>We believe that programs like this are very important for customers to use credit in a healthy, productive way. We have tested our financial education programs and we find that those customers who are enrolled have a lower rate of delinquency than those who have not had that opportunity. Still, it is important not to penalize customers with a high interest rate in a market where many people do not have any credit experience. Maybe they will have to pay a 40% interest rate initially, but the great advantage is that they are not in a closed environment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Global Finance has recently declared Santander Mexico to be the safest bank in Mexico in 2011. What factors do you feel have contributed the most to this result?</h4><p>The reasons are mainly in the policies of the bank regarding its control of operations and the efficiency of the bank's processes, but also in the long term-credits and the total assets. It's also an extremely safe bank because we excel at covering aspects related to money laundering. These awards are proof of our strong position in Mexico and our confidence in growth expectations.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the bank's performance in 2011?</h4><p>Santander Mexico is ranked fourth in terms of the contribution of benefits to the group. It has built a very solid retail banking franchise; some years ago we bought two banks here in Mexico in bad terms and now we are the biggest investment bank in the country. We are also the strongest commercial banking franchise in the country, not in terms of size but of effectiveness. These numbers have made us one of the most productive banks in the global group.</p><h4>How have ratings fluctuations affected Santander Mexico?</h4><p>It hasn't affected us at all. If cuts continue for European banks, then it is possible we could be affected at some point. Our corporate policy is that our subsidiaries work in an autonomous way. This doesn't mean that we are independent from our HQ, but we have a certain level of autonomy that allows us to take special actions based on local market conditions. At the same time, in 2011, Mexico has been one of the key markets for the group and we are experiencing strong consolidation in all segments. So for the moment, I don't envision any changes in our current corporate structure as a result of changes from the ratings agencies.</p><h4>What share does the SME segment have in your lending portfolio?</h4><p>The bank considers the SME segment as one of its key targets in its expansion strategy. Our target is to have a 20% market share, and we think there is impressive growth potential in this area. We had a market share of 4% in 2007, now we have 19%. Our growth this year was at 40% in the portfolio, with positive estimates of 30% in 2012 also in our portfolio. We have products suited to the needs of SMEs that allow them to become better organized both administratively and financially, such as POS terminals. We have deals with different companies such as PwC and Windows in order to offer SMEs an affordable package allowing them to learn how to use programs to produce quality information on accounts and corporate organization. We are the top partner of Nacional Financiera—a government bank that targets SME industrial development—to offer SME-accessible credits.</p><h4>What led Santander to acquire GE Capital's mortgage assets as well as Bank of America's 24% share in Santander Mexico?</h4><p>The acquisition of Bank of America's 24% stake was a way of growing in a country where there is a lack of quality M&amp;A opportunities. The acquisition is aimed at consolidating our presence in the country. At present, banks in the US are under heavy pressure from the international markets as they exit the debt crisis. We thus decided that it was the right time to make the acquisition. Concerning GE Capital's mortgage assets, according to our expansion program, we found it the most attractive deal in the market in order to increase our penetration in this segment, but I have to underline that we have recorded important organic growth also. With this acquisition, Santander Mexico became the second most important bank in the market and the first in residential mortgages, which was our target.</p><h4>What will be the main focus of your growth strategy for 2012?</h4><p>We are looking at increasing our participation in the SME segment by around 30%; 25% in credit for consumers; 22% in the mortgage segment; and 18% in the large corporations segment. We will continue to give emphasis to our insurance operations, as of 2011 we grew 50%, and in 2012 we expect to grow in this sector by around 35% with an innovative product in car insurance.</p><h4>Mexico's banking sector displays a large gap between corporate and consumer lending volumes. How do you expect this to evolve in the medium term?</h4><p>There had been an increase in consumer lending for several years, which has slowed down due to the global financial crisis. The main problem in the market is credit card usage with respect to the size of the economy. In commission terms, the rate is quite low in Mexico. For these reasons, consumer lending is a promising opportunity regarding the young population entering the market. Obviously, this allows for an increase in consumption and allows the banks to meet the needs of a growing population.</p><h4>Mexican banks are generally considered to be well capitalized. How has this strong capital adequacy contributed to the banking system's resilience in the face of global volatility?</h4><p>Mexico has a huge advantage in four very important aspects: a well-capitalized financial system; a portfolio of good quality; good provisions for that portfolio; and a market that has good levels of liquidity. Mexico has a sound financial system and the expectations for the economy's growth are also very promising. Thanks to all of these factors, the banking system has been able to face global volatility much better than other regions.</p><h4>What is your assessment of Mexico's fund industry, and how will it evolve?</h4><p>In our country we have a mature and low-risk investment funds industry. It is exceptional to hear examples of crises relating to these financial instruments as are seen in other markets. In our case, we offer our customers different schemes, even with international funds where other institutions take part as brokers. We don't offer schemes to everybody because we need to be conscious about each profile, and because our clients always welcome having the best options. Our bank has found success in motivating its customers in using these instruments. Our strategies are always focused on our clients.</p><h4>Mexico's sovereign credit rating is considered stable. Do you envision any change in this rating taking into account the coming election period?</h4><p>Fortunately no. We have already mentioned that Mexico has a sound financial system. Its macroeconomic fundamentals are the other factors making Mexico a market for growth, attractive and with a very different behavior. It has a debt ratio of 30% of its GDP, a deficit of 0.5%, and a low inflation rate.</p><p>All these factors make Mexico a good quality risk country and, therefore, the sovereign risk is financed at low prices and its volatility is minimal in relative terms. In this past crisis, Mexico's sovereign risk has been around 100 and 200 basic points, which is a relatively low margin. In fact, the probability is for the rating to be raised rather than lowered.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The US' future is closely tied to the future of the Western Hemisphere. Over 40% of US exports go to the Americas, and those exports are increasing at a faster rate than the rest of the world, generating significant economic gains both for our country and partners across the region.<br></p><p>At the heart of this success is our strong economic ties to North America and the US' close relationship with Mexico. President Barack Obama has said that our two countries “are not simply neighbors, bound by geography and history; we are, by choice, friends and partners… in the 21st century, we are defined not by our borders, but by our bonds."</p><p>These bonds have grown stronger throughout the years, reaching new heights in 2011; bilateral trade between the US and Mexico reached approximately $460 billion, an all-time record. This translates to more than $1.2 billion in trade flowing every day between our two countries, supporting jobs, boosting businesses, and fueling growth on both sides of the border.</p><p>The question both countries must answer now is this: How do we boost trade in order to generate even more economic benefits? One way is to make North America more competitive for the future. Recently, President Obama and President Calderón joined the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, for the North America Leaders Summit. Together, they renewed their commitment to strengthening economic ties by making our borders more efficient and secure for both people and products.</p><p>As close trading partners, the US and Mexico share highly integrated supply chains and co-production. Goods manufactured in Mexico can cross the border four times before being finished and imported into the US. Supply chains are an important part of the US—Mexico trade relationship.</p><p>Unfortunately, this process for production is often plagued by inefficiencies and red tape. Regulations on one side of the border can differ with those on the other side. And the rules are constantly changing, making it hard for businesses to comply. This causes delays, hurts productivity, and ultimately harms the competitiveness of industries in both countries.</p><p>To address these challenges, the parties at the recent summit agreed to streamline and coordinate regulations, making it easier for businesses to compete. This work builds on the foundation laid by another effort: the bilateral High Level Regulatory Cooperation Council (HLRCC) with Mexico.</p><p>The HLRCC has a mandate to ensure that our governments' approach to regulation balances the need to promote economic growth with the need to ensure the safety of our products and people.</p><p>Doing so will go a long way in making trade more efficient, and ultimately more impactful for our two economies.</p><p>Clearly, the US and Mexican governments are making important strides in regulatory cooperation. We are also making progress when it comes to broader border issues. In 2010, during an official state visit to Washington, President Calderón joined President Obama to issue a joint declaration on the 21st Century Border Management initiative.</p><p>This declaration committed the US and Mexico to full and renewed cooperation based on the principles of joint border management, co-responsibility for cross-border crime, and a shared commitment to the efficient flow of legal commerce and travel. The initiative has three areas of focus: border infrastructure; secure flows of goods and people; and corridor security.</p><p>As part of this effort, the two governments have sought to increase collaboration to reduce the administrative burdens of cross-border trade, design ports of entry that meet the needs of both sides, and protect public safety by integrating law enforcement efforts with other government functions including social assistance and community outreach. Both governments are committed to the full implementation of the 21st Century Border Management initiative in order to address any and all challenges facing our trade.</p><p>Additionally, we are working together to support industries with enormous potential to generate economic benefits. One example is energy. It is estimated that Mexico's energy demand will likely double by 2030. The country has the ability to meet this demand with clean, renewable energy; it has world-class resource potential in wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and hydropower. Yet, Mexico currently gets less than 5% of its power from renewable energy.</p><p>Recognizing this great potential, both President Obama and President Calderón are committed to supporting the development of renewable energy. They created the US-Mexico Bilateral Framework for Clean Energy and Climate Change in 2009, a joint effort that includes developing clean technology.</p><p>Together, both governments are working to achieve the triple bottom line: jobs for people, profits for businesses, and a healthier planet for all. There are also enormous opportunities to boost trade in other sectors like travel and tourism, information technology, and education. Now is the time to make the most of them.</p><p>The US-Mexico story is defined by partnership and growth. Trade between our two countries has surged over the years, and it's important that we keep this going to strengthen our economies and spur growth on both sides of the border.</p><p>We are doing just that by working together to make our countries more competitive, enhance regulatory cooperation, collaborate on border management, and develop promising sectors. As a result, in the words of President Obama, “I believe our nations and our citizens will be more secure, more prosperous, and in a better position to give their children the lives that they deserve."</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Despite the considerable turbulence and uncertainty that has clouded the global economy in recent years, the economic relationship between Mexico and the US achieved unprecedented success in 2011. Two-way trade reached a record high of $460 billion, making Mexico the US' second largest export market and third largest trading partner. FDI also surged. US investors contributed more than half the value of new investment projects in Mexico, pushing the total stock of US FDI in Mexico to over $100 billion. These numbers speak to an economic relationship that has transformed in the last two decades. Trade is five times what it was 20 years ago. But more than just the level of trade, what has changed is the nature of trade between the US and Mexico. Intra-industry trade and intra-firm trade are more prevalent than ever before. Production chains and supply networks stretch through both countries, and goods and inputs cross back and forth multiple times. The US and Mexico do not merely trade with each other, we build things together. Mexican exports to the US comprise more than 40% US content.<br></p><p>The collaborative relationship between the US and Mexico shows that the US economy does not stop at the border. Regional integration in North America creates a common economic space that makes the US more globally competitive. Jobs in the US do not exist in isolation, but rather are connected to customers and suppliers worldwide. That type of mutually beneficial commercial linkage is particularly intense with Mexico.</p><p>The challenge for 2012 and the years ahead is to take advantage of those new opportunities by advancing a positive economic agenda that facilitates even more trade and investment, even more job creation, and even more prosperity in both countries.</p><p>Effective border management is a top priority. The US-Mexico border is one of the busiest, most commercially important borders in the world. One million travelers and more than $1 billion in trade cross it every day. The need to facilitate the efficient flow of legitimate commerce and travel is urgent, as of course is the need to impede the transit of illicit goods, funds, and persons. A special border steering committee is working to coordinate infrastructure projects, improve border crossing procedures, and shape regional planning, to ensure the border is friendly to business.</p><p>Our governments also seek to remove unnecessary regulatory differences that slow business growth and make it more complicated to protect consumers and the environment. A bilateral regulatory cooperation council is reducing overly burdensome red tape, streamlining processes, and aligning standards in key sectors such as food safety, transportation, nanotechnology, e-health, and offshore oil and gas development. Special benefits from these improvements should accrue to SMEs, a sector targeted for expanded exports to Mexico under President Obama's National Export Initiative, which seeks to double US exports by 2014.</p><p>Mexico is a priority country in the SelectUSA initiative, a US government-wide effort to attract increased FDI into the US by letting foreign companies know we are open for business. Mexican investment in the US already exceeds $10 billion; and the potential for increased investment is high, which could create jobs, spur economic growth, and strengthen two-way trade.</p><p>Beyond the bilateral agenda, the US and Mexico share important regional and global interests. We are working together to increase educational opportunities and give our next generation the skills they will need to thrive in the 21st century. With Canada, our other North American partner, we are enhancing our region's competitiveness in the global market.</p><p>In Central America, the US and Mexico are providing assistance to develop the capabilities of these countries to operate more effectively against drug-trafficking organizations and gangs, so as to reduce the constraints of violence and insecurity that hinder the economic development of this region. And throughout the Americas, Mexico and the US are working with other countries in the region through partnerships like Pathways to Prosperity and the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA) to promote inclusive economic growth, energy security, and environmental sustainability.</p><p>On the global level, Mexico's chairmanship of the G20 heightens its profile on the world stage. The US supports Mexico's G20 goals of economic stability and jobs, strengthening of the global financial system, improvement of the international financial system architecture, global food security, and sustainable development. G20 finance ministers and central bank governors have echoed the commitments of leaders in offering frank appraisals of the global economic situation and reminding Europe of its responsibility to solve the Eurozone crisis.</p><p>The US looks forward to working with Mexico on this broad, multi-faceted agenda throughout 2012 and beyond.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How competitive is Mexico when compared to the rest of Latin America and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China)?<br></h4><p>The global economic crisis that occurred in 2008 and 2009 marked a coming of age for the Mexican economy, making it behave in a mature way despite a dramatic shock to the real economy and a loss of employment, as well as a contraction in GDP. Mexico is now coming back in a strong position due to stability, which is in huge contrast to the Mexico of my youth when a crisis could break the country for a decade. Mexico has demographic strengths, relating to the amount of people in employment and the amount of people receiving pensions, and those too young to work. Our political system also received a shock during the 2006 presidential elections, but we managed to solve the political conflict through institutions and electoral tribunes, which also represented a coming of age for Mexican democracy. Compared to some of the BRICs, such as China, Mexico has succeeded in achieving a stable, democratic political environment. There is no better system than democracy. Mexico also has huge consumer power, on par with the BRICs. Its free trade agreements are also well developed, and this is positive when looking at the situation of other Latin American countries.</p><h4>What major steps have been taken to improve the competitive index?</h4><p>We cannot point to the government when discussing competitiveness. A famous political commentator once said that there are a number of centers of power, and one of those is Congress. Sadly, Congress is not up to the task of promoting reforms as fast as it should in order to keep pace and increase productivity to make Mexico an even more attractive destination for talent and investment. Mexico is achieving macroeconomic goals in many areas, including inflation, which Banco de México has kept at around 3%. Now, the challenge is to transform this low inflation rate into low credit interest rates, which are still at a level generally seen in developing economies. The country does, however, need to shake up its attitude to collecting taxes, as the collection regime has been too relaxed in the past.</p><h4>What role does innovation in human capital development play in the development of Mexico's competitiveness?</h4><p>One thing we have found is that we need to improve the quality of Mexican schools. Having more years of education improves the income level of an individual. If you don't finish secondary school, you are severely disadvantaged. If you finish university, your income will be, on average, 150% higher than if you don't finish high school. Therefore, we need to improve the education sector, and guarantee that Mexican children stay in school longer.</p><h4>What have been the effects of the country's security concerns on its perception abroad?</h4><p>We receive a lot of foreign investment, but it is impossible to know what is going on in the boardrooms of potential foreign investors around the world. The issue is, would you stop going to New York because New Orleans or Detroit have high murder rates? Of course not. Certain regions are experiencing problems, yet most states have no trouble.</p><h4>You have defined competitiveness as the ability of a country to attract investment. How is Mexico working to ensure the attraction and retention of investment?</h4><p>The Mexican government has made huge efforts to simplify the process of starting companies. One of the best decisions it has made was to liquidate the electric utility that served Mexico City and the surrounding areas in 2009. That had two benefits; a huge improvement in the level of service in Mexico City, and improvement in the allocation of public services, as this company was collecting $4 billion in subsidies every year. One of the biggest challenges Mexico faces is to improve the quality of spending, especially in terms of energy subsidies, which also contribute to global warming, an issue we should be fighting. Fixing these issues will make the country much more attractive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Nuevo León's competitive advantages as an investment destination?<br></h4><p>Nuevo León boasts access to both oceans, which means access to both Europe and Asia, with the internal infrastructure that plants established in Monterrey need. Although most of them export between 80% and 85% of their capacity to the US and Canada, they make sales domestically and to Central and South America. Our main competitive advantage is our strategic location. As members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), we have access to a market of 450 million people and contribute to a GDP that totals $15.5 trillion. NAFTA contains a mechanism for resolving disputes and provides protection for investments. Mexico is the third-largest partner of the US and the second-largest destination for all US exports. The two countries exchange over $1 billion a day in trade.</p><p>Other major competitive advantages include our human capital, stable labor force, and our industrial culture, which goes back to the late 1800s. June 2012 marks the 14th year without a single strike in the whole state, which demonstrates our confidence. An average of 5,000 engineers graduate every year in Monterrey. We have the highest education level in all of Mexico, with over 90 colleges and universities with more than 150,000 students enrolled at any given time. We also have many bilingual schools, maintaining a broad English base, which is crucial for business. Many of the 2,600 foreign companies operating in metropolitan Monterrey are operated by locals.</p><p>As a result, there is a combination of high-tech manufacturing in a low-cost region. We also have very close links between the academic world, the business world, and the government, which allows us to attract new businesses and enhance existing ones. We have many world-class industrial parks, as well as the only research and innovation park in Mexico. Our advantages are reflected in real terms by the confidence of international investors. We attracted $1.6 billion of FDI in 2011, and around 70% was for the expansion of foreign companies currently operating here.</p><h4>What sectors represent your core strengths, and what emerging sectors are you hoping to develop?</h4><p>We have a very diversified economy. We are a manufacturing center, and we produce over 10% of Mexico's manufactured goods. Last year we exported a little over $30 billion from Monterrey, which is more than all of what Central America exports combined. This figure grew 50% in 2010 and exports continue to grow steadily. Many of our sectors are organized in clusters, the strongest of which is the automotive cluster. In Nuevo León we produce about 24% of all auto parts in Mexico. Our administration's goal is to attract a full automotive assembly plant. Other core sectors include home appliances, electronics, metal mechanics, steel, glass, cement, and food and beverages. Software and ICT as well as health care are also increasingly important. Moreover, we are concentrating our marketing efforts on four emerging sectors: aerospace, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and energy.</p><h4>Siemens recently chose Nuevo León as the location of their first low-voltage research center in Latin America. What role do your universities play in attracting knowledge-based investments like this one?</h4><p>The federal and state governments are heavily focused on attracting R&amp;D. A company such as Siemens has found the right talent in the universities through agreements. For example, before students graduate they can undertake an internship with Siemens. This is part of a long-term program, because the company wants to hire people who will stay with it. It wants to have a long-term relationship with students and with academia. There are more than 80 R&amp;D centers that are located in Nuevo León. We also have the Research and Innovative Technology Park (PIIT), unique to Latin America, which was founded eight years ago and fully occupied within four years. We are currently on the second stage, aiming to expand the park and develop research incubators. Historically, we have attracted manufacturers, and we would also like to move toward a knowledge-based economy, focusing on R&amp;D and value-added for the market.</p><h4>How does Nuevo León's Secretariat of Economic Development help to attract and secure FDI?</h4><p>Our main mission in this office is to conduct marketing efforts to position Nuevo León as one of the most attractive places to do business in North America. We aim to create not only more jobs, but better jobs. What we do is create wealth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role are you playing in the refinancing of Mexico's state governments?<br></h4><p>Banorte has been active in government banking for many years. We have built comprehensive relationships with most state and local governments in Mexico throughout this time; relationships that have been far reaching and provide solutions to most of their financial needs. The recent refinancing of government debt by Banorte has been part of this client-led vision and an overall strategy to reengineer our clients' finances in order to provide them with the necessary liquidity to embark on infrastructure and social projects. The refinancing operations in which we have participated include the states of Coahuila, Sonora, Aguascalientes, Veracruz, and Quintana Roo, among others. As we continue to deploy this strategy in the future in order to help local governments achieve a sounder fiscal position, we will surely participate in the ongoing refinancing of state and municipal debt. In this respect, it is important to note that the leveraging level of local governments in Mexico is very low, representing less than 3% of GDP, a healthy level compared to most developed economies.  Nonetheless, the headlines of the recent refinancing activity by Mexican local governments have been negative because of the existing concerns regarding the debt problems of some European countries. People tend to extrapolate and think that the same thing is happening in Mexico, but this is far from the truth. If the Maastricht Criteria were applied to Mexico, I think the country would comply fully, and state and local governments would also achieve a high grade. In my opinion, the responsible use of leverage by local governments in Mexico in the future will certainly become a useful tool to promote local development, infrastructure and economic growth. I am certain that further leverage can be a catalyst for regional development. This is a huge window of opportunity and Banorte will continue to take advantage of it.</p><h4>How has your alliance with Generali allowed you to penetrate the retirement fund and insurance markets?</h4><p>It has been an outstanding partnership, producing many benefits for both companies. We have been able to expand our insurance and annuities business by taking advantage of Generali's expertise in that market. We have developed a portfolio of insurance brokers that has allowed us to expand our business with institutional clients, and recently we began operating our bancassurance model, providing our retail clients with a wide array of car, home, life and other types of insurance through our branch network.</p><h4>How did Banorte's acquisition of Inter National Bank (INB) in Texas fit in with your international expansion plans?</h4><p>The acquisition of INB six years ago was the first step in expanding Banorte's presence across other borders. At that time, we had high expectations of the growth prospects for cross-border banking services with that country. Unfortunately, the financial sector in the US struggled for many years after Lehman collapsed, and INB was no exception. The level of classified assets increased substantially, and we had to make important efforts to clean up the bank's balance sheet. Today, the bank is profitable once more and it is ready to reactivate its growth plans.</p><h4>What factors have contributed to Banorte's positive performance over the last two years?</h4><p>First is our business model and competitive franchise. Banorte is a relationship-oriented institution, not a transaction-oriented one, which means we cherish our clients and provide them with high-quality service so that they become recurring customers. Second, we have an outstanding team at Banorte that is very cohesive, works together, and never loses focus. The corporate culture and working environment at the bank is very pleasant and professional, and everyone is very knowledgeable and experienced.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Vector evolved since its establishment?</h4><p>Vector is a securities broker-dealer in Mexico. A Monterrey- based group of investors led by the entrepreneurship of Alfonso Romo acquired the company in 1987, changing the name to Vector. At the beginning Vector only had an office in Mexico City; then the management established the headquarters in Monterrey. During its first years the company was more oriented to investment banking activities servicing companies in Monterrey. Later, in 1996, the company started a process to develop a nationwide network in Mexico. Now, Vector is the largest independent broker-dealer in the country. By independent, we mean a company that is not part of any banking group, neither foreign nor Mexican. This is our strategy and we have defined that we want to keep it that way. We have developed a large network of branches in Mexico. Vector now has 21 branches in the largest cities of the country.</p><h4>What main services does Vector offer, and are there any areas in which you are planning to expand your services?</h4><p>We are specialized in investment portfolio management. Our customers are what we call high-net-worth (HNW) individuals, institutional investors, and corporations. In terms of services we also have a focus on investment banking activities related to mergers and acquisitions, corporate finance, and private equity. An additional segment in which we are working is mid-sized companies, as they are now suffering from a lack of credit. Mexico was affected by what happened in the credit markets worldwide, although the Mexican financial sector is in very good shape and well capitalized. For many years we have been developing very good platforms to offer our clients a wide range of investment alternatives. In 1993 we established a securities broker-dealer in New York, currently named VectorGlobal. The initial idea of this company was to offer our clients in Mexico a vehicle to invest in global markets by opening an account in the US. Our specialization is to advise our clients on how to invest in the global markets. Three years ago, with all our experience, we decided to go from being a local financial company to an international financial institution. As a first stage, VectorGlobal opened an office in Miami, which is the financial center for Latin America's private banking activities. The idea was to focus on Latin American clients, hiring experienced private bankers that had contacts with clients in Latin America. Then, as a second stage, VectorGlobal started opening offices in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. We have recently opened a new office in Geneva through our subsidiary VectorSuisse to offer our clients different investment platforms from Swiss banks. Furthermore, we are looking forward to extending our network into the Asian market, particularly in Singapore. Through this office we will be able to present our clients a new path to invest in this region of the globe. Additionally, we will be offering Latin American investment products and private equity projects to Asian institutional investors. Although we are just starting, the results of this internationalization strategy have been very encouraging; and now with our subsidiaries VectorGlobal and VectorSuisse, Vector has become the only Mexican global financial company with clients in more than 20 countries.</p><h4>What is Vector's competitive advantage?</h4><p>As we are totally focused on personalized advising, we provide tailor-made solutions and investment strategies for our clients. Because of this strong trait we can compete with the big financial institutions. Mexico has all of the large international players present in the country, and we can  compete because we operate with an extremely close relationship with clients. We provide high quality and fast execution. We have a solid platform and we are also very sound financially speaking, and very well capitalized, with practically no leverage. More than 90% of our revenues come from client operations, and proprietary trading is minimal; we want to be focused on our clients.</p><h4>What are your expectations regarding IPOs, and what does this signal about the Mexican market?</h4><p>Before 2009, IPOs were almost marginal. Now there has been a trend to increase that. The Certificate of Capital for Development (CKD) is a structure the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) developed to create a vehicle for Mexican private pension funds to invest in private equity in the country. Before that, it was not allowed. Private equity is a challenge. In Mexico, private equity represents 0.4% of GDP, which is very small. However, Mexico is in a very interesting condition right now. It has an excellent financial situation. Public debt and the trade deficit are especially low. We are in a good position to attract foreign investment and we are seeing many US companies interested. We see an attractive growth potential in the private equity market. Going back to IPOs, the big companies that are listed on the BMV have, in general, low leverage ratios, high operating margins, and are very well capitalized, and so they are in good condition and ready to carry out acquisitions. M&amp;A activity is going to increase and a way to finance acquisition is through the market. The demand is higher than the supply in terms of IPOs. Vector has participated in every IPO that has been done in Mexico for the last seven years. The BMV has 132 domestic companies listed plus 339 foreign companies, as well as 400 exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and in 2011 we saw 10 Mexican companies being listed. We feel we can grow this number.</p><h4>What are the major strengths and challenges of Mexico's capital markets?</h4><p>One strength Mexico has is the regulation and also the platform and infrastructure the stock market is based on. We have a very good platform, strong and reliable regulation, many brokers, and high demand. On the IPO side, regulation costs are relatively high, but there is also a lack of culture in understanding the advantages of being listed. The challenge is to convince Mexican business people of these benefits. A positive development in the capital markets in Mexico is that investors are more globally oriented, and we can build portfolios with a global vision. We can take advantage of the volatility in the markets and the economic trends and strengths of some countries, for example Chile and Colombia, which are doing very well, or Peru, where there are opportunities to be part of that growth process.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of the brokerage industry and for Mexico's capital markets?</h4><p>The financial sector is very strong. It is continuously evolving in terms of new products, new structures, and new ways to finance and provide equity and debt to companies. The future in Mexico is really optimistic. In the case of institutional investors, we have to provide significantly improved platforms because they are becoming more sophisticated every day. They participate in international markets, they are very active in trading activities, and they are not just passive investors. It is a sector that continues to grow. In terms of individual investors, just 200,000 have an account with a brokerage firm. This is a small number considering that Mexico has a population of 110 million. There are a lot of people who invest in certificates of deposit and fixed-income products. The challenge is to convince them they are losing money that way. They don't want risk. First, we need more companies and more alternatives to invest, and then we have to democratize the access of individual investors and smaller companies to the capital markets. Globalization is also taking place in financial transactions, and we have to take advantage of that. Mexico is on the right path to achieve this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define MAPFRE's position in the Mexican insurance market?<br></h4><p>MAPFRE has experienced an annual growth rate above the average in the Mexican market thanks to its wide presence across the country, its innovative products, and superb business model. We are also constantly on the look out for new distribution channels enabling us to reach other segments of the population.</p><h4>What products are most in demand?</h4><p>Without any doubt, despite the absence of mandatory civil liability insurance for third-party damage as a result of traffic accidents, car insurance continues to be the most requested product in the market. However, we consider that when civil liability insurance for third-party damage becomes mandatory, the market share of this insurance line will increase and contribute to the growing financing culture of the population. Likewise, industrial risk insurance is requested by major corporations. Other popular policies include health and, of course, micro-insurance; however, there is still a lot to be done in that regard.</p><h4>What are your strategies to increasing the presence of MAPFRE products in the market?</h4><p>The first strategy is geographical expansion. MAPFRE has actively worked since the beginning of its operations in Mexico on its geographical expansion project to make its insurance products and services available to most of the population. MAPFRE currently has 400 offices strategically distributed around the country, mainly based on demographic, social, economic, and commercial development criteria. Regarding the permanent innovation of our product lines, we have developed important strategies such as designing and distributing low-cost insurance products—or “micro-insurances"—to promote low-income individuals' access to insurance. Furthermore, we want to introduce standardized basic products aimed at meeting the specific insurance needs of people against death, accidents, diseases, and civil liability in the automotive field. We work to encourage ongoing innovation in order to offer the best insurance products with a great variety of coverage at flexible rates tailored to the individual. We are also looking to expand our distribution channels through the internet, telephone marketing, microfinance companies, and department and self-service stores.</p><h4>What are the challenges in the insurance market?</h4><p>From our point of view, the main challenges that the Mexican insurance sector faces include the limited development of the sector, security issues, which have caused a 72% increase in car theft since 2006, natural disasters, and the implementation of the Solvency II scheme for the Mexican insurance sector, the enforcement of which is foreseen in 2014 based on risk control and the establishment of efficient corporate governance.</p><p>Other issues include the lack of mandatory insurance covering civil liability for damage caused to third parties, namely injury and damage to property as a result of traffic accidents, the need for comprehensive tax reform, and the necessity to modify labor legislation.</p><h4>What are some of the main changes the insurance market should expect going forward?</h4><p>The main changes the insurance industry will undergo include the introduction of mandatory civil liability insurance for automotive vehicles at a national rather than just a local level, amendments to the Federal Labor Law specifically affecting insurance institutions that consider insurance agents as employees of the companies for which they perform brokerage work without considering that such activity is independent, and the incorporation of a consortium or execution of an agreement with an international body providing stability in times of natural disaster. Furthermore, we foresee a reduction in security issues. There is no doubt whatsoever of the social function that insurance performs in any economy, although the specific effect is greater in developing countries, and the immediate and tangible benefits it offers are more obvious.</p><h4>What characteristics distinguish the Mexican insurance market from its neighbors in Latin America?</h4><p>Mexico, along with Brazil, is one of the 15 most important economies in the world, hence the country has very high development potential in all spheres, especially in insurance. Mexico is a leader in the region and it represents an excellent platform to position a company in the international marketplace. That is why most of the greatest European and American insurance companies are present in Mexico, holding leading positions in the sales rankings. The value of insurance premiums in Mexico does not exceed 2% of GDP, while the average in the region is 2.7%. Mexico does not have mandatory civil liability insurance for third-party damage resulting from car accidents. Our market is characterized by first-level regulation and a low insurance penetration rate.</p><h4>How do you expect the insurance sector's contribution to GDP to develop?</h4><p>The Mexican insurance market is characterized by its low level of development, and this is caused by the lack of instruments or a suitable means for enabling the promotion of an insurance culture, the presence of would greatly increase penetration rates. Furthermore, only 4.5% of houses are insured, at least against fire. Major medical expense insurance covers only 5.8% of the population, provided the individual agreements represent only 2% of the total population, and 7.2 million people have a life insurance policy, provided the individual agreements represent 12.8% of the active population, and automobile insurance only covers 26.5% of all the cars on the road. In view of such a situation at the domestic level, MAPFRE has enthusiastically bet—considering it an opportunity—on the implementation of different strategies aimed at covering the deficiencies of the market with the intention to cover the needs and interests of many different segments of the population.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What initiatives has the Secretariat of Energy undertaken to increase long-term investment in deepwater exploration operations?<br></h4><p>With the objective of increasing long-term investment to take full advantage of deepwater reserves, there has been a push in our hydrocarbon exploration policy. In the last few years, investment in the exploration and production of Mexican oil has reached historic levels. Investment in PEMEX's exploration decreased more than 3% from 1990 to 2000, whilst between 2001 and 2012 it had a real growth of almost 5.4 fold. Additionally, the 2008 Energy Reform opened the door to new contracts, which together with the integral services on offer, are a fundamental part of the federal government's strategy to promote investment. PEMEX and its subsidiary organisms' business plan for the 2012-2016 period defines in detail the strategies and objectives of exploration and exploitation. Regarding deepwater reserves, the plan foresees an increase in investment of approximately 9% per year over the 2012-2026 period. Amongst the main initiatives that are being contemplated are projects in the south of the Mexican Gulf. We are looking to conclude exploration activity and start developing the Holok Poniente gas basin. We are also looking to acquire and process 3D seismic information in areas where there is a lack of data of the right quality.</p><h4>In your opinion, what are the strengths of the Mexican energy sector?</h4><p>Mexico is blessed with abundant natural resources. We have important hydrocarbon reserves to the equivalent of 43.1 billion barrels of crude oil and great potential in renewable energy. For example, our country stands out as having one of the highest averages for solar radiation annually—approximately 5.2 kWh per hour per square meter every day. This is a great combination because fossil resources contribute to the financing of the energy transition toward cleaner production and more efficient energy consumption. In addition, referring to so-called transition fuel, or natural gas, Mexico has important potential resources, since, according to the US Department of Energy, the country ranks fourth worldwide for prospective shale gas reserves, with 681 trillion cubic feet technically retrievable. These natural resources, together with the responsible strategy and long-term vision that the federal government has implemented, makes the Mexican energy sector not only strong, but an engine for the development of the country. In terms of strategy, our approach is comprehensive and covers each of the sub-sectors so we can maximize their potential. For instance, we have invested Ps1.2 billion to strengthen the hydrocarbon subsector. Also, during the current administration, there has been a drive without precedence in the development of clean energy sources. This has been achieved through the participation of both the public and private sector due to regulations that give more certainty and transparency to investors. It is worth mentioning that the use of renewable energy sources translates into important economic benefits. Additionally, their use allows for the diversification of the energy mix while reducing greenhouse emissions. Another contribution of the 2008 Energy Reform was the implementation of  three funds to drive the green agenda. The objective of the funds is to boost applied scientific research, such as the adoption, innovation, assimilation, and technological development of hydrocarbon reserves, renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, clean technology, and the diversification of primary energy sources.</p><h4>How is the private sector contributing to Mexico's energy generation capacity?</h4><p>Since the inauguration of Mérida III, the first generation plant under the independent power producer (IPP) scheme, the benefits of private participation have become obvious. Since then, the energy sector's structure has revamped so that the country can benefit from its hydrocarbon reserves without compromising its interests. The main advantages of private participation in power generation is cost reduction, because the official agents compete through Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) public tenders and then compete for energy clearance. This participation also translates into better technologies, which, increase operational efficiency while reducing risk. It is important not to forget that when building power generation plants for renewable energy sources, the energy mix diversifies and the energy security of the country increases. Also, the introduction of better technologies in the country arouses innovation, diffusion, and technology adoption throughout the productive chain. This, without a doubt, generates economic benefits for the country.</p><h4>What impact has the 2008 Energy Reform had on the energy sector, and what measures should be taken to improve competitiveness in the sector?</h4><p>The collection of reforms and new laws that constitute the energy reform plan were the first step in a process that has the objective of transforming the hydrocarbon sector, strengthening PEMEX, and promoting energy security in a sustainable way. The reform has had a significant impact on the energy sector's structure with relevant results, such as the strengthening of PEMEX's corporate governance through the inclusion of four board members who will be ratified by congress. Other positive results for PEMEX include the reinforcement of control mechanisms and vigilance, as well as the creation of the Transparency and Accountability Committee. PEMEX's new fiscal regime also allows it to carry out exploration—the most complex and costly of its operations—with profitability both onshore and offshore. Furthermore, the 2008 reform allows more budget flexibility. Today, there are a series of far-reaching measures to incorporate national providers and contractors into PEMEX's operations. Also, the creation of work and service contracts allows us to go for more complex and long-term projects, maintaining our commitment to the nation over hydrocarbons. The reform has resulted in clear growth in the hydrocarbon sector. For the third consecutive year, in 2011, we restored more than 100% of the total proven reserves, for which we are replacing nine of every 10 barrels. On the other hand, the first integral contracts of services for exploration and production (E&amp;P) have been put to tender in three mature fields in the southern region: Santuario, Carrizo, and Magallanes. Also, in the Gulf of Mexico, PEMEX has incorporated three times more reserves than Exxon over the last year. However, there are still important challenges, since the implementation of these reforms requires the strengthening of institutions and organisms.</p><h4>Shale gas is gaining greater attention in North America and Europe. What opportunities does Mexico have in this regard?</h4><p>Shale gas has the potential to transform the energy landscape of the country. PEMEX has estimated that shale gas resources could potentially reach 459 trillion cubic feet. It is estimated that national natural gas production, without including shale gas, will increase by an average of 0.5% annually for the next 15 years, whilst demand will increase around 2.5% per year. If we develop an integral strategy for shale gas, imports could be reduced, strengthening energy security in our country and reducing exterior energy dependence. Additionally, the exploitation of shale gas could attract between $7 billion and $10 billion of annual investment while generating around 1.3 million jobs directly and indirectly.</p><h4>In what ways is the Secretariat of Energy working to minimize the negative effects that operations in the oil sector could cause in the environment?</h4><p>During this administration the Secretariat of Energy has put special emphasis on projects and activities that promote the reduction of CO2 emissions, energy efficiency, and the use of clean development mechanisms. Also, incentives for activities that protect the environment, like the best use of water in industrial processes, are on offer. As a result of mitigation efforts between 2009 and 2010, PEMEX reduced its CO2 emissions from 50.2 million tons to 45.5 million tons. For 2011 it is expected to achieve an additional reduction of 3.8 million tons of CO2. It worth pointing out that PEMEX lies within a comprehensive management system that looks at industrial security and environmental protection as the main drivers in its activities.</p><h4>The CFE is currently producing 89% of the country's domestic electricity supply. How do you see the sector evolving?</h4><p>The Mexican power generation sector has a unique buying model in which the CFE acquires the surplus of external energy producers. Article 27 of the Constitution establishes that only the state can generate, drive, transform, distribute, and supply electricity for public use. In this sense, the CFE is the only entity that can carry out this service. However, following reforms to the public electricity service law in 1992, the participation of individuals in the electricity generation sector is allowed for self consumption as an independent energy producer, or for activities that are deemed for self-sufficiency, cogeneration, and small production, as well as import and export. As of November 2011, the external energy producers supplied 32.1% of total CFE generation. These percentages reflect the development of efficient mechanisms of electricity production, giving way to combined-cycle technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors are leading to increases in overall production?<br></h4><p>A very important step toward increasing PEMEX's production is the operation of new exploration and production (E&amp;P) integral contracts. The first bidding round has concluded, and there has been a lot of interest from potential bidders for the second round for the Southern Region. The companies that won the first bidding round are already working and are now forecasting an increase in production. Another important factor has been the development of the Ku Maloob Zaap Field, which is producing around 850,000 barrels per day (bbl/d). As for the future, we are confident that we will be able to continue to improve production at the Chicontepec Field, so that in the short term we'll be able to extract around 80,000 bbl/d.</p><h4>What annual level of investment will Pemex maintain during the next five years to finance upstream operations?</h4><p>During President Calderón's term, there has been an historical investment in PEMEX. We have built new platforms, such as the Centenario and Bicentenario, and we have continued with the reconfiguration of other assets such as the Minatitlán Refinery. We are also advancing according to plan on the construction of a new refinery in Tula. We have invested more than ever before. As a result, we have achieved the stabilization of our oil production at around 2.6 million bbl/d. In 2012, PEMEX will invest Ps249.15 billion ($19.84 billion) in the exploration, production, and development of Mexico's hydrocarbon fields. This means that we will be investing 2.8% more than in 2011. We are fully engaged in downstream development and are envisioning that we will achieve the energy independence that the country needs in the medium term. Around the world, the refining business is going through a difficult phase. In other parts of the world, several refineries have closed or are planning to close. To avoid such a dramatic outcome, we have been taking the right steps to achieve the more efficient production of gasoline.</p><h4>What is on PEMEX's agenda with regard to deepwater exploration and production?</h4><p>We are planning to develop three deep-water wells in the Perdido area in 2012: Trion, Supremos, and Maximino. For the development of these wells, we are estimating an investment of between $600 million and $800 million, or about $150 million to $200 million per well. With these projects, PEMEX will become the second most important oil company with drilling equipment in the Gulf of Mexico. We will continue with our deepwater exploration operations, and we will do so in compliance with the regulatory framework in place and with a particular emphasis on safety and environmental protection. In this regard, we have established measures that will strengthen our procedures and guarantee that the operations will take place in the safest possible way.</p><h4>How is PEMEX leveraging technology and infrastructure to minimize any negative impacts on the environment?</h4><p>We have been making our refineries more efficient and we are investing in the reconfiguration and construction of new refineries. We recently finished the reconfiguration of the Minatitlán Refinery, which is a new project in view of the technological improvements that we have developed. We have also taken a leap forward by investing in the reconfiguration of the Salamanca Refinery, and, moreover, we have started the construction of a new refinery in Tula, Hidalgo. We are confident that these steps will help reduce the gap between national consumption and production. One of the top priorities of the company is to operate in a safe and sustainable manner. In this respect, our Safety Health and Environmental Protection System (SSPA) has yielded very good results in recent years and has been key in curbing accidents. For example, we have been able to keep the index of accident frequency at 0.42 accidents per million work hours, the lowest in the history of the company, and lower than the international benchmark of 0.5. Also, in 2010, we achieved a reduction of 22.1% in the emission of polluting agents to the atmosphere, a 0.5% reduction in the use of crude water, and a 21% reduction in our inventory of hazardous materials. With regards to CO2, we have also had very encouraging results. During 2010, we were able to reduce our emissions by 4.8 million tons. To put this in perspective, this is the equivalent of taking 1 million cars off the road. Finally, we continue to support biodiversity conservation programs in places as diverse as the Lancandona rainforest in Chiapas, the Jaguaroundi natural reserve in Veracruz, the Centla Marshes, as well as ecosystems in Alvadaro, Tuxpan, and Tampamachoco. These are the figures for 2010. The figures for 2011 will be available shortly.</p><h4>What major challenges does the Chicontepec Field present?</h4><p>The development of the Chicontepec Field is going through a very strong phase. In January of 2012 we achieved an average production of 63,000 bbl/d, and also accomplished a historical maximum of 65,300 barrels in one day. This is the result of technological innovations and initiatives targeted to reduce costs, as well as the implementation of better operating practices. It is well known that Chicontepec is a very challenging field from a technical perspective. That is why we have installed field laboratories in different locations in order to grasp a better sense of the oil pockets and develop them accordingly. The new exploitation models used in “Presidente Alemán," for example, have yielded very positive results. This well has been subject to many technical innovations that have determined its success. It was designed to be drilled horizontally, and therefore have better contact with the productive sands, and, with this, an increased flow of oil. I think our biggest challenge at Chicontepec is finding the right technologies to increase the recovery rate from hydrocarbon pockets. I am confident that with work now in progress and the different laboratories throughout the region, we will be able to find the best techniques to make the most of this very important field.</p><h4>In your view, what role can foreign investment and expertise play in the development of Mexico's offshore oil assets?</h4><p>The oil industry is one in which learning from other experiences and collaborating in challenging projects is vital. That's why, in April 2008, President Calderón presented an energy reform proposal that was widely discussed and later approved by Congress. The reform included important changes to the legal framework of the industry and strengthened PEMEX's corporate governance, granting it greater flexibility to determine its internal structure, and provide a specific contractual scheme to face upcoming challenges. This regime is now part of the new PEMEX Law. A fundamental part of the reform was the approval of integral contracts for E&amp;P activities. These contracts seek to expand and strengthen the operations of PEMEX through a competitive model that opens the door for new areas of collaboration between PEMEX and the national and international players of the oil industry. Through this new contractual scheme, we will be able to complement PEMEX's efforts to reactivate mature fields and develop complex projects. The first bidding round for the reactivation of mature fields was very successful. The second round is currently underway and we expect it to be as successful as the first one. Another important area for collaboration is in deep-water activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The exploitation of hydrocarbons in the Gulf is a great opportunity for PEMEX and for Mexico. We have estimated that from a total of 54 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of prospective resources in the country, at least 30 billion are in deepwater fields. We are confident that these projects will also open the door for greater collaboration opportunities with other players in the industry.</p><h4>What substantial results has the 2008 legislative reform package produced in the energy sector?</h4><p>In November of 2008 several new laws were decreed, including the new Law for Petróleos Mexicanos, the Law on Renewable Energies, and the Law for the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH). These new regulations gave more strength to the Secretariat of Energy in its role of defining the country's energy policy, and also created the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) to regulate and supervise the exploitation and extraction of hydrocarbons. The reforms also gave PEMEX greater independence with regards to its organization and decision-making processes as well as budget management. The reform also included a transformation of our tax regime that allows us, in the present day, to exploit the most complex and costly oilfields on land and deep water in a more profitable way. We also established new schemes to promote national contractors and suppliers. The 2008 reform was very beneficial for the company's development. Nevertheless, there are still many efforts to be made in order to take advantage of the great opportunities that the oil industry offers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Competitive Approach]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[competitive-approach]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4></h4><h4>GDF SUEZ has a presence in 70 countries. How important is Mexico for the company?</h4><p>It is very important. For us, Mexico is considered a part of the emerging markets, with attractive potential, and it is clearly a country where we want to consolidate and grow our position. As part of North America, Mexico offers the highest potential for growth in the energy sector compared to the US and Canada. In February 2012 the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) announced its need to increase power capacity by 37,000 MW, which means 70% growth in the next 15 years. Natural gas will compose 60% of the fuel mix used in generation. As such, ensuring natural gas availability and sufficient gas infrastructure to transport this gas will be crucial for CFE in the years to come. For GDF SUEZ Mexico, this represents both a big challenge and a big opportunity to add value to the market. Our group is currently the number one independent power produced in the world. Originally, we started operations in the Mexican market offering our services in natural gas distribution. Then we expanded our business to power cogeneration and natural gas transmission. Now we want to offer integrated energy solutions to our clients, and I believe we are in a truly unique position to do so. Mexico will definitely need to invest in its energy future, developing infrastructure that enables the kind of growth a country this size requires. The tenders we secure in power and gas pipelines in the coming years will provide GDF SUEZ with work for the next five or 10 years. Our main strategy is to stay committed to Mexico and to try to participate in all of the opportunities that the energy sector presents to us. We want to have an energy-based portfolio that reflects the standards of the group. We will reinforce our activities in gas transportation and distribution and attempt to expand our presence in power, as the opportunities available in the Mexican market are massive. We are here to take advantage of our size and dedicate large volumes of our investments to transmission projects across Mexico, which is key to the energy infrastructure of the country.<br></p><h4>GDF SUEZ is the leading private company in gas transmission in Mexico. To what do you attribute your success?</h4><p>The development of our activities is a reflection of the main groups' capabilities to handle people, time, money, and knowledge, and the ability to bring these factors to the market in Mexico. We are dedicated to being open to the private sector and investors. By combining GDF and SUEZ we won six bids out of 15 or 20 projects in Mexico. We wanted to balance our risk portfolio in Mexico, and consequently we invested in transmission. After the merger, we engaged in more power-directed activities. We have maintained a leading position the entire time.</p><h4>What are the main challenges to promote the use of natural gas in the local market?</h4><p>Ironically, the first natural gas transmission in infrastructure in Mexico was designed 25 years ago, mainly to export natural gas to the US. PEMEX's exploratory efforts have always been targeted toward oil, and natural gas was secondary. With Cantarell's oil field discovery, associated natural gas became available at a time when local demand was very low, and so exporting it to the US was logical. With the exception of Monterrey, which has been using natural gas for residential and industrial reasons for more than 50 years, industries around the country started to discover natural gas was an economic and valuable energy option, and Mexico became an important market. In 1994, the authorities decided to expand its use. Presently, a lot of industries that have been using alternative energy types are now trying to switch to natural gas. Historically, the market trend has been broken. For the first time in history, the price of natural gas is more and more disconnected from oil. Now, Mexico's market could switch from being an importer to an exporter, because US reserves will last for up to 100 years, and Mexico is the fourth country in the world in terms of shale gas reserves. We can benefit from the cheapest natural gas prices around the world. The strategy of our infrastructure has radically changed, and now everything is focused on pipes and infrastructure—how to move natural gas from the US to Mexico. As natural gas enjoys secure, low-cost, steady prices, local consumers such as the CFE have moved to a long-term strategy. The CFE has decided that more than 60% of power production will be based on natural gas. If you combine the different factors, such as availability, sustainability, security, competitive transportation methods, the implementation of natural gas in the chemical or agricultural sectors, and the potential to convert old power plants from heavy fuel to natural gas, the need for natural gas is strong, and the future is bright. Mexico has a favorable environment, but the change may take years.</p><h4>What role can the private and public sectors play in the development of infrastructure for natural gas distribution in Mexico?</h4><p>Today, there are two main players that could establish the framework for private investment in natural gas transmission: PEMEX and the CFE. The market is not mature enough, based on the demand of industrial customers who could invest in a large-scale pipeline. In terms of return on investment, to reach a certain level you have to be patient. For the past 15 years, the CFE has promoted private investment in transmission and LNG terminals. Both state-owned companies are playing a new role in promotion, and that is a good thing. At a presentation, the CFE announced its intention to convert its power plants to use natural gas. All of this is based on kilometers and kilometers of new pipelines. PEMEX is also promoting a new pipeline from southeast Texas to Mexico. The main players in Mexico's energy sector are involved. If there is natural gas available in the area, industrial managers will choose areas to build new plants. We have witnessed this already in the center of Mexico, in which US and Japanese automakers have switched to natural gas where we have built a pipeline. Nissan built a $1.2 billion plant where energy is available, in Aguascalientes. This movement will consolidate the competitiveness that Mexico has gained against China, especially in the last three years. Add this to the low cost of production and proximity to the US, and it means that this shift will be a good one for the Mexican economy.</p><h4>What does Mexico offer potential investors in the energy sector?</h4><p>If you combine the size of the market, the level of education, the structure of the population, and the business environment, it's clear that Mexico is going to be in the top 10 largest economies in the next 40 years. It's likely that we could be ahead of Spain, Italy, and even France. In the long term, everyone expects Mexico's potential to be something like that of Brazil. In terms of the macroeconomic approach, Mexico has one of the highest potentials in the world. Consumption per capita is very low, and there is a strong correlation between GDP and electricity. As GDP grows, electricity per capita also grows in emerging countries. Projects relating to energy and environment are within GDF SUEZ's portfolio, and match the needs of the country. We have long-term perspectives, and a huge growth potential in business that the country can sustain.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[windows-of-opportunity]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the main focus of your growth strategy over the last five years?</h4><p>We have focused both on consumers and companies, as a national bank that follows a universal model. Our bank provides a variety of financial services to our customers, becoming a one-stop shop where they can obtain insurance, pension funds, consumer financing, corporate loans, and much more. We like to see ourselves growing steadily in all of our business segments. Over the past few years, we have emphasized personal loans and payroll loans, which have increased significantly. With mortgages, we have followed a strategy different from many of our competitors. We have grown through a program called Infonavit Total Credit, which was formed by a partnership with the government housing authority in order to discount payments for loans according to payroll. This risk profile is different from other mortgage loans. Consequently, we have been able to provide 25% of the mortgage loans issued by the banking sector. Another important point is that we provide financing for our corporate customers. To do that, we use our balance sheet or the market. We have seen important windows of opportunity for our clients to issue debt on the market, and we were able to provide financing of about $23 billion in 2011, largely through placements on the market. We have consistently been ranked as number one in terms of the placement of local debt.</p><h4>Which activities, sectors, and trends are driving demand in lending?</h4><p>Our bank provides financing in every segment, including energy, power, and technology. It would be difficult to say that there has been one area lagging behind. For example, telecommunications has been very active, and although our bank has not been heavily involved in housing development financing, we have made progress when compared to other institutions.</p><div class="quote">“The possibility of using mobile phones to do banking is the most important strategy."</div><h4>SMEs account for more than 5 million companies in Mexico. What do they represent for your lending portfolio?</h4><p>The SME segment is relatively small, but the growth has been significant. We have grown 17% in SME lending. I firmly believe that we have found the right model to continue this growth pattern.</p><h4>In terms of credit supply, which sectors of the economy are you more active in?</h4><p>We have been very active in many sectors, but most recently we have been involved in financing petrochemical operations. Another segment we are working in is channeling the supply of financing, which is comprised of suppliers in various governmental agencies. We are working to be more active in infrastructure, which has slowly picked up. We have been pioneers in infrastructure financing, in some cases in partnership with Mexican development banks.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Banamex's financial performance in 2011?</h4><p>It was a great year for the franchise. In consumer credit, we consistently registered the highest indications of growth. On the other hand, 2011 was a difficult year for many markets. We are probably the most important market maker in Mexico, which leaves us relatively exposed to the movements of the economy. However, we consistently do very well, and although last year was a more difficult year, our performance was excellent in terms of our financial strength and capitalization levels. This was the first time that the market was not moving in line with the strong fundamentals of the Mexican economy, but we remain the strongest bank among the competition in Mexico.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of electronic banking in Mexico?</h4><p>Online banking has been growing more rapidly than other transactions in terms of access over the past few years. We believe that the most important change will happen with the product that we are about to launch, the electronic wallet. This product is more than online banking; it offers the ability to use a mobile phone to make payments and transfers between users. The electronic wallet is also an important tool for financial inclusion in Mexico, which is why we enhanced our partnership with América Móvil. Now, customers can transfer an amount directly to anyone's telephone, which functions as the user's banking account number. Mexico continues to be an economy that is very intensive in the use of cash, but payment methods will change significantly with the introduction of our product. This may be the most important development in terms of the way we do banking, not only in Mexico but also in Latin America.</p><h4>What is your strategy for banking the “unbanked"?</h4><p>The possibility of using mobile phones to do banking is the most important strategy. The other is growing our correspondent network. We are in the process of closing a deal with an important chain of convenience stores, creating an additional 10,000 sales points. With this alliance, we can grow to 14,000 locations in villages or small towns where there are no banks of any kind.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the banking sector in Mexico in the medium term?</h4><p>We were well prepared for the world financial crisis in terms of having the adequate regulatory framework. In any event, the banking system is very well capitalized, with a 50% average of core capital. The system is also well reserved, and the authorities have made adequate risk decisions in terms of exposure. We are prepared to adopt Basel III, which is unusual for the banking system of a country. The Mexican banking system is strong; bearing in mind the behavior of the sector before the crisis, it has been growing steadily in terms of assets, at a double-digit rate in a sustainable way. If we link this trend with the emergence of the middle class in Mexico, I would say that we expect to continue registering adequate growth rates for the economy. We expect that the growth of the banking system will continue to be three or four times more than the growth of the economy, which also means higher penetration. One of the important advantages is that we have had microfinancial stability, which is necessary when growing portfolios such as mortgage loans. It is difficult for customers to take out a long-term loan at a variable rate as was done in the past. Having good prospects of economic growth will spark increased penetration of the banking system, more growth, and the development of new financial products and innovations as well as new ways to provide cheaper financial services to the middle classes and emerging markets.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since you were appointed in January 2012, how would you assess your first months in the position and what strategies are you seeking to implement?</h4><p>The year started rather slowly due to the electoral process the country was going through. Nevertheless, the economy is very active and decisively expanding, and I personally believe that this will be a very positive year at all levels. We at Mapfre BHD are very pleased with the results of 1H2012, because we have grown in every field, including market share, premiums, and market penetration. The insurance market currently offers plenty of opportunities, and it will offer even more in the near future. In terms of the strategies I want to implement at Mapfre BHD, I would like to focus on training. We currently have 298 highly skilled and professional employees and it is vital to offer them the right tools to improve and sharpen their skills, so that when new opportunities come up, they are ready to take on the challenge. In this regard, we have already established our own training center, which has started offering courses to our employees.</p><h4>How has the insurance market evolved in the Dominican Republic over the last few years?</h4><p>The insurance market in this country has grown considerably in the last few years and continues to grow as we speak. The market is expected to rise by 12% in 2012, whereas estimates for the expansion of the national economy are at about 6%. The reason why we see this trend is because there are many niche markets where the sector can expand and expenditures per capita and the percentage of the insurance sector in terms of national GDP are still low. Therefore, there is a lot of room to grow. In the corporate sector there is an insurance culture already and today there is a price war. However, the SMEs segment will be a key market in the near future. Also, the life insurance segment is expected to show the fastest growth rates in this country.</p><div class="quote">“The level of insurance awareness will expand among middle-class Dominicans."</div><h4>What market factors led to the establishment of Mapfre in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic has always been a strategic market in which Mapfre has aimed to expand its business activities. The beginning was tough, but after two years in the country we had the chance to establish a partnership with BHD Group, a key player in the insurance sector. This partner company has a broad knowledge of the sector and an excellent reputation among customers. Therefore, the merger with BHD Group was a beneficial step for both companies, because we contributed with new technology as well as international systems and standards. Back then, the growth potential that the sector offered over the medium to long term was the main market factor that encouraged us to set up operations in the country.</p><h4>What is Mapfre's current market share and what are you aiming for over the next few years?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is a very competitive market with several strong players in the sector. We calculated the market share of the premiums collected by each company and in May 2012 Mapfre was the second biggest company in the market, with a 16.1% market share. Regarding our future aspirations, Mapfre always aims to lead the market, bearing in mind our customers and competitors. By leading the market, we mean being the leading company in terms of services, quality, and innovation.</p><h4>Which areas would you consider the most advantageous for your business?</h4><p>Today, the corporate segment of the market is the most important area, not only for Mapfre, but also for all companies involved in this sector. In this regard, we are very strong in the hospitality sector.  In terms of future perspectives, I believe that the market has yet to fully develop in areas such as civil liabilities, life, and car insurance. Corporate business and property insurance are today's main products in the market.</p><h4>How do you assess the current state and prospects of the insurance market in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We still need to work on raising awareness among Dominican citizens. As long as the economy keeps growing, the level of insurance awareness will expand among middle-class Dominicans. At the same time, I think we need to adapt our services to their needs and status, as well as to come up with new marketing systems that will enable us to be closer to our customers. Nevertheless, there is still a long road ahead, especially concerning individual products and micro insurance.</p><h4>Are online and low-cost products the future of the Dominican insurance market?</h4><p>I would not go as far as to say that these two elements are the future of the market, because I believe the future is as wide as you want to see it. I think our first priority is to make insurance products accessible to a wide range of citizens, get closer to customers through different channels, and expand business activities in as many niche markets as possible. Insurance companies have to adapt their products and their systems to the customers.</p><h4>What regulatory measures should be taken for the sector to improve further?</h4><p>In my opinion, I would like to see greater transparency of data and more coordination. I am aware that the authorities are already working on a new insurance law that hopefully will support transparency and coordination. It is a much-needed change for our insurance sector.</p><h4>What are the future targets of Mapfre BHD?</h4><p>The Dominican market is highly concentrated; the top five companies in the sector own around 80% of the market, and the top three about 60%. Therefore, we aim to grow our product portfolio, our marketing channels, and expand our office network across the entire country, which currently stands at 11 offices.</p><h4>What role does the Dominican Republic play in Mapfre's regional strategy?</h4><p>There are 18 different countries in Mapfre America, and the Dominican Republic is somewhere in the middle; we are still a young company in a rather small market. However, the future perspectives are very bright and we are the second most important market in the Caribbean after Puerto Rico.</p><h4>Is Mapfre BHD planning to launch any new products into the market in 2012?</h4><p>We will launch new products for condominiums and microbusinesses, as well as upgrade our marketing channels as part of the innovation process.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the impact of the eurozone crisis on the Mozambican financial sector?</h4><p>Mozambique has grown over the last 10 years, without much exposure to the international financial market, so the crisis has had an ambiguous effect. Most of the banks operating in this country are domestic institutions working for the local economy. For that reason, our banks have not been directly exposed to the toxic assets produced by the international crisis. This is a very small economy, and the local banks are mainly dimensioned to local economy. There are some investors who are more conservative about investing here, but there are new opportunities in oil and gas, infrastructure, and coal. We are seeing new international players with an appetite for investment in this country. In this regard, Mozambique is one of the countries that have enjoyed significant benefits in the wake of the international crisis.</p><h4>Unlike other banks in the sector, Banco íšnico was set up by private investors. What other features make it unique in the local financial system?</h4><p>Banco íšnico was the result of a dream. I have worked in this market for around 14 years, managing classic banks such as Standard Totta (Standard Bank, today) and Millennium bim. One decade later, I realized that there was a distinct market opportunity. The two main banks occupy around 60% of the market, and the four largest banks have 87%. Between 12% and 15% of the population is banked; it is a very small market with huge growth potential. It was obvious to me that there was an opportunity to do something different from the other banks and capture a share of the existing and future potential market. Most of the banks that had arrived were playing by the same principles: they sell products, they offer services, and they try to survive. We saw a lack of banks with a different kind of culture that would include improved services and better relationships. Banco íšnico wanted to create a close and intricate relationship with its customers. We are building a model in which we aim to understand our customers' businesses and devise solutions for them. Therefore, the bank is not just selling products and services, but also finding solutions. Our branches are innovative and reflect a strong client orientation. More than transactional spaces, they are designed to receive clients and to make them feel welcome. Our branch layouts are different from what is common in the sector, with a fresh and vibrant color palette and comfortable private lounges fitted with interactive equipment where clients can keep abreast of daily news and explore the bank's product and service offering, supported by a highly trained team well prepared to receive and service clients in a unique, welcoming manner.</p><div class="quote">“This is a small market and the existing banks are still reacting to new entrants."</div><h4>What is your strategy to reach your target market?</h4><p>Our initial strategy was to reach one particular segment of the market; we didn't want to target the whole market at once. We have a branch network of 11 branches covering the five main cities of the country and we are planning to open three more branches by the end of 2012. We are targeting a segment that values a personalized, distinct, and high-quality service. Most of our business comes from corporate clients, though we also serve SMEs and individuals. In Mozambique, 80% of the people live in the countryside, so 11 branches cannot cover the entire population. However, we cannot forget those people, and we are looking for ways to reach out to rural communities.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the bank's performance since September 2011?</h4><p>This is a small market and the existing banks are still reacting to new entrants. Regardless, the banks are doing well and different monetary policies have been implemented. In 2012, a new restrictive policy made some aspects of business difficult for the banks. The banks are expanding their number of branches, but not their asset value—supporting economic growth with room for improvement. In terms of our strategy, we are doing very well. In just 11 months we have opened 11 branches, covering the five main cities, and have already captured a 2% market share, which demonstrates that the market has been accepting our value proposition. In a very concentrated market, 2% is a lot. As a signal of confidence our shareholders increased the bank's share capital, for the second time, making a total of $60 million.</p><h4>Where is the bank looking for investment opportunities?</h4><p>The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is a region with 300 million consumers, so nothing happens in this country that isn't related to the SADC. One of the main sectors of the economy is agribusiness. Considering our neighboring countries, many investors are making inquires about potential customers, products, and sales. I always suggest that they must view this country as a platform with 23 million people from where they can produce and work with the surrounding markets.</p><h4>Which sector would say has the most potential for growth, apart from the mining sector?</h4><p>In an emerging economy, every sector is important. Agriculture is a sector we have to take into consideration, as 80% of the population lives in rural areas. The industrial sector is also very important, due, in part, to the SADC countries' proximity. There is also potential for tourism in this country, as it has an incredible 2,800 kilometers of coastline. The tourism opportunities are fantastic, as are those in communications, transport, and infrastructure. In the financial sector, insurance companies are attractive as part of the emerging global economy. There is an amazing opportunity for investment in this country. The global financial crisis has been positive for Mozambique because people are looking for new and alternative ways to invest.</p><h4>What role can Banco íšnico play in the investment sector, and why should people choose you?</h4><p>Banco íšnico has people with skills and international experience who have worked in the UK, the US, Asia, and other markets. We have a team that understands the language of finance. Our team knows what project financing means, and we are familiar with the main issues regarding corporate finance. Many international companies come here knowing that Banco íšnico is a small bank, but they recognize our team's reputation and appreciate our very strong international network and links with foreign banks around the world. We have created an international network, which is very important to us.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of Azpetrol's landmark achievements since it was established in 1997?</h4><p>The Azpetrol Company began its activities following the opening of its first fuel station on Tbilisi Avenue in Baku on July 15, 1997. The principal activity of the company is in organizing the retail and wholesale trading of fuel. At present, Azpetrol operates 77 petrol and gas stations covering most of Azerbaijan's regions. In order to increase fuel quality, ensure the continuous operation of our stations, and improve service quality for our clients, Azpetrol brought into operation a modern oil depot with a 7,000-ton capacity and a fleet of tanker trucks in 1999, which today numbers 97 vehicles. In addition, technical service and car wash facilities, cafes, markets, motels, and other complementary services are also offered to our customers. Since 2001, Azpetrol has applied the “Petrol Plus Offline" system to non-cash settlements and, in 2006, we started to provide plastic card payment services to clients. Today, about 2,700 employees work at the company, and their average monthly salary is close to AZN430.</p><h4>What is Azpetrol's development strategy?</h4><p>Azpetrol ended its first year of activity with eight petrol stations. The number of stations has now reached 77; 20 of them are located in Baku, with the rest being spread across different regions of the country. All of our stations are furnished with the latest and most up-to-date equipment and offer a wide spectrum of services to our customers. Azpetrol operates just 8% of the fuel filling stations in Azerbaijan, though it has captured more than a 50% market share. Our trademark is recognized as one of the most well-known icons in Azerbaijan for providing excellent service and high-quality products.</p><p>One of the company's priorities is to contribute to the successful implementation of the “State Program on Social and Economic Development of the Regions of Azerbaijan Republic in 2009-2013," approved by our honorable President. Azpetrol has focused its attention on the development of its regional infrastructure. The company put into operation four new petrol stations in different regions of the country during 2011 (Shabran, Aghsu, Jangi, and Goygol), and it is expected to bring into service five more filling stations in Baku, Sumgait, Sheki, and Ismayilli  over 2012.</p><h4>Azpetrol was awarded the “Network of Petrol Stations of the Year" prize at the Azeri Business Award ceremony. What is the significance of such an award?</h4><p>This award shows that Azpetrol is one of the most advanced and dynamic participants shaping a new image for the national business community in the Azerbaijani economy. It should be noted that over the last few years our company has been awarded many awards, among them “Success," “Business Prestige," the “Caspian Energy Integration Award," “International Gold Star for Quality" from Business Initiative Directions (BID), and the “Queen Victoria Commemorative Medal," among others.</p><h4>Azpetrol has built motels in Shaki, Balakan, and Gazakh. What is your future business strategy regarding the hospitality sector?</h4><p>Our main business activity is in fuel distribution throughout Azerbaijan. In addition to that, and as a strategy to improve customer satisfaction, we have diversified our activities, incorporating complementary services for drivers such as supermarkets and car wash facilities. As for the motel businesses we operate, these facilities are specifically located near border crossings as well as in popular tourism areas. For the time being, we do not have any plans to build more motels because the tourism industry is very active at the moment in Azerbaijan, with many hotels set to open their doors during 2012. However, the dynamics of this market could lead Azpetrol to consider expanding its activities in this segment of the economy.</p><h4>Since one of Azpetrol's priorities is to provide employment opportunities in regional Azerbaijan, as well as to improve the skill level of its personnel, what role does staff training play in your development?</h4><p>Azpetrol's success is closely related to the implementation of the right kind of personnel policy. Azpetrol's greatest wealth is its employees, and we intend to continuously develop the skill base of our personnel. Employees who wish to improve their existing skills and knowledge are firmly supported. We are always ready to help them climb the professional ladder and gain promotion. To achieve this, candidates with the right qualities are taught the necessary skills, while officers currently working for the company are encouraged to improve their existing level of professionalism under the guidance of experienced teachers at Azpetrol's specialized training facilities.</p><p>Our success is closely related to the code of conduct we have for our personnel. The employment process covers different stages, including a candidate's technical knowledge and intellectual level, as well as their personal skills, such as the ability to work within a team. The basic principles we encourage in our employees take into account the needs of our clients, as well as our desire to encourage professionalism, loyalty, ethical behavior, and dynamism.</p><h4>Azpetrol celebrates its 15th anniversary in 2012. What investment and development plans is the company working on?</h4><p>At present, Azpetrol operates filling stations in 36 cities and in regions across our republic. Our principal goal is to maintain our leading position within the sector and support the development of our economy by contributing through our achievements to the further development of regional Azerbaijan. We aim to expand the company's activities, open additional workplaces, increase multiple field service areas, study state-of-the-art practices worldwide related to our field of activity, and then apply them. In this regard, we believe we have a duty to care about education, culture, and sports in our country. Azpetrol has sponsored many international competitions and established a close relationship with the Azerbaijan professional boxing, gymnastics, and chess federations. Also, we signed our first partnership agreement with the European Hockey Federation in 2006, and we have sponsored many events organized by the federation. In 2010 we extended the agreement until 2014. Finally, we are committed to continuing our charitable work by providing financial aid to poor families, orphanages, charitable organizations, disabled people, and refugees, as well as the families of martyrs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Caspian Fish Co contributed to the development of the fishing industry in Azerbaijan since it was established in 2001?</h4><p>Caspian Fish Co is the leading company in the fishing industry in Azerbaijan as well as the Caspian region as a whole. Our contribution to the development of this industry, and especially the caviar segment, is palpable in terms of raising standards, improving processing capacities, and exporting Azerbaijani products to other international markets. We have come a long way since we started operations in 2001. For example, back then Azerbaijani caviar stood fourth among the top five in the world, and nowadays I can proudly say—and our customers can prove this—that we stand equally at number one with Iran. Also, Caspian Fish Co has introduced a higher level of technology at the processing stage, and therefore we have contributed to raising the quality and variety of the assorted products available in the market, and adapted our products to the different markets we are active in. In 2001, 99% of the available fish in the market were sold whole, and customers could not buy their fish in smaller portions. Today, however, there are a wide variety of fish products, and Caspian Fish Co has positively contributed to this evolution within the market.</p><h4>What are your overall processing capacities?</h4><p>Caspian Fish Co can process 120 tons of fish per day. Our company also produces poultry feed from the non-edible fish scraps left over, as these contain a host of important nutrients needed for poultry nutrition. Our processing facilities are equipped with the latest technology and European machinery, mostly sourced from Germany and France. Such machines can process 120 fish per minute, or two fish per second, and they take the tail, head, skin, and bones off, leaving behind only the clean fillets. Caspian Fish Co is not only the biggest processing factory in Azerbaijan, but also the largest in the Caspian region.</p><h4>How would you asses the state of the caviar segment in Azerbaijan, and what measures is Caspian Fish Co implementing for the preservation of sturgeon stocks in the Caspian Sea?</h4><p>Unfortunately, illegal fishing activity in the Caspian Sea has badly damaged the presence of the sturgeon family, which is now close to extinction. However, the situation is beginning to improve. In 2011 the five littoral states on the Caspian Sea were given quotas in order to preserve sturgeon stocks in the area and promote a future increase in the population of this extremely important fish. Caspian Fish Co is heavily committed to the preservation of the sturgeon family in the Caspian Sea, and for that reason, three years ago, we decided to finance and develop a sturgeon farm on the banks of the Kura River, near the Mingachevir area. The future development of that farm will enable us to produce about 200 million fingerlings, and Caspian Fish Co plans to introduce around 15 million fingerlings into the Caspian Sea every year. We will only take between 2 million and 3 million of them to keep at our farm, and we are hoping to have our own sturgeon stocks in four years time. In that regard, and in terms of future processing prospects, caviar usually is 10% of the weight of the fish. If we have a processing capacity of 100 tons of fish, this will yield us 10 tons of caviar. At the same time, we are planning to introduce the meat of male sturgeons into the market. Caviar is a very rich and important piece of Azerbaijan's heritage, and this important initiative is a part of Caspian Fish Co's commitment to promote this valuable heritage. We cannot sit back and watch the tradition of catching sturgeon, which dates back 2,000 years in Azerbaijan, just die off. In that sense, the government has always supported Caspian Fish Co, especially in terms of its caviar production and preservation plans.</p><h4>What role do domestic demand and exports play in your overall business activity?</h4><p>Caspian Fish Co only exports caviar to foreign markets, and every year we have certain quotas to comply with. We always successfully meet the annual quotas, and our biggest customers have traditionally been European countries. However, we have also sold on several occasions to the US, Japan, and other countries that could not complete their quotas. Our caviar farming development project will strengthen our position in the market, allowing us to raise our export figures in three to four years. In the future we will export caviar worldwide, and we will also start exporting sturgeon meat. The reason for that is that the taste of our caviar will be different from that of the usual caviar that comes from other aquaculture facilities. Our farm on the Kura River is taking advantage of the qualities of the river water to breed sturgeon in very similar conditions to those of their wild cousins, the taste of which is usually far richer than that found in farmed sturgeon. We believe that the natural conditions in which we are developing our sturgeon in the Mingachevir area will make our caviar, and by extension Azerbaijani caviar as a whole, the tastiest in the world.</p><h4>What role can such a variety of caviar play in promoting Azerbaijan abroad?</h4><p>Over the years, we have noticed an ongoing trend among our caviar customers; regardless of the so-called origin of the caviar they purchased, it has often been repackaged without even stating its true Azerbaijani origin. Therefore, the name of our country has not been developed and promoted enough in this field. However, we are working on addressing this situation and leveraging Azerbaijan's position as a leading country in terms of caviar production and product quality. Caviar has contributed importantly to the development of the country, but it has much more to offer in the future.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the fishing industry in Azerbaijan for 2012?</h4><p>Nowadays, we live in a world that has become health conscious, and the healthiest meal people can have is fish. Therefore, I am sure that this fact will contribute to increase demand for fish not only in Azerbaijan, but in many other countries, too. In the future, Caspian Fish Co will grow along with this trend.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved over the years to become the largest steelmaker in the region?</h4><p>The building boom that has occurred across the world, as well as in our country, has increased the demand for construction rebar to fantastic levels. Baku Steel Company (BSC) was established in June 2001. Over the years, we have been very consistent in our policies and we have become the largest modern steelmaker in the region. To date we have produced over 2.5 million tons of rebar, and we now employ 3,200 people. It has been 10 years since we entered the construction market. With its great development path over the past decade, the company now holds an important position in the economy of Azerbaijan, has taken an active role in creation of new jobs, and has worked to maintain an ecological balance. Baku Steel Company LLC is the largest taxpayer in the non-oil sector. We began a major restructuring in 2011, which made it an important year for us. Our performance indices clearly prove that it was an economically efficient year for us as well.</p><h4>What is the nominal capacity of BSC, and how has production capacity changed over the years?</h4><p>We are the largest modern steelmaker in the region, and our nominal production capacity is 770,000 tons per year. In order to meet the growing demand for steel products both domestically and abroad, we are undergoing a large-scale restructuring. BSC's products have been and are being used successfully in the construction of industrial projects and bridges. Also, we take environmental issues very seriously. Badische Stahl-Engineering GmbH of Germany and LECES of France, which are some of most advanced enterprises in the world, have installed the latest technology in our production factory, which enables us to reduce production costs and minimize our environmental impact.</p><h4>How developed is your range of products, and where are you focusing your resources?</h4><p>BSC is specialized in the manufacture of oil industry equipment and installations. It is also recognized in the region as a producer of a range of construction rebar and steel billets. Our mold-casting shop, which is a production tradition in the company, has template-making, molding, and finishing and heat-treatment areas. Alloy and high-alloy mold castings are produced in this shop to order, and such castings are in great demand within the oil industry. In line with the demand for steel products in domestic and foreign markets, the company has been restructured in order to expand its product range. We will begin producing angles, channels, I-beams, rods, wire, and other metal products as well. We have purchased new equipment and installed a new rolling mill that will enable us to produce a wider range of goods.</p><h4>What is the company doing to ensure the quality of its services and products?</h4><p>The production of quality products is the cornerstone of the company's tradition. Since our first days of operation, we have cooperated with Swiss company SGS, which has offices in 114 countries, and the British Standards Institute (BSI). Today, the production and sale of manufactured products for export are implemented according to the quality and quantity guarantee of the International Inspection Company of Great Britain (Intertek). With its representatives in more than 100 countries, Intertek conducts independent testing and affirms the quality certificates issued by the plant. Also, the State Committee on Standardization, Metrology, and Patents of Azerbaijan has issued a Certificate of Conformity for our steel rebar. I would also like to say that we take recruitment processes very seriously. People working in the heavy industry sector should be careful and responsible enough to avoid accidents. For this reason, the company has established a training center to teach and promote standards and regulations on health and safety, and care for the environment. At the same time, a focus on our employees' health has always been essential for the company. The medical center operating in the company was reconstructed in compliance with state-of-the-art requirements, and provided with new equipment. This medical center, where qualified medical personnel work on continuous duty, is provided with every thing necessary to render first aid to injured personnel.</p><h4>What role do domestic demand and exports play in the development of the company?</h4><p>Today, the company supplies the domestic market with quality reinforcing bars and billets. Just 10 years ago, the domestic market demand for construction rebar was covered entirely by imported products. Now, a free market relationship has been formed in Azerbaijan, there is competition, and it's quite natural that products from abroad are still imported into the market. Nevertheless, the main provider to the domestic market is BSC. Supplying the domestic market is our primary task. However, we also play a key role in foreign markets and we are the main exporter in this field in the country. We export our products to Russia, Georgia, Turkmenistan, and Iran. The company's products were used in the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, a number of industrial projects, bridges, and residential and public buildings. We continue to try to find new markets. This means that work is being done every day in order to keep our production in line with today's requirements. Our products have been exhibited at various international fairs held in Moscow, Astana, Tabriz, and Baku, and each time they have been awarded diplomas and certificates of quality.</p><h4>What are BSC's future prospects?</h4><p>The first stage is the more efficient processing of light scrap metal, which involves the cleaning of metal scrap on shaker mechanisms, the removal of non-metallic inclusions by means of magnetic separators, and cutting in press-shears. Our plant has purchased a packaging machine from famous Italian firm Vezzani that prepares press packages at a size of 400 x 400 millimeters with a specific weight of 2.2 tons per cubic meter. The capacity of this machine is 70 tons per hour. This machine will enable us to use advanced methods in the processing of charge material for the electric arc furnace (EAF), resulting in relatively clean and high-density scrap packages. The second stage relates to processing operations. We recently signed a contract with Siemens VAI of Germany to develop a project that would replace our existing furnace with a more advanced EAF, which is a very serious step for us. The new EAF will have an updated control system for purging carbon-containing materials. This, and the other projects we are carrying out, will be important not only for increasing our production volumes, but will also contribute to cleaning up the Caspian Sea and Azerbaijan's environment in general. We will install new dust and gas collection technology in parallel with the new furnace of the type that is used in state-of-the-art steelworks in Germany. These systems are fully automated, meaning they are equipped with an automated apparatus to monitor the quantity of all pollutant emissions, and software with continuous control features. This project will bring BSC into line with other state-of-the-art European steelworks. These are the plans we intend to implement in the short term. In general, the company has invested $75 million since 2009 to implement these improvements. All of this will contribute to increasing the plant's annual steel production, and will also reduce our energy consumption, improve our production methods, and enable us to produce more using alternative energy sources in the smelting process. Our aim is to increase the capacity of the plant to 1.1 million tons by the end of 2012.</p><h4>What are the competitive economic advantages of Azerbaijan's steel sector, and what is your outlook for the sector in 2012?</h4><p>Today, iron ore is regarded as one of the main necessities for the development of industry and of economies. There are three iron ore fields with proven commercial iron ore reserves within the territory of Azerbaijan providing us with a reliable raw material base. There are vast opportunities for the development of the metallurgical industry in our country, including the availability of abundant and varied raw materials and different sorts of scrap metals, local energy resources such as oil and natural gas, a metal-consuming industry and construction field, experienced personnel and labor resources, and opportunities for the creation of new fields on the basis of the existing material and technical resources. For example, during the first eight months of 2011 the production volume of the metallurgical industry increased by 1.8 times. We hold a very hopeful and optimistic view of the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the name of the company highlight its motivation and operations?</h4><p>With the rapid development of Azerbaijan into a modern economy and a leading economic hub in the region, our shareholders realized that the time had come for the generation of a new business group. This dynamic and strong company would be led by young, highly qualified, and experienced staff, motivated to observe international standards and core principles. This was what our shareholders had in mind when they created the idea of Synergy Group. This new group would combine local and international experience to be the perfect partner for developing businesses. Synergy Group got its name for a good reason. The key ingredient for positive business development is the combined strength of units, departments, companies, and partners. In our daily work we promote synergies in our own structure and with the best partners in the world. Our name is our slogan.</p><h4>How has your portfolio of companies and services developed over the years?</h4><p>Even though we are only two years old, Synergy Group has already developed a large and strong portfolio. We have invested in every sector of the economy to ensure sustainable development into the future. We are now active in the industrial, construction, hospitality, agriculture, ICT, finance, and education sectors.</p><h4>How has the agribusiness sector developed? Is there potential in the viticulture sector?</h4><p>Agriculture is a very important sector. Azerbaijan is one of the few lucky countries boasting very good conditions for agriculture, a very favorable tax regime, and distinction for its excellent fruits and vegetables. Nevertheless, the standards for agricultural products have to be raised and food processing must be developed, because many agribusinesses are not efficient. Synergy Group companies aim to be an example of an efficient modern agribusiness. Although Azerbaijan has a long tradition of wine making, much of its viticulture was destroyed in the Soviet era. However, Azerbaijani wine is of high quality, and the Caspian Coast Winery competes with the best brands in the international wine market.</p><h4>What role does the construction materials sector play in expanding the industrial base?</h4><p>Many construction materials are imported into the region, although the demand in the construction sector is large and the cost of imports is high. The import of such materials results in higher construction costs. As Azerbaijan's economy is developing further and further, and the ongoing urbanization process gains speed, the demand for high-quality construction materials is increasing as well. In the near future, we will see more investment in local production facilities.</p><h4>What should be done to improve the tourism sector? Do you foresee the hosting of the Eurovision Song Contest having an impact on the hospitality and tourism industry?</h4><p>The tourism sector can contribute to the economic development of Azerbaijan. Very often, people focus on international tourism and forget about local or regional tourism. Concerning local tourism, the country has already heavily invested in the development of infrastructure, hotels, and attractions in regional areas. In terms of international tourism, Azerbaijan was a virtually unknown country for most of its history. Over the past few years, Azerbaijan has become internationally visible due to its excellent athletic performance and the amazing development of the city of Baku. The Eurovision Song Contest will attract more tourism and positively influence the development of the sector.</p><h4>One of Synergy Group's aims is to build the company's presence not only nationally, but also regionally and internationally. What opportunities do you see for Synergy Group outside of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We are already working with international partners in Azerbaijan as well as outside of the country. The positive synergy we have with our partners is beneficial in Azerbaijan and internationally. We operate in the global market, and we have to think and act globally. With our international team, partners, and companies, we do not define geographical limits. Our experiences and contacts make us a strong partner in the region, Europe, and Central Asia. Furthermore, some of our companies and investment projects have been focused solely on foreign markets.</p><h4>What challenges does Azerbaijan have to overcome to become more attractive for FDI?</h4><p>Over the past few years, Azerbaijan has improved its legislation and regulations considerably. International investments are safe, and not limited or restricted by government regulations. However, Azerbaijan competes for international investment. A free economic zone and further strengthening of the regulatory reforms for businesses would make Azerbaijan a more attractive investment destination for various industrial investors.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Azerbaijani economy, and what does this signal for the future of Synergy Group?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is still one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The ongoing efforts of the President to make Azerbaijan one of the most attractive places in the world to do business and live is supported by huge government investment into all sectors of the economy. I strongly believe that Azerbaijan will be an economic hub between East and West. More and more international companies will come to Azerbaijan, and combined local and international business experience is needed. Synergy is vital, and that is how we can help. We were established to focus on and participate in the shaping of this future economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has 2011 been for the company?<br></h4><p>We had a very productive and successful year in 2010. We produced over 67,000 ounces of gold. In 2011 our production output was around 60,000 ounces because we were affected by very severe weather conditions in Gedabek, which is a surface mine. Basically, Gedabek is a copper mine with lots of gold in it. The separation of these two elements is a real challenge. Gedabek is the only mining property in the world that has two plants: SART and ADR. The former plant is being showcased as the best way to separate both elements. Our company has started the process of building a new agitation leaching plant, with an investment of around $60 million, and we very much hope to see the plant operational by the end of 2012. It will allow us to extend the life of the mine and improve the recovery rate for gold and other materials. We are planning to have two production lines for sulfate ore and high-grade ore. The average recovery rate from an agitation plant should be 90%.</p><h4>With production expected from the Gosha mine by the end of 2012, what level of impact are you expecting from these operations?</h4><p>In 2011 we discovered and submitted the notes of discovery to the government for another of our properties, the Gosha mine. It is located at the top of a mountain, and this makes our job difficult. We estimate that there are 300,000 ounces in just one zone of the 13 the site has. These other areas are currently being explored, as we are talking about an underground mine. We are planning to put into operation a small processing plant to produce somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 ounces of concentrated gold annually. Later on we will decide whether to sell the gold concentrate itself or bring it back together and put it in the agitation plant. Adding Gosha's production to our overall operations, we will reach over 100,000 ounces a year, which will enable us to upgrade the status of the company from a junior mining company to a mid-size mining company.</p><h4>What is the status of the Ordubad project?</h4><p>This is another property in our current portfolio, and the initial exploration works were not successful. We will be emphasizing our exploration activities in the Agyurt area, one of our more promising sites, as we need to come up with a discovery by April 2012, otherwise we may lose the right to this mine. If we submit positive exploration results, we will be given the right to mine for the next 20 years.</p><h4>How would you assess Anglo Asian Mining's contribution to the realization of Azerbaijan's full mining potential?</h4><p>Azerbaijan never had a mining industry, and as a result we did not have mining experts. We have created them. We have created a skilled team that can operate in any type of mine anywhere in the world. We have trained our team from different perspectives, such as in processing, geology, mining, engineering, and the environment. Anglo Asian Mining has created jobs, directly and indirectly, for over 1,000 people in rural Azerbaijan, where we have changed the economic environment. We have also developed community projects repairing roads and even building a whole new school for 400 students. We are partners with the government, which owns 51% of production after the deduction of capital and operational expenses, and so far we have given to the government of Azerbaijan close to $30 million in gold, which in my opinion would represent around 17,000 ounces.</p><h4>How do you see the processing prospects of Azerbaijan in the extractive industries sector, and what business opportunities are there for local and foreign investors?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has an extremely high potential for mining. We have been pioneers in gold mining, but there are many other sites in Azerbaijan offering opportunities that have not been touched but contain deposits of metals, polymetals, copper, and probably zinc. We are in talks with the government in order to expand our segments of activity in the country, and I am sure there are plenty of other companies in Azerbaijan that have either obtained concessions or are looking into it. Overall, I am convinced that the industry offers plenty of opportunities for both local and foreign investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What encouraged you to move from the diplomatic field into the telecoms industry and move back to Baku to establish AzQtel-SAZZ?</h4><p>My interest was not so much in the telecommunications sector in general, but the development of the internet and internet services in emerging economies. When I started to work in the international market, I came to realize that the development of the internet was one of the most attractive products to export from the US to developing countries, because it is needed to support companies from all types of sectors such as media, banking, and energy. Toward the end of the 20th century the world started to shift into the digital era, offering great business opportunities and growth potential, and increasing the feeling of globalization among people. After serving as a formal and informal diplomat for Azerbaijan—my home country—for many years, I decided to move into international business, first running the business development department within a company very active in the ICT sector in different parts of the world, testing internet technology in various countries. Finally, I convinced my partners and shareholders to put all of our focus and emphasis on the Azerbaijani market, because of the importance given by President Ilham Aliyev to the ICT sector and the potential growing market that was forming here, where internet penetration was still low and data access was very expensive. From the first stages of our deployment in Azerbaijan, we have been focusing on wireless broadband internet technologies, testing WiMAX technologies. In 2005, we incorporated AzQtel into our operations, and in 2006 we were granted radio frequency licenses. Between 2008 and 2009 we developed a commercial pilot plan, covering downtown Baku with 19 base stations. It was a success and in the following two years we started to expand our network, and we managed to cover all of Baku and other cities like Sumgait and Mingachevir, building more than 180 new base stations. In 2010 we also underwent a rebranding exercise, adopting the name SAZZ, creating a new and more modern logo, and implementing a new marketing strategy, which brought us a solid reputation within the country for being a quality wireless broadband provider with affordable prices—AZN25 for unlimited downloads with up to 10 Mbps speed, and a 24/7 technical support center.</p><h4>What are the advantages of Mobile WiMAX technology as compared to other internet technologies?</h4><p>We have yet to see the worldwide deployment of 4G technology, Azerbaijan included. The wireless market in our country offers different possibilities: GPRS, HSDPI, and 3G. As compared to the latter, WiMAX is superior in terms of bandwidth and SAZZ has also brought affordable prices to the table. Another important factor to keep in mind is that WiMAX technology has been implemented worldwide with high levels of success, and in this regard analysts and vendors have named us as one of the 10 most successful WiMAX deployments around the world after taking into account our entrance into the market and the rate of customer subscriptions.</p><h4>What level of coverage does your network currently provide, and what are your strategic plans to expand it?</h4><p>At the moment we cover all of Baku, Sumgait, Mingachevir, and the vast majority of suburban areas located by the Caspian Sea on the Absheron Peninsula, reaching about 3 million people under our coverage. We are currently in our third expansion phase, in which we will be adding 240 more base stations, and reaching the regions of Azerbaijan starting from Ganja, where our services will soon be available. Toward the end of 2012 we will be covering the vast majority of each regional city center in places like Gabala, Sheki, Gusar, and Lankaran.</p><h4>How has your customer base evolved over this period of time, and what is the company targeting for the future?</h4><p>Since we underwent the rebranding exercise, SAZZ has managed to attract tens of thousands of new customers, something we are very happy about. In this regard, 2011 was a very successful year. Right now, 85% of our customers are individuals, whereas the remaining 15% are banks and SMEs.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the level of internet penetration in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan was an underpenetrated market in terms of broadband, and even though internet penetration has grown rapidly in the last few years, the penetration rate is still low and the country has yet to achieve its peak. The explosion is still ahead of us, and both wireless and wired internet access service companies will be competing for the biggest piece of the Azerbaijani broadband cake for the next three to  five years.</p><h4>What are AzQtel-SAZZ's plans for the future?</h4><p>We are in a decisive expansion stage. Our major plan is to make SAZZ a national broadband operator by spring 2013, and in so doing we can also move into a better competitive position from a coverage perspective. Looking at the Azerbaijani broadband market as a whole, we think that five years from now there will be 4 million-5 million broadband users in Azerbaijan, and the aim is to grab at least 15%-20% of the market. Regardless of what happens in the future, it is a win-win situation for us, because today we already sell more USB modems than all the other wireless operators put together.</p><h4>In your opinion, how has the business environment in the ICT sector evolved in Azerbaijan over the last few years?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has a Soviet legacy in the telecommunications industry, and it does not need to build infrastructure and networks from scratch. Having said that, infrastructure is developing quickly thanks to government regulation and private companies, which are leading fast-paced growth in the sector. I think the appointment of Ali Abbasov as Minister of Communications and Information Technologies was a turning point within the sector, making it more vibrant. The internet has played a key role in broadening ICT sector perspectives. Many software development and system integrator firms have pushed the sector onward, making a difference overall. Today, you can see many Azerbaijani companies expanding their activities abroad, and that is a sign of how much the sector and the business environment in the sector has developed in the last few years. In this regard, AzQtel-SAZZ is also looking into expanding its activities abroad, with current negotiations with companies in Kyrgyzstan and Georgia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What sort of influences led to you joining the media sector?</h4><p>I was born in Karabakh and attended Baku State University's Oriental Studies Faculty between 1963 and 1968. I also studied at the University of Algeria for one academic year, and became an interpreter in Syria. I returned to Baku in 1975 and worked at a satirical publication for 15 years. In 1991 we established AssA-Irada, the first independent news agency in Azerbaijan. Six years later, we set up the first English language newspaper, AzerNews, and I have been running these two publications ever since. I hold a PhD in Syrian literature and have written two monographs on the subject. I have also done a lot of creative writing and authored many publicist works, pamphlets, and short stories. Furthermore, I have written a two-volume historical novel on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and am working on a third volume of this series.</p><h4>How has AzerNews evolved, and what is the current circulation of the newspaper?</h4><p>AzerNews is the first independent English language newspaper in Azerbaijan. It has been 15 years since the newspaper came out for the first time, and we feel proud of what we have accomplished. The most important thing for us is to maintain our independence. We have no income except for sales and advertising. We are the only newspaper in the country that is placed into a PDF format all over the world through www.newspaperdirect.com, the world's leading media website. Our main source of news is our journalists and the AssA-Irada news agency, whose news is featured in the databases of the world's leading economic publication, The Financial Times, as well as those of Russia, Germany, and other countries. We are planning to increase the number of pages as well as that of sponsors in 2012. The employees of all embassies, international organizations, and foreign companies operating in Baku are among our readers. AzerNews is also available on the flights of Azerbaijan's state airline AZAL. At the same time, Azerbaijan's increasing role in the region encourages us to focus on regional events more. We publish 6,000 copies every week, and the presence of an increasing number of expatriates visiting Azerbaijan and local people learning English makes us think of increasing our circulation.</p><h4>How has AzerNews contributed to the development and growth of Azerbaijan over the last decade?</h4><p>The key goal of AzerNews is to disseminate news about Azerbaijan and the region to  the world. Our ethos is our independence and objectivity. We believe we are the best source for foreigners coming to Azerbaijan who want to learn more about the country, as we closely follow all developments. This confidence is built on the numerous appeals, calls, and advertisements from our readers. AzerNews is the best source for those looking to get acquainted with the economy, business environment, culture, and society of Azerbaijan. As a media organization, we closely take part in the recognition of Azerbaijan abroad. For example, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and misleading policy on the Armenian side of this issue forms negative opinions about our country in people's minds, and I am proud that AzerNews tries to get across the truth behind these stories.</p><h4>What are some of the key topics that you see affecting Azerbaijan in the coming years?</h4><p>The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is first on the agenda, as very little has been done on this issue in recent years. It is quite important for Azerbaijan to settle the conflict under international law and get its legitimate territories back. This is the only thing all Azerbaijanis agree on, and I strongly believe that the settlement of the issue will solve other problems for the country. This is a very important time for Azerbaijan. European integration and policies in this direction, as well as relations with neighboring countries—Turkey in particular—are to be top issues on the media agenda.</p><h4>How does freedom of the press and expression in Azerbaijan compare with other countries in the region?</h4><p>The first newspaper in Azerbaijan was published in 1875. At present, local media organizations are of three various types: official, opposition, and independent. We are in the third group. Former President Heydar Aliyev abolished censorship in 1998 for the first time in the history of our media. Our publications never caused any problem for us; we are ready to listen to everyone. A lot has been done for press freedom after Azerbaijan gained its independence in 1991, and today's media has become commercial. The number of newspapers in the country is rather high, which negatively affects the efficiency of their publications. AzerNews has always been independent, and has been critical of many issues. Nevertheless, the media is consistently growing in our country. However, I would rather note that our freedom of the press is ensured and we have never faced any problem in this sphere. We rely on our professionalism in this issue.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures is Azerbaijan Railways taking to update the existing network and its facilities?</h4><p>At present, the length of the main railway is 2,909 kilometers, 802 kilometers of which is dual track. Approximately 60% of the railway is equipped with an electrical signaling system and 1,522-kilometers of the railway is automated. The decree signed by HE President Ilham Aliyev on July 6, 2010 approved the “State Program on the Development of the Railway System in the Azerbaijan Republic from 2010-2014," and initiated capital repair work along 317 kilometers of the railway from Baku to Boyuk Kesik. Under the state program, five of Azerbaijan Raiways' CME3 locomotives were repaired at a plant in Nymburk, Czech Republic before being brought back to the country. Additionally, four of our CME3 locomotives have been sent for repairs in Slovakia and two to Ukraine. Four VL-11 electric locomotives were delivered to Georgia for maintenance. New machines produced by Germany's ROBEL were purchased to reduce the amount of the company's manual labor, and five trolley cars produced by the Tikhoretsk machine-building company were brought to the country on September 6, 2010. Five of the 20 coaches to be repaired were sent to the Sazvrudki plant in Slovakia, and these trains were delivered back to Azerbaijan on October 28, 2011.</p><h4>What plans does the company have to improve the network in the future?</h4><p>The state program calls for the reconstruction of railways, power supplies, communication facilities, and service buildings at the Yalama and Boyuk Kesik border stations; the reconstruction of railways, contact networks, communication and telecommunication stations, power-collecting stations, and service buildings at the Bilajari and Sangachal junctions; the establishment of fiber-optic communication lines on the Yalama-Bilajari section of the railway; the upgrading of power stations and equipment at Kurdemir, Barda, Govlar, Deller, Shemkir, Shirvan, and Alabashli stations; the renovation of one-way and double-sided auto-blocking along the Osmanli-Astara stretch; the improvement of water transportation equipment at Bilajari station; and the installation of an automatized management system for cargo and passenger transportation across the railway network.</p><h4>What challenges does Azerbaijan Railways face in expanding the network?</h4><p>Azerbaijan Railways is actively participating in the realization of the North-South and Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) international and regional transportation projects. In addition to the realization of the North-South international transportation corridor, we intend to construct railways that connect Azerbaijan with Iran, for which we will construct 8.4 kilometers of rail and four stations of 1,050 meters in length each. During the initial stages, two of the four stations will be sufficient. As the volume of transportation increases, additional measures will be taken to expand the railway. Currently, the renovation of the existing Baku-Boyuk Kesik railway is playing an important role in the operation of the new BTK railway, which is set to begin operating in 2013.</p><h4>What are the benefits of the BTK railway connection?</h4><p>This railway has attracted the attention of the governments and the heads of companies in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. The BTK railway will create wider opportunities for the three countries and others interested in using the transportation services of this corridor to establish close transportation connections. “This project is of a great historical significance," HE President Ilham Aliyev said, adding that it “will connect Europe with Asia and Azerbaijan with Turkey through rail, and is of great importance to our economic and political future." The BTK railway is expected to transport cargo of 5 million tons initially, and up to 15 million tons in the future.</p><h4>Do you expect the volume of cargo to increase in the coming few years, considering the growing importance of the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA) Program?</h4><p>Azerbaijan Railways began to participate in several international transportation corridors as early as 1996, but TRACECA is considered the most important yet. This area covers the territory of the Silk Road from Baku to Boyuk Kesik—the border of Georgia—providing access to third countries. The volume of cargo transportation is expected to increase heavily after the launch of the BTK connection. Kazakhstan has already expressed its intentions to transport 10 million tons of cargo through this corridor, which is favorable from an economic and security viewpoint. The technical updates and reconstruction work being conducted as part of the TRACECA Program aims to ensure an increasing volume of transportation, and proves that there are great prospects for Azerbaijan Railways. Our company plays an integral role in the TRACECA project and the region overall.</p><h4>What achievements were made in 2011, and what is expected in 2012?</h4><p>In the year 2011, 3.4 million passengers traveled from Azerbaijani railway stations, including 2.9 million with direct connections and 1.5 million people at local connections. The overall passenger turnover was 6.7 million passengers per kilometer. In terms of density, each coach transported approximately 21 passengers. The launch of online ticket sales on November 21, 2011 contributed to these positive outcomes. We installed two monitors at the Baku passenger station cashiers' hall and one monitor at the Ganja railway station, which are used to inform passengers about seat availability on each train. We began accepting non-cash payments for travel at Baku Station in January 2012. Our newly installed equipment will ensure that payment through POS terminals is being processed. In this way, we are working to improve the quality of the services we deliver to our passengers.</p><h4>What training programs and academic courses are available to improve the human resources in the railway sector?</h4><p>Several programs are being carried out and developed. One such project is the Human Resource Development for public investments, which is based on the agreement between the government of Azerbaijan and the International Development Association (IDA). To date, 57 of our company's specialists have participated in training programs organized by the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Internationally accepted certificates have been issued to specialists who finished training courses on project design and management, transportation management, cooperation between the public and private sectors, financial management based on the standards of the international financial institutes, and a number of other courses. Meanwhile, we offered training courses concerning the implementation of international financial accounting standards under a railway trade and transportation project with the support of G&amp;G Consulting in February and March 2012. These training programs were conducted in two stages, covering topics such as the fundamentals of accounting, the significance of balance sheets for administrative accounts, management accounting, expenditure and revenue sources, expenditure and expense items, and calculating net value. Courses will be held throughout the year.</p><h4>What is the importance of the cooperation between international transportation organizations and financial institutions?</h4><p>Recently, every transportation company has been developing relationships with international financial organizations. As a result of the President's support, we have signed credit agreements with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) that allocated an amount of $450 million in support of railway trade and transportation, and with the Czech Export Bank for an additional ‚¬215 million to develop the railways and improve infrastructure. The authorities have accepted bids from 10 holdings to participate in the qualification round for designing, supplying, and installing a 27.5 kW system, which includes sub-stations and equipment related to signaling for the railway network. At the same time, we intend to purchase 50 new electrical locomotives with alternating current capability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When did KIA come to Azerbaijan and what were the strategic goals of the company in coming here?</h4><p>Despite the fact that the sale of KIA automobiles in Azerbaijan was organized through a Turkish distributor for some period, the project was not sustainable. Only in 2005 did KIA Motors start to look for a distributor directly in Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani economy had already proven its potential, and it was a natural choice for an automobile manufacturer like KIA Motors to take its share of the local market. Sales started in 2006 and we proved to our Korean partners that they had made the right choice; we achieved 168% and 318% growth during the second and third years of our operations. For that reason, we were elected a member of the Zenith Club, comprised of the best KIA distributors worldwide.</p><h4>What are the strengths of KIA in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Over the years, KIA has earned the respect of customers with its unique designs, high quality, and affordable prices. In addition, we have brought innovation and new approaches to the sector. For example, we were the first in the market to give a five-year or 150,000-kilometer guarantee for automobiles. Also, the introduction of the KIA Soul model led other brands to offer models belonging to the same segment. As a result, KIA is known as both a pioneer and an innovator in the local market.</p><h4>How has the services side of the business developed?</h4><p>We usually say that only the first automobile is sold by the sales department, the rest are sold by after-sales service. Hence, it is the services side that establishes the image of a brand in the market. Taking this into account, one of our aims since the first day of our activities has been to provide a high-level service to KIA owners, and we are giving priority to quality rather than quantity. We currently have six authorized service centers operating, and each of them is provided with the most modern equipment and tools. Staff members are taking training courses both within the company and abroad. The major aim of the service is to achieve the highest level of customer satisfaction, and at KIA we are all working in this direction.</p><h4>How was 2011 for KIA in terms of sales? What are your future targets?</h4><p>The results for 2011 were better than we planned, and we achieved 58% annual growth—the highest rate within the local automobile sector. Our main goal for 2012 is to expand KIA's representation in the regions of Azerbaijan, because it is there where we will see high growth rates in the future, thanks in part to the development of the right economic policies by the government.</p><h4>Which models are considered more successful in the Azerbaijani marketplace?</h4><p>As in many places, the Azerbaijani market has its own specific sophistications. For instance, according to the results of 2011, our best-selling model was the Sportage, which belongs to the SUV class, and the Rio and Cerato models followed it. We have also seen 190% growth in the sale of the new Picanto model, and we expect to consolidate the presence of that model within the market. As for consumer trends, the Azerbaijani population tends to look at Europe rather than Asia when it comes to car models. In addition, we have seen an important increase in the number of women drivers in the country.</p><h4>How would you assess the sector's human capital in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>As a fast developing country and economy, I would say that there is an important need for qualified professionals in fields such as the automobile sector. The country needed a certain period of time to establish the right labor market. The positive aspect in all this is that the government was and is working in the right direction to address the situation. The government has been stimulating the establishment of new specialties in higher education, and it encourages young people to study abroad through various programs. The result is already being seen; the supply of a young labor force with modern knowledge is increasing day by day.</p><h4>How significant are KIA's activities in Azerbaijan for its global strategy?</h4><p>Big buildings consist of many small bricks, and KIA Motors operates in more than 170 countries. Although Azerbaijan is not so big in terms of territory and population, it is among the leading countries in terms of sales indicators, development dynamics, and particularly for future potential. For example, in 2011 KIA Motors Azerbaijan was the regional leader in terms of sales and we were awarded for that. According to sale indicators, Azerbaijan is the fourth country in the region after Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine.</p><h4>What's your general outlook for the automobile sector over the medium term?</h4><p>We forecast continued growth in the sector for 2012, and we expect a rate of around 8%-9%. I think the market will give more preference to automobiles produced both in Russia and South Korea, and the share of the latter will increase significantly. The market share for more compact and economic automobiles will gradually increase, for we believe that the acquisition of second automobiles by Azerbaijani families will grow strongly in the near future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you find yourself getting involved in the construction industry in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>I was born in 1958 in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. I graduated from the Economics Faculty of Nakhchivan State University, and when Azerbaijan made its first steps to become a newly independent state, I established Ilkan, one of my first adventures in terms of ownership, and it achieved great success. In 1996 I founded Avesta Concern, and today the company has gained a strong reputation not only in Azerbaijan, but worldwide as well, as proven by the economic and cultural relations we have developed with countries such as Russia, Turkey, the UAE, Poland, China, and Korea. I have developed a lot of different projects such as mosques in Nakhchivan, water supply infrastructure in my home village, and many residential areas in Baku. Also, I built Avesta Concern's office building, which back in the old days was the first modern high-rise building in Baku. I was Deputy of the Supreme Majlis in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic between 1995 and 2000.</p><h4>What was the inspiration behind developing the Khazar Islands New City?</h4><p>I have always tried to bring the most modern projects to our country, being a pioneer in many fields. Khazar Islands is just the continuation of such a trend. The first idea to develop such a project came in the beginning of 2010, after a little inspirational talk with one of my sons, in which he foresaw the construction of a new city. I was thinking about this project for a long time and decided to build it. I began to wander around many different cities and countries seeking out the inspiration to develop my first major project and in one of my several visits to Dubai—actually, on my way back to Azerbaijan—it came to me all of a sudden and I started drawing the first sketches of Khazar Islands New City. At the beginning, very few people believed I could develop such a large project, but President Ilham Aliyev, who is very fond of progress, gave the green light. Today, work has already started. In fact, there are a few buildings that have already been constructed, and we expect to see the first inhabitants, around 6,000 people, living there by 2013.</p><h4>Could you tell us a bit more about the project and its technical characteristics?</h4><p>The Khazar Islands project will be a new business and residential city located 28 kilometers south of Baku. It is made up of 50 islands and 100 bridges, and the overall cost of the project is $100 billion. After carrying out research on the composition of the soil in the area, we have decided to develop the tallest building in the world. At 1,050 meters it will be a business center surrounded by six adjacent buildings that will provide security and protection to the structure of such a major construction project. This building, which will cost $2 billion, will be 220 meters taller than the current tallest building in the world, which is located in Dubai. The project is composed of three stages; in the first one we will construct six islands and 19 bridges over about 5 million sqm. The cost of the first phase is $12 billion, and it will be finished by 2016. In 2014 we will start implementing the second stage of the project, with an overall cost of $20 billion, and the third phase, which will cost $30 billion, will start in 2017. The new city will have its own means of transport, countless kilometers of boulevard area and roads, an amusement park, stadium, equestrian center, golf course, rally area, airport, kindergartens, schools, universities, a power supply center, and all the facilities you can imagine. This complementary part of the project will have an approximate cost of $40 billion. Khazar Islands New City will be completely finished by 2022.</p><h4>What strategies have you implemented to attract foreign investors to the project?</h4><p>I, personally, have taken a big part of the responsibility of financing the Khazar Islands project. However, we have also been attending international investment conferences and summits to attract foreign investors to the project, and today I can say that our main partners are from the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Turkish banks are involved in this project, as well as the country as a whole, because this project is not about me, but about Azerbaijan, its business development and modernization, and its future potential to grow bigger and attract even more international companies to Azerbaijan, because we are planning to sell 100,000 houses to foreign residents. Overall, I think 1 million people will be living in the new city, creating around 600,000 jobs and contributing to the diversification of the Azerbaijani economy and the environment in our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When Cross Caspian was established with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) as a joint venture in late 2005, what opportunities did the parties implied initially see?<br></h4><p>The provision of transshipment services on the Azerbaijan-Georgia transit corridor for oil and oil products coming from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan emerged during the late 1990s, and eventually went through rapid development in terms of volumes, facilities, and the number and type of customers, which offered great prospects for further development, while requiring coordination and comprehensive planning. Cross Caspian Oil &amp; Gas Logistics was established as an integrated transportation services provider. The company coordinates the provision of transportation services for shippers seeking to secure the transshipment of significant amounts of hydrocarbons over an extended period of time. Of course, it is convenient for a shipper to work with a party coordinating all transshipment-related services pertaining to its cargo, but in order to ensure sustainability and the high quality of our services, we also consider among our primary goals long-term analysis and modeling, predicting potential demand in terms of capacities and technical requirements, assessing the status of the available assets, seeking effective means to de-bottleneck any capacity constraints, and ensuring compliance with all applicable local and international regulations, standards, and best industry practices.</p><h4>What transportation capabilities does the corridor possess?</h4><p>We are committed to securing the delivery of high-quality transportation services. Our main goal is to serve our existing customers, and put all our efforts into the provision of better services. We don't just want to remain a reliable partner for our existing customers but also attract new clients by improving our services in terms of both qualitative and quantitative performance indicators. The Caspian-Black Sea transshipment corridor has a capacity of around 1.2 million tons of oil and oil products per month. There have been certain improvements in infrastructure in Georgia and Azerbaijan since 2008, such as the commissioning of the modern Kulevi Oil Terminal in Georgia, and the development of the new Garadagh Oil and Gas Terminal in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>Cross Caspian Oil &amp; Gas Logistics puts a lot of stress on manpower training and environmental issues. How is the company implementing its strategies in these fields?</h4><p>Transparency is the key to ensuring that the established control processes are not preventing companies from developing fresh ideas or hindering their ability to innovate and implement new approaches, methodologies, and procedures, and find new solutions. Learning is a never-ending process. Success is always a result of good teamwork. If people are not only motivated to learn, but really enjoy the work they do as a team, they will work much more efficiently.</p><h4>What is Azerbaijan's geostrategic situation, taking into account the North-South and East-West economic and energy corridors?</h4><p>For a country or a region to serve as transit hub it needs to meet certain prerequisites, such as a convenient geographical position, availability of developed transportation infrastructure, and political, economic, and social stability. Azerbaijan meets all such criteria and occupies a unique position serving as a bridge from the Caspian Sea to the Black and Mediterranean seas, which are world markets. Azerbaijan has diversified its infrastructure through the addition of several major pipelines and a number of maritime terminals. Altogether, Azerbaijan is a very attractive transit hub for potential shippers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the goals for the company when Atropatena began, and what are its main operations at the moment?</h4><p>Atropatena was set up as a distribution company, importing brands into Azerbaijan. We have been focusing on the pharmaceutical and hygiene sectors mostly, but also importing other brands. Schwarzkopf, Calgon, Strepsils, Nurofen, and Henkel are among our customers. However, as we began collaborating with Danone and did some market research, we came to the conclusion that the market was lacking fresh milk products. This was in around 2005. That led us in 2008 to launch a project to establish the production of milk and other products such as cheese and yogurt. In 2011 we opened the factory in the presence of President Ilham Aliyev. It was a very important moment for the company. Overall, distribution amounts to 90% of our business activity and we currently handle the activities of more than 50 brands in the country. Production accounts for only 10% of our activity. However, we aim to increase this figure in the near future.</p><h4>How does Atropatena support the brands it distributes in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We treat each brand in a unique way, supporting them throughout the whole process, and giving them special treatment. We promote them in the country with different advertising campaigns. In this context, we are one of the biggest advertisers in the country, with a budget that surpasses some of the big ICT companies.</p><h4>What is the capacity of the Atena MMC dairy factory's production infrastructure in Agjabadi?</h4><p>We started our production activities in mid-2011 when we inaugurated the facilities there. We are currently producing 25 tons per day, which is 10% of the factory's capacity. Our target is to have the factory fully operative and at its maximum capacity by 2015, when we expect it to be producing 250 tons per day. At the moment we are producing around 28 different products and we will increase that figure up to 54 by the end of 2012. We have an agreement with Danone, which has been a strategic partner in setting up our facility and with whom we work very closely. Danone will start producing its lines for Azerbaijan at our factory in 2012. That will increase the production volume we are currently handling. Our company also produces packaging for our products, which right now include only milk bottles, but we are planning to expand the packaging side in the near future as well.</p><h4>How have Atropatena's manpower and quality demands changed?</h4><p>Due to the expansion of the company's activities, we are constantly expanding our manpower. Apart from the factory, we are developing a project involving a farm with around 3,000 head of cattle. At the moment there are 600, and it will be completed in 2012. That farm will produce about 100 tons of milk per day, and we even plan to produce organic milk. To handle our distribution business, dairy production, and the farm, we will require about 1,000 employees. We put a great deal of effort into ensuring quality and high standards at Atropatena. Our factory is fully automated and features the latest technology for quality control to guarantee the freshness of our products. Our staff members are vital in the process, and we are constantly upgrading knowledge and standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Avromed started operations in 2001. How has the company evolved since then?</h4><p>Avromed has gained wide experience since it launched its operations more than a decade ago. Avromed was founded in October 2001 and within one year we became the distributor of more than 20 leading European pharmaceutical companies, such as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Les Laboratoires Servier, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, and Pfizer. By the end of 2003, the company enhanced its relationship with other European and American manufacturers, which allowed us to expand our product range. The company's revenues have considerably increased year by year and, for example, we closed 2011 with a turnover of more than AZN200 million. In that sense, our total turnover in 2010 was almost AZN140 million. Avromed has been growing more than 50% every single year. That means that we are going in the right direction. Our main principle is to deliver our products in no more than two hours no matter where the location. In line with this, we have seven regional branches and our network covers all the cities in Azerbaijan and I would say 99.9% of the whole national territory, except for the Armenian-occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region. In 2012 we will be opening two more regional branches, for we stress the quality of our services. Also, the company has a fleet of around 100 vehicles and three different warehouses, with the one in Baku being around 3,000 sqm. Since 2007 Avromed has been supplying nearly 50% of the tenders from the Ministry of Health and, of course, we also work with private hospitals. Avromed has its own pharmaceutical retail chain as well, which includes 180 drugstores across Azerbaijan. We currently employ more than 700 people, and around 60 of them are sales people who only serve the retail businesses in Baku.</p><h4>What evolution have you witnessed in terms of medical and pharmaceutical trends within the country?</h4><p>Over the last 10 years we have seen a shift in the manufacturers that are present in the market. Before, Soviet manufacturers used to dominate the market and people did not know much about European and American manufacturers. Nowadays, the situation has changed. Azerbaijan is a very open country and we can see representative offices of the best-known manufacturers in the world, such as Pfizer, GSK, Sanofi Aventis, and Novartis. That means that consumers are also looking to buy their products. We have seen an increasing interest among consumers in quality products. Therefore, the number of CIS producers has considerably decreased year-by-year, and European and American producers, due to their quality and worldwide reputation, have seen an increase in demand for their products. This trend has been palpable over the last few years,  especially since Azerbaijan's population has increased its purchasing power.</p><h4>Who are Avromed's main competitors?</h4><p>Avromed is one of the leading distribution companies in Azerbaijan. Our estimated market share is around 20%. However, the lack of clarity makes it difficult to provide reliable data on this. As for our competitors, although there are more than 100 distributors in Azerbaijan, the main ones are Azerimed, Riyad Farm, Farm Qrup, and Pasha-K. They represent, along with Avromed, almost 70% of the market in this country.</p><h4>What are the main lines Avromed represents that differentiate its product range from other distributors in the market?</h4><p>Our suppliers are multinational companies such as GSK, Aventis, Balkanpharma, Novartis, Les Laboratoires Servier, Sanofi, and Janssen-Cilag. Moreover, Avromed is an exclusive distributor of Pfizer, Alcon Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, Cheminova Internacional, Catalysis, Alfa Wassermann, Abdi Ibrahim, Jugoremedija, Jadran Galenski, Promed, and Octapharma. We currently have a supplier list of more than 190 pharmaceutical companies from 42 different countries. As a result, our services and wide range of products set Avromed apart from its competitors. Our company has the largest stock-keeping units (SKUs) in Azerbaijan with more than 15,000 in our price list, whereas our competitors have around 4,000 SKUs.</p><h4>What were the reasons that led to the launch of your joint venture with GSK to set up vaccination clinics?</h4><p>About five years ago we started this important project with GSK. We opened several vaccination rooms in different hospitals in Azerbaijan in order to offer jabs that had not yet been provided in the country. It has been a very successful project, and now we are looking to expand vaccines in the field of newborn babies that suffer from lung diseases. We are developing a strategy with our suppliers GSK and Pfizer to import the jabs from European markets and distribute them in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>Is the company looking to expand its activities on the manufacturing side?</h4><p>At the moment, we are not planning to start up any manufacturing processes in Azerbaijan. To open up a manufacturing line, we would need a much bigger market than Azerbaijan. We would need to export to other markets such as Central Asia and Georgia. However, this is not in our plans for now, but perhaps in the future we could look at it with more interest.</p><h4>What are the main strategic plans Avromed has for 2012?</h4><p>We are planning to increase our drugstore chain and open two new regional branches in order to keep up our services both in Baku and regional Azerbaijan. Avromed will be expanding its marketing department, so we can increase our portfolio and bring more international companies to our country. Finally, one of our targets for 2012 is to further increase our cooperation and relationship with the Ministry of Health and other governmental institutions.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the pharmaceutical sector over the medium term?</h4><p>The pharmaceutical market in Azerbaijan is very interesting, because at the moment we are tending to the formation of the whole market. We estimate that when medical insurance is implemented, the pharmaceutical sector can grow to twice its current size. There is big potential and I am sure we are headed in the right direction. Also, the number of CIS manufacturers is getting smaller, while their American and European counterparts are increasing their presence in Azerbaijan. That might have an impact on the market size as well. The economic status of Azerbaijan's population is steadily growing, and therefore people are increasingly opting for better treatment according to world standards, which enables businesses in this sector to develop in the right direction.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background story to C Group Hotels?<br></h4><p>C Hotels &amp; Resorts is a company operating in two main areas in Azerbaijan: tourism and construction. Established in 2001, we first started in the hospitality sector, developing a modern and contemporary hotel in Baku, because one of our main missions since the early days has been to be pioneers in our field. I can proudly say that C Group Hotels has positively contributed to the development of both the service and tourism sectors with our hotels and food and beverage businesses.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the booming luxury hotel market in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>This is a very lively and rapidly developing market at the moment, with international hotel chains investing in it and a great potential in the short to medium term. Such a trend also attracts many foreign companies from the tourist sector, as well as other fields of the economy. Along with luxury tourism, Azerbaijan is experiencing very important growth in the business segment, which is also fuelled by four-star hotels; facilities that are playing a significant role in the development of the sector. Business tourists tend to select short-term accommodation, emphasizing location. C Hotels &amp; Resorts sees this need and we are implementing strategies to take the leading role in the sector.</p><h4>The President of Azerbaijan declared 2011 the “Year of Tourism." What do you think needs to be done to improve Azerbaijan's tourism offering?</h4><p>It was definitely a year of very important developments in the sector. Such a declaration was the starting point of a long journey. It is important to start building a city brand like Paris, London, Barcelona, Rome, New York, Moscow, or Brussels. Baku is getting an increasing international reputation thanks to the oil and gas sector, its beautiful building architecture, heritage, and old traditions. Baku is implementing many different large-scale projects that will make the city even more beautiful to the eyes of tourists visiting it, including new parks, shopping malls, boutiques, corniches, entertainment venues, luxury hotels, restaurants, cafes, and much more. Such factors are important in the race to build a city brand. It is vital to keep promoting the city through brochures, billboards, music and promotional films, marketing campaigns, and other means such as international exhibitions, fairs, and events such as, hopefully, the Summer Olympics 2020.</p><h4>How do you think Eurovision 2012 will contribute to further promoting Azerbaijan as an international tourist destination?</h4><p>The Eurovision Song Contest is an important worldwide opportunity for the promotion of Azerbaijan. Work is underway both commercially and politically, and the event on its own will bring cultural advantages; Azerbaijan will show off its traditional hospitality and rich heritage. A wide range of different income, age, and occupational groups will come, and we are already working, both at the hotel and restaurant level, on strategies to target such a variety of customers. The broad experience we have gained over the years in the sector will enable us to provide an innovative approach to our strategies, something that will make a difference at the end of the day. We expect a very vibrant and productive year for the Azerbaijani tourism industry, and we are seeing increasing efforts to improve customer service quality, which adds value to the companies in the medium to long term, providing greater benefits.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In May of this year, the eyes of Europe will rest on Azerbaijan, as its public broadcaster hosts the 57th Eurovision Song Contest. For some of the 100 million viewers across more than 40 countries that this television tradition unites, it will represent their first glimpse of Azerbaijan. As such, the event is an opportunity to do far more than demonstrate Azerbaijan's ability to produce three state-of-the-art TV programs. “Baku 2012" offers a first impression. And the chance to create a first impression only comes once.<br></p><p>In 2006, Ictimai TV—Azerbaijan's first public broadcaster—was established with the intention to create a public broadcaster according to the European model. Ictimai TV was embraced by the pan-European fold of public broadcasting institutions in 2007 when it was granted membership by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Today, to ensure Ictimai TV meets its duty—as a member of the EBU—the EBU remains unequivocally committed to the development of fair and balanced, quality journalism through training, professional discussion and the exchange of best practices. As ever, the EBU is on standby to assist Ictimai—and all its other members—in best serving their audiences.</p><p>Membership of the union came with another much anticipated benefit; participation in the Eurovision Song Contest. The pool of journalists and strong fan base who follow the contest year-in year-out looked upon the new member with curiosity; some even reached for a map. Conscious of its newcomer status, Ictimai TV sent out a strong message in the lead up to the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest, when Azerbaijan participated for the first time. Not only did it host an unprecedented national selection event, it threw a spectacular introduction party. The message was clear; Azerbaijan was in it to win it.</p><div class="quote">“The Eurovision Song Contest is above all a cultural celebration, an international music competition that pits nations against each other in a completely amicable way."</div><p>It took no less than four years for Azerbaijan to top the scoreboard, just slightly more than Ukraine, which secured hosting rights after just two years of participation in 2004.</p><p>It doesn't take much reflection to appreciate the potential the Song Contest offers to a professional singer to reach into the living rooms of more than 100 million people across Europe. No less applies to the host country. While as organizers, we fiercely defend the apolitical nature of the contest. The event has been long regarded “a postcard to Europe," an opportunity for the host to promote its unique character, its vibrant cityscape, and historical hotspots.</p><p>Azerbaijan is poised to benefit. Public relations experts put the promotional value alone of the event at a billion euros. Thousands of people travel to the host city to attend the contest. In 2010, the local tourist authority in Oslo calculated guest spending at hotels, restaurants, taxi companies, museums, and local suppliers at around ‚¬100 million.</p><p>The Eurovision Song Contest is above all a cultural celebration, an international music competition that pits nations against each other in a completely amicable way. Its power lies in its capacity to bring people and nations together in a way that no other event can. In respecting the choice of European viewers to vote Azerbaijan's entrant winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 2011, we abided by our own rules—and thereby granting host rights to Azerbaijan's public broadcaster.</p><p>Hosting the contest should not be interpreted as a political endorsement. The set of criteria that must be met is long. In Fall of 2011, the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan signed a commitment to, among other things, grant security to those who will visit Baku for the purpose of the contest, assuring freedom of movement for the 1,500 to 2,000 journalists visiting Azerbaijan for the 57th Eurovision Song Contest.</p><p>The aim of Eurovision is to unite Europe and of course, to generate a good time. After what is without doubt the most agreeable of battles, a winner will emerge. By placing Azerbaijan at the heart of the debate, by facilitating a means for others to press for positive change, the potential exists however, for everyone to win.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Embawood's business activity over the past decade and a half in the furniture industry?</h4><p>We started operations in April 1996 with seven employees in a rented 300-sqm building. We have since expanded from seven people up to seven factories. In 2001, we established the office furniture brand Ideal Design. A year later, our second factory started to function in Khirdalan. We have also been exporting our products, taking an important share in foreign markets. The main strategy of our organization is to be close to our customers, and we are trying to establish the relevant infrastructure in foreign countries in order to implement this strategy. We want to stand behind our products because we stress both the importance of the sales process as well as after-sales service. A year after we opened, we established the first quality testing laboratory in the CIS. Later on, we launched two more brands, Madeyra, a second home furniture brand, and Dolce Noche, a mattress brand. Embawood's product portfolio has been growing along with the company. Over time we felt the need to address the market's increasing trend toward more modern and better designed products. Therefore, we launched Madeyra at a point of transition for Embawood to broaden our range of target customers in the market. At present, we have 66 retail locations using this name, and we are planning to increase this number up to 80 in the near future. Embawood has operations in 10 countries, with seven factories located in key regional markets such as Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Ukraine, as well as boasting a global retail sales network of more than 200 outlets.</p><h4>How has Embawood sought to promote the company as an Azerbaijani brand abroad?</h4><p>Our representatives, colleagues, and partners abroad are actively promoting Embawood as an Azerbaijani brand. We believe that the increasing popularity of our products shows the heightened interest in Azerbaijan. Embawood also participates in furniture exhibitions every year, and both factors prove that we have been able to follow trends in terms of furniture production and successfully promote Azerbaijan abroad. International exhibitions allow us to keep up with furniture production trends and innovative equipment, and also help us to build relations with foreign state representatives and businessmen, and we are using such opportunities as an additional means of promoting our country.</p><h4>What are some of Embawood's main products, and how much are you producing?</h4><p>Although we started up using small capacity infrastructure and equipment, we have gradually adjusted our production capacity and equipment to meet market demand and satisfy the company's needs. The period following the year 2000 was the turning point in our activity; we expanded our production by establishing an upholstering board division, started the production of office furniture, and acquired a second factory in Khirdalan. We initiated the export of our products in 2002. Overall, our present furniture production capacity is 35,646 sets per month, 99,480 sqm per month in lacquered wood, 26,130 sqm per month in PVC façade production, 871,267 sqm in melamine board production, 2,808 pieces at 160 x 200 centimeters, and 5,616 pieces at 90 x 200 centimeters in the production of spring mattresses, and 4,524 sets per month in the production of upholstered furniture.</p><h4>What major trends have you observed in both the domestic and foreign markets?</h4><p>The Azerbaijani market currently has enough capacity and great development perspectives. We expect an increase in furniture demand due to the rising purchasing power of Azerbaijan's population and also an increase in the frequency of people changing their furniture. Nowadays, the frequency of replacing furniture in Azerbaijan is 15-20 years, while in Turkey it is 7.5 years, and between four and five years in Europe. This will consequently lead to an increase in domestic demand. Competition from Turkish companies in the market is increasing year by year. A similar situation can be observed in the foreign markets we are active in. However, Embawood stands above its competitors because of the high quality of its products. Another advantage for us in foreign markets is that we are a well-known brand already. Our strategy is to stand behind our products and be close to our customers, and that has brought us consumer loyalty, creating a strong relationship between both parties.</p><h4>How do you ensure high quality standards at every stage of the production chain?</h4><p>Embawood takes its quality controls very seriously in all spheres of its business activity and the production process. Therefore, we assess raw materials from our suppliers, we supervise materials during the whole production process, we test our products, and above all we ensure customer satisfaction. We have paid special attention to two key aspects: the quality demanded by our customers and that required by international standards and norms. These two criteria contain the basis of our quality assurance system. In terms of production, at the end of the manufacturing process the completed products have to pass various tests in our quality-assurance laboratories. In addition to the production process and the equipment we use, which has been purchased from leading European companies such as HOMAG and Bürkle, we have the capacity to employ the right kind of human resources. We regularly send our staff on courses and relevant training seminars so they can broaden their skills and improve their qualifications. At the same time, the standardization of workshops is one of the major aspects improving the quality of our products. Finally, after the product is delivered to a customer, mutual relations are built and we rapidly resolve any deficiency or mismatch found after the sale.</p><h4>Where do you see the company in five years?</h4><p>Our company's business strategy covers the period between 2010 and 2015. The major development priority of our strategy is to focus on our customers and to further develop our distribution channels. Our aim of focusing on the customer is to provide high-quality innovative products, to develop new service areas, to increase brand loyalty, and to apply different elements of retailing. At the same time, we intend to increase the range of our products. We are also planning to take certain measures in managing warehouses, logistics, and distribution channels, so we can provide faster and higher-quality services, and optimize the management system of our warehouse distribution network.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[From Up High]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[from-up-high]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has driven the 13% growth rate the ICT sector experienced in 2011?</h4><p>The ICT sector has been acknowledged as one of the priorities of the national economy. The sector's current share of GDP is about 3.5%, which is twice the ratio of 2005. Sector revenues increased by 13% in 2011 compared to 2010, and this is twice as high as we initially expected. Such an outcome has been possible thanks to the government's long-term visionary strategy, various state programs and projects, the promotion of competition in the sector, and a favorable investment environment. Also, I have to emphasize the proficient performance of local entrepreneurs as they practice an innovative and competent approach to business development in local and regional markets.</p><h4>What role have foreign investors played in developing the sector?</h4><p>Both foreign and local investors have turned the ICT sector into a sound competitive environment. Over the last decade, $3 billion has been invested in the sector and 25% of this amount has come from foreign investors over the last seven years. This investment has played an important role in the modernization of telecoms infrastructure, particularly mobile communications, and the development of advanced technology. Today, foreign companies enjoy a favorable legal framework to set up their businesses in Azerbaijan. Many incentives have been set by the government to simplify business registration procedures. The World Bank's Doing Business 2011 report positioned Azerbaijan quite well in starting up a business, registering property, protecting investors, the enforcement of contracts, and access to credit. More progress is being made on the registration period for foreign companies and the development of e-service applications.</p><h4>Azerbaijan will launch its first communications satellite in 2012. What does this achievement represent for the development of the country?</h4><p>The Azerspace satellite is aimed at upgrading the quality of TV broadcasting and telecommunications not only in Azerbaijan but throughout Eurasia, and will lead Azerbaijan into becoming a major relay site for signal transmissions between Europe and Asia. The satellite's footprint will cover Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Africa. We are going to use only one-fourth of its capacity, while the rest will be available for lease. Azercosmos, the government-owned national satellite operator, plans to launch a second satellite in 2015, which will further expand Azerbaijan's satellite communications capacity. Azercosmos also plans to launch a remote sensing satellite into low Earth orbit, which will enhance and accelerate Azerbaijan's capacity in the areas of environmental protection, agriculture, topography, and national security.</p><h4>What targets has your Ministry set to increase internet and broadband penetration?</h4><p>Broadband in Azerbaijan is constantly expanding, and we are seeing an ongoing increase in the number of subscribers. The full digitalization of the fixed-line network has been successfully completed, providing high-quality accessibility. Also, in recent years, broadband has become more affordable since the Ministry has worked closely with the relevant agencies to adjust the pricing. We initiated the AzDataKom network to expand broadband service access of at least 10 Gbps to all of Azerbaijan's regions. In addition, the wholesale distributers Delta Telecom and Azertelecom have significantly contributed to increasing internet bandwidth. We have developed an action plan that complies with the International Telecommunication Union's vision and aims to gradually expand broadband infrastructure over the 2012-2015 period.</p><h4>How will Azerbaijan benefit from the two main regional projects it participates in: the Trans-Eurasian Information Super Highway (TASIM) and the Europe-Persia Express Gateway (EPEG) Agreement?</h4><p>Both projects are key in turning Azerbaijan into a transit corridor, which is a vital part of the government's vision of utilizing the country's lucrative geography as much as we can. TASIM is an initiative of the government that was raised during a ministerial summit held within the framework of the BakuTel exhibition in November 2008. The project is a major regional initiative aimed at the creation of a transnational fiber-optic backbone targeting primarily the countries of Eurasia, from Western Europe to China. It envisages the building of an information superhighway that more than 20 countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia will benefit from. On December 21, 2009, the 64th session of the UN General Assembly adopted the Resolution on TASIM (A/Res/64/186). The Resolution acknowledges the role of Azerbaijan in the coordination of the initiative. In July 2011, in Gabala, as an outcome of this preparatory work, Azerbaijan hosted the first meeting on TASIM, with the participation of leading telecom operators from Azerbaijan, China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkey, and the EU. The last meeting was held in November 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey and I look forward to seeing many other players joining the project. EPEG is another successful ongoing project that will start in Frankfurt, Germany and reach Oman passing through Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan, and Iran via large-capacity, high-quality communication channels. Azerbaijan is a part of the project both as a main and alternative route holder. The design capacity of the new EPEG system will be up to 3.2 Tbps with a total length of approximately 10,000 kilometers, with around 9,500 kilometers being terrestrial fiber-optic cable. The system will be put into operation in May, 2012, with an initial capacity of 540 Gbps. The proposed route is about 3,000 kilometers shorter than the submarine connection between Europe and Asia. EPEG will allow a telecommunication transit route alternative to the Red Sea, Suez Canal, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea regions and can play an important role for traffic re-routing in case of earthquakes and disasters, which have been known to affect multiple systems at once.</p><h4>How will mobile number portability affect the sector?</h4><p>Through the recommendations of the Ministry in 2011, the mobile operators have switched to a new manat-based billing system, thereby ending the major complaints of subscribers giving them permission to properly manage their phone calls and control their ongoing balance. We have also recommended that the operators complete all the procedures regarding mobile number portability by 2013. We have studied the impact of the legislative framework of mobile number portability in various countries, and we have carried out analyses in that regard. Right now, a special legislative norm has been drafted by the Ministry and sent to the mobile operators for their consideration. I believe that the new framework will have a positive effect on the market, creating fair and healthy competition between operators, and attract new investments. It should also increase the number, reliability, and quality of mobile services. So far, we can state that currently the cell phone penetration rate is 110%.</p><h4>What are the main ICT challenges Azerbaijan faces with the organization of international events such as Eurovision 2012?</h4><p>The 2012 Eurovision Song Contest is a superb opportunity for our country in terms of promotion in many fields. However, it also carries responsibilities and challenges, and in this regard we have developed an action plan to provide high-quality telecommunications, internet, and television services. Work has already begun in terms of software, web, and content development, as well as online security. At the same time, we have to make sure that the availability of telecommunications services, mobile infrastructure, and 3G and Wi-Fi services can cope with bandwidth demand. Having said that, we firmly believe that the infrastructure in place will guarantee the success of the event from a technological point of view.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[On the Move]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[on-the-move]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your history in the mobile telecoms industry?</h4><p>I have been in the telecoms business for more than 20 years and led the development of such companies as Nokia in several senior executive positions, in Orange Austria as Managing Director, and at Comium Mobile with four mobile operations in Africa as Group CEO. I took the leadership of Nar Mobile as a result of my extensive experience in the senior management of several mobile operations in Europe and on the African continent. Over this time I got to know how to predict market movements and how to overcome problems in many different situations and atmospheres. The most important characteristic in our sector is innovation and having a clear business strategy. Prior to my arrival in Azerbaijan, I had been leading four different operations in West Africa, where we applied innovative strategies that turned us into a leading company. Innovation is a key word for success nowadays, and now I am trying to apply all my experience to Nar Mobile and the Azerbaijani market. I must say that I like Azerbaijan very much. I am very impressed to see Azerbaijan so developed and Azerbaijanis being well-educated and hospitable people. People in Azerbaijan are very friendly, and what is more important for me is that they are technology friendly. People here try to use the latest technologies as much as possible, be it in mobile communications or any other field. They are curious about all new developments and innovations. Azerbaijanis tend to show great interest in education, technology, computers, and the internet. This is really great.</p><h4>What were Nar Mobile's results like in 2011?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's mobile market saw important movements in 2011. Our Nar Mobile brand is known in the market as the most transparent, innovative, and affordable mobile communication services provider. Unlike our competitors we never used kontors (units), which is an outdated and non-transparent practice for customers. Finally, in 2011 our competitors were forced to move to manat-based payment models, and that made the price competition very intense. In 2011 we invested more than $80 million on major network modernization to deliver the best customer experience to our subscribers. We also invested in the enhancement of our sales and distribution capabilities, and introduced Nar Dünyası (Nar World) sales and service centers under a new modern concept, which is a customer-oriented approach in sales.</p><p>We also strengthened the image of our brand by getting Eurovision 2011 winners El &amp; Nikki to become the faces of Nar Mobile. As a result we showed solid progress in 2011 by increasing our revenues by more than 20%, increasing our market share by 2%, and reducing our churn rate significantly. We have also added to our profile of innovative products and solutions. At BakuTel 2011 we announced our partnership with Azerbaijan Airlines to launch mobile communication services on all aircraft. This will be possible as a result of an exclusive agreement with OnAir, the world's leading inflight connectivity solutions provider. We also presented the latest mobile health solutions that allow our customers to use data services for their health assessment needs. In 2012 our customers will be able to check their blood pressure and temperature with their mobile phones. Also, for the first time in the CIS region, Nar Mobile is introducing the “FutureLab" project, which is an innovation and research center to produce multimedia applications and other customer-tailored solutions in the local market. Nar Mobile is now a very dynamic and young company with new services and products, clearer messages in the market, and one of the most modern networks in the CIS.</p><h4>What role has Nar Mobile played in developing and strengthening the overall ICT sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>I strongly believe in Nar Mobile as a brand and company that has had an important impact on the overall sector. First of all, it has showed to the market and customers what it is to be a transparent operator, as we never used kontors. Second, in 2009 we introduced 3G services in Azerbaijan, which is a very important milestone in the development of mobile communication services. As you know, the introduction of new services requires some time for customers to learn what the service is about before they start using it actively. We managed this challenge successfully, as nowadays the majority of customers know what the benefits of 3G services are. In that regard, our competitors that started offering 3G services only few months ago have a good advantage as the ground work was laid by us.</p><p>With our 3G services the local media market saw another innovation when Khazar TV started 3G-based live broadcasting of its news for the first time in Azerbaijan using our 3G network. Nar Mobile has played a very strong role since the beginning of 2011 in stimulating market development, strengthening transparency, and driving innovation.</p><h4>Since Nar Mobile was the first mobile operator to launch 3G services in the country, what are your prospects for technologies such as 4G or LTE?</h4><p>With the network modernization to be completed soon, we will be ready for provision of LTE services. We plan to become the first 4G mobile operator in the region. This will definitely be a serious breakthrough in the development of the ICT sector in Azerbaijan. It will increase access to mobile broadband tremendously for people in Azerbaijan. Also, this would allow us to further expand the latest mobile technologies in various projects such as in e-government, mobile health, and mobile education applications. The early launch of Nar Mobile's LTE services will open the door for far more innovative services. The key in all of this will be innovation to differentiate; without innovation in the telecoms business you cannot succeed, especially in a market such as Azerbaijan, which is fully penetrated.</p><h4>How will the new mobile number portability  (MNP) law change the market?</h4><p>The introduction of MNP in 2012 in Azerbaijan will contribute to the dynamics of the market: fairness and competition will be enforced. A customer can move to any mobile operator without changing their number. Our studies show that customers in Azerbaijan are quite loyal to their numbers and are reluctant to move to other operators even if that operator offers lower prices and better services. So far, this has strongly affected our success. I am confident that with MNP, Nar Mobile will gain even more customers due to our competitive advantage in price, service quality, and innovation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the first nine months of your tenure at Bakcell been?</h4><p>It has been a very active period. The market has gone through some significant changes. As I joined there was a switch in the market from a kontor (unit) system to a manat-based credit system of payment, which was a seismic shift that saw prices drop quite considerably. Our main competitor dropped its prices very significantly, which put a lot of pressure on the market, but overall, we have performed very strongly in 2011; the number of subscribers is up, revenues are up, and our profit margins are very healthy. All in all, I am very pleased with the performance. We recently launched 3G and it has been very successful. We had over half a million customers within three days, which we were extremely pleased about, and it shows the real potential for mobile data services here in Azerbaijan. We think there is significant pent-up demand, and Bakcell is well positioned to meet it. The response we have seen from our customers proves that they also believe we hold a strong position in the market. We think our users are probably the largest body of true mobile internet users in Azerbaijan at the moment, which is a great achievement.</p><h4>What does 3G technology unlock for the future of the sector?</h4><p>We analyzed traffic over the first few days and weeks after launching the technology and found that around 60% of customers were using 3G to surf the internet and use applications, such as Facebook and YouTube. Fortunately, we have not been bitten by data-intensive downloads and we are really pleased that customers are using the terminals for what they are there for, which is exploring the internet, using internet-based services, and checking email. The overall experience seems to be that customers are getting fast internet access from Bakcell and are utilizing these services.</p><h4>Is Bakcell eyeing 4G?</h4><p>At the last BakuTel conference we demonstrated commercial 4G in a full pre-commercial deployment. A Long Term Evolution (LTE) system has been deployed on our network. We have an existing spectrum, which we can mutualize, and we strongly believe that there is a potential market here. However, we want to grow the 3G-user market first, because it represents a very significant investment. It is important to build up this market and increase 3G awareness before making the move into fast remote-complex technology. At BakuTel we were able to achieve download speeds in excess of 100 Mbps, and we demonstrated full-HD TV streaming over mobile internet using LTE technology. We see important potential and opportunities in services like video on demand and catch-up TV rather than mobile TV. However, looking at European markets it seems as though the revenue potential for cell phones is not so significant. In that regard, tablet computers are where the greatest opportunities are for the future.</p><h4>What are your expectations for mobile number portability (MNP)?</h4><p>I think MNP is definitely of benefit to the market. We are very committed to the introduction of MNP. It's been shown in other markets to increase customer choice, which is always a good thing. For us, we see a significant opportunity to attack the corporate segment and also the national business segment. Bakcell's revenues and profits mostly come from the consumer market, but we see opportunities to move into the big international corporates and also big national businesses operating in Azerbaijan, which for one reason or another generally have accounts with our competitors. We think the credibility we have built up in the consumer market puts us in a very good position to move into those segments.</p><h4>What is your split between pre-paid and post-paid subscribers, and in which segment are you seeing the strongest growth?</h4><p>Overall the market is 96% pre-paid and 4% post-paid, though we have a slightly higher proportion of post-paid customers than the market average. Pre-paid is the segment that is showing the strongest growth right now. From my experience in Western European markets, everyone focuses heavily on post-paid, because those customers have been tied in with long-term contracts. However, that's not the dynamic in this market. In Azerbaijan, contracts can be terminated with a month's notice on the part of the customer, so post-paid only buys you one month's loyalty, unlike Western Europe where it is between a year and 24 months. Therefore, in Azerbaijan pre-paid and post-paid are much more just a means of payment rather than defining customer types.</p><h4>How is the company working to promote mobile internet services?</h4><p>Bakcell is an exclusive partner of Facebook, and we recently signed on as exclusive partner of Opera Mini, the most popular mobile browser that is not pre-loaded onto mobiles and works with almost all brands as well. We also have a partnership with Twitter. We are committed to bringing the mobile internet experience to our customers, whether they are pre- or post-paid.</p><h4>What level of coverage does your network provide for its subscribers nationwide?</h4><p>We operate with around 99% population coverage, which translates to around 92% geographic coverage. We cover all the main cities with 3G, around 62 cities to be precise. Bakcell is constantly deploying additions to its network across Azerbaijan. Bakcell will continue investing to support having the best network in the country.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the sector for 2012?</h4><p>We believe 2012 will be the year when data technology takes off. The increasing availability of smartphones as well as the availability of terminals are driving market behavior in Azerbaijan. Thanks to second-hand phones coming from the European market, prices are also decreasing. The more smartphones there are, the more internet users there will be. That is also one of the reasons why Bakcell is investing heavily in 3G.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been Azercell's contribution to the development of the mobile sector?<br></h4><p>From the very beginning of its operations, Azercell has played a monumental role in bringing in and integrating the latest ICT technology into Azerbaijan. Azercell is the first mobile operator to cover almost 100% of the population, including subways and oil rigs out in the Caspian Sea. Azercell has pioneered an important number of innovations in Azerbaijan, including the first 24/7 customer center, Blackberry service, missed call alert, one-stop-shop service offices, online customer services, RFID technologies, GPS navigation, and more. Back in 1998, Azercell introduced pre-paid services to the market, making it one of the first in the world to do so. This innovative payment method opened up the mobile world to millions of low-income people and boosted mobile penetration. Azercell's one-stop shop offices—Azercell Express—now number 38, of which 22 are in the regions of Azerbaijan. The world-class service standards implemented by us are an example for other international companies providing such services in our country. We have also established the first innovation incubation center—called “Barama," or Cocoon—in the region, and a 4G research laboratory at Qafqaz University.</p><h4>Azercell is the main partner of Eurovision 2012. How will the company assist in such a major event?</h4><p>This is a great opportunity for Azerbaijan to introduce the country to many foreign visitors that will come for the event. Being a presenting partner of the Eurovision Song Contest and promoting Azerbaijan's image is an honor for us as a company. We shall provide all the support needed in this regard. This is a great achievement for the country, and we are happy to share this joy and happiness with our people. This project doesn't bring any commercial benefit for the company, moreover, we are going to spend even more of our human, financial, and technical resources to make sure that all visitors will have the best technological experience that any company in the world can provide. Being the leading innovator in the country in our field gives us an opportunity to present a wide range of our products and services at the highest level.</p><h4>What projects are you developing to further Azercell's growth and presence in the sector?</h4><p>At the moment the focus is on increasing mobile data in the country, and ensuring that the country has high-speed 3G Max presented by Azercell. At the same time, in May 2012, right before the Eurovision Song Contest, we are planning to provide LTE technology and we have already agreed with the Ministry of Communications and Information Technologies that a 4G license will be issued to us due to the importance of the event. We also feel obliged to be the first to introduce this service to the Azerbaijani people. As you know, our main shareholder, the Teliasonera Group of Companies, was the first in the world to introduce 4G, and it is very logical that we should be the first one to introduce it to our people. Moreover, we intend to increase the number of one-stop-shop offices in order to get even closer to our customers in case they need any assistance.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the mobile sector in Azerbaijan for 2012?</h4><p>This year will be very special for Azerbaijan, as the country is hosting the biggest event in its history, the Eurovision Song Contest. As the main sponsor of the event, Azercell will ensure that both our guests from abroad and our customers in the country enjoy a seamless and impeccable mobile communication experience and also get special promotions and services dedicated to the event. Apart from that, in 2012, mobile number portability (MNP) will be introduced as required by the regulator, which will add a new dimension to competition in this sector. We hope that the competition will increase and be based on value-adding, which is essential for healthy industry growth and the timely introduction of new technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[speed-it-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Delta become Azerbaijan's primary provider of ICT services?</h4><p>The company was founded in 2000 and we began to work on the establishment of a corporate network. Our first major project was the construction of a Satellite HUB station, and we put into operation the VSAT Network—a satellite communications network—the same year we started our operations. That was a very successful project that opened important doors for us. Delta Telecom has created the biggest internet backbone in the Caucasus region, providing international access via fiber optics and satellite channels. This IP backbone infrastructure provides the optimal management of high-speed internet capacities, and traffic sharing happens through high-capacity routing platforms. To provide high-capacity communication services we built DWDM, SDH, and Metro Ethernet networks. These projects have contributed to the company's growth and helped us to gain a regional reputation and become a reliable global partner. Also, in 2010 Delta Telecom started building a data center with the aim of developing internet resources in Azerbaijan. This data center is currently operating at 10% of its capacity and we have plans to further develop local internet resources. Delta Telecom will also secure communication services for Eurovision, which will be one of the most important events in Azerbaijan in 2012.</p><h4>What are the main strategies Delta Telecom is implementing to develop its data center, and what is the importance of such infrastructure?</h4><p>In our network a few years ago we imported most capacities for regional internet users. After building a data center we not only import capacities, we also produce national internet resources. Our infrastructure uses the most modern and high-level technology. It is set to become the biggest in the Caucasus region. Our data center offers businesses and individual customers web hosting, an email application, domain support, virtual servers, and special dedicated servers, TV channels over the internet, and data backup and restoration. We are currently developing the data center and we are planning to steadily expand its capacity.</p><h4>What impact will Azerbaijan's accession to the Europe-Persia Express Gateway (EPEG) project have?</h4><p>The EPEG project is a high-capacity, low-latency cable system that will link Frankfurt, Germany, to Oman via Russia, Azerbaijan, and Iran. Delta Telecom is taking part in the project on behalf of Azerbaijan, after reaching an agreement with the other EPEG partners: Iran's TIC, Oman's Omantel, and Rostelecom of Russia. This project will become a reality by mid-2012 and will play an important role in expanding the capacity of the internet in Azerbaijan and increasing the volume of internet capacities. It is a key project for the country, because it will support the existing submarine cable lines. It is expected to link the EPEG project's Middle East networks to European networks over terrestrial areas of around 4 Tbps.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Azerbaijan's role as a regional technological hub in the future?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a very suitable place to become a regional hub, both geographically and economically. Also, the policies implemented by the Azerbaijani government at the international level are definitely contributing to the establishment of our country as the main regional hub. Investment is flowing into the country in many different sectors, with ICT a leading attraction, thanks to the political stability the country is enjoying. Therefore, the business environment is perfect for foreign companies to open operations in the region and establish Azerbaijan as a regional center.</p><h4>How would you rate internet implementation and usage in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Delta Telecom is committed to bringing the highest standards of internet services to Azerbaijan, with a particular focus on fiber optics. In that regard, we are implementing a project that will see the installation of hundreds of kilometers of fiber-optic cables across Baku that we expect will cover most buildings in the city. Our best customers are internet service providers (ISPs), and we are working closely with them on such projects. This system is definitely going to boost internet usage in Baku. Also, the implementation of projects like this one, as well as the consolidation of 3G services across the country, will increase data transfer volumes. Altogether, we expect 2012 to be a very important year for the sector, with data taking off and a potential 40% increase in the number of broadband users in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What are Delta Telecom's main growth strategies?</h4><p>Since the company was established more than 10 years ago, we have experienced a growth rate of about 40% every year. Our main target is to keep up that kind of growth for the next three to four years, because the sector is still young and offers interesting opportunities for the companies involved in it to develop further services and strategies. At the same time, our company is seeking to develop its relationship with foreign companies. Regarding ongoing projects, the data center and the implementation of the EPEG project will definitely be the focus of our attention in 2012. Along with such important growth, the company has been expanding its manpower and we currently employ 150 people. That will continue to be a trend in the near future because we expect to hire around 200 more staff just for the EPEG project. In that regard, we have started to work along with the Azerbaijan Technical University and Alcatel to provide specialized training courses.</p><h4>What is the significance of Delta Telecom securing the online resources for Eurovision 2012?</h4><p>Delta Telecom is a communications partner of Eurovision 2012, and we are working very hard to provide the best communication and internet services for the event and its participants and guests. We will be providing broadcast services for the entire world during the contest.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Up, Up & Away]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[up-up-away]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have passenger numbers evolved over the years?</h4><p>In recent years, we have observed that our predictions were completely justified; we have experienced a significant increase in passenger traffic. While AZAL carried 989,096 passengers in 2010, the number of passengers using AZAL's services increased to 1,352,871 in 2011, which corresponds to almost 37% growth. Seasonality is of great significance, and is clearly reflected in the airline industry as a whole. The summer vacation season and major holidays such as the New Year and Novruz traditionally constitute the peak periods. On passenger flights, 4,944 tons of mail and cargo were also transported, which surpassed the 2010 figures by 12.5%. These are very good indicators for success in the future.</p><h4>What special measures will be implemented to prepare for Eurovision 2012?</h4><p>We expect growth in passenger traffic, not only exclusive to Eurovision, but in the period leading up to the event. Many viewers and fans of the competition will take advantage of the opportunity to travel by spending several weeks in the country to learn about our culture and traditions. This is due to the growing interest in Azerbaijan as a tourist destination. In the spirit of traditional Azerbaijani hospitality, AZAL is opening its doors up to visitors. On April 20, 2012, we will begin operating daily flights to Paris and Prague, and three flights to Rome and Milan. In early May 2012, AZAL plans to launch three daily flights to Istanbul's Sabiha Gökçen Airport. Unfortunately, the construction of the new international terminal at the Heydar Aliyev International Airport is not scheduled to be completed until 2013. However, the modernization of the existing airport complex will be fully completed before the arrival of our first Eurovision guests.</p><h4>How do you foresee Eurovision impacting the tourism sector and the country as a whole?</h4><p>Without a doubt, the contest will serve as an excellent stimulus for the development of the entire tourism industry. When tens of thousands of visitors arrive in the capital, they will witness contemporary Azerbaijan's numerous first-class hotels, recreation areas, resorts, beaches, and entertainment centers. They will also have the opportunity to learn about Azerbaijan's culture, monumental architecture, traditional music, and rich cuisine. Hopefully, they will come visit us again to share their vivid impressions from their visit with their family and friends. I would especially like to emphasize that the industry is prepared to host this large number of tourists. In Baku, famous global brands have opened hotels, the infrastructure has been modernized completely, and unique tourist programs have been developed in recent years.</p><h4>How do you expect the business activity to evolve with the launch of Gabala International Airport?</h4><p>The Gabala International Airport was opened on November 18, 2011. We are deeply convinced that several factors reveal the potential of Gabala, such as the Gabala Music Festival, the opening of several five-star hotels, and the magnificent natural beauty of the region. The airport is the gateway to one of the most popular destinations. AZAL is already negotiating with its partners in Russia to open regular flights from Moscow to Gabala. In the future, interest in passenger traffic to Gabala will definitely grow.</p><h4>How would you characterize the uptake of internet ticket sales?</h4><p>Online ticket sales for AZAL flights on the official website were launched in 2008. Since then, we have enjoyed a stable increase in online sales. However, this is an industry-wide phenomenon; over the last decade, online air ticket sales experienced rapid growth worldwide.</p><p>Year after year, this method of ticket purchasing became increasingly popular in tandem with the population's familiarization with non-cash payment methods. It is much more convenient than the usual visit to the sales agency, which is mutually beneficial as the online sales channel costs the company far less. In 2010, revenue from online ticket sales amounted to about ‚¬960,000. In 2011, that figure grew to ‚¬1.72 million, which corresponds to an increase of almost 80%.</p><h4>What are AZAL's current fleet modernization and route strategies?</h4><p>Currently, AZAL's fleet consists of 21 aircraft: four Boeing 757s, one Boeing 787, three Airbus A319s, seven Airbus A320s, four ATR 72s, and two ATR 42s. AZAL received its first Boeing 767 under contract from the Boeing Company, and it joined the fleet in June 2011. In May 2012, we expect to receive a second aircraft of this type. Furthermore, we expect to receive two next-generation aircraft from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner series in 2014. Along with the growth of our fleet, our route map will also expand. In the beginning of 2014, we have plans to open regular flights to the US and Southeast Asia.</p><h4>What do investments in personnel training and the aviation center signal regards AZAL's future expansion plans?</h4><p>We pay very close attention to the training of qualified personnel. On October 20, 2011, in partnership with Boeing Training and Flight Services at the Azerbaijan Academy of Civil Aviation, a modern training center for the staff was opened called AZAL Training. Our activity meets worldwide standards and this center will provide training for our air crew. In the near future, we are planning to introduce manual training simulations for helicopters. This center is unique in the region; AZAL Training will provide education for pilots from across the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p><h4>What are the main cargo types being imported and exported from Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The main imports are oil equipment, computer hardware, mobile phones and accessories, mobile communications equipment, auto parts, home appliances, consumer goods, and flowers. Our chief exports are oil, agro-products, and consumer goods.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[success-in-a-tough-arena]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Encotec's main strengths since it began operations?</h4><p>In the early years of Azerbaijan's independence, we saw many Western companies arriving in the country seeking local partnerships. These companies would carry out training courses aimed at building the skills and capacities of young Azerbaijani engineers. Thanks to the qualified workforce available in the country, we decided to set up an Azerbaijani engineering company focused on quality above everything else. In the early 2000s, we experienced very slow growth. However, once we became a part of BP's development plans, it propelled our growth and enhanced our reputation in the market. In 2005, we succeeded in signing a long-term contract with BP. The contract greatly increased our profile and heightened our understanding of BP's procedures, systems, and guidelines. All in all, it helped us meet Western standards and set our company apart from the local competition. We are now capable of developing projects realizing both Western and local standards, and this puts us in a position where it is very difficult to be challenged by local national competitors. Today, Encotec is a general engineering company providing multi-discipline design engineering, consulting, procurement, project management, fabrication, construction supervision, and commissioning services.</p><h4>What are Encotec's major ongoing projects?</h4><p>The company is primarily involved in the local and international oil and gas sector. However, the company's expertise extends beyond this sector to embrace the petrochemical, industrial, and utility sectors. At the same time, we are expanding our activities in the construction sector. We are involved in several major projects, one of which is the construction of a new shipyard, where we are responsible for full detailed design and project management. This is a very challenging and fast-paced project and involves the management of numerous sub-contractors. Another major project we are participating in is the detailed design and author supervision of a new plant in Azerbaijan. Furthermore, our ongoing contract with BP for engineering modifications provides us with a continuous stream of small- and medium-scale projects.</p><h4>Encotec has recently opened regional offices in Kazakhstan and Georgia. What are the company's strategies to increase its activities outside the Azerbaijani market?</h4><p>We are still in the early stages for the development of our regional offices. Although we have been involved in some important projects so far, our activities in those markets have been completely driven by our office in Baku. Our aim is to strengthen our position as a unique company capable of working to international standards and simultaneously working toward understanding the local markets. In Kazakhstan we opened our offices in the industrial city of Aktau, where there is great potential in the oil and gas sector. Our local office in Georgia is relatively new and currently our only client there is BP. We hope that in the future we will have identified further clients and sectors that we can tap into to ensure the growth of the office. In the expansion of Encotec's business activities, human capital is crucial. For that reason, we have focused a lot of resources on our recruitment and training process over the past few years. We expect that the employees we hire will be with us for the long term, participating in the company's growth and expansion. We prioritize their adaptability and learning capacity, which will enable them to take part in different projects across all sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ANT Group has a substantial presence in the Azerbaijan construction market. What are some of the major projects that ANT Group has been involved with in the country?</h4><p>ANT group was established in 2002. When we started, we were involved in residential construction projects; we had one complex of five apartment blocks. Later on, we directed ourselves toward other areas of the construction sector, such as parking lots and different types of infrastructure. We complete our projects from A to Z, providing the cement, machinery, and all technical aspects, such as excavation techniques. We also develop the exteriors of our projects, providing such things as glass panneling. In Baku, for example, we are building an 18-story residential block in collaboration with the government. The building on the site was crumbling, and the residents were moved away for the duration of the construction. Even though all the flats weren't insured, the government took the initiative to provide the residents with housing while their new flats were being constructed. Another project, also under development in collaboration with the government, is the army academy. Furthermore, we are developing a campus project in Dagestan for the Azerbaijan State Economic University, an Olympic complex with a hotel in its facilities, many different residential projects, and the Baku car market, among many others. I would like to stress the fact that all of our projects are developed in compliance with European and international standards. Overall, we aim to further diversify our business lines in the future, and one of the new areas we are entering is furniture making.</p><h4>ANT Group has also spread its construction operations overseas to countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Libya. How has this experience been?</h4><p>Following the achievements gained in the internal market and taking into account the high-level of demand for construction works abroad, our company entered the foreign market by bidding for both state and private sector tenders in Russia and Libya. Our aim is to provide contractor work abroad. Our operations in Libya suffered a setback with the onset of the recent turmoil. We also have a few projects in Russia, but our focus is mainly in Azerbaijan. Whichever field or country our company operates in, our mission is to guarantee quality, confidence, and customer satisfaction while strictly complying with health and safety standards. The ANT Group of companies has fulfilled customer requirements and expectations in terms of quality and design, applying the latest technological developments in engineering and architecture. We lay secure foundations in accordance with the latest and best developments in the sector. We aim to establish strong alliances both in Azerbaijan and abroad with our business partners to develop a long-term strategy plan for investment in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What makes the Azerbaijani construction market unique?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is moving closer to European standards in terms of construction. Our aim is to reach these standards in the construction of buildings, and protect Azeri architecture, which has a long and vast tradition. Therefore, we always aim at merging modern technologies in the construction sector with a certain leaning toward Azerbaijan's architectural heritage. In this regard, we have played a significant role in establishing a high level of standards and our company was awarded the International Quality Management Certificates ISO 9001:2000 in 2005, and OHSAS 18001 in 2007.</p><h4>What are the challenges Azerbaijan faces in the construction sector?</h4><p>Of course, in every area, there are some challenges. The global economic crisis also affected Azerbaijan. However, we are considered trustworthy; we always keep our promises, and deliver our orders on time. Having a whole group of companies working in the same sector enables us to develop any project from A to Z, and that's something that sets us apart as well. These days it is hard to sell apartments because home loan interest rates are still high. I strongly believe that they should be reduced a little more, which would boost the market. The government is taking care of the issue, talking with the Central Bank, and trying to make it easier for people to buy their own homes. I would like to add that the ANT Group of companies is an important player within the real estate sector through ANT Realtor, a company that was established more than eight years ago. Our main advantages are price, fast registration, safety, and legal clarity.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the construction sector over the medium term?</h4><p>We will be working over vast tracts of land to develop private homes in Baku in the near future. Also, we are planning the construction of businesses and shopping centers. Altogether, it will be an important part of the future urban development of Baku, a city that has modernized its landscape in the last few years and will further do so in the future, thanks to the growth of the construction sector in our country. As for our group of companies, we are one of only eight companies that have a governmental construction license, and this is a huge benefit that we are determined to take advantage of, for in the last years we have gained the trust of all Azerbaijani people thanks to our projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AzVirt LLC has grown from a family business to a major company handling large projects. What factors have driven the company's growth over the years?</h4><p>Since its foundation in 1995, AzVirt LLC has proved to be one of the most reliable companies in Azerbaijan, as a result of the professionalism of its staff and our use of advanced technologies. The core business activities of our company consist of building and repairing roads and airport runways, and producing materials for road construction.</p><p>The best illustration of AzVirt LLC's story is the projects we have successfully handled over the years and the highly qualified employees we have. Currently, we have about 1,500 full-time employees, including German and Turkish specialists in road construction. Since our foundation, we have heavily invested in developing the skills of our staff through in-service staff training opportunities. And that has been palpable in the projects we have developed, because AzVirt LLC has been a very innovative company within the construction sector, bringing in new technologies, thanks in part to our German partner. We have achieved a lot during these years, and now account for about 30% of the market. Our aim is to continue in this direction.</p><h4>What are some of AzVirt LLC's flagship projects?</h4><p>All the projects we have developed over the years are very important for us, because our aim is to provide the highest level of quality in every single project we handle. AzVirt LLC has participated as a prime contractor in the implementation of numerous projects. Initially, the company focused its business activity basically in the capital, Baku city, and with time we were entrusted with the development of many important projects in Azerbaijan such as the construction of highways connecting different major cities to parts of country, the realization of projects in Ganja, Lankaran, and Zagatala, the access road to Heydar Aliyev International Airport and the expansion and modernization of its infrastructure, the reconstruction of Ganja International Airport, and the construction of the Gabala Airport. Quality, timing, and design set AzVirt LLC apart from its other competitors in the sector, and thanks to this quality our company has managed to gain the sector's trust.</p><h4>What were the market factors that led AzVirt LLC to start producing construction materials?</h4><p>AzVirt LLC has always aimed to put its special signature on its projects in terms of design and handing over the project within the time agreed. Therefore, setting up our own production facilities was a natural step along the company's growth curve; it allows us to rely on our own capacities and make our projects and finances more efficient. We currently produce 700,000-800,000 tons of asphalt per year, and we have a strong and solid production base, which includes asphalt machines made in Germany such as the WIBAU, with a capacity of 200 tons per hour, the LINTEC CSD 2500/5/50, at 160 tons per hour, the LINTEC CSD 1500/4, at 120 tons per hour, and the SIM CB 210, at 210 tons per hour. We also have stone crushing and screening machinery, foreign-made asphalt pavers, rollers, graders (the BMK—832 and BMK—280 models), dump trucks, milling machines, vehicles for bitumen transport and cement supply, loaders, and other specialized machinery for road construction.</p><h4>What were the market factors that encouraged AzVirt LLC to go international?</h4><p>In 2011, and for the first time in the company's history, we decided to expand our activities abroad because the company's current capacity and size enables us to do so. At the moment, we are developing infrastructure projects in Romania and Serbia, but we aim to expand our international portfolio and we are keen to take on projects in Eastern European countries such as Bulgaria. I would like to add that AzVirt LLC is the first Azerbaijani company to win an infrastructure project tender in any European country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were Safe Life's main goals when it was established in 2007?</h4><p>The basic principles of Safe Life's activity are to ensure fire safety, to arrange training for fire prevention and emergency situations, and to avoid casualties and the loss of material possessions. It is noteworthy that the goals set during the establishment of the company have been achieved. However, it was not easy to achieve because citizens are inexperienced in this sphere, and this fact considerably complicated the situation. Over the years we have widened the scope of our services and today we can declare with confidence that our company can render highly professional services both in fire and alarm protection systems, including not only detection, but also solutions, by means of gas, water, and foam firefighting systems. We can also find complex technical solutions for all kind of projects, providing clients with complete fire-fighting systems including alarms, extinguishers, ventilation, access control, fire doors, notification systems, and evacuation equipment.</p><h4>How has Safe Life contributed to improving fire safety in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>After independence, the country was still dependent on fire prevention systems built on Russian norms and rules. At present, the sector is being reconstructed and the standards are being updated. Now, European standards, as well as some modern Russian standards, are in play.</p><h4>How closely do you cooperate with Azerbaijan's Ministry of Emergency Situations?</h4><p>We have very close business relations with the Ministry of Emergency Situations, and we make great effort to justify the trust that the Ministry has placed in us. We are the only company in Azerbaijan that owns all four licenses necessary for the design, installation, manufacture, and sale of fire safety equipment. Along with the Ministry of Emergency Situations and other state organizations, there are many private engineering firms and organizations that we count among our clients.</p><h4>Since the company imports security products from Turkey and Europe, what potential has Azerbaijan to become a producer of such products?</h4><p>We import security products from different countries, including Germany, Austria, the UK, the US, Spain, Italy, Japan, Turkey, and Russia. We then offer them to our customers. They fully comply with the quality standards we require, which at the end of the day is one of the main goals of our company. We provide the best quality to our clients and gain their trust and satisfaction. Manufacturing is among our future goals. We would be thrilled to offer our clients products made in Azerbaijan. At the moment, we are working hard on this issue, and want to be ready for this task in the future.</p><h4>How do you plan to expand the company from this point on?</h4><p>One of the main goals of Safe Life is to focus on ensuring the non-stop and efficient operation of surveillance systems on the Absheron Peninsula. Our customers' facilities remain under surveillance 24/7. This is one aspect that has led us to receive requests from all corners of the country. In the near future, we plan to expand our range of services in centralized monitoring and carry out surveillance in all the regions of the country. Finally, we plan to expand to international markets, and at the moment we are working on a strategy to introduce new equipment. We expect to soon export fire cabinets and fire extinguishers manufactured by Safe Life in Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

In 1981, encouraged by late President Turgut Özal, he shifted his base of operations to Ankara and founded the Etsun company. He continued to be active in international trade, building up a network of companies spanning much of the Middle East, and centralized his activities in the UAE in 1992. In 1994, he established the Intersun company in Dubai, dealing in international trade between South Asia, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Switzerland.

		<url><![CDATA[a-diversified-approach]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Azersun Holding's profile changed since its inception?<br></h4><p>Azersun Holding is an enterprise that strategically produces foods that consumers can rely on. Consumer confidence is one of our most valuable criteria, and at the same time it distinguishes us from our competitors. The economic policies implemented by the government were able to protect our local companies from the crisis. However, the difficulties faced by our foreign partners, from whom we purchased raw materials throughout the crisis, affected our business in various ways. We took on a diversified approach to our manufacturing activities to support our companies during that period. In addition, the great value of our products has been recognized throughout the CIS region, one of our main export markets. Today, our companies are involved in a wide range of business activities such as agriculture, FMCG, construction, banking, transport, and energy.</p><h4>How is your network able to cover the whole territory of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>As a leading group of companies in the region, Azersun Holding has developed a very strong distribution network. Our companies distribute products throughout the Caucasus, with a representative office in each region closely cooperating with our partners. I firmly believe that this is one of our primary strengths that sets us apart from our competitors.</p><h4>What role does domestic and international demand play in the company's current strategies?</h4><p>One of our main aims is to achieve a very important, leading position in foreign markets, especially in Georgia and the CIS region. The large production capacity of our enterprises enables us to be the leader in food production in Azerbaijan. On top of that, foreign markets appreciate the top quality of our products, and this is the main reason our export figures are growing rapidly.</p><h4>What are the main markets Azersun exports to and where do you see opportunities to expand your business activities?</h4><p>Presently, the main countries on our export map are Russia, Georgia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. We also export to the Middle East, as well as study the markets in a number of European countries and the US. These countries also enjoy our products. We will enter the European and US markets with some of our products in the coming years.</p><h4>What competitive advantages do your products offer?</h4><p>Quality is our main aim. In all our factories, there is modern and advanced technology developed to harness the quality of our productive fields. These factors have given us important advantages, which have been directly reflected in our production process. All of our companies operate under ISO and HASP standards. We develop our products at every stage of the manufacturing process, from the fields to the kitchen table. The professional specialists from the analysis and development department create products that match our consumer needs. Each of our brands is as dear to us as our children. We recognize that our brands are labeled “made in Azerbaijan," and this makes our responsibility two fold.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for foreign investment in the food-processing sector?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a country with great history and rich culture, and it also has bountiful natural resources and scenery. The comfortable investment conditions established by the government are attractive for both companies and individuals. President Ilham Aliyev has paid special attention and concern to the development of the non-oil sectors of the country, and I believe the business and investment opportunities are continuously expanding in Azerbaijan. New fields and sectors are appearing; there is a range of opportunities in a number of areas, including agriculture and agro-industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Delta Group come about?</h4><p>The successful developmental reforms led by President Ilham Aliyev have created opportunities for entrepreneurs and businessmen in our country, who then contributed to further professionalizing their organizations as well expanding their business activities. Under these circumstances, Delta Group was established in 1999 and today we hold wide experience in Azerbaijan's trading system; we have companies operating in different sectors such as exports, production, distribution, logistics, and business consulting. The aim of grouping them under the same umbrella was to use our resources more effectively, and at the same time ensure professional management standards. The fact that we have been working and providing services for such a long time in trade and the FMCG sector sets us apart from our competitors. We have been functioning both in Azerbaijan and in foreign countries for more than 12 years, and today we are the official representative in Azerbaijan of many worldwide brands and companies.</p><h4>What is the percentage of production activities in your overall business volume?</h4><p>Production represents around 50% of our overall activities. We are planning to sign contracts with several foreign companies by the end of 2013, and the share of production in our overall activities is expected to increase, for it is a priority in our future plans. The BisMak Food Production Complex, located in the industrial area of Sumgait city, was opened in December 2006. The complex includes a three-story office building, a biscuit factory with six production lines, a pasta factory with three production lines, and a modern mill complex and chocolate factory with three production lines. In that regard, leading specialists from Turkey and Russia have been invited to the BisMak Food Production Complex in order to boost international cooperation and increase those figures. In addition, our “Saglam Qida" (“Healthy Food") factory is expected to open in 2012, and this will increase our capacity in the second half of the year.</p><h4>Delta Group is building a pastry factory that will produce over 40 types of bread and pastries. What market factors influenced this investment, and what are your current expectations for output?</h4><p>At present, the BisMak Food Production Complex makes flour, pasta, biscuit products in various types, and chocolate, which are high quality and greatly enjoyed by our customers. The next step forward was the production of bread. All of us know that bread is a strategic product worldwide. For the purposes of developing this area, we launched the so-called  “Safe Food" project, supported by the National Fund for Supporting Entrepreneurship. The production process in the factory will be based on the technology of leading German company Werner &amp; Pfleiderer, and in accordance with international standards. The factory, which will employ around 500 workers, will have a production capacity of 124 tons per day, and this figure is expected to rise to 200 tons by 2013. It will produce more than 40 different types of bread and flour.</p><h4>How can the company benefit from the expansion of infrastructure such as Baku's port and airport?</h4><p>The expansion of such infrastructures means the expansion of our business activities, especially for imports and exports. Above all, it will impact on the speed of such processes, and it will create broader opportunities for our logistics services. Delta Group is in the process of establishing the “Delta Logistics" center. The center will be equipped with modern technologies meeting international standards and will provide services to local and foreign companies. Delta Group is highly interested in the development of national and international infrastructure in Azerbaijan, and we fully support the government's policies in this direction.</p><h4>What are Delta Group's plans for the future?</h4><p>Delta Group has always been a development-oriented company and has actively sought to join nationwide projects. In addition to the bread factory, we are planning projects in the field of poultry and egg production, flour products, as well as chocolate and biscuits. In that regard, we have been holding talks with Swiss company Bühler. We aim to expand our import portfolio and bring even more internationally recognized brands to Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What role do domestic demand and exports play in the development of the company?</h4><p>In general, our activities are solely focused on meeting the demands of our customers. We pay particular attention to exports, for we aim to make Azerbaijan known in foreign countries by producing goods capable of being competitive in the global marketplace. We are currently exporting to countries including Russia, Israel, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Liberia, and Iraq. Delta Group has many international partners and we are currently cooperating with leading companies in countries such as New Zealand, Malaysia, Germany, Austria, Serbia, Russia, Latvia, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Colombia, Turkey, and Poland. For example, one of our many successful partnerships has been with Fonterra, from New Zealand, which is a world leader in producing butter and dairy foods. Delta Group has been representing Fonterra in Azerbaijan and other foreign countries for the last 11 years. In the future, we intend to expand cooperation with other European and Asian countries as well as to import products from countries in the CIS area.</p><h4>What's your outlook for the Azerbaijani market in the FMCG field for 2012?</h4><p>Over the last few years, the FMCG sector has continuously developed and we have seen an expansion of market chains and an increase in local production. In addition, many worldwide brands have entered the Azerbaijani market. All these factors have led to an expansion of Azerbaijani companies abroad, as they have been using their experience in the national market to widen the scope of their activities. Nowadays, you can also see foreign countries exporting goods produced in our country. I am very positive in terms of future expectations and I believe the sector will grow further in 2012 and beyond.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key reforms in the social sphere in Azerbaijan since you took office in 2006?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a country that gives high priority to targeted social principles, and is always mobilized to build a welfare society, creating economic opportunities for all people. Social reforms in the country have been aimed toward securing social justice, and ensuring equal and fair development in the social security system for all sections of the population. We also target favorable and effective employment opportunities and hope to see real growth in people's income, the development of qualified human capital and social infrastructure, as well as the protection of low-income citizens and evolution of a public-driven welfare system. Over the years we have been strengthening the social security system and improving the wage system in Azerbaijan as a result of the application of international experiences that we have been observing. Since mid-2006 Azerbaijan has applied state social support systems, and according to our data 120,478 families were receiving state social support at the end of 2011. Each family is paid an average of AZN106.45 per month. In the last few years we have improved the system by expanding its coverage and the type of assistance for poor families so that more families can benefit from these opportunities.</p><h4>Azerbaijan has targeted the eradication of poverty by 2015. What are the core policies your Ministry is implementing to achieve such an important goal?</h4><p>In general, 2011 was a significant year for the dynamic progress of our country in all fields. In this regard, we continued to implement effective measures to increase social welfare. As you know, one of the important factors in reducing poverty is to create new jobs as well as to promote the efficient employment of people. In 2011, 94,000 new job vacancies were created, 73,000 of them were permanent positions, and for the time being the number of work places is over a million. As a result, the unemployment rate in Azerbaijan fell to 5.4%. In addition, the average income of the population is growing from year to year, and in 2011 alone it increased by 19.6%, double the 7.9% inflation rate. One of the factors causing poverty is that vocational and labor skills do not meet the requirements of the modern labor market. Therefore, we have been focusing on providing effective employment opportunities and improving the quality of people's labor potential in line with the needs of the economy. In the last few years new vocational training centers have been established, enabling a large number of people to broaden their professional skills and improve their future. At the same time we have developed a series of social security programs to provide assistance to poor families. However, as we do not want these families to depend on state aid, we have been implementing a “one-time social assistance and self support program" to use their potential to increase their income. Overall, the economic growth of Azerbaijan, which currently represents more than 80% of the overall South Caucasus economy, and the measures implemented in the social sphere have helped to sharply reduce poverty to 7.6%.</p><h4>What's the significance of Azerbaijan's Public Council of Social Protection, which started operating in 2011?</h4><p>Cooperation with civil societies is always a focus of attention for the government, and the establishment of such a council enables us to work toward transparency in our work. Such an entity will contribute to encouraging civil participation in the social sphere, process citizens' appeals, and conduct better investigations while providing better services to society. The Public Council actively participates in all these processes, improving the effectiveness of our services. I am certain that such an entity will improve the living conditions of the Azerbaijani population and further involve people in an active role within social protection activities.</p><h4>What steps is the Ministry taking in order to improve the welfare of disabled people in Azerbaijan and achieve their active integration into society?</h4><p>Today, Azerbaijan prioritizes policies promoting the integration of people with disabilities into society. In the last few years we have adopted new legal normative acts to provide disabled people with state benefits and complementary services. Financial support to people with disabilities has been constantly strengthened and the amount of benefits given to them increases each year. In recent years we have also expanded rehabilitation and treatment network centers, and now there are 14 such centers in Azerbaijan, where more than 8,000 people are treated every year. In order to ensure better and more effective social rehabilitation for people with disabilities, we are developing specialized centers such as an education-rehabilitation center for eye disabilities, social rehabilitation centers and social asylums for underage children, a center of social adaptation for prisoners released from penitentiary institutions, a specialized rehabilitation center for the victims of Chernobyl, and a help center for human trafficking victims. Finally, at the expense of the state, we are building individual residential houses and tenement apartments for disabled people in different regions of the country. About 5,000 citizens with disabilities, including the families of people who died protecting the territorial integrity of the country in the Karabakh war, were given modern new apartments. During 2012 we expect to build approximately 1,000 new apartments. At the same time people with disabilities were provided with nearly 3,250 cars, increasing the overall number of disabled people with cars to 7,500.</p><h4>How would you describe the Azerbaijani workforce to potential foreign investors?</h4><p>The Azerbaijani workforce is diligent, efficient, and determined. In the fields of traditional labor, the professional skills in the workforce are sufficient. However, the continued development of our country, its integration into the world economy, the creation of a transparent business environment, and the flow of foreign investment make it necessary to improve the country's labor force. At the same time, and in order to intensify such processes, we have started implementing programs to improve professional standards and related learning standards jointly with the World Bank. The aim of this project is to prepare the legal and institutional framework for the establishment of over 100 vocational centers and courses according to international standards within the next three years. Such a project will play an important role in the development of the workforce at the level of international requirements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has access to higher education in Azerbaijan improved since independence?</h4><p>At present, our country has 51 higher educational institutions, and of these 15 are private higher education centers, which run both Bachelor's and Master's degrees in 139 different specialties. The quality and access to higher education in Azerbaijan is increasing year by year. In this regard, the government has taken steps to facilitate access to higher education for students with disabilities as well as internally displaced persons who have lost both parents, covering their education costs. Therefore, we can say that we have successfully implemented state programs and other types of measures to broaden educational opportunities for Azerbaijan's youth, improved the quality and infrastructure of the sector, and further integrated our higher education system into the international system. Education and the ability to create more opportunities for Azerbaijani students are some of the priorities of our government, and we have been implementing new financing mechanisms since 2010. I would also like to stress the significant role played by private institutions in order to leverage both the quality and capacity of the higher education system in our country. Currently, there are 19,616 students, including 418 foreign citizens, studying in these institutions. The majority of the private universities in our country have exclusive partnerships with international universities, take part in grant programs to encourage student and staff exchanges as well as to improve their material and technical bases, and provide their students with high-standard infrastructure such as campuses, laboratories, and offices. However, I would not like to forget about the magnificent work done by our many public universities, which today can compete with private institutions in terms of teaching standards. Finally, it should be noted that the British QS World University Rankings included Baku State University and Qafqaz University in its 2011 list, which speaks volumes about the improvements made to our higher education system.</p><h4>The Ministry aims to make some changes to the policy of financing the education of local university graduates abroad. How are you working toward encouraging more Azerbaijani students to follow their studies abroad?</h4><p>President Ilham Aliyev approved a state program on education in foreign countries for 2007-2015, and its main objective is to contribute to the development of a competitive economic system, expanding education opportunities for our students, and ensuring the country's needs for high-level and qualified staff. Up until now, about 5,000 Azerbaijani students have benefited from our financial programs, and we target to increase annual figures, supporting some 1,000 students abroad every year. Turning “black gold into human capital" is one of our priorities for the future, and the measures implemented in this regard will also position Azerbaijan, which enjoys a very stable political life thanks to our President, as a leading regional country in terms of education.</p><h4>At the beginning of 2012, the Ministry opened a new vocational school in Baku, and the country has over 50 of such centers. How significant are these developments?</h4><p>The State Program on the Development of Technical Vocational Education 2007-2012 has enabled the country to expand the network of technical and vocational education institutions, strengthen the material-technical base, increase the number of students that are taking the vocational education path, improve international cooperation, update curriculums in accordance with  the requirements of the labor market, and address other issues designed to improve staff training. A total of 12 technical vocational education institutions have been renovated within the framework of the State Program, and 14 more have been provided with better and more modern equipment. Also, we have accelerated the digitalization of textbooks and the system as a whole through the education portal www.avel.edu.az, which in the future will provide electronic vocational education courses, electronic books, video lessons, and all sorts of media facilities for students. Our main target is to train highly-skilled personnel and staff to adapt them to contemporary labor market demands, which at the end of the day will also contribute to strengthening the process of diversification in the national economy.</p><h4>What plans does the Ministry have for e-learning?</h4><p>The integration of new technology into the education system in Azerbaijan has been gradually implemented since we approved a state program on the matter aimed at developing applications, providing schools with equipment, and, of course, training staff. We have more than 500 schools connected to the “network for education;" there is one computer for every 20 pupils, whereas in 2004 the ratio was one for every 1,063 pupils. Around 9,000 teachers were provided with computers, and for the first time in history we have developed and integrated electronic subjects and their complementary resources into schools, and 1,000 schools have been provided with broadband internet.</p><h4>How is the Ministry working to ensure the quality of teachers' knowledge and skills, content of textbooks, and assessment systems?</h4><p>Teachers play a vital role in the formation of a student's personality, and that's undeniable. Modern teachers should be able to adapt themselves to today's necessities, as students have a wide range of potential opportunities. Over the last few years we have been adapting the curriculum content for primary education within the scope of general education reforms to increase the level of pedagogical personnel, new subjects, assessment systems, the use of modern teaching methods, and training processes. We are planning to carry on with such reforms, especially in the field of teacher training, textbook content, teaching strategies, and assessment systems. In addition, in recent years, the Ministry of Education has introduced new regulations in connection with the management of schools, in order to improve their efficiency, and it is important to note that we have been doing so along with schools, school boards, and councils, because we believe that it is important to involve the pupils' parents in the process of school governance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What significant reforms have taken place at the university since Azerbaijan gained independence?<br></h4><p>Azerbaijan Medical University (AMU) has had a long and very successful history since it was founded in 1930. The adoption of the credit system and the Bologna process are the most important reforms that have taken place at AMU since our country gained independence. It was a big challenge to go from a Soviet education system to the credit system. It is very important to us because it helps to bring international standards to our institution and further integrate it into the international higher education system. Along with the introduction of the credit system, we included postgraduate Master's degree courses in our Pharmacy Faculty in 2009, and residency courses in our General Medicine and Pediatrics faculties in 2011, which train residents from four to six years, depending on the specialty. We must not forget about the national reforms in higher education implemented by the Ministry of Education, because they have contributed to improving the quality of education in Azerbaijan and further raising it to meet European standards.</p><h4>How is the university working to further integrate itself into the world education system?</h4><p>AMU has different exchange programs with international institutions; not only at the student level, but specialists and staff as well. We currently have more than 40 partnerships and agreements with international universities. Also, we constantly invite education experts to attract their regulatory expertise to our country, and particularly to our institution. In that regard, the World Bank and the World Health Organization have been supporting us very closely over the years. Extracurricular activities play an important role in the education process, and we can develop them thanks to our international agreements. Also, the integration of IT systems in our programs and examination procedures, which are mostly based on European examination models, has resulted in the increased use of new technologies in  our programs.</p><h4>How can AMU benefit from the changes the Ministry of Education is planning to make to the policy of financing the education of local university graduates overseas?</h4><p>The Ministry of Education is increasingly encouraging Azerbaijani students to follow their studies abroad, and this is very important not only for them, but for our educational institutions as well. More than 60% of the medical students who go on exchange programs come from our university. The most important thing, however, is to make sure that these students come back to Azerbaijan once they graduate. On our side, we work closely with the Ministry of Education in order to make sure we are ready to attract these students, providing what they professionally need to develop their careers in Azerbaijan. In this regard, we have built a new therapeutic center with 17 departments and 400 beds, and a surgery clinic with 21 departments; extra capacity for 500 patients is also under construction. We provide both clinics with the most modern equipment so that doctors can develop their careers under the best conditions possible.</p><h4>How has the success of AMU been reflected worldwide?</h4><p>We like to keep track of our former students and residents, regardless of where they are working right now. An important factor that shows our success, as an educational institution, is the number of specialists who have graduated from AMU, and who are working abroad at the moment. A couple of years ago, coinciding with our 80th anniversary, we counted more than 10,000 specialists from our university working in 28 different countries. However, the number of our alumni spread across the world is growing from year to year. As an example, more than 40 students obtained residency in Germany in 2011. In Saudi Arabia we have more than 300 of our graduates working in different specialties. And in addition, a large number of AMU alumni are successfully working and studying in Turkey and different European countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since you took over the Ministry in 2006, what key reforms have you sought to implement at both the ministerial and national level?</h4><p>Since 2006, the Ministry has prepared integrated measures and national programs that set the principles and priorities for cultural development. These have included programs for the development of theaters, museums, cinemas, and libraries. Also, we commissioned a program on the development of tourism for the 2010-2014 period, focusing on the development of the main assets of cultural and tourism institutions. Over the 2006-2011 period alone, government investment in culture and tourism increased 28 fold. The number of museums increased by 22% and the number of hotels by 78%. At the same time, we have experienced a substantial increase in the number of foreigners visiting Azerbaijan; the number of foreign tourists has been growing over the last five years at an average annual rate of 10%-11%, while the worldwide figure is between 4% and 4.5%. We expect to maintain this trend. We have also refurbished key infrastructure like the Heydar Aliyev Palace and the National Museum of Arts. I would like to add that the new Azerbaijan State Carpet Museum, among others, is reaching its final stages of construction and will be a very attractive touristic and cultural center for Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, we are strengthening international relations via initiatives such as the organization of cultural days abroad and the cultural days of other nations in Baku. We are hosting an increasing number of international cultural events including the Rostropovich Festival, Gabala Music Festival, the Puppet Theater Festival, and of course, the cornerstone: the biennial Baku World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue, with the participation of relevant government agencies, ministries, NGOs, and international entities from all over the world.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the achievements of the “Year of Tourism" held in 2011?</h4><p>In general, it was a successful year that I would set as a benchmark for a new stage of development in the tourist sector. An action plan was adopted with key items and priorities to be implemented in terms of legislation, organization, planning, infrastructural development, and the popularization of domestic tourism as well as the promotion of national tourism products. Therefore, I believe that this was a very fruitful year and a great experience in understanding the strategic positioning of tourism in the economy.</p><h4>How is the Ministry preparing to host Eurovision 2012?</h4><p>Eurovision 2012 is one of the top list events for the country this year. Since we expect considerable scores of visitors for Eurovision week in Baku, the Ministry is implementing several key policies in order to make sure everything goes smoothly. We are improving the quality of hotel services, travel companies, and tourist information outlets. We are also working to see an improvement in guided tours, as well as complete the construction of several potential tourist attractions. We realize the importance of the project and are committed to doing all we can to make sure the event is well received.</p><h4>What are the main challenges Azerbaijan faces in order to become a more popular tourist destination?</h4><p>The relatively low exposure of the country to the world is a major challenge. Although there has been a great improvement, there are still many people around the globe that do not know much about Azerbaijan. For that reason, we have increased our presence in international media, fairs, conferences, and exhibitions. Another challenge is to facilitate the visa process for potential visitors, and we are already working on this with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We want to facilitate the issuance of electronic visas and online application capabilities. Tourism is considered a strategic sector, and thus these projects will be carried out with the full support of the government. The tourism industry had to begin from scratch after the collapse of the USSR. Tourist infrastructure was demolished, as none of it complied with international standards. Furthermore, there was no management capable of operating under a market economy. Finally, the expansion of transport infrastructure will also contribute to attracting more tourists in the future. In this regard, we are working on the development of trans-border tourism with neighboring states through bilateral projects. For example, there are plans to organize cruise tours on the Caspian Sea. Obviously, having advanced seaport infrastructure will help us greatly in the promotion of this idea. Tourist inflow analysis shows that 90% of foreign tourists enter the country via the airport and, therefore, the further expansion of Baku's airport infrastructure will facilitate the development of tourism. We will also not forget about the promising Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project, which will potentially tie into the Turkish and European rail network, making railroad travel from Europe to Azerbaijan and vice-versa a reality.</p><h4>How would you assess Baku's potential to become a high-class tourism center?</h4><p>The country has many opportunities to develop an elite tourism sector, including a well-developed dining industry, the oil industry, and the links between Azerbaijan and the Nobel, Rockefeller, and Rothschild families. The country also has a rich history and deep connections with European and world developments. That is not to mention its significant infrastructural developments, lavish hotels, shops, and restaurants. There were several worldwide brand hotels commissioned during 2011, including the Hilton, Kempinski, and Jumeira Bilgah Beach. In 2012 we expect the commissioning of JW Marriott, Four Seasons, and Fairmont brand hotels in Baku, with some other fashionable hotels on the way in the regions of Sheki and Gabala. We continuously work on the improvement of the quality of tourism services in terms of the development of best practices and standards, and new products. In addition, we are exploring new destinations in the country that could be used for tourism purposes.</p><h4>Since the Ministry has activated the process of certification of eco-tourism zones, what is the potential for rural tourism in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We consider eco-tourism not only as an economic opportunity, but also as a social responsibility and commitment to future generations. In our view it is not only business for travel agencies and tour operators, it is also something that helps young people better understand and feel responsible for the preservation of biological diversity and natural resources. In this context, rural tourism is a very important factor. There is a plan for this segment that contains all steps related to the restoration of traditional economies, arts, and crafts in the regions, as well as the development of infrastructure and the creation of jobs. This has brought about a revival in agricultural activities, the refurbishment of historical and cultural monuments, and the development of transport infrastructure. Therefore, we are now actively developing this segment of the industry, and I see very good prospects for the future as the regions of Azerbaijan have a lot to offer in terms of traditions, arts, history, culture, customs, and nature.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history and achievements of this governing body of football in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The year 2012 marks the 20th anniversary of AFFA. As in all areas of life, not all of our activities have been carried out smoothly. Achievements and failures, as well as disappointments and victories, are constantly chasing one another. Nevertheless, there has been some stability over the last few years. AFFA has established a system to monitor the performance of national teams and organize tournaments held countrywide. For many years, the limitations of the country's infrastructure have prevented the development of football. Thankfully, these problems are about to be solved. Approximately 80 artificial pitches have been installed throughout the country, and in addition, AFFA has constructed a Football Center in Mardakan, which consists of a beach soccer pitch and the Dalga Arena with the capacity to hold 6,700 fans. FIFA President Joseph S. Blatter and UEFA President Michel Platini were also present at the opening ceremony of the Dalga Arena on June 6, 2011. Currently, two stadiums with the capacity for 11,000 and 3,000 fans are under construction in the districts of Nizami and Bayil, respectively. Measures have been taken in order to reach high-level standards in football infrastructure, as it is one of the three main priorities of AFFA for the development of football in our country. The other two priorities are education and promotion. As in many countries all over the world, football is one of the most popular sports in Azerbaijan. Among AFFA's main targets are the development of every style of the game, the promotion of the sport, the development of professionals in the sphere of modern football management, the improvement of infrastructure, and the encouragement of children, teenagers, and other young people to adopt healthy life styles.</p><h4>What is the importance of international cooperation between the AFFA and institutions such as UNICEF to further strengthen football's penetration among children and women?</h4><p>The work done by AFFA in the sphere of women's football development attracted UNICEF's attention, and today there is strong ongoing cooperation between the two organizations. For example, we named the U-17 Girls League, which consists of 16 different teams representing different the regions of our country, the U-17 UNICEF Girls League. Within the framework of this cooperation, UNICEF representatives in Azerbaijan are constantly organizing different seminars on women's rights. In general, I believe that this cooperation between UNICEF and AFFA is very influential in the development of women's football in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What impact do you expect the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup to have on the country? Will Azerbaijan be bidding for more international tournaments in the near future?</h4><p>As a developing country situated between the East and West, we have embraced women's football. When we prepared the bidding documents for the event, we thought it could be difficult for Azerbaijan to win the privilege of hosting. The final appointment was a very special moment for us, and we celebrated it. The main idea of the event is to organize the best FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup in history. With the help of this unique event, we want to promote sports, present our country to the world, and let people familiarize themselves with our culture, economy, and prospects. The tournament will attract 16 teams from around the world to take part in this championship, and more than 125 countries will broadcast the matches live. Some of us will have the chance to recognize our daughters, friends, and relatives on the screen. It is also important for our young, energetic, creative Local Organizing Committee to work side by side with FIFA professionals. As the first whistle of the tournament approaches, we already recognize the results of our hard work, and we are more confident now. We have applied for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, and I have the honor of presenting the bid for this occasion. I am confident that we will win.</p><h4>What is AFFA doing to ensure high standards of coaching and refereeing in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The topic of the referees and coaches cannot be ignored in the complex development of football. Much work has been done to reach higher standards in both spheres. For example, we have held seminars with the participation of international experts on these issues and AFFA is now hosting courses to prepare young referees. Until 2011, AFFA organized UEFA's C, B, and A category coaching courses. We are pleased that UEFA has applauded AFFA's activities and granted us the right to host professional-category courses as well, and this represents a great success for our country. I believe that the education in both the refereeing and coaching will be improved on a constant basis.</p><h4>FK Karabakh reached the UEFA Europa League play-offs twice in the last couple of years. How does this accomplishment reflect the evolution of Azerbaijani football?</h4><p>The achievement of our clubs at international tournaments makes us proud and happy. Their achievement represents a victory for Azerbaijani football on a larger scale. This result is proof that the strategy chosen for development is the correct one. We are overjoyed that FC Karabakh accomplished this success. We are promoting the historical land of Karabakh throughout Europe and the world. With every achievement of this club, the international community learns more about our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Det.Al Holding's background?</h4><p>Det.Al Holding is a foreign company using advanced technology and operating in the mining of iron ore and alunite. It is a leader in non-ferrous and ferrous metallurgy, the processing of iron ore concentrate, and the production of pellets, DRI, steel, aluminum, and primary aluminum. Being an investment company, Det.Al Holding has a track record of investments and successful cooperation with several industrial enterprises.</p><p>As of today, Det.Al Holding has subsidiary companies in the sphere of iron ore, alunite, aluminum, and steel production. Dashkesan Filizsaflashdirma, an iron ore company that started producing concentrated iron ore from 2010, is also exporting to foreign markets. Other divisions of our holding are Det.Al Steel and Det.Al Aluminum, which is successfully constructing an aluminum producing smelter in the city of Ganja. Det.Al Holding has also laid the foundation of the Integrated Steel Complex in Azerbaijan, including the design and construction of an iron ore concentration plant with a capacity of 2 million tons per year, a pellet plant with capacity for 2 million tons per year, a direct reduction plant with capacity for 1.1 million tons per year, and a steelmaking plant with capacity for 1 million tons a year. We are committed to the development of Azerbaijan, and currently Det.Al Holding provides around 4,000 jobs.</p><h4>What are your current expectations for output at the aluminum smelter in Ganja?</h4><p>Phase I of the greenfield Ganja Aluminum Smelter, which will have an annual capacity of 50,000 tons of primary aluminum, began in October 2011, and the completion of Phase II with the same capacity is expected in late 2012. The smelter plant meets the highest technological, environmental, and quality standards, and by the end of the year about 500 people will be working there.</p><p>The new aluminum smelter plant is located within Det.Al Aluminum's aluminum factory complex, where we are constructing a semi-fabrication plant as well. The new complex will produce 50,000 tons of high-quality primary aluminum of the A-7 type and 50,000 tons of aluminum coiled sheets annually. We expect to finish both Phase II of the smelter plant and the pre-fabrication plant by 2014, and Ganja Aluminum Plant will supply the main raw materials for the complex. The available established infrastructure gives us an opportunity to increase annual production to 200,000 tons in the future after additional investment. This new complex will also add annual production capacity to Azerbaijan Aluminum's smelter in Sumgait, which currently produces 60,000 tons of primary aluminum per year, and Ganja Aluminum Refinery, which produces 450,000 tons of metallurgical grade aluminum.</p><h4>How would you assess domestic aluminum production and demand?</h4><p>Over the last few years, we have been implementing projects to increase the country's production capacity due to the high demand for aluminum in neighboring countries. As an example, the main market is Turkey, where we are in negotiations with important traders.</p><p>However, we cannot forget about the European market, as it is another important destination for Azerbaijan's aluminum production. At the same time, demand in Azerbaijan is increasing and for now we expect that about 30% to 35% of our production will cover local demand and the rest will go to foreign markets.</p><h4>How has Det.Al Holding contributed to the rebirth of Azerbaijan's metal industry?</h4><p>Det.Al Holding is the main aluminum company in Azerbaijan, producing and exporting high quantities of aluminum from our refinery and other semi-fabricated products. We have boosted the country's capacity over the years through the construction of industrial complexes and related infrastructure. At the same time, Det.Al Holding is one of the main steel producers in Azerbaijan from iron ore, and we currently have 300 million tons of approved reserves of iron ore. Also, in the last few years we have introduced the latest technology to the production chain, and we are currently implementing measures to rehabilitate our reserves, improve facilities, and increase the capacity and quality of our products. We are also working on the construction of a new pelletization factory in Ganja, which is one of the major projects in this segment, with a concentrated production capacity of 1.2 million tons a year. It will be fully completed by 2016.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the ferrous and non-ferrous metals industry in 2012 onward?</h4><p>This is a very attractive industry for foreign investors at the moment, because the government is creating incentives and favorable conditions for potential companies to develop their activities in the country. Also, Azerbaijan holds huge potential in the mining sector and in the ferrous and non-ferrous metals industry. Therefore, I can see many foreign investors looking toward Azerbaijan in the next few years. In this regard, Det.Al Holding is also working on attracting FDI for all of its industrial projects in the aluminum and steel segments, and we have seen a high level of interest in our ongoing projects.</p><h4>What other economic advantages does Azerbaijan offer to foreign investors?</h4><p>Today, Azerbaijan's business environment is very safe. It has seen consistent economic development, favorable legislation, and political and financial stability. Azerbaijan offers better investment opportunities when compared to other countries in the Caucasus, and also when compared to Central Asia and most other CIS countries. In addition to this, there are major infrastructure projects being implemented at the moment, and such projects will strengthen Azerbaijan's position at the international level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since you already have a successful musical career, what factors led you to develop your entrepreneurial side?</h4><p>It was an easy decision for me, because I have been involved in business since 1997. I began by selling Russian goods on eBay, and I held an average of 1,500 auctions a week. I decided to set up my own company with an office and a website to expand my business. After I finished my degree, I moved to Moscow, where my father made me an offer. I agreed to take over the management of a luxury retail chain, and five years later the business was making a profit; we had 75 stores and our turnover increased from $5 million to $65 million. Ten years ago, my father appointed me to the position of Commercial Director of Crocus Group. In 2011, he promoted me to Vice-President of the company, giving me the responsibility for projects such as Vegas Mall, Crocus City Mall, Crocus City Hall, and all our stores and restaurants in  Moscow. However, music is something I have always been passionate about, and in 2005 I decided to seriously pursue a musical career. I released my own album, formed a band, and performed in front of large crowds. I released my first single, “Still." The song was unexpectedly successful, and gave me a lot of confidence to continue pursuing my dreams. Since 2006, I have released five albums, and my first international album was produced in London in 2010. A number of songs from that album, entitled “Wonder," made it to the artists' list chart. One of my most successful achievements has been to become the first non-British artist to ever have three consecutive “record of the week" distinctions from BBC Radio. In September 2011, I signed a contract for my new album, to be released globally by EMI in May 2012.</p><h4>Sea Breeze is a premium class real estate and resort in Nardaran, a suburb of Baku. Can you tell us more about the concept you developed with the Sea Breeze resort?</h4><p>My childhood has always been linked to Nardaran, where our family has a summer home. When the Sea Breeze project began, initially it was a personal construction project for my family. I started purchasing some surrounding land, and discovered a very old, abandoned building from the Soviet era. I bought the building, hoping to knock it down. However, we tested the structure and realized that we could restore it into a hotel. We went further with the project and began to develop restaurants, housing, and services. It all came naturally. Presently, we have finished the whole infrastructure, including the roads, gas, electricity, water facilities, hotel, and complementary services such as the swimming pools, spa, and a sporting complex.</p><h4>Is the Sea Breeze resort capable of growing in terms of space, residences, and services?</h4><p>We have sold 20 houses out of the 30 we initially built, and since we own more surrounding land, we are already planning to expand as demand increases. Our main business strategy at the company is entertainment- and leisure-oriented real estate development, and Sea Breeze is an additional project within our overall strategy.</p><h4>What does Sea Breeze offer that sets it apart from other real estate and tourist options?</h4><p>Sea Breeze is a premium class development project, and our average prices are at the same level as luxury apartments in Baku. The difference at Sea Breeze is that you have your own land, complementary private facilities that you can use at your leisure, and access to the sea. Therefore, we offer a privileged location, private beach on the shore of the Caspian Sea, and numerous services and facilities.</p><h4>Have you considered carrying out a similar project in other areas around Baku?</h4><p>I always have plenty of ideas to develop. However, during my short business career I have come to learn that it's better to focus on your current projects in order to provide the market and customers with the best quality products. I am also very committed to my musical career, but I think my business focus in Baku will be on Sea Breeze.</p><h4>Since you had a very successful 2011, what do you expect from 2012?</h4><p>From a musical point of view, I have not set any particular goals for 2012 in terms of record sales or singles. However, I have a vision for my musical career. I have released my first Russian single and a new single in the UK in order to broaden my market. I am also adapting my musical output for these markets. My aim is to be successful in what I do, and in the future release more international songs for my entire audience.</p><h4>What impact will Eurovision have on the country as a whole?</h4><p>Eurovision will help promote Azerbaijan globally and will become an unprecedented showcase for the country. During the contest in May, visitors will be able to see the tremendous changes Azerbaijan has experienced in the past few years. I believe that the timing is perfect. People will be blown away by the beauty and development of the country, and I am sure that the event will take Azerbaijan to a whole new level, not only politically and economically, but culturally as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>TBY What investments have been made in Azerbaijan's transport network over 2011?<br></h4><p>The largest investments over the last year have been the development of the new Baku International Sea Trade Port and the Baku-Alat highway, as well as the purchase of new large and medium-capacity buses and 500 new “London taxis." In addition, we created 55.3 kilometers of railway, upgraded the locomotive fleet, and purchased seven electric and diesel units. In 2011, AZN112.6 million was spent on railway development. Furthermore, 203.5 million tons of freight were transported, 22.1 million tons of cargo were carried by rail, 109.8 million tons were transported by road, and 1.5 billion passengers were transported. During 2011, AZN1.6 billion was allocated for the maintenance of 668.7 kilometers of roads. As part of an action plan on the improvement of the transport system in Baku for the 2008-2013 period, we constructed 17 new road junctions and 75 pedestrian passageways, and repaired hundreds of kilometers of existing roads.</p><h4>What is the status of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project?</h4><p>In 2011, work on the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project successfully continued, focusing on the construction of the Akhalkalak-Kartsakhi segment, near the Turkish border. This stretch contains a 4.2-kilometer-long tunnel and a station. At the same time, we continued to work on the reconstruction of the Akhalkalak-Marabda segment, which stretches for 153 kilometers. In 2012, an important year for the development of the project, we are aiming to increase the pace of work, which is being carried out according to the planned schedule.</p><h4>How will the development of the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA) further position Azerbaijan as a hub between East and West?</h4><p>The participation of Azerbaijan in the TRACECA program is of strategic importance for our country to strengthen and expand economic relations with European countries, and further integrate our country and economy with the world. It is a great opportunity to put Azerbaijan on the map as one of the main transport hubs between East and West. We have already implemented several projects within the framework of the TRACECA program, such as transport management training and a legal and regulatory framework. Further projects have included the application of a tariff policy, the streamlining of procedures at border checkpoints, the restoration of railway lines, and other related technical assistance and investment-orientated initiatives. The TRACECA project has contributedto an increase in the number of basic multilateral internal and transnational transport agreements between Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkey. Our country is at a crossroads between North and South, and East and West, and the transport infrastructure projects that we are developing within the TRACECA program will increase the flow of cargo through the corridor.</p><h4><br>Azerbaijan recently inaugurated its Intelligent Transport Management Center, the first of its kind in the CIS region. What are the benefits of such technology?</h4><p>The implementation of a new Intelligent Transport Management System started back in 2007, when President Ilham Aliyev announced the project. Since 2009 we have been implementing different types of measures, such as installing cameras in several parts of Baku, as well as onboard equipment in buses and terminals. The Intelligent Transport Management Center is the new central operating base for the traffic management system, enabling us to collect all types of current information from videos to analyze situations, provide instructions, and implement further system-controlled equipment transferred to the field. At the same time, information about the current status of the roads can be delivered to drivers via mobile phones, electronic digital boards, and TV and radio stations. The center also boasts the largest wall monitor system, at 5-meters high and 24-meters wide. The new transport management center will help us optimize the decision-making process, ensuring the implementation of adopted measures and the transfer of information on the system to the relevant departments, collecting a wide range of data from more than 1,612 streets and avenues and 2,096 buses, through 378 units of specialized equipment and 320 kilometers of fiber-optic cables. The deployment of new functional equipment on the roads will continue until mid-2012, and we will keep installing controls at intersections and junctions throughout Baku.</p><h4>Azerbaijan has announced the future introduction of a single payment card for public transport. What will the impact be?</h4><p>The e-card payment system will allow passengers to use a single card for all types of public transport. We are also working on the introduction of payment and information terminals that will give a clear understanding to passengers of the optimal routes for all kinds of transport, and facilitate the purchase of tickets too. Our aim is also to boost payments by plastic card within the public transport system; a card that will allow passengers to check their balance, and in the future we can't rule out developing further uses for these cards outside of the transport system.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Azeryolservis' background story, and how does it fit into the rapid development of Azerbaijan's road transport infrastructure?</h4><p>In recent years, the scale of road construction has increased, as has overall capacity. This expansion required a new organization to manage the process. Therefore, Azeryolservis was established in 2007 under the Ministry of Transport. Our organization has been in charge of the construction of roads, bridges, road junctions, and also the repair, reconstruction, and maintenance of such infrastructure. At the same time, and as part of our activities, Azeryolservis has promoted international cooperation in the field of traffic and road management, attending many international conferences and seminars, taking an active role in the International Road Federation (IRF), the Intergovernmental Road Council, the CIS, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESKAP), and the Special Program for the Economies of Central Asia (SPECA), where discussions have been held on projects and activities related to the country's economic development, and the improvement of international transport corridor infrastructure.</p><h4>What are some of the key national projects Azeryolservis has been involved in?</h4><p>Since 2004, when President Ilham Aliyev assumed power, 5,711 kilometers of roads have been rebuilt and repaired. Of these, about 2,148 kilometers are highways or roads of relevant importance within the national network such as the Baku-Alat and Baku-Guba highways, which have improved the road connections with our neighbors Georgia and Russia. Over the years, we have also improved access to Heydar Aliyev International Airport. In addition, during this period, we have finished the construction of 152 new bridges and tunnels, 25 new road junctions, and 38 pedestrian passages in Baku. In this regard, we are building six new road junctions and nine more pedestrian passages in the capital city, with special attention on preparing Baku for Eurovision 2012. Such infrastructure within the city will facilitate the movement of pedestrians. Finally, I would like to mention that Azeryolservis has actively contributed to the improvement of existing roads through the application of the most modern technology and materials, with special attention paid to the reconstruction works carried out on the M-2 highway, where the high-quality materials and techniques we used enabled us to lay an asphalt-concrete cap layer at the bottom to prevent the formation of cracks in the road. We have sought international expertise in the field from Turkish, German, Japanese, Italian, US, Chinese, Swedish, Belarusian, and Russian companies providing us with know-how and mutual cooperation. Azeryolservis has significantly contributed to strengthening Azerbaijan's material and technical base over the last eight years.</p><h4>How has Azerbaijan's road network been integrated into international transport corridors?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is in a geostrategic position, sitting at the center of the Europe-Caucasus-Asia and North-South international transport corridors, which has extensively contributed to the development of the country's transport capacity. For example, 67.9% of the road network in Azerbaijan is currently in compliance with international standards. At the same time, Azerbaijan's geographical location conceals important challenges; we need to constantly work on leveraging the road network's capacity and adapt it to international standards. Government plans have guided the country's development in this field, stating the priorities, improving the efficiency of modern transportation, and developing communications, management, and services, improving the quality of the roads, reducing the costs of transportation, and expanding international cooperation to meet international requirements. In addition to what we have achieved, the government plans for the construction and repair of 9,600 kilometers of roads by 2015. The development of projects leading to international integration, in particular international transport corridors, will be a priority in the next few years. In this regard, the second stage of the Silk Route project, which passes through Azerbaijan, is underway. The Silk Route will play a key role in leveraging Azerbaijan's road cargo transport capacity.</p><h4>How has Azeryolservis contributed to improving road safety?</h4><p>Road safety is a major challenge and requires daily attention. In particular, due to the very rapid growth in the number of vehicles on the roads in recent years, statistics show that the majority of road accidents take place on highways and urban roads. Although we have been working on building up a modern road network—improving road conditions and safety—the driving culture in the country has yet to be strengthened. Over the years we have increased the presence of road signs and indicators. The priorities for the future will be traffic campaigns with the Ministry of Internal Affairs to promote the use of seat belts, facilitate road emergency medical services, and develop an intelligent traffic management center, which was inaugurated by President Ilham Aliyev in late 2011. In this regard, and linked to the organization of Eurovision 2012, I would like to add that the government has developed an action plan with six major points in order to facilitate the movement of vehicles and people around the city of Baku during the event, building many more underground passages, carrying out reconstruction works on main junctions and roads, and raising awareness of road safety and traffic problems. The Traffic Police Department, under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and its subordinated institutions, as well as specialists from the Ministry of Transport, and our company as well, are implementing campaigns on national TV channels, newspapers, and magazines in order to raise awareness among Azerbaijani drivers of the increase in the number of road traffic accidents, in particular the increasing number of accidents resulting in death.</p><h4>Both the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have put road and transport investment at the top of their agendas. How closely do you work with such institutions?</h4><p>Both institutions have contributed to the development of Azerbaijan's road network for a long time. In this regard, we have carried out joint projects with the EBRD, such as sections of the Silk Road. There are also several projects lined up for 2012, including the 166-kilometer Mingachevir-Bahramtepe road, and the 99.2-kilometer Kurdamir-Ujar-Yevlakh state highway. We also work with the ADB, which has financed projects for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of road infrastructure such as the East-West international transport corridor, the Silk Route, the Ganja Ring Road, and the construction of part of the Baku-Alat highway. We are currently developing the reconstruction of the Masalli-Astara state highway and the construction of a new bridge over the Kura River.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most significant achievements Azerbaijan has made over the last decade in children's rights?<br></h4><p>My first appearance to talk about such issues was in 1994, when I was invited to the National Assembly as a child expert. It was difficult to raise awareness about children's rights in Azerbaijan, for everybody included children under the global human rights label. However, things have changed and I am extremely pleased with what we have achieved over the years. We have raised awareness of the need to promote children's rights in our country and fight for them, because they are our future. We have improved living conditions as well as worked to support children with disabilities. It was very important for us to also work on the psychological issues experienced by mothers, a field in which we have been very successful too. We have also improved children's literacy and nutrition across the country. Those were very tough times and I remember spending weeks away from home, just travelling and trying to support communities in regional Azerbaijan. It has been a long but successful road.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the role young Azerbaijanis are playing in the development of the country?</h4><p>In Azerbaijan, the youth represent 50% of the population, and the government is implementing successful policies to encourage young students to follow their studies abroad, as well as addressing the employment and housing issues that affect this community. The government is very committed to supporting the youth in every sphere, because we know of their importance to the country's future. It is vital to help young people broaden their educational qualifications, as well as ease the path toward employment and entering the housing market. They are our present, but most importantly, our future, and the Republic of Azerbaijan relies on them and their skills to drive growth in the country. Today, the Azerbaijani youth is powerful, educated, and has a strong intellectual potential and bright future ahead.</p><h4>How would you assess the human rights situation in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>One of the most important achievements in this field was the establishment of our constitution in 1995 by our great leader, Heydar Aliyev, in which there is included a chapter on basic human citizens' rights and freedoms. Full membership at the UN in 1992 and our integration into the Council of Europe in 2001 have also contributed to the continued development of human rights in Azerbaijan, which has attached a lot of importance to international cooperation with different organizations in the field of human rights and their protection. Our country has extensively and closely collaborated with the OSCE, with which we signed a mutual Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 1998. Such close cooperation has lasted for many years and has been focused on the implementation of democratic, educational, and human rights reforms.</p><h4>What are your views on the increasing interest of the EU in developing ties with Azerbaijan, as proved by Baroness Catherine Ashton's visit to the country?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's cooperation with the EU is one of the key elements within our foreign affairs policies. We have implemented important projects to develop the economy, transport infrastructure, democratic reforms, and human rights. Over the years we have strengthened such ties, especially since Ashton has held her position. Thanks to such work and close cooperation we have successfully raised awareness of Azerbaijan's development. Ashton's visit to Azerbaijan in 2011 and the coming of different EU commissioners to Azerbaijan show that our country is an important partner for Europe and efforts will be continued in this direction.</p><h4>How important are events such as Eurovision and the FIFA Women's World Cup on the path toward development?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is gearing up toward hosting one of the most important events in its history, an event that will be watched worldwide. New buildings, concert complexes, and hotels are being built in connection with Eurovision 2012. In this regard, I want to praise the magnificent work that our First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva, President of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation and UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, is doing. The arrival of hundreds of thousands of tourists will be a challenge, but at the same time will form a great tool for the promotion of Azerbaijan; we will be exposed to the whole world. Everybody will become acquainted with Azerbaijan's ancient history and rich cultural heritage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>President Ilham Aliyev announced that 2012 would be the “Year of Sports." What major goals has the Ministry of Youth and Sports set for this year?</h4><p>This announcement is very important for Azerbaijan's youth, especially those who are involved in sports. Over the last few years, the government has built 33 sports complexes, and 11 more will be finished in 2012, including a gymnastics center and swimming pool in Baku, the Olympic stadium, and a variety of boxing, wrestling, and judo facilities. This is also a key year for the future of our activities. In the summer of 2012, Azerbaijan will be participating in the London Olympics. Baku is bidding to host the 2020 Olympics, and the results will be announced in 2013. Azerbaijan will also be hosting the FIFA Under-17 Women's World Cup, which we expect will boost the sport's popularity among women. The year 2012 will be an important year for Azerbaijani athletes and the sports community as a whole.</p><h4>What steps has the Ministry taken to demonstrate to the International Olympic Committee that Baku is ready to host the 2020 Summer Olympic Games?</h4><p>One of our strengths is the unanimous commitment from Azerbaijan's institutions, government bodies, and civil society. Every organization is working to realize the dream of hosting the Olympics. According to a survey conducted by TNS Global, 95% of Azerbaijan's population have shown support for Baku's bid to host the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic games, and 93% believe that Baku will be selected. The Ministry has been promoting the Olympic spirit in many Azerbaijani schools, as the students are potential athletes or volunteers for the event. It is important to stimulate the development of society through sports and volunteerism, especially in young people, as more than 50% of our population is under the age of 30. Through the Olympic Games, we can improve the lives of millions of young men and women and contribute to their success.</p><h4>How has sports infrastructure evolved over the last two decades in Azerbaijan, and what are the main infrastructure priorities for the Ministry of Youth and Sports?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has heavily invested in the development of its sports infrastructure network in order to boost our athletes' potential and host international events. Over the last few years, we have succeeded in hosting large-scale international tournaments, as well as European and world championships, to increase Azerbaijan's reputation as an international sports contender. In 2011, we organized a total of 42 international events, and our athletes won 706 medals. In the 2012 Summer Olympics, more than 50 Azerbaijani athletes will be in London participating in the games and achieving success.</p><h4>What are some of the key elements of the state program to develop Azerbaijan's youth from 2011 to 2015?</h4><p>A similar program was carried out between 2005 and 2009, and brought about excellent results. We effectively adapted policies toward youth aged between 14 and 29 years, who comprise one-third of the country's population. Some of the most important aspects of the program are the further implementation of youth policies, the development of infrastructure in regional Azerbaijan, and the construction of youth centers across the country. We are proud of the high level of achievement that young Azerbaijanis have demonstrated in the fields of education, science, and culture. We are also advancing entrepreneurship among the youth by supporting the establishment of their own businesses. We are strengthening our students' development by encouraging them to participate in the international community through various channels. We are aiming toward developing their skills and knowledge, providing them with the right tools to stimulate their intellectual and creative potential, and promoting employment tools, especially for lower-income students. We have established a youth fund to foster talent and creativity. These intellectual assets will present new opportunities for our youth. Azerbaijan's youth are a very dynamic, rapidly developing part of the population, and it is important to encourage them to take an active role in the public sphere, both nationally and internationally.</p><h4>How is the Ministry of Youth and Sports synchronizing with other ministries and institutions to implement policies and develop projects?</h4><p>Today, young people are able to actively participate in projects in many fields, including culture, tourism, health, education, and economics. Fortunately, the Ministry and other state and non-governmental organizations have initiated bilateral projects and policies. Together we have constructed and allocated housing for young people in Baku. In 2011, we registered more than 215 youth organizations, up from the 70 organizations operating in 2006. Such data prove that different national programs and policies between the government and other entities have been successful.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Azer-Ilme's annual production figures?<br></h4><p>Taking into account the various designs that are found regionally within Azerbaijan, we produce around 12,000 sqm a year in 600 different designs. All of these designs are authentic antique designs. Our production figures vary ever year, since we accept customer requests for particular designs.</p><h4>What goes into producing each carpet?</h4><p>We continue to use age-old techniques; we make carpets in the same way that they were made 200-300 years ago. Everything is hand-made in our company. We acquire the wool directly from the Azerbaijani mountains, totally washed and cleaned. We only use natural dyes in production: indigo, onion skin, walnut, saffron, and so on. After manually dying our wool and silk, our designers make the old authentic patterns, which are later on handed to the weavers, who start the actual process of making the carpet. Once they are done, we dust, wash, and iron the carpets, since they are curly. If there are any obvious mistakes in the carpets, we fix them, whereas if we find minor mistakes, we leave them, because they are the sign of a hand-made carpet. It usually takes a month to complete a 1-sqm wool piece, whereas a square meter of silk takes between 40 and 45 days.</p><h4>How relevant is R&amp;D for Azer-Ilme?</h4><p>We are building a carpet school to help future generations continue this art. This school will open its doors at the beginning of 2012 and will be situated next to our headquarters. Around 22 children under 10 will be able to attend this school every year. We want to offer master classes and provide these children with the latest technology to ease the learning process of such an important tradition. Also, we are planning to display small fragments of every single type of antique Azerbaijani carpet. We have published three different books on Azerbaijani carpets, and each of them focuses on a particular region and its traditional designs. These books contain a brochure that is published in six different languages: Azeri, English, German, French, Arabic, and Russian.</p><p>We are continuously investing in research on the history of carpets and carpet-making techniques in Azerbaijan, the Caucasus, and the eastern part of Turkey. It is important for us to understand the evolution of such important cultural products from Azerbaijan. On the marketing side, we also carry out intensive research to meet the requirements of every single market; we analyze the type of design that fits each market.</p><h4>Which markets is the company active in, and what role do domestic demand and exports play in Azer-Ilme's development plans?</h4><p>Outside of Azerbaijan, the US and Europe are the most active markets for us right now, with Germany and Italy being the most important ones within Europe. We also meet demand from some Arab countries such as Kuwait and Jordan. Regarding the internal market, the Azerbaijani economy has grown in potential since we regained our independence, and we have benefited from that. We believe that Azerbaijan's market still has significant potential to keep growing. Currently, 60% of our production goes to the domestic market, while the other 40% is exported. However, there are other differences, since the Azerbaijani market is dominated by silk production, while wool dominates the foreign markets.</p><h4>What are Azer-Ilme's plans and strategies in the medium term?</h4><p>Our aim is to continue our work on raising awareness of the historical importance and variety of traditional Azerbaijani carpets through published books, the education center, and the new museum of carpets in Baku. We are doing our best to contribute to the museum, which is an important part of Azerbaijan's heritage. We are seeking to spread this Azerbaijani art throughout the world and make it live long and strong. Businesswise, we will continue to contribute to the country's economy. These are our main goals for the next five-10 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have stated Austria's aim to develop new bilateral relations with Azerbaijan. What factors will be driving this potential for expansion?<br></h4><p>Azerbaijan is already Austria's most important trading partner in the region, but there is always room for improvement. I am thinking of natural gas in particular. The Nabucco pipeline project would give Azerbaijan direct access to the European market and allow it to achieve full market value for its gas. On the other hand, Austria offers many options to potential investors from Azerbaijan. We have the lowest unemployment rate in the EU and a highly skilled labor force. Vienna is ranked number one in the world for its quality of life, and is the headquarters of many companies that are active in Central Europe.</p><h4>How significant was your visit to Azerbaijan in 2011 in order to boost bilateral relations?</h4><p>It was the first visit of an Austrian President to Azerbaijan. I was accompanied by a large business delegation, and I recall clearly that HE President Aliyev praised a number of Austrian companies, which are already operating successfully in Azerbaijan. The business forum held in Baku during my visit helped to establish new business contacts. However, our relations should not be reduced to economic questions. We are also attaching great importance to the strengthening of cultural relations. Over the last four years, a number of agreements have been concluded between our Ministries of Culture, universities, and national libraries as well.</p><h4>How would you assess the state of relations between both countries and its evolution over the years?</h4><p>Excellent! In 2012 we are celebrating 20 years of friendly diplomatic relations. The opening of an Austrian Embassy in Baku in 2010 and my visit are clear signs. I am looking forward to the return visit by HE President Aliyev, which is planned for 2012. The conclusion of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on education will give further impetus to our bilateral relations.</p><h4>What is the geostrategic situation of Azerbaijan within Austria's international focus?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is strategically placed in its region and is an important player there. The South Caucasus region is of strategic importance. This goes beyond the interest in energy cooperation. We value the contribution of Azerbaijan to regional stability and its insights into developments in neighboring countries.</p><h4>The Austrian-Azerbaijani Chamber of Commerce (ATAZ) is planning to stage the “Central European &amp; Azerbaijani Investment and Trade Summit" in Vienna in 2012. How would you assess the role of ATAZ in developing relations between both countries?</h4><p>I welcome all efforts aimed at further intensifying our relationship. The role ATAZ is playing is particularly important. The planned investment and trade summit will underline the role of Vienna as a hub for doing business in Central Europe.</p><h4>What are your future expectations in terms of Austria-Azerbaijan relations, especially on the expansion of trade?</h4><p>I have already mentioned the importance of gas and energy. But there are many other fields, such as tourism, health care, and ICT, where promising prospects exist. Another area is agriculture, where agreed fields of cooperation are agricultural engineering, the cultivation of plants, and animal husbandry, as well as the early detection of diseases. On the local level, the city of Vienna envisages a number of economic and cultural projects as a follow-up to a visit to Baku. All in all, I am confident that we are on the right track.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook on Azerbaijan's key economic indicators?<br></h4><p>For the last several years there have been many positive internal and external indicators showing the strength of the Azerbaijani economy. These include macroeconomic achievements, economic growth, and banking sector expansion together with other indicators that are facilitating the stimulation and development of the economy. Azerbaijan's economy has been developing at the fastest rate in the world for the past few years, doubling its GDP twice over the last five years. Today, the Azerbaijani economy makes up 80% of the entire economy of the South Caucasus. Azerbaijan's growth was made possible by the realization of large-scale regional projects, such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline, Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway project, and a new port in Baku for the handling of goods from Central Asia. Such investments have established the foundation for new prospective projects to handle the transit of energy from Central Asia to Europe. All of these projects are transforming Azerbaijan into a locomotive of regional economic development.</p><h4>How has the BSE contributed to the overall development of the economy over the last decade?</h4><p>Since being established in 2000 as a joint-stock company, the BSE has reached several milestones. In July 2000 the BSE was granted a stock exchange license by the State Committee for Securities of Azerbaijan. Two months later, in September 2000, the first short-term government bond was sold via the BSE. Then, the first repo was introduced to the market in November 2001. In 2004 the BSE recorded the first transactions with corporate bond equities. Thus, during the first several years of its activity, the BSE started to work in close cooperation with both the private and public sectors. These dynamics are now continuing with the aim of fulfilling the main mission and vision of the BSE, which is to become a leading financial institution by establishing deep capital markets and effectively managing risks. It is also working to carry out its vision of organizing a transparent and fair market with wide-ranging financial instruments and creating attractive investment tools for investors. Regarding the contribution of the BSE to the development of the of the economy, the “State Program on the Development of the Securities Market in 2011-2020," which was adopted in May 2011, is of great importance. The main objectives of the program include the institutional development of the securities market, the organization and promotion of financial intermediation activities and collective investment schemes, the maintenance of demand and supply on the securities market, the expansion of the application of principles of financial transparency and corporate governance, the improvement of the legal and normative framework in respect to the securities market, and the improvement of market awareness and professional skills. The realization of the program has been divided into three phases. The first phase is the modernization of the infrastructure of the securities market. The time framework for phase one is 2011-2014. The second phase concerns the automation and consolidation of transactions on the securities market, and it covers the years 2015-2017. And the third phase will focus on the introduction of new and more complex tools and services in the securities market. This phase will be realized during 2018-2020. The infrastructure of the Azerbaijani capital markets consists of the State Committee for Securities, which is the regulatory body, the BSE, the National Depository Center, which is the central securities depository and registrar, and the brokers and dealers, who are the professional participants acting as the securities trading intermediaries on the market.  With this regard, the realization of the targets of the state program is very important for the development of the whole securities market and its actors. The BSE is now correlating its newly adopted strategic plan in parallel with the state program's main directions.</p><h4>What are the main activities the BSE carries out currently?</h4><p>The BSE's main activity is the trading of securities. We organize and conduct real-time auctions by means of an electronic and fully automated trading platform, which is the property of the BSE. We also carry out clearing and settlement activities using the BSE's clearing account at the Central Bank. The BSE keeps records of the mutual obligations of counter-parties during trading sessions and ensures those obligations according to the auction's results. We additionally provide depository services for government securities. The BSE also provides the necessary market information to all stakeholders by means of its official website, and periodic data bulletins.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the BSE's trading activity in the recent past?</h4><p>Let's compare 2010 and 2011. The difference is clear and it is huge. For example, in October 2010, the average daily turnover was around AZN5.65 million. In October 2011 the same figure was AZN18.4 million. The Azerbaijani business community is becoming more and more aware of the capital markets. The possibilities are expanding every day. Such periods of interest historically result in massive overhauls of the markets and rapid development. The outcome of these periods are the development of an appropriate trading architecture, favorable investment possibilities, and regional expansion. Azerbaijan today is on the threshold of such a period.</p><h4>What level of FDI have you seen over recent years?</h4><p>The number of practical regulation changes liberalizing the process of conducting business has been exceptional. Among them one can mention the law on the protection of foreign investment and the law on investment activity. Later, Azerbaijan carried out some revolutionary legal reforms including the adoption of the new Tax Code, civil procedures, land and labor regulations, customs courts, and foreign exchange law, as well as a the law on international arbitration that made the system more transparent and business friendly. Azerbaijan is the leading FDI destination in the region. In the last decade FDI in Azerbaijan exceeded $100 billion. It is a very good signal that FDI is becoming diversified. More and more investors are looking to the non-oil sector. The creation of favorable conditions for this dynamic is the one of the main aims of the government.</p><h4>In which non-prime sectors do you see the greatest opportunity?</h4><p>The state priority is for the development of the non-oil sector. Within this, great opportunities can be found in all the non-prime sectors. FDI is more commonly seen in the transport, agriculture, construction, telecoms, and retail sectors. Starting from the first days of its activity, the BSE has been establishing relations with foreign investors. These relations developed with the coming of the first foreign investors to the Azerbaijan capital markets from 2004. Later, this interest became wider and deeper from the point of view of investment volumes and the increasing number of investors. Together with other sectors, the financial sector of Azerbaijan has a good base to become the financial hub of the region. That is why we strive toward becoming a regional financial hub by providing a fertile environment and favorable investment opportunities for investors in our capital markets.</p><h4>What level of cooperation does BSE have with its international counterparts?</h4><p>The BSE has always paid attention to increasing relations with its international counterparts. It is necessary from the one hand in order to obtain more experience from them, and on the other hand to make the international financial community more aware about us. It is necessary in order to attract more foreign investors to Azerbaijan's capital markets. Azerbaijan is a member of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges, and one of the BSE's shareholders is the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE), which has always been useful for us. Thus, one of our main objectives is to generate more continuous interest in our capital markets by establishing strong cooperation with more and more counterparts.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the future?</h4><p>We expect to become more institutionally strong, and are working hard to organize, manage, and develop transparent, easily accessible, and effective markets. We aim to organize market possibilities for investors, issuers, and intermediaries so as to contribute to the financial and economic growth of Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ateshgah's insurance premiums amounted to AZN18.5 million by January 2012. How has the company sought to position itself in the market?</h4><p>Ateshgah Insurance Company was established in 1996, and in December 2011 we celebrated our 15th anniversary. Ateshgah initially functioned as a company totally focused on the corporate segment. New legislation that came into force demanded the separation of company activities into life and non-life lines by establishing separate life insurance companies. For this reason, in 2009 Ateshgah created the first specialized life insurance company in Azerbaijan: Ateshgah Life. In the same year we consolidated all of our insurance companies into the Ateshgah Insurance Group of Companies. Having more than 15 years of history in the Azerbaijani market, Ateshgah Insurance currently holds the leading position in the insurance industry and has licenses for more than 20 types of insurance activities. In 1998 there were only 15 employees at Ateshgah, but now there are almost 300 employees, including the staff in all the offices throughout the country. During 2011 we signed more than 72,000 new insurance contracts, which exceeded the previous year's result by more than 60%. Our success, to a great extent, depends on our counterparts. That's why we are very selective and maintain high standards for our reinsurance and brokerage partners. For example, our key partners include Hannover Re (Germany), SCOR (France), Swiss Re (Switzerland), Munich Re (Germany), and ROSNO (Russia).</p><h4>How will recent changes in Azerbaijani insurance laws and the increase of compulsory product lines impact Ateshgah and the sector as a whole?</h4><p>Due to the historical development curve of the insurance industry, we were behind other countries in the greater region. However, our growth rate has transformed into one of the highest in countries with transitional economies. There are two major indicators to assess the inclusion of insurance services in a country: gross written premiums over GDP, which is called insurance market penetration, and gross written premiums per capita. For example, our insurance market penetration lags behind Kazakhstan's by 50%. Even in developed countries, the popularity of insurance products in modern society is due to the adoption of compulsory insurance laws. From an economic rationale, compulsory types of insurance guarantee citizens security from unusual events—the byproducts of substantial growth, which our economy currently experiences. The latest two compulsory insurance legislation acts, including one for industrial accidents, have accelerated the growth rate of the insurance industry. The law on compulsory types of insurance covers four types of insurance: immobile property, passenger, fire protection, and third-party motor liability. All of these compulsory insurance types have a huge impact on instilling a culture of using insurance products in our country. Ateshgah, among other leading insurance companies, put a lot of effort into the development of these legislative initiatives by actively participating in working groups and examining international experiences. When it comes to our market penetration, we believe we will be able to increase our share up to 15%.</p><h4>Ateshgah insured the face of the winner of Eurovision 2011, Nigar Jamal, in the first instance of exclusive insurance in the industry. Its portfolio also includes the “Temple of Fire." How are such high profile elements placed within your business strategy?</h4><p>Our vision is to remain the leader in the financial services sector due to innovative business practices, while contributing to the preservation of Azerbaijan's cultural heritage as well as a prosperous and environmentally clean future. The promotion of the country and preservation of our cultural heritage is a social responsibility for our company. We believe that the victory of our representatives in Eurovision is a good avenue for every Azerbaijani to promote this country. We decided to take this chance in order to promote our country and meanwhile increase our brand awareness. The “Temple of Fire" is a unique piece of Azerbaijani heritage, which is also part of our country's branding activities. We decided to insure it for $3 million at our expense, and the Ministry of Tourism is the beneficiary of this deal.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for 2012? How do you see the size, nature, and direction of the Azerbaijan insurance market evolving in the upcoming years?</h4><p>According to the projections of the Ministry of Finance, total written premiums in 2012 will reach around AZN280 million-AZN300 million. In 2011 this indicator was AZN213 million, increasing more than 37% over 2010. The primary source of growth will come from compulsory types of insurance. If we examine the development of insurance industries in the CIS region and Eastern European countries, we see that the implementation of compulsory insurance gave the sector a push, and 2012 promises to be a very interesting year for the insurance market in this respect. Also, interest from multinationals engaged in the insurance business will foster the institutional development of the local market. Insurance companies will start implementing best business practices and the latest technologies. The insurance industry will keep growing at an extremely high rate in the coming years.</p><h4>What kind of business opportunities do you see for foreign investors in the Azerbaijani insurance market?</h4><p>Our country generates almost 85% of the GDP of the Caucasus region. There is a consistent economic policy to decrease the oil dependence of the country. There are many opportunities for foreign investors in any field of our country's economy, especially in industry. High real returns, which are possible in our economy, are an attractive element for foreign investors. Much has been invested in infrastructure, especially the development of roads and the redevelopment of urban and rural areas. These are only a few of the factors attracting foreign investors. Having said that, I believe we need to develop the equity markets through reforms in order to make our investment climate even friendlier to foreigners.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) project within your future plans to increase gas exports to Europe?</h4><p>The package of gas agreements that Azerbaijan signed with Turkey includes the construction of TANAP and the terms and rules for gas transit through Turkey. The agreements are internationally and politically important, as proved by the joint declaration on the Southern Gas Corridor signed by President Ilham Aliyev and the president of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso. TANAP will be the first project of this magnitude transporting large volumes of gas to Europe. Azerbaijan's geopolitical and geostrategic situation enables the country to become a major transit hub for energy supplies destined for both Europe and Central Asia. The European Commissioner for Energy, Günther Oettinger, visited Baku in 2011 to participate in a group designed to evaluate and address potential legal, political, commercial, and technical issues that could arise in connection with the development of the Southern Gas Corridor. The European energy map is changing, and thanks to the long-term projects developed in Azerbaijan and the region, these changes will have a big impact on us. We are in a key decision-making phase regarding regional energy security. Azerbaijan's main advantage is its diversified network of pipelines and reliable transport infrastructure, which positions the country as a key energy partner for Europe and the US.</p><h4>Since Azerbaijan has extensive experience in the energy sector, how can the country contribute to the development of the region?</h4><p>As a result of the successful realization of the national oil strategy, Azerbaijan has attracted many foreign investors, and the continuation of this trend is one of our main priorities. The country's role in the energy sector has evolved over the years, reinforcing our position as the state's largest investor in countries such as Georgia, Ukraine, and Turkey. The Kulevi Oil Terminal in Georgia is a good example of such a trend; Azerbaijan supported Georgia by opening petrol stations and developing a gas distribution network. In Turkey, one of the most important Azerbaijani assets is Petkim, a company that produces petrochemical products. Currently, Petkim's products represent 27% of the Turkish market. Azerbaijan is also further expanding its relations with Pakistan in the energy sector, carrying out the exploration and production of oil and gas fields in a country with great potential. We are sharing our broad experience in the field to contribute to the development of other countries.</p><h4>You were quoted saying that Azerbaijan's annual oil and gas revenues reached $20 billion in 2011. What were the final results of 2011 in terms of production and revenue?</h4><p>President Ilham Aliyev approved a decree on the long-term strategy for the use of oil and gas revenues in September 2004. The decree encourages investment in the oil and gas sector and promotes the active development of the non-oil sector of the economy, the development of SMEs, large-scale infrastructure development, the implementation of poverty reduction measures, human capital development, a strengthening of the country's defense capabilities, and other such strategies. Although oil production in 2011 decreased by 5%, the country's non-oil industry grew by 11.1%, demonstrating that the oil revenues from previous years have been fueling the growth of other sectors of the economy. Moreover, large portions of the major investments made in 2011 were aimed at increasing currency reserves. For the first time, Azerbaijan's foreign currency reserves reached $40 billion, which proves that we have been able to maximize the effective use of oil revenues.</p><h4>What were some of the other major industrial and energy achievements of Azerbaijan in 2011?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has strengthened its position as an oil and gas major after new large gas fields were discovered in 2011. The discovery of 200 billion cubic meters (bcm) of reserves and 30-40 billion tons of condensate at the Umid gas field will lead to heavy production in the next three to four years, spearheaded by SOCAR's $5 billion investment. In addition, exploration was successfully conducted at the Absheron gas field, and according to the preliminary data, there are an estimated 350 bcm of gas reserves. Azerbaijan is also operating the world's first solar and wind hybrid-electric power station, which will enable the country to initiate new efforts in the field of renewable energy. There are a number of other important projects such as the development of a solar park, which will further strengthen Azerbaijan's industrial potential.</p><h4>What are the key priorities for the Ministry in the field of renewable energy?</h4><p>The favorable geographical position and climatic conditions of the country allow us to increase the proportion of renewable energy in the future and reduce the impact on the environment. Over the last few years, we have prioritized the development of important wind and solar projects, and one of our focuses for the future will be on electrical and thermal energy. The state strategy will outline the answers and guidelines for the long-term development of our potential in the alternative energy sphere. In this regard, Azerbaijan, as a full member of the International Renewable Energy Agency, is fully committed to complying with the organization's activities and tasks. It is no coincidence that President lham Aliyev signed a decree in honor of the worldwide implementation of alternative energy sources, as our energy goals are reflected in the use and further development of alternative and renewable energy in our country. In the coming years, Azerbaijan will maintain emphasis on its energy-saving and environmental protection policies.</p><h4>What role will Azerbaijani SMEs play in the further development of the industrial sector? What are the major development plans that the Ministry is implementing?</h4><p>One of our main priorities for the future is to further strengthen and develop the base of Azerbaijani SMEs, because there is a need to create large industrial enterprises in our country, such as the recently inaugurated Ganja aluminum plant. Our aim is to increase the activity of SMEs in the industrial sector of the country and to attract further investments in this field. At present, we are successfully implementing a number of state and regional development programs to achieve our future goals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Over the past 20 years, thanks to the rational use of its energy resources, Azerbaijan has become a diversified economy. After restoring its independence, the Azerbaijani people became masters of their own wealth. Our country is developing successfully. Our economic development indicators from the past several years have been truly impressive: our economy has grown by 300% since 2004. Of course, we realize that most of this growth has occurred in the oil and gas sector. And this is quite natural for a country that has been independent for only 20 years. All countries, in particular those in transition, should make the best of their resources and natural wealth to build a strong economy. This has been our goal and policy. The attraction of billions of dollars in investment to our oil and gas sector has helped us diversify our economy. We have now set a new objective. The new objective is to double our GDP, which we have already tripled in size since 2004. However, now we want to double the size of the economy by developing the non-oil sector.<br></p><p>As a country producing oil and gas, we always view GDP from both an energy and non-energy standpoint. In 2010, for instance, the non-oil industry grew by 11% and the non-oil sector by 9%. Our next objective is to modernize and diversify the country and develop it for the next 10-12 years. As the first program on regional development was adopted in 2004, in 2014 we will embark on a new 10-year development period.</p><p>The total volume of investment made in our economy in the last 15 years is $110 billion. In 2011 alone a total of $20 billion was invested in our economy, of which $7 billion was FDI. This shows that Azerbaijan is still attractive for foreign countries, and that this is not only due to the oil and gas sector. The volume of investment in the oil and gas sector is decreasing because all of the major projects have been completed. Investment in the manufacturing sector, tourism, and services is on the increase. We have channeled the financial resources fetched by the sale of oil and gas into the real sector of the economy, as well as IT and education.</p><p>Several years ago, I stated that we must turn our “black gold" into human capital. The experience of developed countries shows that it is possible to become a developed country only through technological and educational progress. For this reason, we are sending our young people to the leading universities of the world, and we are seeing the benefits of that.</p><p>We are already recognized as a country with a favorable investment environment. The volume of FDI in Azerbaijan is the highest in the CIS. The competitiveness of our economy is growing. According to the Davos Economic Forum, the Azerbaijani economy is ranked 55th in the world and first in the CIS in terms of competitiveness. This is a major achievement for us. It proves that our policy of diversification is paying off. Of course, the energy sector will continue to dominate our economy. This is natural because oil production constitutes about 50 million tons. Gas production this year will be close to 30 billion cubic meters (bcm). By implementing new projects and attracting investment, we can raise this figure to 50 bcm. So no matter how hard we may try to develop the non-oil economy, energy will always dominate our GDP. But this is natural, and it opens up new horizons for us, because Azerbaijan's economic and energy policies are now transforming into our country's political clout.</p><p>The EU views us as a country contributing to the Southern Gas Corridor that will deliver Azerbaijani gas to Europe; we are the country making this project possible. We have made several important achievements in the past several months, signed transit agreements and agreements on the construction of a gas pipeline that will transport large volumes of Azerbaijani gas to Europe. We will benefit from that even more than from the energy projects we started in 1994, because there were no companies capable of carrying out such large-scale activities then.</p><p>We talk a lot about diversification and energy security. These two issues are interrelated. But when we talk about diversification and energy security for European consumers, I think we need to talk more about diversification of sources rather than the diversification of routes from one source. However, the diversification of routes is also important. Thus, Azerbaijan is a new, large, close, and friendly source for European consumers. If we can implement our plans on the construction of the powerful Southern Corridor, we will enter a phase of very fruitful and mutually beneficial energy cooperation in the next decade. Therefore, energy security has become an important national security issue. We, as producers, understand this and want all of our partners to treat this issue in the same manner.</p><p>No country can build future development plans without energy security and prognostication. We are aware of the changes and approaches to the various sources of energy, especially after the tragedy at the Fukushima nuclear plant. Thus, it is clear that the demand for gas is set to grow. Azerbaijan is a resource-rich country committed to open policies and having strong links with European institutions.</p><p>I would also like to say a few words about our obligations not only as a country rich in energy resources, a producing, transporting, and potentially a transit state, but also as a country that treats its natural resources with great care. For more than a century, Azerbaijan's oil reserves were developed without any attention being paid to the environment. The concept of the “environment" was not evaluated in due measure in the past. Today, our obligation is to clean up the “legacy" left over from the decades of oil production off- and onshore and to contribute to the global environmental cause. So even though we have oil, gas, and markets, we are now investing in renewable energy. We believe that this is part of our commitment. We are investing in hydropower engineering. In 2011, we began to invest in solar and wind energy. We are not investing because we  desperately need these alternative sources, nor are we investing because this is an important part of our energy balance, but because we treat this as an obligation to the previous and future generations.</p><p>We also now have large companies engaged in the service, energy, and non-energy sectors. They will contribute a portion of the $20 billion investment in our gas fields. Thus this wealth will be spread  out in a diversified manner. In general, one of our biggest achievements playing a role in the economy is transparency. Azerbaijan joined the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative eight years ago, and is now a full member of it. We have achieved complete transparency in our energy sector.</p><p>Now we are changing the system. We are applying this approach to the financial system as a whole. Thus, the prospects for the future are positive, the economy is stable, sustainable, self-sufficient, and it receives strong support from the energy sector, as well as creates a completely clear picture of the strategic future of the country. Our ultimate goal is to turn Azerbaijan into a developed country. All of our structures and ministries are working toward that goal.</p><p>A very important event for our country occurred in 2011. Azerbaijan was elected to the UN Security Council for the first time. This is a major historic victory. I think that this is our biggest victory in the 20 years of independence. We have earned the confidence of the whole world in a difficult struggle. I have repeatedly stated in the last eight years that Azerbaijan is pursuing independent policies. Azerbaijan has a road of its own. This is a road of development, progress, and democracy, and the Azerbaijani people have chosen this road.</p><p>The problem worrying us the most is the unresolved status of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan is stepping up its efforts in all countries, especially in the recent period. However, the solution of this issue depends not only on us. Unfortunately, Armenia's non-constructive stance, its hypocrisy in negotiations, and its practical defiance in talks have dealt a serious blow to the process. Sadly, the world community and the countries directly dealing with the issue are shying away from naming the party responsible for disrupting the talks.</p><p>There are, however, positive statements. We are hearing and supporting these statements. In particular, this year's development has been the repeated indication by the co-chairs of the peace process that the status quo is unacceptable. We support these statements. However, specific steps should follow statements. Unfortunately, these steps have not been taken.</p><p>We will continue our diplomatic and political efforts. We have a principled stance in the negotiations. We will not back down a single step from this stance. Nagorno-Karabakh is native and historical Azerbaijani land. The international community and the UN recognize and support Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. The international community views Nagorno-Karabakh as a part of Azerbaijan. The conflict must be resolved precisely on these principles. The territorial integrity of our country must be restored. The occuppying forces must withdraw from all our occupied territories. Azerbaijani citizens must be able to return to the occupied territories, including Nagorno-Karabakh and Shusha. Only then can a lasting peace be established. We will never tolerate a second Armenian state on native Azerbaijani lands. This is our principled position. I want to reiterate that this position is based on history, international law, and justice.</p><p>There have been both difficult and great days in these 20 years of independence. And I am absolutely sure that there are only great days in store for us in the future. Azerbaijan will continue to develop and grow stronger. The past 20 years of independence have shown that the people of Azerbaijan can live as an independent nation and live well. The state of Azerbaijan has asserted itself in the region as a stabilizing factor. No projects can be implemented in the region without Azerbaijan's participation. The experience of recent years has shown this yet again. Azerbaijan is a force to be reckoned with in all economic, energy, political, diplomatic, and regional cooperation matters. We have achieved this ourselves, and we must protect this achievement. We must and we will protect our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are considered one of the most energetic first ladies in the world. You head the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, the Friends of Azerbaijani Culture Friends Foundation, Azerbaijan's Gymnastics Federation, and you are also a member of the Azerbaijani National Assembly. What does such vigorous and multifaceted activity mean personally for you?</h4><p>Success for success' sake, power for power's sake, and ambition have never been key motivations for me. The main thing is to be of help to people, and to find ways of helping those in need. And such help and support can be very diverse. Some need help to have their health brought back, to get education, or to establish a museum, while others need help to preserve architectural monuments for future generations. Sometimes there is a necessity to support the development of infrastructure, sometimes there is a need to provide organizational support for interesting projects, and what is really important to me is when we succeed in both realizing large-scale projects and helping real people.</p><h4>The Heydar Aliyev Foundation was established in 2004. Since its establishment it has realized a wide range of cultural, educational, and healthcare projects. How would you assess the results of the Foundation's work?</h4><p>It's quite difficult to classify our activity and the projects and programs we have implemented from major to minor ones. From the very beginning we set a range of priority directions in our work, such as education, healthcare, culture, sport, and the social sphere. For eight years the Heydar Aliyev Foundation has been successfully implementing large-scale projects in these spheres. We managed to build cooperation with influential international organizations and arrange high-profile international conferences and festivals in Baku. The Foundation continues its work to improve the education system and ensure its integration into the world education system, as well as help those who need care, preserve national and moral values, and draw the world community's attention to Azerbaijani realities. There is such a concept as the “human dimension," and our Foundation is working on this aspect. It is very hard to separate the tasks, to say that this is a matter of urgency, and this one can wait. For example, hundreds of schools, tens of kindergartens, and specialized boarding schools for children with special needs have been built, repaired, and equipped to the highest standards as part of the Foundation's projects and programs. And this is not just fresh repair work on the building. Such state-of-the-art schools open brand new horizons, creating wider opportunities for students, which include tens of thousands of boys and girls every year. A Jewish education center was established, and a French school is going to open its doors to students at the initiative of the Foundation. I'm sure of the importance of this work, and this investment in the future can hardly be exaggerated. At the same time, our Foundation is carrying out great work in the field of health care. This includes hospitals and clinics, state-of-the-art equipment, and projects aimed at helping children with diabetes and thalassemia. Each of these projects means saved lives and recovered health. Supporting culture and preserving cultural legacy is another important priority in our Foundation's activity. With the support of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, Azerbaijan is hosting music festivals and a traditional international mugham festival, the Gabala international music festival, and a festival of classical music named after Rostropovich. The International Mugham Center was built in Baku, while new museums and musical schools have emerged in the regions. We are actively cooperating with many international organizations, including UNESCO, ISESCO, and UNICEF. However, the major result of our Foundation's work is that we have managed—I hope—to revive the traditions of charity in Azerbaijan. In our country, these traditions have a long and rich history. Oil magnates from the era of the first oil boom, including Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev and Musa Nagiyev, made a tremendous contribution to the formation of these traditions. In the early 20th century Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev funded the construction of the first secular school for girls and the opening of the first national theater in Azerbaijan. He also funded the education of Azerbaijani youths in the best universities in Russia and Europe. Beautiful buildings constructed with the funds of Musa Nagiyev continue to be the architectural pearls of Baku. And it is good that these traditions are today revived in tolerant, secular Azerbaijan, which has an ancient history and is located on the crossroads of the East and the West, and where the past interweaves with the present.</p><h4>The Heydar Aliyev Foundation is making a valuable contribution to preserving a rare cultural legacy not only in Azerbaijan, but also in other countries. For example, it has supported the restoration of the stained-glass windows in the Strasbourg Cathedral. How significant are such activities?</h4><p>An ancient and rich cultural legacy is a source of national pride for our people. This includes carpet weaving, which dates back thousands of years, literature, and music, which offer a fascinating mix of East and West, as well as the architectural monuments of Azerbaijan, which earn the epithet “motionless history." The Azerbaijani mugham, the Novruz holiday, the art of ashiqs, and carpet weaving were incorporated into the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List. And historical and cultural legacy requires constant and tireless care. Any lost artifact means irreplaceable losses and, I can say for sure, it is a crime against future generations, and so we are trying our best to preserve cultural legacy both in our country and beyond its borders to the maximum extent. The Heydar Aliyev Foundation has restored architectural monuments, such as the Palace of Versailles in Paris, which are included in the World Heritage List. We also allocated funds to restore the stained-glass windows of the 14th-century Strasbourg Cathedral, restore the Louvre, rebuild the Berlin City Palace, which was destroyed during World War II, as well as restore damaged medieval Azerbaijani manuscripts kept in the Vatican's archives. The Foundation will continue working on this front. Currently, we are carrying out negotiations over the restoration of cultural monuments in the Vatican. Building cultural and humanitarian relations with other countries is of great importance to us. It is cultural and humanitarian cooperation that affects how well we know each other, and how familiar we are with the history, culture, and traditions of other people. In 2011, the Heydar Aliyev Foundation organized a large number of events in different countries on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the restoration of Azerbaijan's independence. We hope that these events have helped many people to familiarize themselves with and love our music, culture, and art. This January, the “Fly to Baku: Contemporary Art from Azerbaijan" exhibition took place in London with the assistance of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation. The exhibition featured interesting works in a variety of genres, including painting, graphics, photography, and video. Such exhibitions will be arranged in Berlin, New York, Paris, and Rome. I would like to emphasize that the Heydar Aliyev Foundation's international activity is not limited to the field of culture. The Foundation built a girls' school in Muzaffarabad in Pakistan after an earthquake destroyed the old school. We contributed to building and repairing schools in the Netherlands, Georgia, Egypt, the Russian Federation, and Romania. We provided financial assistance in tackling the consequences of the earthquake in Haiti and floods in Romania. I would like to note that the Heydar Aliyev Foundation will continue contributing to expanding Azerbaijan's dialogue with other countries. This is a beautiful foundation for international cooperation.</p><h4>Azerbaijan's economy continues to rapidly develop amid the world economic crisis. How important is it to develop the traditions of charity in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's successes are obvious. The state budget increased 16 fold, and thousands of schools, hundreds of healthcare facilities, and tens of sports complexes have been built in the country. The level of poverty fell fivefold from 49% to 9%. Our beloved native Baku has changed, and changes have also occurred in Azerbaijan's regions. This makes it possible to assess the scale and rate of the country's development. Nevertheless, there is an enormous field of activity for non-commercial foundations. First of all, it is a cultural sphere. Today, Azerbaijan is recognized mostly as an exporter of oil and gas. However, our history and our culture is an important national heritage as well. There is also the necessity to support social projects, but the level of socio-economic development is not the point here.</p><p>In my opinion, feelings and inner emotions are more important. As the economic crisis continues it is vital to form the traditions of charity and social responsibility, and instill the ability to sympathize and empathize into ourselves. This must become part of our life.</p><h4>Less than a year ago Azerbaijan celebrated the victory of its duo Ell &amp; Nikki at the Eurovision Song Contest in Düsseldorf. Since you head the Eurovision 2012 Organizing Committee, how is Azerbaijan gearing up to host such important event?</h4><p>Probably it's no exaggeration to say that our representatives' victory at the Eurovision Song Contest was marked by nationwide celebrations. And as an Azerbaijani, and as a citizen of my country, I was truly thrilled with the triumph of the duo. This, surely, is a great success of both the participants of the contest and all those involved in preparing this winning performance. The victory at Eurovision is a good example that shows that success and responsibility walk together in life. Preparations for such a large-scaled contest include many aspects: a concert hall, hotels, city logistics, and infrastructure. Our preparations are already nearing an end, and I hope we will summarize the results of the last stage of preparation for Eurovision in April 2012. I would like to point out another aspect. Eurovision is a common feast of music from different countries, different people, and different cultures. In Azerbaijan, for centuries, representatives of various nationalities and religions have co-existed in peace and harmony. Being a country located at the crossroads of continents and civilizations, we are familiar with different religions and cultural values, customs, and traditions. Our traditions of tolerance provide a brilliant foundation so that all conditions are created for every visitor who comes to Azerbaijan as an organizer, observer, or just a member of the audience. I hope the beauty of Baku, which combines old buildings in eastern architectural styles and modern European-style buildings, will fully meet the requirements of even the most demanding guests with its delightful aura, cordiality, and hospitality. Tens of thousands of people from different countries will visit Baku for Eurovision 2012, and we are happy to give them all a proper reception.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will the impact of Azerbaijan's non-permanent two-year membership of the UN Security Council be, and what are your priorities in this regard?</h4><p>Since joining the UN on March 2, 1992, Azerbaijan has consistently demonstrated its commitment to the principles and goals of the UN Charter and international law, which are, in my view, indispensable preconditions for a peaceful, prosperous, and just world. Azerbaijan was elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council with the support of 155 countries, and I believe that this represents the recognition of the accomplishments our nation has achieved over the past 20 years of independence. At the same time, we are aware of the great responsibility our membership on the UN Security Council brings, but feel ready to take on any challenge. We will make our utmost efforts to support international peace, justice, security, and stability. Let me underscore the importance of transparency in decision-making, accountability, and consistency in the implementation of adopted resolutions. As a non-permanent member, Azerbaijan will play a great role in making the UN Security Council more transparent, inclusive, and effective, so as to better respond to the threats and challenges that our world faces today.</p><h4>What role has Azerbaijan played in promoting regional cooperation and development?</h4><p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union and since the very first days of independence, it was actually Azerbaijan that unlocked the potential of the Caspian Sea and South Caucasus region by leading the pace of development in the oil and gas and transportation sectors, and, in general, attracting FDI, which immediately helped Azerbaijan and the whole region create a better investment climate. Azerbaijan has successfully positioned itself as a regional leader in terms of increasing regional investment and removing infrastructure bottlenecks. In times of political volatility and risk, with the ambitious “Contract of the Century" and the Silk Road milestones, Azerbaijan initiated a policy of massive, large-scale investment in oil and gas exploration and production in the Caspian Sea, as well as laying down solid regional transportation infrastructure, which resulted in helping the Caspian Sea, Central Asia, and the South Caucasus region to connect to the Black Sea and Mediterranean regions. The role our country assumed, in fact, helped to untap the export and import needs of the wider region as a whole. Our projects in inland, multi-modal, aviation transportation, and the oil and gas sectors enabled technology transfer, the transfer of sector-specific expertise, and growth in tourism opportunities across the region, increasing both employment and income opportunities. All that led to the realization of many commercially strategic regional projects such as TRACECA, Baku-Supsa, Baku-Batumi, Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan, and the South Caucasus Export Pipelines, which transport not only our crude oil and natural gas, but also similar commodities produced in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Today, Azerbaijan wants to maximize the opportunities for itself and the region in general, promoting and enabling projects such as the Customs Cooperation Initiative, the Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey Electricity Bridge, the Aid-for-Trade Initiative, and the Southern Gas Corridor. In these days of competitive globalization, our new ambitious regional and inter-regional projects are focused on the ICT sector and the realization of the Trans-Eurasian Information Super Highway project (TASIM). Through its numerous efforts, Azerbaijan managed to bring many businesses and governmental partners to the negotiating table. In so doing, we brought forward the idea of using our regional geography to create politically solid, financially bankable, and long-term commercially viable partnerships in the region. Azerbaijan could not have achieved that if it had not been for its ability to build sustainable cooperation and partnership projects.</p><h4>How would you assess the strategic partnership between Turkey and Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan and Turkey have enjoyed fraternal relations from the very first day of our independence, and as you may know Turkey was the first nation to recognize the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991. We are strong allies and strategic partners on many issues. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Trans-Anatolian Gas Pipeline (TANAP), which was signed between Azerbaijan and Turkey at the end of December 2011, is one of the numerous agreements existing between the two countries. These documents contribute to the enhancement of our strategic partnership, which is also based on deep historical ties, as well as cultural, linguistic, and religious kinship. Azerbaijan and Turkey also share common positions on the issue of energy diversification. The TANAP project will further advance our cooperation in this direction. It is worth noting that the agreements on the transit, purchase, and sale of natural gas that were signed in Izmir on October 25, 2011 at the first meeting of the High Level Strategic Cooperation Council of Azerbaijan and Turkey paved the way for further endeavors in the energy field. The construction of the Star refinery is also a big economic commitment and Azerbaijan's first great investment project abroad, worth $5.5 billion.</p><h4>What is the significance of Azerbaijan joining the Non-Aligned Movement? How is Azerbaijan looking to revitalize its engagement with NATO?</h4><p>We consider Azerbaijan's joining the Non-Aligned Movement and our relations with NATO on different tracks. Membership in the Non-Aligned Movement allows the Republic of Azerbaijan to effectively cooperate with non-aligned countries in various fields and contribute to the Movement's constructive role in international relations for the purpose of achieving a more just, equal, and law-abiding world order. Azerbaijan pursues a multi-dimensional and balanced foreign policy and has proven to be a reliable partner, as well as a strong and, to a greater extent, decisive country to cooperate with in the Caspian-Caucasus region. The Non-Aligned Movement represents a forum where we hold useful dialogue on global peace, security, and justice. When it comes to our partnership with NATO, it is worthwhile to mention that integration into European and Euro-Atlantic structures remains one of the strategic goals of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan was among the first countries that signed up to NATO's Partnership for Peace (PFP) program on May 4, 1994. In order to improve cooperation with NATO and bring it to the next level, Azerbaijan joined the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP) in May 2004. IPAP has proven itself to be an effective mechanism, allowing for a substantive political dialogue and intensive practical reform effort. In the framework of the IPAP process, dozens of cooperative projects are carried out on a broad spectrum of issues, ranging from preparing military units for international operations, to environmental cooperation and public diplomacy. Azerbaijan and NATO have recently endorsed the third stage of IPAP, consisting of politics and security, defense and military issues, public information, civil emergency planning, science and environmental issues, administrative issues, security of information resources, and  legal issues.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key reforms the Ministry has implemented since it was established in 2005?<br></h4><p>The Ministry of Emergency Situations was established on December 16, 2005 to prevent and reduce the consequences of natural and man-made disasters and forest fires; centralize rescue and rehabilitation management; and organize and implement a civil defense network for the country. We also aim to increase awareness of natural and technogenic disasters, eliminate their consequences, and strengthen the systematic approach to crisis management at the state level. Changes to the Ministry's structure and regulatory framework have been continuously carried out; a material-technical basis and material resources have been established; information about emergency situations has been disseminated among different agencies; and activities concerning the elimination of consequences have been coordinated.</p><p>Over the past few years, we have purchased and upgraded our materials and equipment. We have invested in special-purpose emergency vehicles, training equipment, and specialized clothing and uniforms for the State Fire Protection Service and Special Risk Rescue Service. We have also acquired a variety of specialized vehicles such as boats, scooters, planes, and helicopters for the State Water Rescue Service and the Aviation Group. Furthermore, we have purchased specialized medical and rescue equipment for the Medical Service. Thus, thanks to the special care of the management of the country, the Ministry has become a fully and technologically equipped mobile entity capable of fulfilling all of its duties. Meanwhile, the Ministry has established its own training academy in order to train personnel and conduct scientific research in the field of emergency situations. Over the last decade, the personnel of the Ministry have successfully taken part in rescue operations such as large-scale firefighting, structural collapses, explosions, accidents, landslides, mudflows and floods, and other natural and man-made disasters.</p><h4>What are some of the major policies the Ministry has implemented to lower the level of road fatalities and work-related accidents?</h4><p>We established and equipped rescue groups in 12 regions able to respond immediately to emergency situations. They conducted numerous rescue operations in response to transportation accidents in 2011. Hundreds of injured people were rescued from damaged vehicles and brought to medical care facilities. We have also analyzed current road, rail, bridge, and intersection technical data in order to install effective security devices. Every year, the Ministry's specialists supervise and conduct technical examinations on more than 100,000 installations and equipment in the oil and gas industry, and fuel and natural gas facilities. We are also aiming to protect the environment by monitoring the mining, metallurgy, chemicals, petrochemicals, and oil and gas processing sectors, as well as the transportation of dangerous goods by rail, road, and pipeline. Additionally, we control workers' safety in order to prevent accidents and eliminate potential risks. Moreover, thousands of workers and engineering technical staff are focused on studying safety regulations every year. We aim to raise awareness of civil defense and the rules of conduct during any emergency situation, and we hold regular public awareness events in various educational institutions, establishments, and organizations. Information on accidents and rules of behavior during disasters can be found on the Ministry's website and newspaper.</p><h4>Since the floods that affected Azerbaijan in the spring and summer of 2010, how has the Ministry worked to strengthen riverbanks and improve the natural disaster response system?</h4><p>Thousands of workers, helicopters and rescue boats, and a large quantity of equipment were used in the Ministry's active rescue operation during the heavy rainfall and flooding in 2010. The level of groundwater rapidly rose in coastal areas, and the Kura and Aras rivers overflowed their banks. We brought this natural disaster under control, thanks to our constant awareness of the events and the urgent measures taken. Most importantly, we were able to prevent the loss of human life. The people evacuated from the disaster area were relocated to temporary shelters and camps, and the necessary infrastructure was established for the convenience of the temporary settled population. We were able to meet all their needs, especially in terms of health and safety, through the medical offices we set up in the camps. We investigated the causes of the flood, and we have undertaken reconstruction projects by strengthening damaged dams and repairing more than 300 kilometers of the Kura River system. We have taken the necessary steps to eliminate future risks and improve security measures in areas along waterways, such as conducting comprehensive research and investigations with specialists from Dutch companies.</p><p>The volume of the Kura and Araz rivers was determined by models and the water consumption of both rivers was calculated. Taking into account these calculations and as a result of the temporary working regime of the Mingachevir water reservoir, we were able to avoid the floods in 2011 despite the same volume of water flowing compared to 2010. Under the Ministry, we established the State Agency for Water Resources to improve the management of water resources in the country.</p><h4>How important is international cooperation in improving employee skills in the field of emergency services?</h4><p>Since the Ministry of Emergency Situations was founded, the development of international cooperation has been one of its highest priorities. Therefore, over the last few years we have developed cooperative ties with relevant bodies in the US, Russia, France, Belarus, Ukraine, Turkey, Korea, Bulgaria, Romania, the UK, Israel, Kazakhstan, Germany, Qatar, Greece, Italy, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, and Georgia . The Ministry has also achieved sustainable relations with the UN, OSCE, the Organization for Democracy and Economic Development (GUAM), the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) organization, the International Civil Defense Organization (ICDO), the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ), and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), as well as with other international and regional organizations. In addition, the Ministry's rescue workers have participated in the training sessions of many international organizations in the past few years, such as NATO.</p><h4>How would you assess the role of Azerbaijan as a regional contributor to emergency rescue and humanitarian operations abroad?</h4><p>One of the President of Azerbaijan's main characteristics is his goodwill in terms of assisting other countries that face emergency situations. In accordance with the task of the President, the Ministry has taken an active part in several international rescue operations, delivering humanitarian cargo and sending aid. Azerbaijani rescue personnel have participated in efforts to help people affected by floods in Pakistan and earthquakes in Iran and Turkey. For example, 213 rescue workers from the Ministry were sent immediately to the earthquake zone in the Turkish province of Van. In 2010, our rescue workers took part in the prevention of two large-scale natural disasters in foreign countries. The Aviation Group dispatched two helicopters with 19 rescue workers to help extinguish large-scale forest fires in Russia. Two helicopters with 16 technical personnel were also involved in putting out fires around the city of Haifa in Israel. The relevant services of several countries have praised the Ministry's material-technical base, high-level skills, the professionalism of its personnel, the effective methods and tools it uses for prevention, its management of emergency situations, and elimination of possible side effects. Currently, our rescue personnel, supplied with modern aviation and fire-fighting equipment, mobile hospitals, and other necessary technical agencies, are ready to take an active role in rescue operations abroad at any time.</p><h4>What are the core priorities for the Ministry over the next few years?</h4><p>Our high-priority duties include the completion of the structural formation of the Ministry, the improvement of our regional centers' activity, the development of quality content and services in all of our organizations, the refinement of our legal framework, and the enhancement of international cooperation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>As the largest country in the Caucasus region and located at the heart of ancient civilizations, Azerbaijan is among the most progressive Islamic societies that support secularism, different religions, and tolerance to the highest level. In 2011 the Republic of Azerbaijan celebrated the 20th anniversary of its return to independence, and Italy hosted a series of events to celebrate it. Among them it is worth mentioning the concert at the Opera Theater in Rome December 2011, where the best of Azerbaijani culture was on display and had a great impact on the hundreds of Italians that gathered for that special night. The same day it was a special pleasure to meet First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva at the Quirinale Palace, where we had a fruitful discussion on bilateral and international issues and the activities of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation that, among other commendable things, has launched a very interesting program in our country. President's Aliyev's decision to participate in the celebrations in Rome for the 150th anniversary of Italy's unification on June 2, 2011, was also particularly significant, and it testifies the excellent level that our relations have attained.<br></p><p>Italy and Azerbaijan are linked by deep feelings of friendship and by fruitful, multifaceted cooperation. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992, our two countries have created a growing number of opportunities for intensifying political dialogue both at a bilateral and multilateral level. Membership in the OSCE and in the Council of Europe—strongly supported by the Italian government—represented a historic step in the process of gradual integration into European institutions. Azerbaijan's active cooperation with NATO over the last few years, through participation in the most important military operations, is also remarkable. Our common engagement in Afghanistan, indeed, represents a concrete contribution to creating a more secure world, free from terrorism and extremism, and is motivated by the same foreign policy goal; peace.</p><p>I am also glad to recall that cultural cooperation is very intensive, as well as people-to-people contact, which favors tourism and a better mutual understanding. In 2011 more than 4,000 Azerbaijani citizens visited Italy, not to forget the growing number of Azerbaijani students who attend Italian classes at the Azerbaijan University of Languages in Baku.</p><p>Economic ties are thriving; a significant partnership has developed between our two countries over the last few years. Italy is currently the first economic partner of Azerbaijan, with a bilateral turnover that exceeded ‚¬7.5 billion in 2011. In this context, it is worth mentioning that Azerbaijan recently became Italy's top oil supplier, thus providing a significant contribution to the achievement of Italy's strategic goal of diversifying its energy supplies.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is still a huge potential to be exploited in the economic field. Several new areas of cooperation can open new chapters in the relationship between our two countries, including agriculture, ICT, the food industry, tourism, renewable energy, and many more. This is the reason why the Italian government—namely the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Economic Development—constantly encourage Italian companies, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises, to take part in the process of diversification of the economy carried out by the government.</p><p>Looking at the social aspects, Italy deeply appreciates the model of religious tolerance that Azerbaijan represents in the Caucasus. This is an important achievement that also sets a valuable standard for other states in the Muslim world. As far as foreign policy is concerned, we strongly support efforts aimed at bringing Azerbaijan closer to European institutions. In every international forum we will support this goal. More specifically, we consider the Eastern Partnership to be an important tool to strengthen and widen the scope of cooperation between Azerbaijan and the EU, both at the bilateral level and in multilateral platforms, where our Azerbaijani friends can always rely on our continuing support.</p><p>Cooperation between the EU and Azerbaijan, however, can already rely on the important role that Azerbaijan plays in Europe's energy security, which champions supply diversification. I hope that such cooperation will be further intensified in the near future. We believe that the EU can play a positive role in bringing peace and stability to the region by helping both Azerbaijan and Armenia to find a negotiated solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Efforts to find an agreement on the Basic Principles should continue, and I welcome the fact that both parties have re-committed themselves to the diplomatic process and to finding a peaceful solution. Indeed, the status quo is unacceptable, as was recently reiterated at the G8 Summit in Deauville. The peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is a key strategic interest of the international community, since a settlement of the conflict would pave the way toward stability in the South Caucasus Region, creating new economic opportunities and ensuring a better future for younger generations.</p><p>I am confident that Azerbaijan's election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2012-2013 term will offer a unique opportunity to consolidate the constructive role of the country in the region and beyond. I am also sure that Azerbaijani diplomacy will seize the momentum and contribute to the achievement of UN goals such as international peace and security, but also in the fight against poverty and in preserving the environment, as well as in further promoting religious and cultural dialogue among people.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, energy is the milestone of our partnership, but I would like to underline that it is a different kind of energy that fuels the deep friendship between our two nations; an energy made of cultural respect and admiration that creates the natural sympathy that binds Italy and Azerbaijan. It is the same energy that explains the extraordinary flux in human contact between our two peoples. These feelings are deep and sincere; they represent the most solid and reliable foundation of our partnership and they are also the most important reason for optimism about future relations between Italy and  Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the activities of the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) over the years, and what are the landmark achievements of the fund since it was established?<br></h4><p>Since its establishment more than a decade ago, SOFAZ has grown considerably, both in terms of its assets under management and institutional capacity. Over the past few years, SOFAZ has been the major source of funding for large-scale strategic projects of national importance, namely the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, the Oğuz-Gabala-Baku water pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway, new settlements for internally displaced people, and in financing the education of Azerbaijani students abroad. The three pillars that define SOFAZ's role are: the preservation of macroeconomic stability through fiscal tax discipline, the reduction of dependence on oil revenues, and the development of the non-oil sector. Moreover, SOFAZ aims to achieve intergenerational equity regarding the country's oil wealth. SOFAZ also finances major infrastructural and social projects. Since our first day of operations, transparency has been at the forefront of our priorities. We pride ourselves on being awarded the UN Public Service Award for improving transparency, accountability, and responsiveness in public service in 2007.</p><h4>What are the key strategic priorities of SOFAZ's investment program in 2012?</h4><p>Recently, several amendments have been made concerning the rules of foreign currency asset management. Consequently, SOFAZ's investment spectrum has broadened considerably. According to our investment policies, SOFAZ is now able to invest in new asset classes, such as real estate and gold, and extend its allocation to public and private equities. Additionally, SOFAZ may now invest in assets denominated in the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Furthermore, up to 5% of the SOFAZ's investment portfolio may be allocated to non-investment-grade debt obligations with a credit rating no less than BB-. These changes are aimed at maximizing returns as well as enhancing the diversification of our investment portfolio, which has grown dramatically over the past few years and now exceeds $30 billion.</p><h4>What is the present approximate size of the funds under management? What proportion of SOFAZ's funds is being transferred annually to the state budget?</h4><p>SOFAZ's assets under management reached $29.8 billion by the end of 2011, up from $491.5 million in 2001. The assets are expected to reach around $34 billion by the end of 2012, assuming an average oil price of $100 per barrel. In 2012, $12.5 billion will be transferred to the state budget.</p><h4>Several important oil and gas streams will come online in the next five years. What role will SOFAZ play in the management of these new asset flows?</h4><p>The revenues of the sale of these new oil and gas sources will flow into SOFAZ, and we will invest these new resources according to investment guidelines. The assets under management are expected to reach $200 billion within the next 10 to 15 years.</p><h4>How would you assess SOFAZ's contribution to the education of young Azerbaijanis locally and abroad? What is your evaluation of Azerbaijan's human capital?</h4><p>The development of the country's human resource capacity is always the focus of the government's attention. Within the framework of the Ministry of Education, SOFAZ has invested $44 million in the state's program for the education of Azerbaijani youth abroad from the year 2007 to 2015. The implementation of this program will significantly improve the education and professional skills of the younger generation and create many new opportunities for the development of our human capital. Our financing is a strategic step toward the future realization of President Ilham Aliyev's vision to “transform black gold into human capital." To date, the program has financed the education of 1,028 students.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Azerbaijani economy in 2012 and beyond?</h4><p>According to the Ministry of Economic Development's macroeconomic forecast, the real GDP of the country will be AZN43.5 billion in 2012, increasing by 5.7% compared to 2011. The non-oil sector is also expected to increase to AZN24.9 billion in 2012. The growth of non-oil sector from 2012 to 2015 is expected to be 8.6%, 7.7%, 8.1% and 8.3% respectively. Inflation is forecasted to hover around 6%. Total household income has been showing dynamic growth recently, and is forecasted to reach AZN36.4 billion in 2012, increasing 6.8% compared to 2011.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the highlights for IBA in 2011?</h4><p>In 2011, IBA was ranked 33rd in asset scales among banks in the CIS region. IBA was also included on the list of the 1,000 largest and most sustainable banks in the world, according to The Banker magazine. The World Organization of Creditors also recognized IBA as the winner of the “Investment Angel" World Investment Award. Despite global challenges, IBA successfully carried out a number of projects and transactions, entered into several loan agreements with the largest international banks and investment companies, and established new correspondent relations with 90 financial institutions worldwide. For the first time in the history of Azerbaijan, IBA concluded a gold transaction to raise funds through structured financial instruments.</p><h4>What strategies drive IBA's focus on retail banking?</h4><p>One of our main development strategies is to introduce new banking services. Recently, we offered an extraordinary service called “gold deposit" to our customers. Now, they may place their deposits in gold without physical acquisition of the metal. The client gets a two fold chance to win from both bank interest rates and the growth of gold prices. In general, IBA's customers are offered over 150 different banking products and services. IBA is constantly making efforts to introduce the latest banking technology in Azerbaijan and provide modern financial services to the citizens of the country.</p><h4>What are IBA's plans to further its international cooperation and presence?</h4><p>It is no secret that IBA is the only national credit institution gradually expanding its presence in the global financial space. Our subsidiary bank in Moscow celebrated its 10th anniversary recently, entering into the top 150 largest Russian banks and actively promoting economic relations between Azerbaijan and Russia. IBA's branches in St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg have progressed on a path of sustainable growth, which indicates the effectiveness of our investments in these regions. The same can be said about our Georgian branch, which is actively involved in the rendering of services for a number of major regional and international projects. Our representative offices in London, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, New York, and Dubai adequately represent IBA's interests in the largest financial centers around the world. In 2010, we developed a strategy to enter emerging markets, prioritizing the integration of the banking sector in the CIS. The focus of our international strategy is also aimed at markets in the Middle East (Qatar), Western Europe (Luxembourg and Switzerland), and the US, a program that was established after monitoring trade and political relations with these countries and carrying out a comprehensive study of the dynamics of their banking markets, including the presence of members of the diaspora.</p><h4>What strategies is IBA implementing to increase the penetration and usage of credit cards among its customers?</h4><p>We attach special importance to the business of banking cards, and this is one of the main future directions of our integrated strategy. IBA became the second bank in the region to start distributing the most innovative cards. These cards boast a dual-contact and non-contact interface and dynamic data authentication (DDA). IBA also carries out projects related to salary, pension, and social cards, which are services being used by hundreds of thousands of people. The number of card customers is constantly increasing. To date, IBA's card activity represents 40.7% of the entire card market in the country, 32% of all the ATMs operating in the country, and 32.4% of the country's total POS terminals.</p><h4>What is the significance of electronic banking within IBA's strategy?</h4><p>Over the past few years, we have introduced a number of new technological solutions. In 2008, we successfully introduced Flexcube, an innovative automated banking system developed by Oracle. The transition to this software allowed IBA to expand its banking product portfolio and minimize operational risks, improving the quality and speed of services simultaneously for customers who may perform various transactions even while sitting in the office. Today we offer internet banking, mobile banking, e-commerce, and other high-tech products that have become very popular among our customers. IBA has the largest customer base in the country and our priority is to improve the quality of customer services. To do this, we are introducing the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, which will enable us to create a flexible service system that provides banking services tailored to each customer.</p><h4>How would you assess Azerbaijan's potential to become a regional hub for Islamic banking within the CIS area?</h4><p>IBA was chosen to promote Islamic financing in the CIS region, owing to the fact that the bank is already active in the implementation of Islamic products and services. For the first time in Azerbaijan's history, we are planning to establish a new office in the field, enabling the country to become a regional center for Islamic financing. This decision was made bearing in mind the favorable geopolitical situation of the country and the availability of the markets in neighboring countries, such as Russia and Kazakhstan. There are also many opportunities to enter other markets. IBA has expressed its desire to host the Annual Caspian Forum on Islamic Banking. Thus, Baku may also become a center for the development of new tools to attract Islamic financing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-state-of-peace]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) is the largest regional security organization in the world, uniting 56 participating states across North America, Europe, and Central Asia. The focus of the organization, which was founded in 1975, includes working on conflicts that still exist in the OSCE region, including those in the South Caucasus.<br></p><p>As the Chairmanship of the OSCE in 2012, Ireland is going to work hard to achieve progress toward the peaceful resolution of regional issues, including the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.</p><p>When outlining the priorities of the Irish Chairmanship in his address to the OSCE Permanent Council this January, the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, Irish Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore, said, “We in Ireland know all too well the devastating cost of conflict. Through negotiation, compromise, and the dedication and imagination of the two governments and leaders on both sides of the divide, a lasting settlement was achieved in relation to Northern Ireland."</p><p>As his Special Representative for the South Caucasus, I will seek to facilitate engagement by all the parties in drafting a lasting settlement of the conflicts in the region, building on Ireland's own experience, while being aware that no two conflicts are the same. In April 2012, the Irish OSCE Chairmanship will host a conference in Dublin on Northern Ireland as a case study, aiming to draw on themes which may be applicable to conflict situations in the OSCE area. While each conflict situation is different, we hope that by providing information about our experience, the parties involved in other conflicts may find useful insights into how resolutions might be accomplished.</p><p>For it is only with the political goodwill of both sides, aided by the cumulative effort of the international community, that tangible progress can be achieved. The OSCE Minsk Group, which is co-chaired by Russia, the US, and France, and includes Belarus, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Turkey, and the OSCE Troika—Lithuania, Ireland and Ukraine in 2012—as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan, is the only established framework for facilitating a political solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. We support the efforts of the Minsk Group co-chairs aimed at encouraging the sides to reach the level of agreement on the basic principles of the conflict settlement which will pave the way for the drafting of an official peace agreement.</p><p>Having this long-term goal in mind, we must seek to ensure that no further escalation of tensions on the ground takes place. The increasing number of deadly incidents on the line of contact raises serious concerns and calls for urgent measures to effectively strengthen the ceasefire regime, as previously pledged by the two sides. Withdrawing snipers from the line of contact and refraining from the use of threats or force, as well as continuing OSCE monitoring activities, will boost confidence and help ensure security and stability on both sides of the divide.</p><p>Another essential step in this direction is to implement the agreement reached by Presidents Aliyev, Sargsyan, and Medvedev last year in Sochi to set up a mechanism to investigate incidents along the line of contact. We believe that the work on the proposals for modalities of such a mechanism drafted by the Minsk Group's co-chairs and the personal representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, which has been with the sides for some time, provides the basis for the achievement of concrete results this year.</p><p>We are aware of the internal political processes in both countries and that the focus of public attention will affect the upcoming 2013 presidential elections in Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as parliamentary elections in Armenia in May 2012. Every candidate should refrain from using the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict as a campaigning issue so that it does not undermine the effectiveness of international efforts aimed at conflict resolution and building trust between the sides. This process will be further complicated by the elections in all of the Minsk Group co-chairing countries. We must not let the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict slip in the agenda of the international community.</p><p>Confidence building is not only about the military; to a large degree it is also about promoting people-to-people contact. I welcome the statement by the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan on January 23, 2012 regarding the development of humanitarian contact across the divide, and the readiness to facilitate continued efforts to develop dialogue between their countries' intelligentsia, and academic and public circles. The Irish Chairmanship is ready, in cooperation with the OSCE as a whole, to support these efforts.Track two diplomacy is another sphere that needs to be strengthened in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict resolution process. While high-level negotiations continue, it is crucial to assure them of broad public support and this is where grass-roots activities pertaining to conflict resolution can make a great contribution.</p><p>In the OSCE's engagement with the South Caucasus, building trust and bridging differences at the international level go hand in hand with promoting confidence between people and the authorities within the countries of the region. The OSCE Office in Baku and the OSCE Office in Yerevan have been working there since 2000. Their tasks currently do not include matters related to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict settlement. Through the OSCE's field operations in the South Caucasus, they promote the implementation of their commitments, to improve the conditions in its very large area of operation.</p><p>It has been rightly said that one makes peace with one's enemies. In other words, the negotiations that give rise to resolution take place between the parties involved. The effort of the OSCE as an organization is to encourage, promote, and facilitate this negotiation. We hope that we will make progress towards this goal in 2012.</p><p>Written in January, 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[On the Growth Track]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[on-the-growth-track]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerbaijan's GDP per capita is steadily growing, reaching over AZN4,700 in 2011. What does this growth signal about Azerbaijan's overall economic development?</h4><p>Over the years, Azerbaijan has achieved a high level of stability and sustainable development, establishing a successful socio-economic model. The country is also working toward preserving stability in the non-oil sectors and ensuring economic growth in the regions, which offer great potential to various segments of the economy. The regions have also been instrumental in the development of SMEs, infrastructure, poverty reduction, and human capital. It is no coincidence that Azerbaijan remained resilient during the global economic crisis. Azerbaijan's rapid GDP growth between 2004 and 2011 can be attributed to efforts aimed at diversifying the economy, as industrial production has increased by 2.7%, agriculture by 1.3%, construction by 3.2%, transport by 2.3%, ICT by 6.4%, and trade by 2.6%. Successful industrialization, institutional, and investment environment policies have been implemented, and we have seen an expansion in production capacities and infrastructure. In this regard, it is important now to support the development of Azerbaijani enterprises in order to attract more FDI. One of the most important features of the national socio-economic development model is the development of the private sector through the implementation of state programs to encourage entrepreneurship, as well as the creation of an entrepreneurial infrastructure. As a result of the dynamic development of the private sector today, more than 80% of GDP production is provided by the private sector, and both domestic and foreign investment have increased by 4.6% and 2.1%, respectively, since 2003. Azerbaijan has achieved an expansion in the volume of its foreign trade, and fostered economic relations worldwide. At present, Azerbaijan is trading with more than 150 countries, having increased foreign trade turnover by 6.4% in the last eight years. During the same period, the average income has also increased  by 5.3% and more than 1 million jobs have been created.</p><h4>How has FDI influenced the development of Azerbaijan's national economy? What strategies is the Ministry following to further attract FDI in the coming years?</h4><p>Between 2003 and 2011 Azerbaijan received $100 billion in investment, and half of it was FDI. We have seen the active participation of foreign investors in different sectors of the economy, especially in the non-oil sectors. Azerbaijan currently offers a very favorable business environment for foreign investors. It boasts a favorable legal system, mechanisms to protect the rights and interests of investors, and respects the inviolability of property. We are constantly working on improving the legal framework to attract more investment in the future. In addition, we have developed agreements with many countries to promote and protect mutual investments. We have also worked to resolve double taxation issues. Azerbaijan offers many advantages for foreign investors such as a competitive private sector, ease of starting a business, and a simplified business environment. The World Bank and other international institutions have positively recognized such trends, and Azerbaijan has been recognized as the most competitive economy in the CIS in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index 2011-2012. Azerbaijan has been growing sustainably over the last 15 years, and large amounts of investment have flowed into the country. The many major regional and international infrastructure projects that have been developed also speak volumes for the favorable investment conditions in our country.</p><h4>How would you assess Azerbaijan's role as a regional economic, energy, and transport hub?</h4><p>Since the “Contract of the Century" was signed in 1994, Azerbaijan has achieved a leading position in the energy sector through the development of large-scale agreements and projects. It has become a key player in providing energy security and creating the basis for international cooperation in the Caspian Sea region. Oil strategy policies have also been the locomotive for the development of other sectors of the economy. Thanks to prudent national policy, Azerbaijan has developed into a transit point for oil and gas, sitting in the middle of international transport corridors such as the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA) and the North-South Corridor. We have also been working toward developing the road, rail, and air networks, strengthening the transport system, and making efficient use of the country's resources. At present, we are working on the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway and the Baku International Sea Trade Port, as well as other transport links. In this regard, I would like to stress the importance of the synergies we constantly create with other ministries in order to develop Azerbaijan's international potential.</p><h4>What economic challenges does Azerbaijan face in terms of stimulating further economic growth?</h4><p>In order to ensure macroeconomic stability, economic diversification, business development, and a favorable business environment, we need to keep implementing measures to improve the economic fundamentals of the non-oil sector and national infrastructure. Our priorities for the future will be energy, food, and environmental safety, while minimizing dependence on the oil and gas sector and maximizing the diversification of the economy. We also aim to further develop the agriculture sector, with special attention on intensive methods. In addition, we will be focusing on further improving the business environment, creating special economic and industrial zones, and strengthening our support for business entrepreneurship. Once Azerbaijan completed its transition to a market economy, it entered a new stage of development, and the main objective now is to increase production capacities and competitiveness, as well as develop an export- and innovation-oriented economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Azerbaijan's legal trade and investment framework evolved to support economic growth?</h4><p>The government has successfully opened up the economy to international business and introduced investment-friendly laws and regulations. There have been many important legal developments in Azerbaijan since its independence, including the enactment of modern civil, labor, tax, and customs codes. The authorities have also worked toward streamlining activities for the granting of licenses and permits, and established central property and mortgage registries. Furthermore, international financial reporting standards (IFRS) have been adopted, and a single-window system for company registration, work-permit formalities, and customs procedures has been introduced. The legislation enacted has established a very open environment for FDI. The government has lifted limitations on foreign participation in the banking sector, and the privatization process is open to foreign investors as well. Incentives have been granted to the trading system, and recent amendments in legislation have focused on simplifying the regulations governing imports and exports.</p><h4>How would you assess the evolution of Azerbaijan's export-import profile?</h4><p>During the first 11 months of 2011, the trade turnover in Azerbaijan increased by 9.2%  and amounted to $33.2 billion, compared to $28 billion in 2010. Azerbaijan exports far more than it imports, and it recorded a trade surplus of $16.1 billion for the year. Local exports exceed imports by 2.9 times, and the main destinations for Azerbaijani products are mostly European countries. Major exports include oil and gas, petrochemicals, metals, and agricultural products, though Azerbaijan is working to diversify its export profile. The priority is to expand the country's offering in terms of agriculture, industrial products, and services. Azerbaijan already exports to several EU countries, the US, and the Middle East. The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) continues to be the largest market for Azerbaijani products, while Russia, Turkey, China, Germany, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, the UK, and the US are among Azerbaijan's main import partners. In 2011 Azerbaijan traded with about 150 countries. The country ended the year with a positive trade balance. The government supported this with a policy aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship by providing loans and a number of tax incentives. Companies with a turnover of less than $191,000 annually pay only 4% tax in Baku, and just 2% in areas outside of  the capital.</p><h4>What are your views on the key trade partnership between Italy and Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Italy has been the main importer of Azerbaijani oil and petroleum products since 2003, and it is the gateway to Europe for Azerbaijani crude. The volume of exported products through Italy makes up about 51.9% of total exports. At the same time, we import pipes, tobacco, leather goods, and furniture from Italy. AZPROMO's main aim is to diversify the portfolio and trade relations with Italy. There is huge potential in many sectors, such as agriculture, ICT, and tourism. We are cooperating with the Italian counterparts to organize business meetings, forums, and other joint promotional activities.</p><h4>What factors are driving investment and growth in the non-oil sector? What sectors offer the best potential to attract FDI?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a country with a wide range of investment opportunities, and is undoubtedly one of the most attractive destinations for FDI in the region. Over the past 16 years almost $120 billion has been invested in the Azerbaijani economy, more than half of which was invested by foreign businesses. The year 2011 attracted a record-breaking $20 billion in investments. Domestic investments totaled $13 billion, while $7 billion came from abroad. The non-oil sector of the economy received the largest portion of these investment flows. For foreign investors, the agriculture and food-processing sector possesses great potential for development, with a wide range of investment incentives and strong  profitability.</p><h4>What role will new transport infrastructure, such as the expansion of Baku's seaport and airport, play in attracting more FDI and strengthening the economy?</h4><p>The development of infrastructure is a key strategy to attract investment. The government has paid special attention to the development of this area since Azerbaijan became independent in 1991. Many large infrastructure projects are currently underway. One such project is the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad, which is also called the “Iron Silk Road." After completing this project in 2012, Azerbaijan will become a logistics hub as it restores ancient trade routes connecting Asia to Europe. The Baku International Sea Port will be the largest in the Caspian Sea. It will be capable of transporting 21 million tons of goods per year, or 150,000 TEUs. These are only a few examples of efforts aimed at increasing the capacity for moving people and goods to and from Azerbaijan, and eventually making the country a key logistics hub for the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the overall strengths and challenges of Azerbaijan's banking system?</h4><p>In general, the Azerbaijani financial sector is steadily growing despite the global financial crisis, and we observe optimistic inflation indices in the country. Azerbaijan's economy is constantly developing based on this economic trend, the foundation of which was established by the national leader Heydar Aliyev and is successfully continued nowadays by President Ilham Aliyev. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR) tightly controlled money flows during the crisis and made strong efforts to maintain a stable currency, which significantly decreased the negative impact of the global crisis on Azerbaijan's financial sector, ensuring stable growth over the last five years. The nationwide credit portfolio during the first 11 months of 2011 increased by 7.5%, bank assets by 10.78%, and client deposits by 26.4%. This economic policy has resulted in a tripling of GDP and kept inflation in the single digits. The country has attracted a significant amount of investment, and a serious improvement has been made in business compatibility legislation. The banking sector is developing well and has extremely positive future growth indices.</p><h4>How will recent changes in insurance laws and the increase of compulsory lines impact Ata Insurance and the sector as a whole?</h4><p>I am sure that changes in the insurance law and market will definitely lead to qualitative and quantitative changes. AtaSigorta, or “Ata Insurance," is actively participating in the Compulsory Insurance Bureau, established in 2011 after changes in the insurance law. This empowers AtaSigorta to provide compulsory insurance in the areas of real estate and automobiles. As the culture of insurance practice is new for the Azerbaijani market, the population will need time to adapt to it. Our main goal is to become a leading company in the insurance market, while being a quality and reliable partner for our customers, working within the agreed timeframe. This, along with correct advertisement campaigns, means I am sure we will be guaranteed profitable results in the future. The insurance market is gradually improving, and it grew by 36% in 2011 alone, up from AZN156 million to AZN213 million.</p><h4>You have made several investments in the hospitality industry, starting with the iconic Excelsior Hotel Baku. How would you assess demand for five-star rooms in Baku, and what does this signal about the broader economy?</h4><p>Excelsior Hotel Baku is one of the most attractive and well-organized hotels in Azerbaijan's capital city. It has gained popularity among guests, who leave our country broadly satisfied and wanting to come back to Baku. The increasing need for high-quality hotels in Azerbaijan, and the growth of foreign investment in the country, makes us very optimistic for the future potential of the tourism sector. We are proud that Excelsior Hotel Baku is the first five-star in Baku, positively contributing to the improvement of the business environment in the country. Our country is becoming an attractive tourist destination, hosting a number of international sporting competitions, conferences, and seminars, as well as the increasing arrival of foreign companies.</p><h4>What motivated your recent creation of AtaTravel, and what are your plans for the new company?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's economy grows with each year, and tourism is developing accordingly for the government pays special attention to this sector. AtaTravel aims to serve foreign visitors, emphasizing client satisfaction and a versatile services offering. AtaTravel offers a wide range of service packages to meet a customer's tourism and travel expectations, covering attractive sightseeing, and highlighting historical monuments and sites in Azerbaijan. We also envisage the development of the internal tourism market as well. We are currently holding negotiations with leading European tour operators in the light of our future cooperation. In this regard, we recently signed a cooperation agreement with the Legrand tourist company in Greece, which enables us to obtain attractive prices from Greek hotels and resorts.</p><h4>What impact do you expect the Eurovision Song Contest will have on the tourism sector and the country as a whole?</h4><p>It was a superb result for the nation and the result of much effort to promote Azerbaijani culture and music at conferences and events taking place in various European countries. Azerbaijan will attract the attention of not only European countries taking part in this event, but also countries outside of Europe, such as in Australia, which also holds the rights to broadcast the event. We anticipate a large inflow of tourists during the contest, significantly contributing to the development of the tourism sector.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Azerbaijani economy, and what does this signal for the future of AtaHolding's growth and development?</h4><p>Large-scale investments are being made into the country's economy by both the government and the private sector. Investments in the non-oil sectors are prevailing over those of the oil sector. In 2011, the size of investment in Azerbaijan reached $20 billion. A well thought out economic strategy and market reforms will guarantee many years of sustainable development for Azerbaijan's economy. There is major potential in all spheres of the economy, with the creation of huge industrial techno parks and the vast gas fields that have been discovered. As well, Azerbaijan is getting ready to become a major gas exporting country in the coming years. Further infrastructure upgrades are ongoing, and we are seeing some mega-projects being implemented. I also believe that in the future we will see significant growth in industry, especially in the metallurgical sector. Finally, the AtaHolding group of companies will continue to do our best for the future development of Azerbaijan. The main target defined by President Ilham Aliyev is to double GDP by 2020.  Led by our corporate logo “Synergy for Azerbaijan…" we are firm in our efforts to invest in different spheres of the economy to support economic development, bring modern services and expertise to local markets, as well as successfully represent our country in the international marketplace.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-azerbaijan-connection]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As one of the first investment companies to come to Turkey from the GCC countries, what have been your most successful investments?<br></h4><p>This is Turkapital's fourth year—we started operations in 2008. Given the circumstances and the environment globally, ours has been a success story. We're seeing that many of our peers, investment houses and companies operating in the same market, have lost their capital. In our case our capital has been preserved and we're growing. Over the last four years of operations we have acquired an auto fleet and leasing company, Autoland. It began in 2012 with 3,500 cars, but when we bought it in 2008, it had only 150 cars. We acquired it with a very small investment, around $1 million. We injected the capital and then grew the company. Our plans for 2012 and beyond are to grow and reach 5,000 more cars.</p><h4>What about your other fields of operations?</h4><p>We have established an insurance company called Neova. This is a huge challenge, but I think it will be one of the best performers under Turkapital. The company's first year of operation was 2010, and we closed the year 2010 with about TL60 million in revenues and premiums. For 2011, we closed with about TL90 million in revenues.</p><h4>What's behind this success?</h4><p>We have an edge and it's helping, which is that we use Küveyt Türk's branches as our sales points, but we're also accessing the other participation banks and their branches. We have signed with Al Baraka Türk, which means 150 branches, and Türkiye Finans has another 120 branches, and so on. We have almost 400 branches that Neova uses as its sales points. In addition, there are around 300-400 agents nationwide. It is this network that has yielded such incredible results.</p><h4>What expectations do you have for Iskan?</h4><p>İskan is another outstanding performer under Turkapital. Currently, a capital redemption is being undertaken, as we put forward 60% of the capital to buy real estate, which has now been sold. As a result, İskan is becoming a smaller real estate company that will be more focused on developing projects, and even investing in real estate projects. Its team is small, but they are well educated and have real experience in the real estate sector, with great knowledge of laws and local regulations. We have big plans for İskan in 2012. Another company we have established in Turkey is Depolar, a real estate company involved in warehouses. Its name has now changed to Kavea because we are preparing to hopefully list it on the stock exchange.</p><h4>In which other countries does Turkapital have significant investment?</h4><p>We use Turkey as our base, but we have been looking at Central Asia and we have acquired a shopping mall in Azerbaijan, which is performing very well. We have an office in Baku and we are looking at more assets to book and to expand. We also have an office in Tatarstan. Russia is a little bit challenging—we have been there for about three years and we haven't booked any assets. Luckily the office is small, so we don't incur many costs and we hope to see something happening in Russia and Tatarstan, especially over the next six months to a year. There is good potential, and Tatarstan will also host the 2013 World Student Games, which opens a lot of potential for development. We hadn't looked at Eastern Europe in our first four years, so we did a fact-finding trip to Bosnia and Croatia, and there are some good opportunities there. We are now studying up, but we haven't committed or decided what to do yet. However, there are some good opportunities coming up, hopefully.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in Azerbaijan in addition to the shopping mall?</h4><p>Central Asia in general is not an easy market—it's tough. Private equity is something I would like to go into but I think it's not easy. The easier asset class perhaps is real estate. In that regard, we will probably go for other real estate projects. I think this will help us set foot in these countries and get on the learning curve and then perhaps make more deals in private equity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Since the onset of the century, Azerbaijan has emerged as one of the world's most dynamic economies. Its economy has expanded on average by 15 percentage points per annum in the last decade, and throughout the global crisis it has shown extraordinary resilience. Macroeconomic and financial stability was maintained while large capital inflows from the sale of natural resources were prudently used to diversify the sources of economic activity. Today, the country's economy is being primarily driven by industry, agriculture, trade, transport, and telecommunications, among other sectors.<br></p><p>There has been substantial progress as it relates to infrastructure modernization and development, which until recently was a legacy of the Soviet Union. Existing roads have been renovated to meet contemporary demands and new roads are being built as a part of the plan to transform Azerbaijan into an East-West and North-South transportation corridor. Within the last two years, 10 new power-generation stations have been created, transforming Azerbaijan from an energy importing country to a reliable energy exporter.</p><p>Similar breakthroughs have been achieved while developing the country's business environment. In the past decade, reforms in all areas covered by the World Bank's Doing Business metrics were implemented. Particularly during the years 2008-09, with business-friendly reforms in seven out of 10 regulatory reform areas—including the creation of a state-of-the-art online tax payment system and the introduction of a one-stop-shop for business registration—Azerbaijan was named “top reformer" according to the Doing Business report. This stride was also captured by the Global Competitiveness Report, which in its latest 2011/12 publication ranked Azerbaijan as the most competitive economy in the CIS region. In addition, the country has made remarkable progress in elevating the living standards of its citizens. Most social indicators have revealed this exceptional leap as the country developed into the upper middle-income category. The poverty level has decreased from close to 50% at the onset of the century to barely 8% in 2011. Similarly, the level of inequality, as noted in the latest IMF Article IV report, has declined rapidly from 42% to 34%, reflecting the increasingly equitable distribution of economic benefits throughout the population.</p><p>At the early stages of the oil boom, the authorities outlined an effective and long-term resource management strategy that enabled the country to accumulate large reserve buffers. Established in 1999, the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ), which is where the proceeds from sales of natural resources are accumulated, has played an important role in the country's natural resource revenue management strategy. It serves as a buffer against oil price fluctuations as well as ensures intergenerational equality of benefits with regard to the country's oil wealth, whilst improving the economic wellbeing of the population today and safeguarding economic security for future generations. Since its inception, SOFAZ has received around $60 billion in oil and gas revenues and has been able to save close to half of this figure. As of end-2011, SOFAZ's balance stood at $29.8 billion, which roughly equals 53% of the country's 2011 GDP. In contrast, public foreign debt is a mere $4.5 billion, which amounts to around 8%  of GDP.</p><p>The overall financial sector and banking sector in particular has grown rapidly, although from a shallow base. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan continues to keenly monitor the banking sector's activities in the wake of global financial market instabilities, and most macro-prudential regulations are periodically updated and strictly enforced. Overall, the banking sector is well capitalized, and the latest tests have demonstrated that it is strong enough to withstand severe and protracted shocks.</p><p>This phenomenal performance has been acknowledged by many international financial institutions. For the first time in its history, Azerbaijan was upgraded to an investment grade rating by two leading international rating agencies, Fitch Ratings in 2010 and Standard &amp; Poor's in 2011.</p><p>Azerbaijan continues to collaborate intensely with international development organizations in framing strategies for future development challenges. The current Country Partnership Strategy with the World Bank, covering the period of 2011-14, for instance, envisages a lending envelope of about $1 billion, which will be complemented by a strong and enriched program of knowledge services. The plan is for the World Bank to increase its analytical work in the areas of job creation and growth, the financial sector, and agriculture and irrigation, among others. This is a clear indication of the government's agenda to elevate the level of intellectual capacity going forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the Central Bank of Azerbaijan Republic (CBAR) targeting for monetary and financial policy in 2012?<br></h4><p>In 2012, CBAR's monetary and exchange rate policy shall be directed toward preserving macroeconomic stability, with the main priority being the maintenance of the banking system's sustainability based upon the formation of a counter-cyclical policy framework. Monetary policy will be aimed at finding a possible optimum between inflation and economic growth, and the value of money and rate of return in the economy. The main imperatives of financial stability are the maintenance of a sustainable and stable banking sector, and its balanced and sound development. In 2012 anti-inflationary policy will remain an important task. The main target for monetary policy shall be single-digit inflation (7%-8%). As in the previous year, external factors shall also have a significant effect on inflation. In order to achieve the inflation target, CBAR will use the money supply and the exchange rate as intermediate targets. The exchange rate of the manat will preserve its significance in the maintenance of macroeconomic stability, management of financial stability, as well as in preserving the international competitiveness of the non-oil sector. The exchange rate regime shall keep improving. CBAR will also adequately employ monetary policy tools to ensure a possible effect of money supply on economic growth. The parameters of the interest rate corridor, including the refinancing rate, reserve requirements, and the volume of CBAR bonds, will be adequately regulated depending on the level of inflation, the economic cycle, and the situation in the financial markets. In 2012, CBAR's financial stability policy will be directed at enhancing the financial soundness of banks and the preventive regulation of risks. To that end, prudential supervision shall be adjusted to post-crisis requirements and the latest global challenges. To further resist risks, banks will be encouraged to adequately respond to the existing macroeconomic stance and increase financial provisioning through supervisory mechanisms. Restructuring and consolidation, and the promotion of competition in the sector will be some of our key priorities.</p><h4>What were some of the most important achievements in 2011?</h4><p>Azerbaijan celebrated the 20th year of its independence in 2011 and demonstrated to the entire world how dynamically and sustainably it has stepped into a new decade. Azerbaijan has confidently joined the group of middle-income countries. The Azerbaijani economy remained resilient against external shocks in the global economic environment. The country's economy kept growing and macroeconomic stability was preserved. Whereas the credit rating of most countries was downgraded, the credit rating of Azerbaijan was upgraded. The surplus in the balance of payments in the previous year reached $40 billion. Strategic foreign exchange reserves surpassed $40 billion and totaled 65% of GDP. The paramount source of employment—the non-oil sector—grew at a high rate of 9.4%. Investments in the economy also grew by 27%. Per capita GDP exceeded $7,000. The poverty level continued reducing, dropped to 7.6%. Incomes in the population grew by 11% in real terms. To preserve and further amplify economic achievements the policy of diversification is continuing. In that regard, non-oil exports increased by 19% in 2011.</p><h4>CBAR has not excluded the possibility of applying new liquidity regulations in 2012. What would be the aim of such a move?</h4><p>Lessons from the global crisis and new post-crisis challenges have encouraged international efforts and new initiatives to manage financial stability. These processes are also accompanied by the formation of new regulations in the financial system in concert with the challenges of today. CBAR actively tracks international discussions associated with new frameworks in financial stability management. In order to develop new mechanisms that ensure financial stability, CBAR is guided by new standards emerging on the global stage. In general, a radical modernization of banking system regulation and the supervisory framework, built upon the latest best practices and standards, has become one of our top priorities. Within this framework, the application of a new liquidity norm proposed by Basel III standards to manage short-term liquidity in banks in a more advanced manner is on the agenda. Relevant research is underway to look at such a possibility. The aim is to adjust the prudential supervision framework to Basel III standards and attain the key targets of financial stability. Previously, CBAR applied a new leverage ratio, taking into account Basel III standards, which yielded positive results. All these measures are targeted at maintaining stable and sustainable performance in the banking system and preserving confidence among the population and investors.</p><h4>CBAR's forex reserves grew by 63.6% in 2011, reaching almost $10.5 billion. What is the institution forecasting for 2012?</h4><p>Amid the surplus in the balance of payments forecasted due to high oil prices this year, the strategic foreign exchange reserves in the country as well as the reserves of CBAR will continue rising. According to CBAR estimates, the surplus in the current operations account of the balance of payments is expected to amount to 20%-25% percent of GDP in 2012. With no significant changes in the foreign conjuncture, in 2012 the growth rate of CBAR's forex reserves is expected to stay at the same level as 2011.</p><h4>Local bank assets reached a historical AZN14.3 billion, increasing by 7.3% on a yearly basis. How significant are such figures?</h4><p>Indeed, the banking system continued growing. The assets of the banking system increased by 7.3% in 2011, and reached AZN14.3 billion, including 8.1% growth in bank loans that amounted to AZN9.7 billion. These figures are significant from the standpoint of amplifying financial intermediation, and increasing the access of economic agents to financial services. The regional network of the financial system in the country is expanding. In 2011, 13 banks launched 26 branches. CBAR licensed nine new non-bank credit institutions (NBCIs), as well as 19 new credit unions in 2011. Thus, the country possesses a financial system that has a wide network and provides financial services that underpin the policy of diversification.</p><h4>By November 2011, the volume of deposits and savings in credit institutions increased by 24% as compared to a year ago. What does that signal?</h4><p>The scale of savings and deposits of legal entities and individuals in the banking system increased by 24% in 2011 and reached AZN9.4 billion, including a 36% growth in deposits, which approximates AZN4.1 billion. This signals, on the one hand, high activity in the banking system, and high confidence in the banking system on the other. Manat deposits increased by over 61%, which indicates a reduction in the economy's dollarization level. To note, the Deposits Insurance Fund, launched in 2007, greatly contributed to this high level of confidence.</p><h4>It was reported that CBAR might introduce changes to mortgage lending regulations. What are your views on the mortgage market?</h4><p>The mortgage system is the key macroeconomic contributor to economic growth and employment. To that end, we are focused on the expansion of access to mortgage lending. CBAR has drafted a specific state program for the development of mortgage lending in the country. This versatile program shall focus on several areas. In order to ensure wider access to mortgage lending, it is one of our key priorities to launch a guarantee mechanism to optimize the down payment requirement. One of the key priorities on our agenda is also to expand the scope of people with the right to obtain social mortgages to ease access for the broader stratum of the population, particularly for the youth and young families. We are considering the potential to apply new mortgage products in harmony with the needs of the population, particularly to issue loans for the construction and repair of residential buildings in the regions. We should stimulate the purchase of new houses in residential areas through mortgage lending and broadly apply a mechanism of advanced registration of the rights to property. We are also considering risks with respect to mortgage lending, which should not be disregarded. Over previous periods the Azerbaijani mortgage market remained stable. We shall continue this policy.</p><h4>CBAR has made increasing efforts to bring the local credit card market to international standards. What are your priorities in this field?</h4><p>There are 4.6 million credit cards in circulation. This market has huge potential in Azerbaijan. CBAR permanently strives to expand cashless payment opportunities, particularly card circulation in the country. We are implementing initiatives in the field with public institutions. These initiatives primarily target the enhancement of the legal and institutional base. The network of POS terminals is also being expanded. The number of POS terminals increased by 68% in 2011. A reduction of tariffs for cashless payments in the banking system is also being stimulated. We are planning large-scale public awareness campaigns on the advantages of plastic cards.</p><h4>How do you see the Baku Stock Exchange (BSE) evolving over the next few years?</h4><p>CBAR prioritizes the development of financial as well as forex market infrastructure. Relevant measures led to the integration of interbank forex operations to a Bloomberg-based unified e-trade platform in 2011. The transition of operations to a new trade system enabled the system's players to follow the dynamics of USD/AZN exchange rates online, and scope indices on trade transactions and the average weighted exchange rate and supply and demand for forex. A total of 24 banks announce exchange rates on USD/AZN on a daily basis and conduct transactions, which has significantly increased transparency in the forex market. CBAR shall continue activities to develop financial markets and boost transparency.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for Azerbaijan in 2012 and beyond?</h4><p>Prospects in the Azerbaijani economy are very favorable. The country has successfully transformed its oil wealth into social and human capital development and modernization of its socio-economic infrastructure. This process shall continue in the upcoming years. Sustainable and inclusive growth is the paramount challenge of the new era. President Ilham Aliyev has identified a strategic target for the upcoming decade on economic growth. The main goal of the new decade is to further grow the economy. We are exclusively oriented toward strategic targets and finding a new growth model. This is a catch-up growth model aimed at diversifying the economy. However, this model is to be primarily realized on the basis of the rapid development of human capital and market institutions.  An export-oriented liberal economy is a strategic priority. We have the capability to increase per capita non-oil exports by at least 10 times in the upcoming decade. Private investment and SMEs will be the key drivers of the new growth model.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has 2011 been for Kapital Bank?</h4><p>It was a successful fiscal year for Kapital Bank, and by the end of 2011 the bank's assets reached AZN1.32 billion. The bank's charter capital also increased by 33% to AZN40 million in 2011. Kapital Bank has already succeeded in creating a positive image in the international arena, where it has been trying to expand its profile. The Black Sea Trade and Development Bank (BSTDB) has opened a credit line to the bank for a mortgage program. Now the bank offers free credit resources to foreign companies on short-term conditions. Kapital Bank is a member of the SWIFT international settlements system, Reuters international information and dealing system, and the World Savings Banks Institute.</p><h4>What are your views on the Central Bank of Azerbaijan's (CBAR's) increasing efforts to bring the payment card market to international standards and make it safer?</h4><p>The tradition of non-cash payment are being formed and developed in Azerbaijan. CBAR is continuing efforts toward stimulating cashless payments and bringing the country's payment card market to international standards, and is supporting the country's banks on this front. As a result of the work done, there are four processing centers in the country, including the “KapitalKart" processing center of Kapital Bank. This processing system allows us to provide card payment processing services, support card accounts, ensure the operation of ATMs, POS terminals and other payment terminals, prepare reports for banks and international card organizations, and organize the exchange of information between international card organizations and banks. Kapital Bank is the leading bank in Azerbaijan by number of active plastic cards, which now exceed 2 million. The bank currently has 421 ATMs across the country, and 466 POS terminals.</p><h4>What regulatory reforms do you believe need to be made to improve the operating environment in the banking sector?</h4><p>The next phase of banking system reform in Azerbaijan started with the new policy focuses formed in 2000, and these continue until today. In parallel with the huge flow of oil revenues into the country, and as a logical result of a successful oil strategy, purposeful measures are being taken to make the financial resources of the banks prepared to manage this flow. The efficient and safe transformation of oil revenues to the non-oil sector is ensured, and the banking system's financial mediating function for poverty reduction is being developed. Access to quality banking in regional areas is improving, and we believe that the protection of macroeconomic stability, financial stability in the banking system, and the substantial modernization of the sector should be key priorities for CBAR. The application and development of corporate governance standards is also of great importance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The defense partnership between the US and Colombia has been strong, remains strong, and will continue to be strong in the future. Both of our nations are committed to deepening our cooperation even further.</p><p>Over these last decades of very close cooperation, Colombia has built one of the world's most advanced military and police forces and has accomplished an historic transition. In the last few years alone, Colombia has moved from a nation under siege from guerillas and drug-trafficking mafias and paramilitary groups to a country that is a force for security and prosperity in South America. That is a tribute; a tribute to the strength, fortitude, and above all sacrifice of the Colombian military and the Colombian people.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia is one of our closest partners in the hemisphere and an emerging regional and global leader."</div><p>In particular, Colombia has made significant progress in its campaign against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). I want to commend Minister Pinzón and the Colombian armed forces for their efforts against this terrorist group. The Colombian people have expended a great deal of precious blood and precious treasure in their campaign against the FARC, and as a result the FARC has been seriously weakened.</p><p>The US stands in solidarity with Colombia in its campaign against the FARC, and we will continue to provide training, equipment, and assistance that Colombia has requested in order to defeat this common enemy. Colombia is planning to receive 17 Black Hawk helicopters between December 2012 and January 2014 to help its efforts against the FARC.</p><p>It's a testament that the progress Colombia has made in resolving its internal security challenges has really helped bring together our relationship and our cooperation on regional security challenges, particularly those emanating from Central America. Our two nations both understand that our security depends on the stability; not just within our borders but beyond our borders. And there is a great deal of potential for our two militaries to work closely to help build the capacity of other nations in this region to address these security challenges.</p><p>To that end, in April 2011, during President Obama's visit to Colombia, he and President Santos signed a new Regional Security Assistance Cooperation Action Plan. Minister Pinzón and I have discussed the next steps that we can take within the framework of this plan to achieve our shared desire of a secure, stable, and prosperous Western Hemisphere. We are working with our State Department colleagues to move forward with this plan.</p><p>One of the specific steps we debated was the establishment of a state partnership program between Colombia and our own National Guard. This program has helped deepen our defense cooperation with other partners in the region, including Chile, Peru, and Uruguay. The South Carolina National Guard will be partnering with the Colombian Ministry of Defense to develop and share knowledge, exchange expertise, and develop an action plan moving forward.</p><p>State partnership programs have helped us share lessons learned and expertise that has been shared for disaster response and other missions where the armed forces can provide critical support to our civil authorities.</p><p>The Colombian armed forces already have tremendous experience and expertise in disaster preparedness and extensive experience dealing with floods and other natural disasters. The establishment of a state partner program represents an opportunity to further enhance our capabilities in this area and represents an important new avenue for defense cooperation.</p><p>Colombia is one of our closest partners in the hemisphere and an emerging regional and global leader. In the new defense strategy that we established in the US, one of the key elements is to develop innovative security partnerships around the world. The kind of partnership that we have here in Colombia is an example of the kind of training exercises assistance that we hope to be able to develop elsewhere as well.</p><p>What Colombia has done is a tribute to the strong partnership we have built—a defense partnership that has endured for more than 60 years and which has helped bring stability and prosperity to both of our great nations.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess BP's progress in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>BP has built excellent relationships with its Azerbaijani partners, based on their confidence in our ability to deliver strategic projects. BP operates several major oil and gas development and transportation projects, including the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oil fields, the Shah Deniz gas field development project, and the world-class Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline. BP is also the technical operator of the South Caucasus Pipeline, which transports gas through Azerbaijan and Georgia. Since BP started operations in Azerbaijan 20 years ago, we have managed: 1.9 billion barrels of total production from ACG; about $35 billion of total investment in the country together with our partners; tens of thousands of local jobs, over 1.3 billion barrels of crude oil carried by BTC to the world market on over 1,800 tankers; a $20 billion investment in the Shah Deniz Phase II project (which will deliver 16 billion cubic meters of additional gas per year); the new Shafag-Asiman exploration project; and about $55 million spent in support of the social and cultural development of local communities. Our results in Azerbaijan are impressive, and I firmly believe we will continue to meet our long-term commitment to support Azerbaijan in becoming a regional leader with a strong, sustainable economy.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Shafag-Asiman exploration drilling project?</h4><p>The Shafag-Asiman project is one of BP's production-sharing agreements (PSAs) in Azerbaijan, which was established in 1998. The Shafag-Asiman project presents an exciting opportunity, and we hope it will enhance our operations in the Caspian Sea. This PSA differs from others, as it is our first project with just one other partner, the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR). We believe that the project will reinforce our relationship and take our partnership to a higher level. This PSA is also a good opportunity to further expand Azerbaijan's natural resource base. We conducted the first 3D seismic survey in Azerbaijan on the contracted area. The geographical survey was finished in January 2012, and we will be processing the data we have collected throughout the year. Caspian Geophysical is undertaking a portion of the data collection. Upon its completion, it will be the largest 3D survey ever processed on site. It may take up to 18 months to interpret the data, and an additional year to plan the first exploration well. We will be working with SOCAR to develop our drilling plans for this challenging and important exploration project.</p><h4>How much investment has gone into making the ACG oil fields successful?</h4><p>The ACG oil fields are some of the largest in the world and the most productive in the Caspian. We have invested about $22 billion in the development of the fields, in collaboration with our partners. The new platform, West Chirag, is planned to increase oil production and recovery from the ACG field. It will be located between the existing Deepwater Guneshli (DWG) and Chirag platforms. We began construction on West Chirag, the sixth platform of the ACG, more than 15 years ago. The first oil from the new platform will be pumped in late 2013.</p><h4>How relevant is the Shah Deniz field within BP's oil and gas portfolio? What can we expect in terms of production from Stage II of the project?</h4><p>The Shah Deniz field is one of the most expansive fields operated by BP worldwide, and Stage II is currently the largest project in BP's international portfolio. The project is designed to bring a diverse selection of gas and energy products to our European markets through the new Southern Gas Corridor. We expect to begin the delivery of Shah Deniz gas in 2017. In terms of production, Phase I supplies 8.6 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas per year, and approximately 50,000 barrels of condensate per day. Phase II will focus on the remaining resource potential in the current reservoir intervals, adding 16 bcm of gas per year and up to 100,000 barrels of condensate per day.</p><h4>What's the importance of the recently signed energy agreements between Turkey and Azerbaijan witnessed by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President Ilham Aliyev?</h4><p>We were delighted to see these agreements signed as they support our efforts to take the giant Shah Deniz full-filed development (FFD) project further. These agreements include gas sales and transit agreements with Turkey, and technical cooperation agreement with BOTAÅž—all within the inter-governmental agreement. They provide the legal framework for the sale of 6 bcm per year of Shah Deniz future gas to Turkey and for the transportation of 10 bcm per year of Shah Deniz FFD and other Azerbaijan-sourced gas to European markets through Turkey. Our current plans are to continue the engineering studies that will enable the project to move into the front-end engineering design phase this year. In parallel we also continue the pipeline selection process with plans to make a decision in the coming months as to which pipeline routes will form the Southern Gas Corridor—a suggested new link between the Caspian and Europe. Gas from Shah Deniz FFD will follow almost the same route as the current South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) through Azerbaijan and Georgia. In Turkey, according to the recently signed agreements between Azerbaijan and Turkey, transportation of Shah Deniz FFD gas to the European markets will either use existing BOTAÅž transmission network or new pipeline infrastructure—the so called Trans-Anatolian-Pipeline (TANAP). These options are currently being evaluated with a decision expected later this year. We are also working to assess the options that will deliver gas from Turkey onward to Europe and no decision has yet been made on the route selection. Significant progress has been made in this evaluation process. Three third-party pipeline projects have been considered: IGI Poseidon and TAP to Italy, and Nabucco toward Central Europe. A fourth project toward Central Europe, SEEP, which has been proposed by members of the Shah Deniz consortium, is also being considered.</p><h4>What projects has BP been involved in to help protect the environment?</h4><p>Protection of the environment is among BP's first priorities along with our commitment to safety of people and our operations. In Azerbaijan, as part of our operations we regularly conduct various environmental studies including baseline and environmental impact assessment studies. We also conduct environmental monitoring programs covering offshore, near shore, and onshore areas of our activity such as around platforms, along pipelines, and at terminals. We use the best available technology in our operations that allows us to reduce and mitigate impact on the environment. Together with relevant governmental bodies we develop and test oil spill response plans using the best international practice and standards. In addition, together with our partners we have supported a number of major environmental investment initiatives such as “Green Pack and Training of Teachers on Green Pack Methodology" to raise schoolchildren's awareness of the importance of protection of the environment, and the “Energy Bus" project, which promotes development of alternative energy sources. We hope the effect of these initiatives will be sustainable and contribute to enhancing awareness in the communities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>I visited Azerbaijan in late 2011, and I was very keen to go there to develop further bilateral relationships between the EU and Azerbaijan and highlight the importance of making sure that our relationships are tailor-made to suit the needs of both.<br></p><p>Azerbaijan is an important partner of the EU in terms of energy, and I know that it is working closely with my colleague, Commissioner Günther Oettinger, to advance on this issue. Azerbaijan is also an increasingly important player in the Caucasus region and it has been proved by its election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council at the UN.</p><p>The Eastern Partnership is an important way in which we demonstrate the closeness of our relationship, building on the common values and aspirations that we hold for all our people. For all my life the issues of human rights has been central to the way I approach the relationships that we have in the EU. With all the countries in the Eastern Partnership, it's part of the core values that we hold.</p><p>Azerbaijan knows well the position the EU and I myself hold in terms of these issues and I hope my visit to Azerbaijan was an opportunity to demonstrate the value that we place on this relationship, considering further in our meetings what more we can do to develop and deepen that relationship in the future.</p><p>We also touched upon the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The EU has a different role to the Minsk Group, which is responsible for trying to resolve this issue. I appointed a special representative to offer our support in some of the ways that the EU can support the process; an example being confidence-building measures.</p><p>Briefly, we also discussed some foreign policy issues, among them Iran. As you know, on behalf of the E3+3 or the P5+1, I'm responsible for leading the negotiations with Iran, and we take a very clear double-track approach. We believe in trying to get the Iranians to negotiate and to respect their commitments on nuclear proliferation. And we're concerned about the latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). While we wish to see Iran honor its commitments and come to negotiate, we recognize we need to keep up the pressure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>October 24, 2011 was a historic day for the Republic of Azerbaijan. On that day, Azerbaijan was elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2012-2013 during the 66th session of the UN General Assembly. A total of 155 countries around the world supported our membership of the Security Council, which testifies to the achievements that Azerbaijan has made in recent years. The President of Azerbaijan, HE Ilham Aliyev, has characterized this election as Azerbaijan's biggest foreign policy success since regaining its independence in 1991.<br></p><p>Azerbaijan fully deserved to become a member of the Security Council as it received an overwhelming number of votes. We highly appreciate the trust and support given to Azerbaijan by the broad UN membership and assure all Member States of our firm determination to work in a constructive manner in the Security Council.</p><p>It is my firm belief that Azerbaijan will contribute to international peace and security by closely working with all members of the Security Council. First and foremost, Azerbaijan conducts an independent, multi-dimensional, and balanced foreign policy and has proved itself as a reliable partner, as well as a strong, stable, and predictable country in the years past.</p><p>Secondly, Azerbaijan will continue to demonstrate its commitment to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter and international law. Thirdly, Azerbaijan will spare no effort to establish lasting peace and stability in the South Caucasus region and beyond. The main priority of Azerbaijan's foreign policy is to find a solution to the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. As a country suffering from the scourge of war, ethnic cleansing, and occupation, Azerbaijan is the most interested party in a quick and just solution to the conflict.</p><p>The Security Council adopted four resolutions (822, 853, 874, 884) in 1993 in response to the illegal use of force against Azerbaijan and the occupation of its territories. In these resolutions the Security Council demanded an immediate, complete, and unconditional withdrawal of occupying forces from Azerbaijani territories and reaffirmed the territorial integrity and inviolability of the internationally recognized borders of the Republic of Azerbaijan.</p><p>Although mediation efforts conducted for over 20 years have not always been consistent and have yet to yield results, Azerbaijan continues to be committed to a negotiated settlement to the conflict. We proceed from the understanding that at the core of the ongoing political process is a settlement formula based on putting an end to the illegal occupation of Azerbaijani territories, the restoration of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, the return of forcibly displaced persons to their native lands, and ensuring the peaceful coexistence of Azerbaijanis and Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region within Azerbaijan.</p><p>Azerbaijan regrets that the Security Council's resolutions have not been implemented yet and that Azerbaijani territories still remain under foreign occupation.</p><p>The Security Council, as the main organ responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security, should not tolerate the non-implementation of its own resolutions and should not remain indifferent to the grave consequences of the conflict. Azerbaijan will raise conflict-related issues under different topics such as the protection of civilians including women and children, peace and security, armed conflict, and the rule of law.</p><p>Furthermore, Azerbaijan's economy is on the rise. In recognition of result-oriented reforms, an ambitious national development strategy, and consistent economic policy, Azerbaijan has been recognized as one of the world's top reformers. Azerbaijan is determined to contribute to the realization of the development goals and objectives agreed within the UN. Azerbaijan demonstrates full support and undertakes ceaseless efforts for the eradication of poverty and promotion of sustained economic growth, sustainable development, and global prosperity for all, paying particular attention to addressing the special needs and vulnerabilities of the developing and least developed countries as well as those recovering from natural disasters. Over the past years Azerbaijan has provided extensive humanitarian assistance and contributed to the implementation of national development policies and strategies in a number of countries from different regions. Azerbaijan is keen to make further efforts in this direction. In addition, Azerbaijan has always been a place of coexistence and tolerance between different ethnic groups and religions. As a bridge between Eastern and Western civilizations and an active member of the Group of Friends of the UN Alliance of Civilizations, Azerbaijan actively contributes to the promotion of inter-religious and intercultural dialogue, which is one of the main priorities of its foreign policy. Azerbaijan will continue its efforts to this end.</p><p>Azerbaijan acknowledges the vital importance of ensuring greater transparency in the decision-making process, accountability in performance, shared responsibility, and better involvement of non-member states in the work of the Security Council. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council, Azerbaijan will fully dedicate itself to contributing to the maintenance of international peace and security and to making the Security Council a more representative, transparent, and efficient organ so that it can effectively address the full range of challenges and threats confronting our world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Scalability As Drawn]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[scalability-as-drawn]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the success of SOCAR represent the development of Azerbaijan as a key international player in the oil sector?</h4><p>The role of national oil companies (NOCs) has been growing lately around the world, and they have been gaining a larger role in the world regardless of their geographic location. SOCAR is also playing an important strategic role both in Azerbaijan and internationally. We plan on developing our presence in surrounding countries such as Georgia and Turkey. Four years ago we made our first international investment in Georgia, and today we represent 50% of that market, with our own distribution network for oil and oil-based products. SOCAR also oversees the gas distribution network in Georgia as well, because up to 90% of gas imports to that country come from Azerbaijan. We are the biggest taxpayers in the country.</p><p>In addition, we have made strategic investments in Turkey, where in 2011 we inaugurated a new refinery, called “Star," which is located in Izmir province and will have a production capacity of 10 million tons a year. We are going to invest about $6 billion in that refinery, because we want to expand our activities in the petrochemical sector in Turkey, which has huge potential. Besides that, we have started investing in the distribution of oil products in Ukraine and Romania. Furthermore, we bought Exxon's petrol stations and the businesses tied to them in Switzerland, and we started constructing a new oil terminal in the UAE through SOCAR Trading.</p><p>The project consists of three phases: the first is the construction of a terminal with a capacity of 115,000 tons. In the second phase, the capacity will be increased to 230,000 tons by 2013. Finally, we will further expand the facility's capacity to over 600,000 tons by 2014 in the final phase.</p><h4>What are the advantages of the construction of the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP)?</h4><p>The oil and gas businesses are very different. Gas is a lot more challenging, and we first have to figure out transit and distribution issues for the gas to start flowing. We signed various agreements in Izmir, Turkey, in October 2011 and we were granted the right to deliver and transport gas throughout Turkey. Right now we're talking about a capacity of 16 billion cubic meters (bcm), and we had to either do this through Turkey's gas distribution company, BOTAÅž, and its expansive national grid, or build a new, dedicated pipeline. Both are considered as key elements of the Southern Gas Corridor. We came up with the TANAP project, although we agreed with the authorities in Turkey to check the feasibility of both projects and to make a final solution by mid-2012. Azerbaijan and SOCAR place a priority on Europe and Turkey in terms of Azerbaijani gas, and this project offers alternatives to the future supply of Azerbaijani gas to both markets. However, as a gas supplier, our aim isn't just to deliver the gas, but to do it at the best price. This is a commercial enterprise after all. European consumers should know that we have to make multi-billion dollar investments to be able to deliver our gas to Europe. The preliminary assessment of costs for Shah Deniz Phase II is about $25 billion to $26 billion. Therefore, the gas we sell has to recover those costs and deliver a reasonable profit as well.</p><h4>What favorable options does SOCAR see for Azerbaijan to supply to the EU through the Southern Gas Corridor?</h4><p>In January 2011, the President of the European Commission (EC), Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, and President Ilham Aliyev signed a joint declaration on the Southern Gas Corridor. Barroso, knowing of the importance of Azerbaijan in such a project, labeled us the “enabler" country, because the first supplier of gas from the Caspian Sea to Europe will be Azerbaijan. SOCAR has been positively contributing to this project by carrying out negotiations with potential buyers and the owners of pipeline infrastructure in Europe. During 2011 we managed to narrow the initial pool of 14 companies that could be the potential buyers of Azerbaijani gas from Shah Deniz II. We have identified the potential pipeline projects for the Southern Corridor: Nabucco, the Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy (ITGI), the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), and the Southeastern European Pipeline, which is geographically going to follow the Nabucco route via Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary.</p><p>Since all these projects needed Azerbaijani gas to go ahead, we had to prioritize one of them, because it is impossible to carry out all four at the same time. When one is started the other ones will be postponed. In February this year we selected a single pipeline to Italy and decided to undertake exclusive negotiations with TAP. No decision has yet been made on the selection of a single pipeline toward South Eastern/Central Europe and we expect to finalize our choice by mid-2012. A final route selection for an initial 10 bcm per annum from the Shah Deniz field to Europe will be made no later than the planned final investment decision for the Shah Deniz project in mid-2013. Meanwhile, we continue our commercial engagement with potential buyers, to compile the necessary information about the selected projects, and to further develop our cooperation with the EC to implement the Southern Corridor Strategy. We are now considering what the design of the pipelines should be in all the potential routes, keeping in mind not only current volumes of gas, but also all those volumes that would come from other fields in Azerbaijan after 2020 or 2025. We don't just plan for the next five years but the next 15 to 20 years. Our forecast for 2025 is that the production of natural gas from Azerbaijan would be around 50-55 bcm. Therefore, obviously, it's not economically feasible to build pipelines for every one of our fields. Instead, we need to build a pipeline that can service all these fields and one that can be upgraded as the necessity arises. This leads to an interesting and innovative concept: scalability. Throughout 2011 and continuing today we have been working on the concept that any pipeline project should be scalable; you start with one capacity, then end up with a second capacity, but in such a way that it prevents any losses, offers maximum efficiencies, and doesn't bring interruptions to operations. Therefore, 2012 is the year for decisions, and in terms of starting the full-scale implementation of the Shah Deniz Phase II project, there will also be financial decisions, after which there is no point of return.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-story-of-transformation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The World Bank In Azerbaijan—Celebrating 20 Years of Fruitful Partnership<br></h4><p>In 2012 the World Bank Group and Azerbaijan celebrate 20 years of successful partnership—a partnership marked by a most impressive transformation. Just two decades ago, Azerbaijan was building its statehood on the ashes of the Soviet Union, torn by war and political uncertainty, with more than 60% of its population living below the poverty line and only $14 million in foreign currency reserves. Today, poverty has fallen to less than 10% and the sovereign oil fund alone has savings of over $35 billion. In 2011, Azerbaijan graduated out of the IDA, the part of the Bank that provides concessionary “soft" loans to poorer developing countries, into the ranks of middle-income countries that borrow from the Bank purely on market terms and conditions.</p><h4>Delivering Results to Improve People's Lives</h4><p>Azerbaijan became a member and shareholder of the World Bank in 1992 and has since received over $2.97 billion for 43 projects. The World Bank helped develop an appropriate regulatory environment in the oil sector, which facilitated investments by the world's leading companies. Investments by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector financing arm of the World Bank Group in oil production and transportation infrastructure, also helped lay the foundations for Azerbaijan's prosperity. The Bank also supported the creation of the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ), which has saved over half of the oil revenues the country has received since 2004. SOFAZ has become a model for other resource-rich nations seeking to develop more transparent mechanisms for managing commodity wealth.</p><p>The Bank has also been supporting the government in its institutional reform agenda. We helped to design and implement an ambitious land reform program as well as agricultural development projects, which provided 80,000 farmers around the country with access to financing. Through an improved system of agriculture extension and advisory services, farmers are learning to use modern farming methods and better quality seeds to improve crop yields and make more money. The World Bank has rehabilitated irrigation networks covering 56,000 hectares of agricultural land.</p><p>Over 80% of the current World Bank portfolio is in much needed physical infrastructure—especially roads, railways, water, and sanitation—and supports Azerbaijan's goal of providing high-quality public services to its population. Since 2001, more than 300 kilometers of highways have been built or rehabilitated and further investments are being made in this area, making the travel and transportation of people and goods much safer and quicker.</p><p>The Bank has also been very engaged in supporting the modernization of Azerbaijan's educational and health systems. We have financed the development of new curricula, teaching materials, and methods so that students are better equipped to face the requirements of a rapidly changing world and job market. Similarly, doctors and nurses are being retrained and health facilities are being modernized in over a dozen rayons in the country. The positive impact of the Bank's support is also being felt by the more than 1.3 million pensioners in Azerbaijan who can now receive their monthly payments instantly at ATMs.</p><p>Azerbaijan no longer needs to borrow from the World Bank, but continues to appreciate it for the global knowledge of best practice that its staff brings with it. In addition, projects financed by the Bank follow the highest standards, both in terms of technical quality and management approaches, as well as support capacity  building among counterparts and local contractors.</p><h4>The Challenges Ahead</h4><p>The most significant challenges are common to several countries across the region—namely, the need to ensure strong and inclusive growth going forward, and to diversify and rebalance the structure of growth and investment. The upshot is that while Azerbaijan has achieved some remarkable successes in recent years, much of this stemmed from the rise in oil production following the coming onstream of the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) field. However, oil production has plateaued already and will fall further in the medium run in the absence of new discoveries. Furthermore, the oil sector will not create enough jobs to keep the growing and young Azerbaijani population gainfully employed. Hydrocarbon dependence will therefore have to be reduced. Currently, public spending is nearly 40% of GDP and over 100% of non-oil GDP. Oil accounts for over 90% of total exports. This situation is clearly not sustainable. At the same time, in order to get some perspective on what is needed to effectively diversify, it should be noted that if per capita incomes are to increase from current levels to $20,000, non-oil exports will need to increase 50 fold—a massive scaling up, though from a low level.</p><p>Developing a new diversified non-oil, export-led development model will clearly not be easy. For one, the “new normal" of slower growth in advanced countries suggests that export-led growth—the best option for achieving higher living standards and faster job growth in countries such as Azerbaijan—may have become harder to achieve. What this really means is that it becomes more important to get the other ingredients in the mix just right.</p><p>Other factors will further compound the diversification challenge. The large capital and revenue inflows related to oil exports in the past seven years have led to an overall real effective exchange rate appreciation of around 40%. This makes it more difficult for non-oil exports to be competitive in global markets unless there is a compensating increase in productivity. Managing an appropriate monetary exchange rate and fiscal policy will also be important in this respect, as will building physical infrastructure. But these policies will have to be complemented by a highly educated and skilled workforce as well as by entrepreneurs that are willing to innovate and acquire new technologies and know-how. The government has introduced notable reforms on the institutional front, particularly through the fight against corruption, administrative improvements in tax, customs, and business registration, and the move to draft a competition law. However, market institutions need further strengthening so that they can fulfill their role of facilitating innovation and productivity growth and providing a supportive and investment-friendly business environment. All over the world, SMEs are the crucibles of job growth. And to promote these SMEs, competition policies that are focused on leveling the playing field will be critical.</p><p>While developing non-oil exports will not be easy, there are good examples of other oil exporters that have done so successfully. Norway's per capita non-oil exports are 50 times those of Azerbaijan's. Malaysia's per capita non-oil exports are 28 times those of Azerbaijan's. Azerbaijan can therefore certainly improve its performance on this front, and significantly.</p><h4>Working Together for a More Prosperous Future</h4><p>The government is fully aware of the need for diversification and has engaged with the Bank and other development partners to create a comprehensive and cross-cutting action plan for sustainable and shared non-oil, export-led-growth. The Second High-level Economic Policy Forum held by the government in Baku on March 5 and 6, 2012 in collaboration with the World Bank marked a significant step forward in this context. International experts and policymakers from around the world worked with representatives of the government on Azerbaijan's strategy for entering and competing effectively in global markets.</p><p>The World Bank looks forward to deepening further our cooperation with the government and to supporting Azerbaijan every step of the way to create an even more prosperous future, where the benefits of economic growth are enjoyed by all and where everyone has an opportunity to make their lives better.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>General Electric (GE) is a very diversified company. Which areas of the business are performing particularly well in Colombia, and which areas have more potential for growth?<br></h4><p>GE has been in Colombia since the early 20th century. Over the years, GE's focus has mirrored the broader economic trends in Colombia. A few years ago the country did not have much potential in oil, but today it is a different story. In the last eight years the company has focused on developing the oil and gas sector as well as pursuing other opportunities in the energy and transportation sectors.</p><h4>GE grew 30% in Latin America in 2011. What does Colombia represent for GE's global operations?</h4><p>Latin America specifically is one of the most important regions for the company worldwide, being one of the major growth leaders. Colombia contributed a growth rate of more than 130%, which is significant relative to the Latin American region, especially because of the oil and gas sector. Our participation in Latin America today is about 6% of our global operations, and we hope we can increase that participation within the next three years to 10%. GE has expectations in the region; being one of the fastest growing markets in the world where the company can collaborate to develop its infrastructure and a sustainable economy. Samples of GE's commitment to this market are the decision to build our fifth Global Research Center in Rio de Janeiro among other plants intended to supply the oil and gas industry. These plants will provide solution and innovations to the entire Latin America region. Colombia is going through a significant time as there is an estimated portfolio of promising investment. Projects related to the use of high-quality technology could allow the country to take the big leap into modernity. GE has the expertise and innovation that Colombia needs to cover its infrastructure gap and generate overall sustainable development.</p><div class="quote">“Latin America specifically is one of the most important regions for the company worldwide, being one of the major growth leaders."</div><h4>In 2010 GE played an important role in the Cartagena Refinery, and the company is planning to grow significantly in the energy sector. What are the most important current and upcoming projects?</h4><p>Our businesses in Colombia are a success story. After the energy crisis that Colombia experienced in the late 1990s, the country developed an appropriate legal framework and increased political will to develop the sector. We are strong participants in the industry, especially in thermal generation as well as renewable energy, which is just starting to be explored. We have the most advanced technologies in thermal generation and a strong portfolio in fuel, gas, and alternative energies. In oil and gas, we have customers in different areas, from upstream all the way to downstream. With our recent acquisition of the artificial lift technology business, we have an operation in Colombia that is sourcing electro submergible pumps for exploration activities, and they are selling to most of the companies that are exploring now. We are supplying important elements to support production, including pumps, compressors, and equipment for the construction of the pipelines. To explore and produce oil companies need energy. As a result, energy projects are very closely related to oil production and exploration, and GE is also participating in energy, mostly thermal energy related to oil operations.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the project in Barrancabermeja?</h4><p>Barrancabermeja is a refinery that has long needed a project to increase its capacity. We have a strong interest in the refinery. The necessary equipment is in place, and it is a matter of removing or expanding our presence there. Barrancabermeja is an important project for the country.</p><h4>The engines for Copa and Copa Colombia are from GE. What is the potential for further investment in this segment?</h4><p>One of the most important approaches of GE is oriented toward the development of the aviation sector, where we are a renowned company because we are leaders in manufacturing turbines for airplanes. GE's involvement with airplane engines is a reflection of the dynamics of the country. The increase in the number of people traveling and the number of flights are a result of the country's strong growth. At GE, we aim to work closely in the supply of the engines and even the airplanes for different projects. Our GE Capital business unit leases several aircraft to airlines in Colombia. We not only have an engine business, but also a leasing business. This is another sector of the industry that we expect to grow significantly.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind the sale of your interests in Banco Colpatria last year?</h4><p>GE made the decision to concentrate its business globally on industrial production. As a part of that strategy, GE Capital decided to reduce its footprint internationally. The company decided to sell some of its successful and attractive assets. This strategic transaction was a good deal for both parties. GE's partnership with Banco Colpatria was very positive, and it was an excellent starting point for GE Capital in Colombia. Despite GE's involvement in middle market finance, GE's primary focus is as an industrial conglomerate and a technology company. This has been our strength for nearly 100 years. Although GE Capital's participation is still very important in the company's revenues, the company has decided to focus on the industrial sector.</p><h4>What are the advantages and the main challenges of investing in Colombia?</h4><p>We understand that energy, infrastructure, and economic development are critically important for Colombia as the country continues progressing. Therefore, we are sure that success will require depth in areas where GE is an expert that excels. Colombia is currently one of the most attractive countries in the region for investment. This is the result of continued policies to open doors to foreign investment and to create legal stability and an attractive environment for FDI. Colombia has a little bit of everything. It is not an oil country, but it has oil. It is not a gold country, but it has gold. Colombia has very good agricultural products like coffee and flowers. It also has a strong industrial sector, even though more infrastructure development is necessary. The size of the country is also an advantage. Colombia is larger than most other countries in the region except for Brazil. However, Colombia needs to be better at execution. This is the nature of the country and the Colombian people. We are very good at planning, have a very high level of education, and have creative and strategic thinkers, excellent economists, the best lawyers, and good statisticians, but at the point of execution we find a way to be slow. We need to improve in this area. But the good thing is that we know that now.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the philosophy behind the design of the Mastretta?</h4><p>We realized that the global automotive market has many niches, and we saw a niche market for high-quality sports cars manufactured with excellent performance standards, but in low volumes. This industry is already present in Europe and the US. At our company, we combine the technology and the financial strength necessary to develop our own version of this niche car. We started developing the project in 2005, and began production and sales in 2011. Our company has been in the market for 25 years, and our core business is industrial design. Today, we have a new division of the company, which is the manufacturing wing for the Mastretta MXT.</p><h4>What were the main challenges in the development of the Mastretta MXT?</h4><p>Designing and building the car was not an issue, but the automotive industry is one of the most competitive industries in the world. With many great and excellent manufacturers in the sports car niche, to compete successfully in the business is a huge technological challenge. Another challenge was to make the transition from operating in the services industry to become a manufacturer by attracting financial support. It was also challenging to modify the structure of the organization of the company to win over investors. A third big challenge was to build a manufacturing facility from the ground up and be able to begin producing the car.</p><h4>How many cars are you planning to produce over 2012?</h4><p>We will produce 120 cars. Our production is low volume and our cars are very customized. It is important to mention that in Europe there is special legislation for manufacturers like Mastretta, and if you manufacture less than 1,000 vehicles per year it is more affordable and easier to be successful.</p><h4>Which countries in Europe have expressed the most interest in the model?</h4><p>There are sports car fans throughout Europe, but countries such as the UK, Italy, France, Spain, and Germany are our main markets. We have already secured two distributors that are representing and working for us in Europe, and we look forward to opening more offices in the future.</p><h4>What will be the impact of deliveries to US customers in mid-2012?</h4><p>The US is a huge market for sports cars. We expect to open up another window of opportunity, and the company will be able to grow faster.</p><div class="quote">“Car sales depend on customers' emotions to a large degree. People buy the cars that they fall in love with."</div><h4>What are Mastretta's competitive advantages?</h4><p>The main competitive advantage is the unique design of the car. Fortunately, it has been very well received, and car sales depend on customers' emotions to a large degree. People buy the cars that they fall in love with. A second competitive advantage is the car's high performance; the Mastretta is fun to drive. Thirdly, we manufacture the car at a very competitive cost, which allows us to offer the car to the market at a very competitive price.</p><h4>With future legislation on CO2 emissions getting stricter, will you consider manufacturing hybrid or fully electric cars?</h4><p>In the future, yes. Hybrid or electric cars are light and weigh less than 1,000 kg. Our ideal is to manufacture electric cars. We are already working with an official electric car company in South Korea, because we want to produce an electric or even a hybrid version of the car in two years.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in Mexico's automotive industry?</h4><p>Mexico is highly competitive in terms of skilled people in the workforce, and the country has recently entered the spotlight as a car producer, ranking seventh or eighth in the world. Many large manufacturers are not coming to Mexico to exclusively assemble cars. Instead, they are beginning to develop and design the models here. This shift will allow Mexico to develop a more sophisticated car industry in the future. Currently, there are more engineering students in Mexico than in the US, although the population is three times larger there.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the automotive sector in 2012 and the medium term?</h4><p>In the coming years, we will see high growth in Mexico's industry, sourced from the largest manufacturers in the world. Companies will be manufacturing more cars and conducting more and more R&amp;D in Mexico, developing technology and innovations. I see Mastretta as a business that can increase production to 500-600 cars per year, with more models to offer to the market. Furthermore, we see the company as capable of offering more sophisticated models and competing with the most advanced cars manufactured around the world.</p><h4>How do you feel the international market will receive a car designed and built in Mexico?</h4><p>To convince the market that this product is high quality and high performance is the main challenge. This is to be expected; we are a relatively new company that still needs to build credibility within its niche. However, we are committed to producing a good product that the international market will recognize.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you assess the opportunities for offshore exploration in Colombia?</h4><p>There are offshore activities in both the Pacific and the Caribbean region, though resources in the Caribbean are more advanced now. The first site that started producing was Chuchupa, just off the Guajira peninsula, and it was, and continues to be, a Chevron venture. Chevron provides approximately 70% of the gas in Colombia, and it has played an important role in the development of the gas industry since that discovery in the 1970s. From this field gas is exported to Venezuela. What is happening, however, is that production in this field is declining. That is the first challenge for us in Colombia. On top of that, we at Equión provide 30% of the gas in the country. In terms of private companies, we are the second largest domestic gas supplier. We know how to manage this market, and we know how to manage gas. Knowing that sector and knowing how to commercialize this commodity gives us special experience. The two companies that have this experience are Chevron and Equión. For now, the main challenge is to replace this declining field. We are looking along the shore to replace this gas, and have two blocks on the Caribbean coast now. In the first exploration area, RC5, we are looking for gas. Of course, it is a relief for the country to have another source and a firm that can produce gas apart from Chevron. That is our challenge; it is not just an exploration project, it is a project that can help provide Colombia with energy security over the medium to long term. Equión also works with international contractors like Schlumberger and Corinne Martin. We have everything ready, and we hope that the weather conditions improve so we can have good news for this country.</p><h4>What should be done to maximize Colombia's offshore opportunities and potential, and how important do you think synergies are in these efforts?</h4><p>Developing synergies between the companies and between the blocks is a very important point. We don't have a huge area like the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, or other locations where there is a lot of exploration, development, and production for contractors; those are very easy places to have jack-ups, for example. There is less movement in Colombia. We need to coordinate with other companies on how we are going to develop Colombia's offshore resources. We need to coordinate and communicate in order to bring in the companies and equipment we need here for long-term business, not just for three or six months. We need to show contractors that we can offer long-term contracts. We have started talking to the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) and established a “Rig Club," and by doing this we can better coordinate all stakeholders. This is the way to achieve a high level of offshore development in Colombia. Everything has to be coordinated, and this also includes environmental licenses and community permits. Now that we have this group, we have established an open line of communication with the government.</p><div class="quote">“Developing synergies between the companies and between the blocks is a very important point."</div><h4>What are the primary challenges that you face in realizing the full potential of energy exploration and production?</h4><p>The companies need to be well coordinated with each other and with government institutions. When dealing with permits or environmental licenses, the government approves the things we need to be coordinated. Another challenge is coordinating with communities. The consultation process, prior to the initiation of a project, must be handled with care. When you arrive in a new area, it is a challenge to understand the needs of the communities, and this takes time.</p><h4>What level of investment are you looking to make in the medium term?</h4><p>For the time being we have two blocks, RC4 and RC5. The short-term plan is to invest about $150 million in exploration, but we are in the middle of studies and approvals on RC4, which is a deep-water project. If the approvals go through this will be an $80 million to $100 million project. In RC5, the Mapalé 1 exploration well startedon August 3 and should be able to show some information in the first quarter of 2013. We would like to develop more than one well, but it will depend on weather conditions.</p><h4>What is the production in your onshore block in Casanare province?</h4><p>All of our production is there now, and it operates at the equivalent of 100,000 barrels per day (bbl/d). It's approximately 50% gas and 50% liquids. From that production, almost 20,000-30,000 bbl/d equivalent belongs to Equión, with the rest belonging to the other partners. We have had these contracts for 25 years, and these contracts will expire in the coming years—the first one in 2016. The big challenge with those fields—the mature fields that will expire first—is to bring in the technology to get more from them. Equión is working with leading companies such as Baker Hughes, Halliburton, and Schlumberger; although our company doesn't develop this kind of technology, we work very closely with our partners. We get together with all of the contractors and find different ways to increase the recovery factor. The first challenge is in handling the mature phase of these fields. We have a big development in the last license, expiring in 2020, which we call Piedemonte (foothills). Those wells are very deep. This means we drill to maybe 20,000 feet from the top of the mountain, meaning big rigs, and each well takes about eight months to drill. The geology is not easy. The layers are not clearly delineated, and the terrain is very faulty. It's in the middle of the mountains, so it's not easy, but the company that has the experience to do this kind of work is Equión. Our company also does a lot of community development and build roads. We are receiving very good resources from each well, and each well could yield between 5,000 and 12,000 bbl/d if things go well. Each well could cost $80 million, so it is a big investment. If you compare that to other operators in Colombia that drill in flatter areas, their costs are only $5 million or $10 million—but they don't find as much. In flatter areas the costs are lower per well, but not as productive. Also, they are producing heavy oil, so it has to be blended. Here, it is a gas condensate—liquid with gas. We have to handle the gas, and then re-inject it. In the other areas it is just liquids, so it's easier. When you have gas you have more challenges, and you have to build facilities to re-inject the gas. A lot of technology and experience is required in order to manage these types of fields.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been CONAGUA's recent landmark achievements?</h4><p>We have implemented a very ambitious plan to provide drinking water to the entire population, and so far we have reached 91.6% coverage. There are 12.6 million additional people who now have access to drinking water as a direct result of the construction of a vast amount of infrastructure. We have also made great strides in terms of wastewater management treatment, where Mexico has historically fallen behind when compared with international standards. When President Calderón's administration took over, the country was only treating 36.1% of its sewage and wastewater, and within six years of his mandate we will bring that figure up to 60%; so far, we have built 385 new plants, rehabilitated 60, and we are currently developing many more, of which three are among the largest in the world. Two of these plants are being built in Guadalajara, which will treat all the wastewater of that region. At the same time, we expect that the Atotonilco water treatment plant near Mexico City will be operating by year 2014, a facility that will have the capacity to treat 60% of the wastewater of the entire valley of Mexico by itself, or in other words, serve 20 million people.</p><h4>What are the main upcoming targets for CONAGUA?</h4><p>As part of the national development plan, our main targets for the future are to work on large infrastructure projects that have a long-term vision, especially regarding water sustainability. For example, currently we are constructing the Zapotillo dam, a large and very important project to provide water to the areas of León and Guadalajara. Such projects are vital to attract private investment. In the last six years we have tripled the overall figures for private investment, and we want to continue with this trend. Furthermore, over the last six years, the total investments made by CONAGUA are double or even triple those of the previous period.</p><div class="quote">“In the last six years we have tripled the overall figures for private investment, and we want to continue with this trend."</div><h4>What are the main challenges facing the balancing out of water supply distribution, and what can be done to address these?</h4><p>Mexico's main challenge is the decrease in water availability, both from surface and underground sources, as well as the overexploitation of underground wells. It is envisaged that our main projects will address this situation, but there is a long road ahead of us, and I believe that the work done in the last six years has been very positive in terms of sustainability.</p><h4>What other key projects do you have in the pipeline?</h4><p>We have two ongoing projects that are being prepared for the provision of drinking water that may receive funding from the National Infrastructure Fund (FNI). The first is Monterrey VI, which is a Ps13.9 billion project to be completed over a period of 48 months. It is an aqueduct that will stretch 136 kilometers with pipes of 84 inches and six stations pumping at 6,000 liters per second. A second project is the Picachos aqueduct in Mazatlán, designed to address the expected water deficits in the area associated with the growing population. The project will cost approximately Ps400 million and pump about 750 liters per second at its stations and have a service life of 50 years.</p><h4>The Water Agenda 2030 formulated the country's commitment to the consolidation of a sustainable water policy for the future. How has the development of the vision progressed and what are the core aims?</h4><p>Conceived to respond to water issues and reverse the tendencies that affect the sustainability of economic and human development as a whole, the Water Agenda 2030 was integrated in 2010 with an increased focus on the participation of society. Since its inception, we have emphasized that the agenda is not simply a compiling of CONAGUA's objectives over the next two decades. On the contrary, it is a result of the strong collaboration to identify and characterize the changes that are required to achieve long-term sustainability. The challenges ahead are large and complex; the agenda puts forth a long-term vision to create a Mexico with clean rivers, watersheds, and aquifers that offer universal drinking water and sanitation, while at the same time providing safety from disastrous floods.</p><h4>To what extent does lack of education among the population remain a challenge to the sustainable supply of water nationwide?</h4><p>Education is a key part of our national plan; technical advancement through capacity-building courses that provide greater education among the population of Mexico is a strategic matter. In this regard, we are currently taking part in education programs across the country. However, our main focus is on more efficient water use programs, especially within the agricultural sector, because we can teach farmers to save water by introducing appropriate techniques such as drip irrigation. It is also important to work closely with municipalities so they can be part of the global project to achieve water efficiency.</p><h4>How important are public-private partnership (PPP) schemes in the government's plans, and what opportunities exist for private sector entities in providing water infrastructure?</h4><p>There are plenty of opportunities for the private sector to get involved with projects from CONAGUA. In fact, most of our undergoing greatest projects are PPPs, which have been boosted in the last six years thanks to a new law the government of Mexico passed during President Calderón's administration, making the country much more attractive for FDI. In addition, the government created the National Infrastructure Fund (FNI), and although at the beginning we did not tend to use it much, today CONAGUA's projects represent about 30% of that fund. In terms of opportunities, I believe that irrigation, greenhouses, and crop selection in the agriculture sector offer a wide range of opportunities for investors, whereas in the industrial area the main opportunities have to do with water treatment—mainly its purification and reuse. This is something we can also export to Mexico's municipalities, because new technology is required in wastewater management.</p><h4>To what extent has the regulatory environment been tailored to provide effective industry support?</h4><p>In 2004, new amendments to the National Water Law were passed in order to encourage a higher level of civic participation, and I believe it was a very significant step forward. In addition, the PPP law, which was passed in 2012, has played a key role in attracting more investment, introducing new technology, and raising awareness among Mexico's population. I believe that Mexico's legal framework is ideal to achieve the country's main climate change and water supply targets. CONAGUA has also approved a long-term working agenda in order to work with a clear future vision regardless of the change of government.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

There has to be a bridge and transportation facilities between two countries for any type of business relationship or tourism to grow. Usually, when airlines invest in a new route there is already a business relationship. Two years after Emirates was established in Dubai as the airline of the Dubai government, it opened an Istanbul route. Having two flights per week to Istanbul was a big challenge because there was very little awareness in Turkey about the UAE and Dubai. In 1993, five years after Emirates started operating to Turkey, Emirates only had two flights operating between Istanbul and Dubai, and those Boeing 727 aircraft were going to Frankfurt and then coming back, which gave Turkey a weekly 250-passenger capacity. Today, we have capacity for 5,000 people one way weekly. We are flying every day, in the biggest aircraft that Istanbul's airports can receive. Our load factor is an average 81% on the route, and we have 11 flights per week. Some days it is a single flight, sometimes a double. Istanbul to Dubai is the most profitable European route for Emirates in terms of cost-revenue ratios.</p><h4>How has Emirates encouraged trade and business between Turkey and Dubai?</h4><p>I started with Emirates in August 1993. I come from an export-import background and worked for British Airways and then Emirates. Dubai was really unknown, and so I spoke to the Chamber of Commerce, customs, the warehouses, and cargo villages to discover the export-import trends. Then I did the same thing in Turkey. We went to Turkish producers and exporters, and we made a booklet in Turkish that showed how to do business with Dubai, how to invest in Dubai in a free zone, how to set up a company in a free zone or outside it, and how to export. At the time, many exporters were trying to sell to Germany and the US, but these countries have quotas. In Dubai, there are no quotas. We gave exporters the contacts they needed. This was all before the internet of course, and this information is easier to access nowadays. For two years, my office was full of exporters looking to get contacts. Now, many people are doing business with Dubai, investing and engaging in the construction and finance industries. We were also telling people, especially white-collar workers who seek employment abroad, to try their chances in Dubai. In Europe, it is very hard to get a work permit. If you go there and try to find a job, you will find one since most of the population are expatriates.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai is, and will always be, the center of business in the UAE."</div><h4>How did Emirates build the tourism relationship Turkey has with Dubai?</h4><p>After we built up the business to a certain extent, we started to promote Dubai as the closest place with the nicest beaches and sea when it is freezing cold in Turkey. During the cold winter months the warmest place Turkish people used to go was Florida and the Caribbean, which is about 16 hours of flying time. Dubai is just four hours away offering luxury hotels, high market restaurants, good shopping, very high-quality service, warm weather, and very nice beaches. Two years later, there was a severe winter and one of the country's holidays fell on a very cold period. All the seats were full, but travel agents were calling us and asking for seats to Dubai. The next year, during the winter holidays, Dubai was the only demand that consumers were making to travel agencies by name. If they wanted to go to Europe, they asked for whatever was available and cheap, but many people expressed a desire for Dubai specifically.</p><h4>What portion of your passengers travel for business and how many for leisure?</h4><p>Approximately 60% travel for business purposes, and the other 40% go to Dubai for tourism. The level of repeat travellers is high for both the business and leisure segments. Also, expatriates and their families moving between Dubai and Turkey are repeat customers. Dubai is not a once-in-a-lifetime trip. If you go to Dubrovnik, for example, you see it once and think it is nice. In Dubai, you are not going to see historical ruins. You will sit in the sun, have good food, go shopping, and spend time with your family. It is a perfect place to have family vacation because you are on the beach all day and you don't have to rush around sightseeing.</p><h4>Are most bookings made through travel agencies or online?</h4><p>Around 70% of our bookings come through local travel agencies. We have direct sales from our offices and reservations centers that make up 12%, and the remaining 15% is from online sales.</p><h4>E-commerce is really growing in Turkey. Do you encourage more people to book online?</h4><p>When people go online they can get much more information about routes, fares, and services than they can get from any other source. Therefore, we recommend people go online and decide through which source they want to buy their tickets.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in air travel?</h4><p>Between Istanbul and Dubai and beyond, finding a business-class seat is one of the challenges that the whole network is facing because the services are excellent and people want to get what they pay for. Everyone who flies business class once with Emirates will not fly economy again. Also, once they fly with Emirates they try to fly everywhere with us. In the past three or four years, I believe that the trend is moving toward luxury. People with the money are ready to pay for it if they can get that luxury. Globally, when they go on business trips, they fly business class. When the same people go on personal holidays, they want to fly first class.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Mexico represent for Movistar's global operations?<br></h4><p>It is an important operation in terms of clients. We have close to 21 million customers, which is about 22% of the Mexican mobile market. Movistar is the second largest operator in Mexico. Mobile penetration rates in Central American countries and South America are about 100%. We have not reached those percentages yet, meaning there is an opportunity in terms of market growth. Ours is also an underdeveloped market, considering smartphones and data. Data is the future of telecommunications, and this sector is still in its infancy in Mexico; there is a lot of room to grow. Despite the fact that we have a smaller operation than, for example, Brazil, and despite the fact that our market share is smaller than in most other South American countries, in terms of potential Mexico is a very important country. It is the second largest economy in Latin America with a lot of opportunity for growth.</p><h4>What has been the significance of 3G in the local market?</h4><p>If one service provider has 3G then everybody has to have it. The difficulty for us—and fortunately we were able to overcome it—was that we did not have enough frequency, or enough spectrum in the metropolitan zone of Mexico City. If you want to have good wireless broadband access for your smartphone, you need 3G. LTE is the next step—we expect to provide it throughout Latin America. We are just waiting for the terminals that are needed to offer a sufficiently low price. The iPad now comes available with a 4G-type connection, but smartphones are still too expensive for our market. It is going to take some time. If anybody dives into 4G, that will pull everybody else into the new technology.</p><div class="quote">“We have been able to control our costs and cut our administrative and operational expenditure substantially over time."</div><h4>You recently presented the BlackBerry Curve 9380 and the BlackBerry Bold 9790 in Mexico. What has been the reception among Mexican consumers?</h4><p>We have had good a reception to all our smartphone launches. What we are trying to do now is find the most inexpensive smartphones because the purchasing power of the Mexican population is not comparable to European or US customers. We are trying to convince the manufacturers to bring the prices down. Movistar is already providing a reasonably low-priced smartphone, as most people want to be able to use messaging services, access the internet, and download music and videos. We do not want this to be something that is limited to wealthy consumers.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the local ICT sector?</h4><p>There is a need for fiber-optic backbones to be constructed all over the country. We teamed up with Televisa and Megacable in order to bid for fiber-optic lines from the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), because the backbone provided by Telmex is expensive. For many applications, mostly industrial, technological, and scientific, you need a considerable amount of broadband. We still have a long way to go in Mexico in terms of infrastructure needs. We need to be able to have a broad enough market for the population to be able to acquire tablets or PCs. The population in Mexico is, to a considerable degree, urbanized, but there are parts of the population that are still rural. That rural population does not have sufficient coverage or none at all. That is another challenge for the future, especially for educational purposes. To improve coverage, satellites are part of the answer.</p><h4>What financial performance are you expecting for 2012?</h4><p>We have a very reasonable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) figure, considering the challenges we have faced. We have been able to control our costs and cut our administrative and operational expenditure substantially over time. At the same time, our customer base has been expanding. We are happy that our results have been improving and we are projecting a continuous improvement in the future, mostly because of data. Voice is becoming more and more an IP-type of connectivity and, therefore, less attractive, and more like a commodity. The percentage of post-paid to pre-paid services, as well as the percentage of smartphones and tablets, is expected to increase. That's where the future lies.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Jafza was established in 1985 and is one of the world's fastest-growing free zones. What is the background of its development over the last quarter of a century?</h4><p>The vision behind the creation of Jafza, the brainchild of the Dubai government, was to develop a leading industrial, warehousing, and distribution hub in the Middle East. The initiative was aimed at boosting Dubai's plan for economic diversification and improving the traffic of associated ports and airports. The free zone was created to be all embracing, and was designed to cater to all types of industries and business sectors. As an economy, we have always recognized the immense value of trade. Jafza officially opened in 1985 with land and standard size warehouses to provide ready-built facilities to customers, who were mostly engaged in trading activities. We started functioning in that year with 19 companies. By the 1990s, we expanded our facilities to cover industrial activities. The light industrial units (LIUs) were developed to cater to the manufacturing sector. In 2003, growing demand for industrial space from the chemical and food industry led to the development of the South Zone and hybrid clusters for these two industrial sectors. In the meantime, Jafza successfully developed and implemented a customer-focused service infrastructure and culture that concentrates on customer needs and requirements. Jafza's deep commitment to service excellence led to ISO 9001 certification in 1996, making it the world's first ISO-accredited free zone. We also pioneered the concept of a “one-stop shop" in the region. Today, Jafza offers a host of infrastructure facilities to new companies, ready-built warehouses, and LIUs on developed plots, all well supported with amenities such as food courts, pharmacies, hospitals, banks, on-site residential facilities, and much more. Through Economic Zones World, Jafza's parent company, clients have access to build-to-suit solutions (BTS), which are essentially custom-built logistics facilities that are also sustainable. We have taken the excellent infrastructure that Dubai has to offer—the port, air, and road network—and added significant value attracting thousands of global companies. Today we host over 6,700 world's finest companies, including 120 of the Global Fortune 500 enterprises.</p><h4>In 2011, Jafza won the Dubai Quality Award for Excellence. What have been the key factors leading to your success?</h4><p>Winning the prestigious Dubai Quality Award (DQA) for excellence demonstrates Jafza's commitment to best practices, something we have prioritized from the start. We received the DQA in 2003 as well, and we have undertaken a business process re-engineering exercise. Overall, our strong commitment to customer-oriented solutions, innovation, and the speed at which we execute new ideas are some of the reasons why we are one of the most favored investment destinations for companies interested in the region. Jafza has focused on two aspects that have worked as the free zone's biggest growth drivers, which are ease and cost of doing business.</p><h4>What contribution is Jafza currently making to Dubai's GDP? What growth do you forecast over the next year?</h4><p>Jafza has demonstrated consistency in its role as an important driver of the nation's economy. In 2010, companies based in Jafza generated trade amounting to AED233 billion, 25% of Dubai's total non-oil trade in the same year, which was AED902 billion. Over the past five years, Jafza has contributed to Dubai's GDP at over 20% on a year-to-year basis, accounted for more than 50% of Dubai's total exports and 40% of net FDI flow into the UAE, and sustained more than 135,000 jobs through its companies.</p><h4>Dubai is consistently applauded for its excellent infrastructure. How has Jafza enhanced technical capabilities through technological innovation and development?</h4><p>We have continuously been enhancing our IT infrastructure and introducing a host of value-added services. Today Jafza is one of the most e-friendly free zones with one of the highest customer e-adoption rates in the UAE. By 2012 we want the e-adoption rates to hit above 90%. Jafza has introduced a number of initiatives, including support services such as the e-license and e-lease programs as well as an online service for the payment of customer invoices, all geared to offer greater convenience. Our customer service facility is also one of the finest in the country. It underwent re-engineering a few years ago, designed after analyzing the services we offered and the customer experience of our clients. The facility includes an intelligent, custom-built queuing system, which, over almost a year of operation, has reduced the processing time of transactions by as much as 70%.</p><div class="quote">“Jafza has demonstrated consistency in its role as an important driver of the nation's economy."</div><h4>What trends have you witnessed in terms of new companies coming to operate within Jafza over the last year?</h4><p>In 2011, approximately 400 new companies joined Jafza, which included 40 leading multinationals such as ACE Hardware, AO Smith, Apollo Tyres, Baumer, Caterpillar, David Brown, Ford, Oracle, Pelican, MAN, and Stemcor Special Steels. Sector-wise, the largest chunk of new companies came from the machinery and equipment segment, followed by electronics, chemicals, building materials, and food. Region-wise, the largest number of new companies came from Europe, followed by the Asia Pacific, Middle East, and the Americas. The trend shows a growing focus on infrastructure development in the region and economic growth that has eventually driven demand for consumer goods.</p><h4>In what ways do you work with business councils around the world to enhance competitiveness and trade relations?</h4><p>We are proud to be supporting continued bilateral co-operation between the UAE and the world. Jafza has representatives, partners, and dedicated teams based in the UAE and overseas to target companies in developed as well as emerging economies across the world that are looking to expand their horizons. We continuously work closely with business councils and government institutions in different international markets, as well as Dubai-based organizations, on joint projects, road shows, and seminars to target various sectors to stimulate investments.</p><h4>What key projects do you currently have in the pipeline?</h4><p>The development of the Jafza South Zone has been dramatic since 2003, with its world-class warehouses and other amenities. We are still working on expanding and adding more facilities to provide a better value proposition for our customers. Under construction is the ambitious $600 million convention center complex, which will be equipped with exhibition halls, an auditorium, banquet hall, meeting and conference rooms, a hotel, world-class recreational and retail provisions, and many other business-friendly facilities.</p><h4>The Dubai government has announced a commitment to the development of sustainable business operations. How is Jafza contributing to sustainable development?</h4><p>We are certainly seeing a shift toward sustainability across industries and businesses in the UAE. Jafza on is increasingly focused on sustainability. It is now mandatory for all developments to follow Trakhees' green building standards in the free zone, and Trakhees' EHS rules are part of Jafza's standard contract documents. With regards to its new customer projects, Jafza is fully committed to incorporate sustainability features that fully comply with the US Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED rating system. Our subsidiary is Gazeley, a global provider of sustainable logistics space. The company has recently delivered a 65,000 sqm state-of-the-art and environmentally efficient logistics facility to CEVA Logistics, one of the world's leading supply chain management companies in Jafza. The facility has achieved LEED Gold certification, and is the first project in the UAE to gain this recognition. Jafza actively manages utility usage to ensure a minimal impact on the environment. It is also mandatory for the service providers to ensure that waste (paper, plastics, cans, etc) is reduced and recycled. We have introduced a CSR policy manual in Jafza that ties in with the company's policy of integrating CSR into its overall business model and honoring its social and environmental obligations.</p><h4>What was your experience like during the global liquidity crisis, and what lessons were learned during that period?</h4><p>There were definitely lessons learned during the crisis. Customers sought more value during the crisis for their investment, and we continued to build on our customer-centric model to deliver that—whether through infrastructure, more commercial options, flexible terms for building, value-added products, or services. Our agility and customer focus during the downturn has been the key reason that has kept Jafza growing since 2009, in both customer base and revenues. I believe that investor confidence in the UAE is returning. Dubai is a reliable business hub and despite everything, the Emirate has maintained its popularity as a business destination. The UAE economy has bounced back from a slowdown and is on track to grow 4.5% in 2012, driven by the oil and non-oil sectors.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the mining sector in Colombia?<br></h4><p>Mining offers wonderful opportunities because it has been underdeveloped for the last 20 years as a result of security issues. In terms of mining, the country is like Peru 20 years ago, or Chile 30 or 40 years ago. We have much higher prices in certain commodities, and the technologies and techniques we use are designed with the environment in mind. The deposits that we have in Colombia include nickel, copper, gold, and diamonds. The potential is there. We have the entrepreneurship and the management skills to succeed in the sector. The Colombian workforce is very fast at training people, and Colombians are very hard workers, so we have what we need here. The big challenges are the government and its institutions. The National Mining Agency (ANM) and the Environmental Ministry understand that you need very clean processes. For us, that means we need to know the requirements at every stage of the process. I'm referring here to exploration, construction, and production. But we are probably eating the pie before we cook it, and we need to be more careful about that. We need to generate the right signals in order to develop projects that can generate both royalties and high employment rates for the country and consolidate the “new Colombia." It is important to generate employment and possibilities outside of urban areas, and the best way to promote that is with mining. This is because mining is a sector that generates infrastructure, is highly intensive in developing suppliers, and pays higher wages than other sectors. All of that can only happen if we understand that Colombia needs to develop mines, so we need to explore and we need to be able to construct mines to the highest specifications in the world. For that, we need to have a clear framework and then translate that into production. If we do not accomplish this now, the exploration later on will be very frustrating, and we will miss the window of opportunity.</p><h4>Ashmont Resources recently expressed interest in acquiring American Gold Mines. What is the strategy behind this decision?</h4><p>The deal has not been finalized yet; we are in the process of due diligence. What I can tell you is that in Colombia there are a lot of artisanal workers, and there are a lot of products that have been underdeveloped because of idiosyncrasies in production—people have the wrong ideas about production, engineering, and design. If you go into those areas with fresh eyes, you're adding more knowledge. At Ashmont Exploration we are mainly focused on geology as well as social and environmental challenges. As a private company we can move very quickly, and I think that is our big advantage—we see opportunities and we go for them.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the El Alacran and Santa Cruz projects?</h4><p>El Alacran is a copper-gold deposit, and it is a project that is moving forward very fast. We are in the second phase of the drilling campaign right now, and we expect to move to pre-feasability in 2013 and then to feasibility by the end of the year. It is a fantastic deposit in terms of the geology and geometry of the body. In terms of infrastructure, because it has been developed by Cerro Matoso, it is in a mining district, so it is among pro-mining communities. My personal challenge is that El Alacran is one of the first of a new generation of professional mines in Colombia. Although it is not a huge mine, more second tier, it has access to infrastructure, which is not very common in the Colombian mining sector. Overall, we are very happy about the results we have obtained so far. We feel comfortable moving forward, and I think we are addressing the major issues. The team at Ashmont tries to foresee problems before they arise, and are moving forward in the social and environmental area at a higher standard than what is required by the government, which gives us a lead in that respect.</p><div class="quote">“We are going to move forward in both production and greenfield exploration."</div><h4>How important are your relations with the community?</h4><p>I think that, as in any country, you need to maintain good relations not only with the ministry, but also with the community. We have successfully built that, and for us it is very important, not only because the mining code is being written right now, but also because it is important for us as Colombians to share experiences and give advice on what communities can do better, and what they should not be doing. I am very active in participating in the Mining Chamber to share my point of view.</p><h4>How can Colombia best take full advantage of its mining resources?</h4><p>The first thing that the government has to do is integrate agencies and take the leadership to determine the procedures for the sector. What you need as an investor and as a developer of projects is to have clear rules, because then you can plan and invest. I think that the government has to be very strong, being able to take decisions and move this locomotive of change. The government can't think that only the major companies can develop exploration. The world is composed of junior companies that explore and are more flexible than the majors. Infrastructure in mining is not that important, because if you have a clear set of rules, and you have a deposit that is big enough, you can build the infrastructure. You can also build a public-private partnership (PPP), and make an agreement with the government where it, for example, puts in $400 million and you put in $200 million and make it work. The opportunities create themselves if you build the right framework.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for Ashmont Resources in Colombia, and for the mining sector in general?</h4><p>For Ashmont Resources, we want to consolidate as an exploration company in Colombia. I want to be a big inspirational company in Colombia, and we are going to move forward in both production and greenfield exploration. In Colombia 90% of the territory is unexplored, and we are going to invest a lot in geophysics and become the top exploration company in the country. As for the mining sector, we are at a crossroads. If we do things right, Colombia will become a very strong mining country with a lot of opportunities. You have to understand that what we know about gold in Colombia is what the Spanish knew. We have not produced new knowledge in 300 years, so you can imagine the opportunities that we have here. In terms of location, we have been trying to build a very good port on the Pacific that will allow us to export any kind of metal you can imagine. The opportunities in the sector are just unbelievable. It is a sector that is more intensive in infrastructure and human resources than oil, for example. If you manage to put them together, security will improve, unemployment will decrease, foreign investment will increase, and royalties will increase. Overall, Colombia will be richer.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main challenges has the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) faced since its establishment?</h4><p>We experienced several challenges while laying the foundations of UNASUR, including the drafting of a treaty to be approved by every country, structuring a budget, and building a network of officials. These were the first steps of a very ambitious political project shaped in the style of the EU—the concept of establishing UNASUR was based on the creation of a union that would include every South American country. It was very important for us to keep in mind this initial goal and the ideas developed by the leaders of the region almost eight years ago. In fact, I would like to mention that our previous General Secretary and former President of Argentina Néstor Kirchner contributed heavily to the organization. In general, 2012 will be a year in which we focus on establishing agendas, working committees, and economic and social priorities for the organization and region as a whole.</p><h4>How does UNASUR complement other regional treaties and processes such as the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) and Organization of American States (OAS)?</h4><p>UNASUR was born at a different political conjuncture, and organizations such as the Common Southern Market (MERCOSUR) and the Andean Community primarily deal with the commercial and trading union of the states. In this regard, UNASUR aims to summarize the political and social union of the South American states, something that was already in the minds of our ancestors, such as General Simón Bolí­var. I am confident that over the next few years the organization will take decisive steps toward handling issues of defense, economy and finance, infrastructure, energy and health for the social union of South American states. I believe that this is what makes us unique and able to perfectly complement other organizations such as CELAC, which includes all Latin American and Caribbean countries.</p><div class="quote">“Ecuador has positively contributed to the establishment of UNASUR, especially during its term as president from 2009 to 2010."</div><h4>What has been Ecuador's main contribution to UNASUR?</h4><p>Ecuador has positively contributed to the establishment of UNASUR, especially during its term as president from 2009 to 2010, when Ecuador importantly contributed to institutional strengthening and the promotion of a constituency treaty that was approved at the regional level. Ecuador set a very positive example in terms leadership at all levels of the organization, especially when the region was affected by problems in locations such as Venezuela, Colombia, and Haiti. Ecuador focused its efforts on making our dream possible, and I believe the organization took a vital turn after Ecuador's presidency. To demonstrate the country's leadership and key role in the development of the organization, UNASUR's headquarters are currently located in Quito.</p><h4>What are the strengths of UNASUR in the current international political context?</h4><p>Our region has already gone through all the stages of development; we have learned from the past as well as our own experiences. Regardless of the differences in the region, we can say that we have achieved political maturity, and all the states are working toward the development of a stronger union of countries. At the same time, we have achieved a very important degree of recognition at the international level, thanks in part to our transparency in fields such as defense.</p><h4>What is the state of development of the economic and financial union in the region and the establishment of the Bank of the South?</h4><p>Due to the global recession, regional political leaders called for the unification of economic positions in order to preserve the interests of the continent, starting with foreign exchange reserve management, which has enabled the region to raise more than $750 billion in foreign exchange reserves. Regarding the Bank of the South, though it does not belong to the institutional body of the organization, it will be a key element to further promote the economic and financial union of South America, and we expect that it will begin operating in 2013.</p><h4>What are UNASUR's greatest achievements since it came into operation one year ago?</h4><p>Over the last year, we have established several committees regarding defense, drugs, health care, society, economy, infrastructure, energy, education, and technology. The institutionalization of the organization and its committees is one of the main achievements of UNASUR. These committees are formed by ministers from relevant portfolios, which facilitates the implementation of the measures agreed upon at the international level. Personally, I believe that the South American Council of Defense is UNASUR's greatest achievement thus far; its establishment has contributed to the development of many common and joint strategies in a field where South America previously lacked unity. I think that it is important to mention the South American Council of Infrastructure Planning, an organization that has enabled the region to prioritize infrastructure projects that will boost development and integration. We also need to strengthen our work regarding the very important issue of poverty, because 30 million South American people still live in dire conditions. However, we have achieved a lot and the future is brighter for South America.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What might be regarded as Azerbaijan's most significant achievement during the period starting from independence in 1991 until 2003 when you became the President?<br></h4><p>In 2011, the Azerbaijani people are commemorating the 20th anniversary of their national independence. The last 20 years represent an important milestone in Azerbaijan's history. During this time, Azerbaijan achieved all the fundamental domestic and foreign tasks it faced. The state became a fully fledged member of world politics as an actor—equal in rights and took its deserved place in the system of international affairs. Today, we can say with confidence that, over the course of the last 20 years, we have succeeded in building a modern, strong, vibrantly developing, democratic country ruled by laws that rely upon its interests and international law and pursues a policy of independence. I think that this is the biggest achievement of our people.</p><p>However, the process of building a nation state in Azerbaijan and creating civil relations with the international community has not been as smooth as it would appear today. Our independence had been seriously undermined by a number of factors, which included the aggression of neighboring Armenia and its occupation of parts of our sovereign territory, the internal struggle for supremacy, and the resultant anarchy and civil disobedience, which at that time increased the threat of civil war.</p><p>The social life of the people suffered greatly due to the country's then economic decline. Inflation reached a critical point. Individual incomes dropped by more than three times and wages by 5.7 times. It was only on the return of the national leader of the Azerbaijani people, Heydar Aliyev in 1993, that it became possible to halt these economic problems, and focus our attention on re-building the state.</p><p>Azerbaijan entered into a period of stability, and the national development that laid the foundations of our statehood started in 1995. The main directions of state policies pursued until 2003 were to establish public and political stability, build a democratic state ruled by law, create a liberal economy, implement new oil strategies, realize the successful integration of Azerbaijan into the international community, ensure the restoration of territorial integrity, and strengthen national independence and solidarity. Certainly, during those years, Azerbaijan was able to overcome the wall of information blockade and represent itself internationally. By focusing on the decisive importance of the national economy and of independent development, the signing of the first major oil contract—known as the “Contract of the Century"—and the implementation of global transnational projects, such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline and the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum (BTE) gas pipeline, have paved the way for the future dynamic development of Azerbaijan. During 1995-2003, GDP grew by 90%, state budget revenues trebled, the country's foreign currency reserves rose 85 times, while average monthly salaries grew five fold. The volume of investments made into the national economy exceeded $20 billion. These successful changes in the country's economy have been decisive and have permitted Azerbaijan to move forward with the opportunity to further develop its  future aims and plans.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the results of your policies to obtain serious progress in the field of economic development following your election as President in 2003?</h4><p>Many important changes took place in the global political system at the start of the third millennium. New priorities have been established for our activities in global politics. Humanity has stepped forward into a new information era. This era and its realities require a more balanced, pragmatic, and flexible policy for newly independent nations such as our own. For this objective, real potential and resources had to be defined accordingly and used in a distinct way. The experience of several resource-rich countries demonstrates that work only yields results if you have a substantiated course of strategic development.</p><p>As a result of the implementation of the massive energy projects in the coming years, a large amount of oil revenues will flow into the country. Therefore, we will focus our attention on the resolution of social and economic issues. First of all, it is a priority to diversify the economy, forge the competitive potential of the non-oil sector, create a modern social and economic infrastructure, and reduce the drastic difference between the capital and the regions by paying particular attention to regional development to solve the social problems of the population. For this purpose, over 2003-2004, two important documents—the State Program for Social and Economic Development of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the First State Program for the Social and Economic Development of the Regions for 2004-2008—were adopted. Furthermore, special programs and projects have been approved for sustainable development in each specific field.</p><p>Very important work has been carried out in Azerbaijan over the last seven years in terms of modernizing the country, liberalizing the economy, and making investments in fields that may potentially bring large returns in the future. These efforts have been noted in particular by all prestigious international ratings and monitoring organizations. During recent years, Azerbaijan has been a leading country in the world due to its pace of social and economic development. During 2004-2010, GDP and industrial production increased three times. The number of poor people fell by a factor of five and dropped to 9.1%. The transport and public utilities infrastructure has been largely renovated across the country, and this work continues.</p><p>Large-scale foreign economic activities are being implemented to ensure Azerbaijan's business community has access to the international marketplace. Long-term loans and favorable subsidies have been allocated for the development of entrepreneurship inside the country.</p><p>I would like to note in particular that the economic crisis that started in 2009 created serious consequences for the economies of many countries, deepening trends of economic decline and halting the implementation of social and other programs. However, the implementation of all projects envisaged in Azerbaijan has continued, and economic growth stood  at 9%.</p><p>Azerbaijan has made tremendous steps to attract investments. We hold one of the leading positions in the CIS region in  terms of volume of foreign investments per capita. Over the last several years, national investments have exceeded foreign investments. Taking into account 2011, the volume of investments made into the national economy will surpass $80 billion. In 2010 alone, $16 billion was invested into our economy.</p><p>In 2011, the state budget of Azerbaijan surpassed $20 billion. By comparison, the state budget in 2003 was equal to only $1.2 billion. Our budget for the current year will be social- and investment-oriented again. Social issues are being successfully solved in the country. Wages and pensions are regularly raised, while large funds are being allocated to create social infrastructure. This is already the second consecutive year that the development of the non-oil sector has dominated the performance indicators of the oil sector. This domination reached 9.8% during the current year. Over the first 4 months of 2011, the average monthly salary increased by 13% and reached AZN350. Today, the average level of pensions constitutes 40% of average wages. Over the course of recent years, over 2,000 schools, hundreds of medical centers, 31 Olympic sport compounds, and many cultural centers were built in Azerbaijan. At the same time, modern cities are being created to improve the living conditions of almost 1 million refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Their social problems are being actively solved by the government.</p><p>Azerbaijan is a leading country in the region due to its economic potential. The general share of our country in the South Caucasus economy reached 75%. Having completed its period of economic transition, Azerbaijan has become a country with a stable economy. The high assessment given by international financial institutions to the economic reforms implemented proves my arguments. The Doing Business 2009 Report produced by the World Bank and International Financial Corporation declared Azerbaijan the top reformer country in the field of improving the business environment. Azerbaijan is also the leader among CIS countries in the Global Competitiveness Report prepared by the World Economic Forum for 2010-2011.</p><h4>Azerbaijan's important oil and gas industries have become the center of attention of the international community. What is being done by the government of Azerbaijan to direct revenues to the comprehensive development of the real economy?</h4><p>In fact, the rich natural resources of Azerbaijan have been in the limelight of different states and power centers in all periods of time. Having gained its state independence near the end of the 21st century, and following the signature of the “Contract of the Century" in 1994, this wealth started to serve Azerbaijan's national interests.</p><p>One cannot claim to be wealthy due to natural resources alone. It is a very difficult issue to utilize these resources, produce oil and gas, define its free export routes, and create the relevant infrastructure. It is not hard to perceive the difficulty in implementing giant energy projects for the country when it was involved in conflict due to the military aggression of Armenia, facing the resistance of powerful circles and not having its own financial resources. However, as a result of the firmness, wisdom, and well-balanced pragmatic policy of Heydar Aliyev and the efforts of our partners, it became possible to eliminate all difficulties, attract billions of dollars to Azerbaijan, and implement important transnational projects that would have seemed an illusion in the past.</p><p>Currently, Azerbaijan exports 1 million barrels of oil per day. In 2010, over 50 million tons of crude oil were exported to the world's markets. This level will be maintained in 2011. At the same time, Azerbaijan's proven gas reserves have passed 2.2 trillion cubic meters, while the general potential is estimated to be 5 trillion cubic meters. In order to bring energy resources to world markets, Azerbaijan has paid much attention to diversification issues by creating its infrastructure in line with modern standards. The country currently has seven export pipelines in various directions. Our important contribution ensures the energy security of not only the region, but also Europe. We intend to gain access to new markets to realize our country's rich gas potential and strengthen our position in traditional markets. Depending on the results of future talks, we can increase the export level of our energy resources in any direction.</p><p>In addition to all of these achievements, the rational use of oil and gas revenues and transparency in this field hold significant importance for Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and oil-generated revenues are accumulated in the State Oil Fund, which is audited internationally. Resources from this Fund are spent transparently following the approval of Parliament.</p><p>Oil-generated revenues are used to form the state budget and fund various programs. For the time being, bringing oil production to 1 million bbl/d ensures the influx of financial means into the national economy for the resolution of social and economic issues. At the same time, we are already thinking about the future generations. Today, foreign currency reserves totaling $35 billion have been accumulated in Azerbaijan. Despite our large oil and gas reserves and vast revenues, we wish to see sustainable development that is not dependent on oil prices or production levels. In the years to come, our foreign currency reserves will increase as the development of the non-oil sector will increase and budget payments from other fields will  accumulate also.</p><h4>What level of importance does the education system have in your plans to upgrade and diversify Azerbaijan's economy?</h4><p>We know that natural resources are not eternal, and they will exhaust over time. Natural resources represent a tool to develop other sectors of the economy, create both intellectual and scientific potential in line with the requirements of the contemporary period, and ensure sustainable development. Therefore, converting black gold into human capital is not simply a slogan. It is a reality. The role played by education in forming human capital of high intellectual abilities and establishing a strong economy is more topical than ever.</p><p>Today, a modern and effective educational system is being created to develop human potential in line with the requirements of an information and knowledge-based society and the economy of a developing country. Also, the development of Azerbaijani science by strengthening the activities of the National Academy of Sciences and its logistical basis are priority issues. Our goal is to link scientific development with the general pace of national development and to create a harmony between science, higher education, and the economy.</p><p>As a result of the work done, Azerbaijan was named as the country with the fastest progress in the field of human development for 2005-2010 in the UN's Human Development Report 2010. Our country was added to the list of the fastest developing countries.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the potential of ICT to act as a driving force for economic development for Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In the contemporary period, ICT is very popular in all fields of life, and has become an integral part of public and economic processes. ICT is regarded as the most promising segment of the Azerbaijani economy. The National Strategy of Information and Communication Technologies for 2003-2012 and the First State Program for 2005-2008 were adopted in Azerbaijan in 2003. During this period, we created a free and competitive environment in the ICT market, attracted investments to this field, developed a legislative basis, modernized telecommunication infrastructure, and started to widely use the latest  in technology.</p><p>At present, the development pace of the ICT sector in the country surpasses general world indicators by several times. The report on the Global Development of Information Technologies for 2008-2009 prepared by the World Economic Forum indicates that Azerbaijan is moving ahead of several leading countries in its development of ICT and holds the leading position among CIS states.</p><p>Today, Azerbaijan has become the region's ICT hub, and the possibilities of the internet are expanding rapidly. According to the latest statistical data, the national internet penetration rate is 50%. If, several years ago, one computer was available for every 1,000 people in Azerbaijan, today the proportion goes to one computer per 15 persons. Azerbaijan is also becoming a country with a space industry. Azerbaijan's first telecommunications satellite will be launched in 2012.</p><p>Taking into account the geographical  location of Azerbaijan and the development level of our national economy, we think that we have all the opportunities for the ICT sector to become the second most profitable field after the oil and gas sector in the near future.</p><h4>Your Excellency declared 2011 as the “Year of Tourism." What does your country intend to obtain by paying so much attention to the tourism potential?</h4><p>In general, we have the intention to fully develop all promising fields of life in Azerbaijan. Our country has quite a large and attractive tourism potential. On the one hand, Azerbaijan has nine climatic zones, beautiful and picturesque nature, rich flora and fauna, cultural heritage, historical monuments. On the other hand the large-scale measures undertaken in recent years to ensure rapid social and economic development have renovated all fields of public life and created an infrastructure of services, transport, communications, and public utilities that make conditions favorable for tourism to become an economic priority. The State Program on the Development of Tourism for 2010-2014 is being implemented in Azerbaijan. Our main objective is to bring the national tourism sector in line with world standards by 2014. In the light of all these tasks, 2011 was declared the “Year of Tourism" in Azerbaijan.</p><p>Modern hotels are being opened in large cities of the country to receive foreign guests. The system of tourism services is forming rapidly in all the regions. Almost 100 hotels were operational in 2003. However, their numbers exceeded 500 in 2010. For the time being, the construction of 35 new hotels is underway. By the end of 2011, six five-star hotels will be commissioned. The world-class Shahdag Winter-Summer Tourism Complex is of particular importance, being among the largest projects in the field of tourism.</p><p>Of course, the state allocates substantial funds to help shape the modern tourism infrastructure. However, hotels are constructed by the private sector. This means that there is much confidence in the development of Azerbaijan, which makes it possible to spend hundreds of millions in this economic field. Investors have confidence that these investments will make good returns.</p><p>Azerbaijan won the Eurovision Song Contest in 2011 and obtained the right to host this event in 2012. In 2012, we expect a large number of tourists to come, and therefore we have already started to undertake the relevant measures to create convenient conditions to stage this event as well as to accommodate the guests that will arrive and ensure their safety. There is no doubt that we will fulfill all our obligations entirely in appropriately organizing this major event.</p><h4>One-fifth of Azerbaijan's territory remains under occupation, and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict remains an issue of nationwide importance. What opportunities do you see in resolving this conflict and restoring Azerbaijan's territorial integrity?</h4><p>The resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani, Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is the main problem and the most painful issue for our country. Despite all our efforts, this conflict has not been resolved so far.</p><p>Currently, Armenia and the Armenian lobby put forward their groundless claims related to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and attempt to mislead the international community. In fact, it has been internationally recognized that the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan has been violated. Over 1 million people have been expelled from their native lands. The Azerbaijanis have been subjected to an ethnic cleansing policy. Our historical and cultural monuments have been destroyed in the occupied territories. All our tangible wealth has been plundered. As a result of the massacre committed in Khojaly in 1992, 613 Azerbaijanis were brutally killed. Hundreds of people were taken hostage. The fate of many of them remains unknown to us.</p><p>The UN Security Council adopted four resolutions demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of troops from the occupied territories and the return of civilians to their lands. These resolutions have not been fulfilled as yet. The decisions and resolutions of the OSCE, the European Parliament, the Council of Europe, the Organization of Islamic Conference, and other international organizations have not been fulfilled by Armenia. Fact-finding missions from the OSCE visited the occupied territories twice. It proved the illegal settlement policy of Armenia implemented in the occupied lands was contrary to international legal norms.</p><p>Dealing with the settlement of the conflict since 1992, the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs' efforts have appeared futile due to the non-constructive position of Armenia. Every time there is a mood of getting closer to resolving the conflict, significant events occur in Armenia, such as the ousting of the president from power, or the assassination of the prime minister in the Parliament building, or the retreat by leaders from previously agreed positions in an attempt to violate the negotiations process. We think that the international community should be more active in exercising pressure on Armenia to deter it from such a destructive position. It is the only way out.</p><p>Nagorno-Karabakh is one of Azerbaijan's ancient lands. Azerbaijanis have always lived in these territories. All historical monuments and toponyms belong to Azerbaijan. It is an integral part of our history and culture. The Armenians moved into these territories at a later period. Now they wish to create a second Armenian state upon Azerbaijan's historical lands. However, neither Azerbaijan nor the international community will allow this to happen.</p><p>We positively accepted the joint statement of leaders of the countries co-chairing the OSCE Minsk Group released on May 26, 2011. Azerbaijan strives for the quick resolution of the conflict. According to the Helsinki Final Act, there is no contradiction between the principles of territorial integrity and the right of self-determination. The right of self-determination can be realized within the framework of the principle of territorial integrity, and it is the only possible way for conflict resolution to come about.</p><p>Our principal position in relation to the Armenian-Azerbaijani, Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is to restore the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and make possible the return of our citizens to their native lands. Only after these steps can peace and cooperation be created in the region, and all sides of this issue can justly benefit from this development. Azerbaijan will never agree to the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh and its attachment to Armenia, and will not let it happen.</p><p>I would also like to point out that time is not in Armenia's favor. Over the last 20 years, Armenia has been isolated from all regional projects. Its economy is in full decline. The population is not tolerating the tense social conditions any longer and people are leaving the country. The difference between Azerbaijan and Armenia is increasing significantly. The military budget of Azerbaijan has already surpassed the full state budget of Armenia. The leaders of Armenia and the Armenian lobby should properly assess the current realities and understand that the international community will never recognize the outcomes of occupation, and this conflict will be resolved sooner or later.</p><h4>How can you assess the position of Azerbaijan as a regional and international economic and political power over the long term?</h4><p>We are very optimistic about the future. After 1993, Azerbaijan became a fully independent, self-reliant, and modern country with a sustainable economy and a national and civil unity that has stepped firmly towards democracy and is integrating successfully into the international community as well as acting as a leader in the South Caucasus region. In the years to come, we are resolved to make further achievements and participate more actively in regional and world politics in order to foster mutual cooperation, confidence, security, peace, and prosperity.</p><p>Relying upon the successes and potential opportunities gained so far, I can say that Azerbaijan has a very brilliant future ahead of it, and we will use all possible means to reach this target.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Azerbaijan's relationship with the EU, and what support has the EU offered to Azerbaijan's economic development?<br></h4><p>Azerbaijan has always been an active participant in the Euro-integration process. Our partnership with the EU has undergone a transformation from a predominantly assistance-based to a mutually beneficial interaction that reflects the interests of everyone. It is vital that the cooperation between Azerbaijan and the EU is built on the basis of efficiency, equal partnership, mutual understanding, and respect. Azerbaijan is the main trading partner of the EU in the region and we expect to dramatically expand our non-oil sector in the years ahead. Therefore, our relations should cover other fields such as education, research and science, transport, agriculture, and security. We launched negotiations on the EU-Azerbaijan Association Agreement under the Eastern Partnership initiative (EaP) in 2010, and this is set to replace the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) by strengthening EU-Azerbaijan relations and helping to move the reform and approximation process in Azerbaijan forward, thus contributing to gradual economic integration and a deepening of political cooperation.</p><h4>How has Azerbaijan formulated its foreign policy within the Caucasus region to best ensure regional cooperation and trade?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is interested in developing mutually beneficial economic and trade relations with all states, and particularly with the countries of the Caucasus region. Our primary goal is to ensure sustainable economic development through diversification of the economy and further development of the non-oil sector, as well as promoting regional cooperation. Our country has no economic relations with Armenia, the armed forces of which still occupy almost 20% of Azerbaijan's territory. This factor negatively impacts comprehensive cooperation within the region and in fact leaves Armenia outside of the main regional projects. The official position of the Azerbaijani government is that Armenian forces should withdraw from the occupied territories. In that case, the door of economic cooperation and bilateral relations would open between the two states. At the same time, Azerbaijan has strong economic ties with all the other countries of the region, and those relations continue to develop as year-on-year bilateral trade turnover grows. Our country has become a leader in economic performance in the south Caucasus and is one of the fastest developing economies on the world stage. Azerbaijan also actively cooperates with the countries of the region on a multilateral basis in the framework of such regional organizations as the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and other initiatives in order to be involved in and benefit from the projects of a regional nature in various fields.</p><h4>How is Azerbaijan working with its neighbors to resolve long-standing territorial issues in the Caspian Sea?</h4><p>Azerbaijan attaches great importance to discussions toward the regulation of traditional economic activity in the appropriate sectors formed as a result of established practice in the Caspian Sea. As a result of both multilateral and bilateral negotiations, we have signed agreements with Kazakhstan and Russia on seabed delimitation in the Caspian Sea. These agreements fixed the delimitation of the Caspian seabed on the basis of the median line principle and launched a new stage of negotiation processes by creating a legal base. At present, works within a Special Working Group on drafting the convention on the legal status of the Caspian Sea and bilateral negotiations with Turkmenistan and Iran on the delimitation of the seabed in the Caspian Sea are underway. We hope that the delimitation issues in the Caspian Sea will find their legal settlement within the framework of the friendly and cooperative relations that we have with our coastal Caspian neighbors.</p><h4>What action is your Ministry taking to ensure Azerbaijan's rights in the Nagorno-Karabakh region?</h4><p>The Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan and seven adjacent regions surrounding it have been under the occupation of the Armenian Armed Forces for 20 years. Through the relevant resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council, the international community has called for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from Azerbaijan's territories. Negotiations on the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict continue under the mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group after 17 years. I have had several meetings with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia in 2010, mediated by my Russian colleague, Mr. Sergey Lavrov. Besides that, we hold regular contacts with the co-chairs of the Minsk Group. Thus far, Azerbaijan and Armenia have been able to iron out some differences. Nevertheless, certain important elements still remain to be agreed on by both sides. We continue to work on basic principles, based on which a comprehensive peace agreement should be signed. Most recently, the leaders of the Russian Federation, US, and France have issued a joint statement reiterating that the current status-quo created as a result of the use of force is unacceptable and should be changed. Azerbaijan expects that the settlement of the conflict will provide for the withdrawal from the occupied territories, the return of Azerbaijani populations to their homes, the normalization of life, peaceful coexistence between Azerbaijanis and Armenians in the region, and the future political process of defining the self-rule status for both communities of the region within the territorial integrity framework of Azerbaijan. It is our firm belief that any solution to the conflict can be lasting only if it is based on the peaceful co-existence of the two communities. Within this basic framework of territorial integrity, Azerbaijan is ready to provide self-rule to the region through the equal participation of both the Armenian and Azerbaijani communities. This is widely recognized and supported by the international community. Despite all the difficulties stemming from discontinuity in the Armenian position, I still have hopes for a peaceful settlement to the conflict.</p><h4>As the diversification of the country's economy gathers pace, what can the Ministry of Foreign Affairs do to help foster FDI and support Azerbaijan's non-oil and gas exports?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has become a key investment destination in the region over the past years. In the last decade the total FDI stock in Azerbaijan has exceeded $25 billion, which is due to a number of factors, namely abundant mineral resources, a favorable location and climate, competitive cost of production, and friendly laws. Today, the government has defined its priority to diversify the economy, reduce the dependence on the oil and gas sector, and increase non-oil exports. Activities undertaken by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its diplomatic missions to foster FDI and support non-oil exports include creating Azerbaijani trade chambers in potential export market countries; implementing various export promotion activities in foreign countries; organizing fairs, business-forums and conferences for exporters; and creating a data system for export products and exporting companies and disseminating this information among the various stakeholders. We also organize introductory meetings for delegations of potential investors in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What is the country's relationship with NATO, and can we expect to see a continuation of the Partnership for Peace (PfP)?</h4><p>Integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures remains one of the strategic goals of Azerbaijan as envisioned in the National Security Concept. Azerbaijan was among the first countries to sign up to NATO's PfP program on May 4, 1994. We highly appreciate the firm adherence of the Alliance and its member states to the territorial integrity, independence, and sovereignty of Azerbaijan. Bilateral partnerships, in general, and our bilateral partnership with NATO in particular are no doubt successful. The principles and tools of bilateral partnership have helped us initiate major reforms in our defense and security sector, enhance interoperability, and contribute militarily to NATO-led military operations. In order to improve cooperation with NATO, Azerbaijan joined the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP) in May 2004. IPAP has proven itself to be an effective mechanism, allowing for a substantive political dialogue and intensive practical reform efforts. In the framework of the IPAP process, dozens of cooperative projects are carried out on a broad spectrum of issues, ranging from preparing military units for international operations up to environmental cooperation and public diplomacy. Deriving from the principle of the indivisibility of security in the Euro-Atlantic area, we sent our troops to Kosovo and Afghanistan, where our soldiers stand shoulder-to-shoulder with NATO member state military contingents. We offered Afghanistan a number of assistance projects in the education and training sphere. Azerbaijan and NATO further exchange information on counter-terrorism issues. We look forward to expanding this area of cooperation with NATO. We believe that the goal of achieving security in the Euro-Atlantic area should be of central importance both for the Allies and PfP Partners, and that the Euro-Atlantic partnership should remain distinct within the growing partnership network of NATO.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>We would like to preserve the positive experience we have built up over recent years in the common space that we share—the Caspian.<br></p><p>The President of Azerbaijan recently described relations between Russia and Azerbaijan as warm and friendly, between two strategic partners, and I fully agree with this assessment. We see the essence of these relations reflected in all different areas of cooperation—economy, security, and humanitarian. These close ties were exemplified by the assistance that Russia received from Azerbaijan during a recent natural disaster, when wildfires burned and destroyed many villages. Helping to put out fires in several areas, we thank the Azerbaijani government for its kindness and willingness to help.</p><p>Looking at the future I see bright prospects ahead. We have some very promising projects. The two states recently signed agreements on the joint use of the trans-border Samur River's water resources. It is common assets such as this that create the need for us to reflect on how to make best use of our resources.</p><p>Of course, energy cooperation is one of our important sectors, but it is not the only important area in our relations. In the future we look forward to energy summits between the two nations in order to set our respective clocks on all the various issues at hand, all the more so as we already have rapidly growing ties in some areas—our cooperation in the gas sector, for example. Cooperation in the oil sector and the electricity sector are also areas to which we give particular attention.</p><p>Regional issues are also always on the agenda, and we have discussed challenges extensively with Azerbaijan. We would like to preserve the positive experience we have built up over recent years in the common space that we share—the Caspian. I hope that we will have many opportunities ahead to deepen this cooperation.</p><p>Humanitarian cooperation is very important. A symbolic act took place in 2010 with the handover of icons confiscated during attempts to smuggle them into Azerbaijan. It is very good to see that this kind of cooperation between our law enforcement agencies is developing. This is a gesture of friendship and we appreciate it, of course.</p><p>I think we need to be very attentive when it comes to our economic interests. We need to realize that each side has its own interests, and these interests are always pragmatic in nature. This is not like in the humanitarian sector, where we focus on ideals, but is an area in which our aim is to earn money. This is normal. We need to measure our desires against our possibilities in this area. That is the first point.</p><p>Secondly, the President of Azerbaijan and I have both noted that our countries are big players in the energy sector and we have many common interests because we both produce and supply energy resources. We therefore need to reach agreements in this sector, and we need to cooperate. The agreement increasing gas purchases signed recently was precisely an example of this kind of cooperation.</p><p>Thirdly, there are various projects underway today. Russia's position is that we cannot and will not obstruct any projects. This would not be the right course of action at all. We simply need to identify the most promising cooperation areas and demonstrate the attraction of particular joint projects. As for future projects, let the most profitable projects—the projects of greatest interest to our partners—take the day. No one is imposing anything on anyone, but at the same time projects must demonstrate their economic rationality. I would say that this is the line we should base ourselves on in building up our future energy relations.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Since you took over the Ministry in 2008, what key reforms have you sought to implement at both the ministerial and national level?<br></h4><p>The Ministry of Economic Development plays a leading role in the implementation of state economic and social policy. We have a wide scope of responsibilities that include the development of various sectors of the economy, trade relations with foreign countries, investments, the development of entrepreneurship, the elimination of unfair competition and promotion of competition, as well as the protection of consumer rights. During the first years of independence, the economy was based almost entirely on petroleum revenues. These revenues were then redirected to develop the non-petroleum sector in order to encourage diversification. At present, the development of the non-petroleum sector forms the basis of Azerbaijan's economic policy. In 2010, the growth rate of the non—petroleum sector exceeded the overall economic growth rate of 7.9%. In the same year, the growth rate of the non-petroleum industry was 6.2%, while telecommunications grew by 29.7%, and goods transportation saw an increase of 3.1%. Additional growth rates in 2010 include 16.2% growth in the chemicals industry, two fold growth in equipment production, 44.6% growth in metallurgy, and 2.4% growth in food production.</p><p>Our government is also applying systematic and successive measures to further develop favorable business conditions to promote an entrepreneurial spirit, to attract investment to the non-petroleum sector, and to diversify exports. Our Ministry closely participates in the process of governmental credit supply to improve financial aid for new businesses in the non-petroleum sector. In 2010, we granted a total of AZN115 million to 1,430 entrepreneurs through the Ministry's Entrepreneurship Support Fund. The fund assigns AZN125 million of preferential credit to priority sectors of the economy. The Fund for the Motivation of Export and Investments in Azerbaijan (AZPROMO) was founded by the Ministry of Economic Development to promote investment and exports. The Azerbaijan Investment Company (AIC) was also founded to support foreign investments, provide loans to the non-petroleum sectors, and attract foreign and local entrepreneurs to the non-petroleum sector.</p><p>In 2010 alone, nearly 100 business forums and conferences were held in Azerbaijan to attract foreign investment and develop non-petroleum exports. Azerbaijani businessmen have also participated in business forums and business meetings organized both in Baku and overseas by AZPROMO, and established relations with foreign partners. We are currently working on opening trading houses in foreign countries to widen the possibilities of reaching overseas markets. The Ministry plays the lead role in coordinating government programs including poverty elimination, regional, social, and economic development, and food provision. With the successful results of these programs, our country can better develop its economy—the poverty level is decreasing year by year, new enterprises are being established, and new job opportunities are being formed. The standard of living is rising and the economic situation in the regions is improving.</p><h4>What measures are being taken to boost GDP growth in 2011 and over the medium term?</h4><p>During the global financial crisis in 2009, Azerbaijan's economy grew by 9.3%. There are then objective causes for the decrease of the growth rate in 2010. After signing the “Contract of the Century" in 1994, the large-scale exploitation of Azerbaijan's rich petroleum and gas deposits increased the export capacity of the country and dramatically increased the GDP growth rate. Oil and gas production is still largely carried out in accordance with the contract today. In the past two years, the growth of the petroleum sector was 14% in 2009, while in 2010 it accounted for just 1.8%. This shows that in 2010 economic development was mainly in the non-petroleum sector. We will be focusing on realizing infrastructure projects, further improving the business environment, and attracting investment into the non-petroleum sector. The government will be paying special attention to our industrialization policy, which supports the production of competitive goods, the implementation of new technologies, and extends access to the financial markets, and adapts product and service quality to international standards. It is also necessary to work towards perfecting our legislative foundations, as well as forming special economic zones and new industrial complexes. These measures will guarantee the dynamic development of our country.</p><h4>Which sectors will play the greatest role in the diversification of the economy?</h4><p>The ICT sector is a crucial part of the non-prime development program. It is not surprising then that President Ilham Aliyev has declared ICT the second priority sector after the petroleum industry. Secondly, strengthening the transit potential of our country has enormous importance in the development of the non-petroleum sector. The construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway, the re-construction of the Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA) highway, and the construction of the International Sea Trade Port are especially important. The new port, together with contributing to the development of transit possibilities, will lead to the strengthening of the position of our country in the region. Furthermore, important measures have been taken to stimulate the investment-innovation process and the implementation of ecologically safe technologies, which help to save energy and resources. The agrarian sector has enormous importance regarding our country's food security. Currently, our attention is focused mainly on the intensification of production volume expansion. There is also big potential for developing the tourism sector considering the history of the country, its geographical position, and favorable climatic conditions.</p><h4>What key sectors of the economy is your Ministry seeking to promote from an FDI perspective?</h4><p>The development of the non-oil and gas sector is the main priority to provide stable economic development. This sector has enormous potential due to the geographic position of the country, its climate conditions, natural resources, the formation of the infrastructure system, and a favorable business environment. In order to stimulate non-petroleum exports, our strategy is to stimulate export goods production, improve export infrastructure, perfect our quality control system, and develop education for export. Foreign investments also have an important role in the development of the economy. For this reason, the existence of favorable conditions for foreign investments is always on the agenda of the government. Measures to improve the investment environment in the country have increased the flow of foreign capital into our economy. Currently, government consent is not required for foreign companies in Azerbaijan and they enjoy full rights. Business registration procedures in Azerbaijan have been simplified, and rules for the regulation of entrepreneurship activities have been considerably liberalized, while export duties have been annulled, and the maximum limit of 15% for import duties has been determined. There are lots of possibilities for foreign investments in such non-petroleum sectors as machinery, construction, the chemical industry, metallurgy, electricity production, construction materials, light industry, the food industry, and tourism. There is also big potential for foreign investment in the production of ecologically safe agricultural goods.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the economy in 2011 and for the medium term?</h4><p>The stable development of the Azerbaijani economy is expected to continue in 2011, and according to forecasts, the growth rate of Azerbaijan's economy will come in at 3.8%. The non-petroleum sector's growth rate will again surpass the rate of the petroleum sector with, according to our predictions, a 7% growth rate.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Why was the State Oil Fund (SOFAZ) initially established?<br></h4><p>It was established December 29, 1999 by decree of the late President Heydar Aliyev. Its objective is to transform depletable resources like oil and gas into financial assets that will serve the future generations of Azerbaijanis. We have a few objectives that are interrelated, yet are important by themselves. One of the most important points is to accumulate and manage revenues from the oil and gas sector, to stabilize those revenues in order to provide macroeconomic stability, to provide for intergenerational equality, and to use some of those resources for the current generation. Since the fund was established, we have received $52 billion, and roughly half has been spent, while half of it has been saved. We're now managing about $27 billion. The majority of the money was transferred to the state budget, and the budget has used that money mainly for infrastructural investments.</p><h4>How do you expect to see the size of the funds under your management develop?</h4><p>SOFAZ's assets under management increased 20 times from $1.3 billion to $27.5 billion during the period 2005-2011. The forecast assets of SOFAZ for end-2011 are over $30 billion at an oil price of $90 per barrel.</p><h4>What sort of asset management strategies do you employ?</h4><p>When the fund was small, a conservative investment policy was applied and we mostly invested in fixed income instruments across the world, in three major currencies: the US dollar, euros, and pound sterling. We have a diversified portfolio of fixed income instruments, investing in sovereigns and corporates, but as the fund grows, we are now looking into riskier and more return-generating asset classes. Therefore, we hope to diversify into equities, private equity, and potentially into real estate.</p><h4>What split in terms of local and overseas assets does SOFAZ have?</h4><p>We invest only externally, not domestically. That being said, since we invest only half of the $52 billion, half of that money gets spent inside Azerbaijan in accordance with our annual expenditures. So the split between that and the stock that is being managed overseas is roughly 50-50.</p><h4>What are some of the major infrastructure projects you are involved in?</h4><p>The biggest portion of our annual expenditure budget is transferred to the state budget, and that money is used for roads, infrastructure, electricity supply, water supply, and so on. Apart from that, SOFAZ finances five different projects. The projects have to be significant and be of national and sometimes regional importance. One example is SOFAZ's financing of the Azerbaijani share of the BTC pipeline. Additionally, we're currently financing the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad. We've financed the construction of the Oğuz-Gabala water pipeline, and we're currently financing a water and irrigation system rehabilitation project. One of the most important projects we're engaged in is the construction of temporary settlements for refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the conflict area. Last, but certainly not least, is the financing of Azerbaijani scholarships abroad. We offer full scholarships covering all tuition and accommodation costs, the only requirement being to come back and live in Azerbaijan for five years. The current President put it very eloquently as “the transformation of black gold into human gold".</p><h4>How would you compare SOFAZ to other sovereign funds like the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA)?</h4><p>There are more than 30 sovereign wealth funds in the world. They recently came together and created an international forum of sovereign wealth funds. The inauguration of the forum actually happened here in Baku. It's a closed club of sovereign wealth funds where we discuss our problems and exchange ideas. The current members of the forum manage a total of $4 trillion. Of course, different funds are at different stages of development. Most start with conservative strategies and invest in low-risk fixed income instruments, but as they grow and as the fund's experience grows, they often branch out into riskier, more lucrative, and more diversified fields. SOFAZ is also going through that evolutionary process as it gets bigger. The thing is we are managing the wealth of our entire nation, and so we don't have the right or the luxury to be too experimental or risky with this money. Instead, we're learning from other sovereign wealth funds how to manage our assets and apply the best strategies.</p><h4>How closely do you work with the Central Bank of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We have a very good relationship not just with the Central Bank, but with all the relevant government agencies. SOFAZ is very important in terms of macroeconomic stability, and that's why we have a supervisory board that includes all the top government officials who ensure that everything goes smoothly in a macroeconomic sense.</p><h4>There are a number of important new oil and gas schemes that will be developed and implemented over the next five to 10 years. How are you planning to manage these new revenues, and will it require a modification of your strategies?</h4><p>Yes, by the end of 2011 we hope to be about $30 billion in size, and over the next 10-15 years we expect inflows of around $200 billion. At least half of this money will be spent on development, the other half being invested in the fund. Of course, with that amount of money we can't continue to apply the same conservative investment strategies. We will apply new strategies in line with our continuing growth. We currently employ about 100 people and we're building a new headquarters that uses all the latest technology available. Our employee numbers will grow and we'll continue investing in our people and training them. We already have a very comprehensive training program for our employees and we want to expand that further to become a truly modern investment house. We receive money from the oil and gas sector, yes, but apart from that we are a financial institution.</p><h4>What challenges do you see in Azerbaijan going forward?</h4><p>We don't operate domestically, but in general, as a former central banker, the financial sector in Azerbaijan is one of the most developed sectors in this country. There are good banks, and so forth. It's a very young economy, although it's developing very rapidly. That being said, I think the biggest challenge is the diversification of the non-oil sector. The oil and gas sector generates about 60% of GDP, but it only employs 1% of the labor force. It's very capital intensive. The country becomes richer, but distributing it is the problem. The only way to distribute that wealth is to provide jobs. The oil and gas sector can't provide those jobs. So to create jobs, the non-oil sector has to be developed. That's the most important long-term goal for Azerbaijan. The state decided to lay the groundwork in which private businesses and a strong private sector could develop and grow in Azerbaijan. For this purpose, the government's strategy for the last five years has been to create the best infrastructure possible. Five years ago we were importing electricity, now we're exporting it. Five years ago we were importing gas, now we're exporting it. Today there are no blackouts; the road network has been refurbished, not just in Baku, but also in the whole country. Now the aim is to create a business-friendly environment so that a private sector can flourish. I think that's a very good strategy.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since its foundation in 2006, how has the Azerbaijan Investment Company (AIC) assisted in the evolution of the non-oil sector in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>The Azerbaijan Investment Company is a state-owned equity fund established in March 2006 by Presidential decree. The sole purpose of the AIC is to provide termed equity injections into important green and brown field projects in the non-oil sector. Through this mandate, we are supporting the diversification of the Azerbaijani economy. The initial capital was provided by the State Oil Fund (SOFAZ). AIC is managed by a board of directors, the chairman of which is the Minister of Economic Development. In addition to making mandated investments, we also work to attract foreign investors who would like to establish a presence here. To give you an idea of our projects, we have invested in two projects together with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), including the Garadagh Cement Plant, which is the largest cement producer in Azerbaijan. AIC has a 10% holding, while a further 10% belongs to the EBRD and 70% belongs to Holcim, another global player. These proceeds are currently being invested into the development of a new facility that will allow production using the latest technology. The second project we have cooperated with the EBRD on was an investment in M-Pro, the largest dairy producer in Azerbaijan. AIC owns 20% of that company, while EBRD owns 10%. These capital injections are being spent on the construction of a new milk processing facility. These two projects represent our goal of importing new technologies and applying the best international practices. This will help to develop the local skill base—another crucial goal of this organization.</p><h4>How does AIC work to attract foreign investors specifically?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has become the most attractive country in the region due to its political, economic, and social stability. AIC cooperates with the Azerbaijan Export and Investment Promotion Foundation (AZPROMO), which acts as our front office, organizing bilateral business forums and exhibitions. When investing in a project it is important to attract investment partners that have experience and successful track records in managing similar facilities and businesses. In this case, we can award management contracts. The second option is to team up with investors on the development of a project and bring in management teams for fixed periods. Currently, one of the largest projects we are working on is the construction of the only modern shipbuilding and ship repair facility on the Caspian Sea. It is a project worth over $400 million, and we own a 25% stake while 65% belongs to the State Oil Company and 10% belongs to Singapore's Keppel Offshore and Marine Company. It's a large and reputable company that is experienced in managing ship repair and shipbuilding facilities globally. In addition to the equity investments, Keppel will be awarded the management contract for the next 25 years. Over the next 25 years that firm will gradually train local experts who will eventually take over the management of the facility. This is a typical operational mechanism for AIC. Azerbaijan needs such a shipbuilding facility, and we feel this investment will be crucial for the future of the economy.</p><h4>How geared toward promoting exports are your investments?</h4><p>One of our key targets is to promote businesses that will produce export or import replacement orientated products. To give an example, AIC participated in a project to develop the first salt production facility in Azerbaijan. Historically, the country had imported salt from Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey. We now have enough raw materials to refine and produce our own. To realize this project, we teamed up with the largest holding company in the region, Azersun Holding. The plant was commissioned in July 2010. This project serves as a great example of how we can replace imports by creating better quality local production.</p><h4>Is AIC looking to diversify its operations over the coming years?</h4><p>AIC is looking to become something of a fund of funds. We believe that by partnering with the private sector and international equity players, we can better allocate funding to various sectors and sub-sectors of the economy where it is needed the most. For this reason, one of our tasks is to establish funds in Azerbaijan that can invest both domestically and internationally. The country's reserves of $30 billion put us in a great position to begin such a journey. In that regard we have already begun making progress. In 2008, together with the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD), we established an equity fund in Azerbaijan: the Caspian International Investment Company (CIIC). AIC owns 24.1%, and 50% belongs to the IDB and ICD. The rest belongs to various Middle Eastern investors. The purpose of this fund is to take advantage of the many opportunities that are present in the domestic non-oil economy. Currently, three projects have been invested in by the CIIC, and great success has been achieved.</p><h4>What sectors do you believe offer the best opportunity for foreign investors in Azerbaijan going forward?</h4><p>I would like to highlight the agriculture sector as a key investment field over the coming years. Due to Azerbaijan's geographical location, it is possible to grow almost everything. Historically, we have been supplying our neighbors, including Russia and Kazakhstan, with fruit, vegetables, and meat. Now, we are taking it to an industrial level—and this is where the potential lies. Food processing is also another key investment sector, and AIC is interested in targeting this area. As a result, packaging is also going to be an important growth segment in the coming years. After that, I would like to highlight alternative energy as a growth sector. Taking into consideration that the State Agency for Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources was established recently, once its legal base is up and running, AIC and foreign investors will be able to take advantage of the environment to launch new projects in the renewable field. In addition, AIC is interested in recycling projects, including the recycling of tires, car batteries, and paper. Tourism is also an obvious choice, and we have recently been mandated to begin investing in the country's tourism infrastructure. The final sector I would like to highlight is logistics, which will also be a growth sector, attracting investment aimed at turning the country into a regional transport hub. Furthermore, the industrial production sector will always be interesting for AIC to consider.</p><h4>How did the global economic crisis impact Azerbaijan as an investment destination?</h4><p>The crisis made us more efficient in managing our economy. For this reason Azerbaijan was able to propel itself into a position as one of the top destinations for foreign investment. This is also boosted by its rich natural resource reserves that are great for local production. In addition, Azerbaijan's strong infrastructure and young population also helped it stave off the worst effects of the crisis, and are its greatest assets going forward.</p><h4>What is the next step to further encourage foreign investors to come to Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The government is keen to invest and encourage investment and provides all types of support. We are now thinking about establishing industrial parks based on best international practice. This will help SMEs to develop themselves very quickly and efficiently. The Ministry of Economic Development, based on the recommendations of the President, is planning several projects of this nature in various cities, where the government will provide utilities such as gas, water, and electricity, as well as prepare the sites, create administrative buildings, and install all the necessary infrastructure that enterprises will need to begin operating. This is the next phase of our development, and AIC will be investing in these as well going forward.</p><h4>What regulatory challenges remain to make Azerbaijan more attractive to foreign investment?</h4><p>Regulations and procedures are continuously changing. Many things have been tried in Azerbaijan, including incentives and tax exemptions, and it is all about waiting and watching how foreign companies respond. Feedback can then be assessed and changes can be made. I had previously mentioned alternative energy as a future growth sector, and the regulations surrounding this sector are still developing, and we are waiting anxiously to find out what the State Agency for Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources will offer in terms of incentives. I can highlight a recent development, whereby the government provided additional incentives to investors. Certain equipment being imported into Azerbaijan for agricultural purposes will be VAT and custom duties exempt. This incentive was enacted in March 2011 will continue to stimulate the sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Azerbaijan Export and Investment Promotion Foundation (AZPROMO) work to promote trade and investment in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>While targeting foreign investors and entrepreneurs, we aim at promoting Azerbaijan as an attractive investment destination. Some audiences are already quite knowledgeable about Azerbaijan and the opportunities it represents, while some do not know much about our young country. For this reason, we try to provide as much information as possible, including the history of the country. Azerbaijan has always been attractive because of its oil and gas resources. At the beginning of the 19th century Azerbaijan was delivering more than half of the oil produced in the world. This resulted in many inventions and innovations within the sector, including the first oil tanker and the first oil pipeline. As soon as Azerbaijan became independent it opened its doors to foreign investors. In 1994, the “Contract of the Century" was signed. Since then, oil giants such as BP, Chevron, Total, Statoil, and others made their first investments into the country. From that time, Azerbaijan started writing its present history, making the first steps as an independent state.</p><h4>How is the global perception of Azerbaijan changing?</h4><p>All the economic achievements in Azerbaijan are, obviously, being noticed by international financial organizations. In 2010 Standard &amp; Poor's improved the long-term credit rating of Azerbaijan to BBB-, and for the first time Azerbaijan was given Investment Grade status, according to Fitch Ratings. The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report for 2010/2011 ranked Azerbaijan first among CIS countries and 57th in the world. The World Bank's Doing Business Report 2009 also named Azerbaijan as the number one reformer in the world. This was achieved thanks to the reforms in such areas as starting business, registering property, protecting investors, and others. Essentially the report was highlighting the development of entrepreneurship in Azerbaijan. Just to give you a comparison, in 2008 we introduced the “single window" approach for registering legal entities in Azerbaijan. Before 2008, entrepreneurs required more than 70 days, almost three months, to register a company. After the introduction of the “single window", they require less than three days. In order to make Azerbaijan even more attractive for investors, be it foreign or local, as well as to further facilitate the development of entrepreneurship, a number of tax incentives have been applied. The introduction of simplified taxation has also supported the development of SMEs. Companies with a turnover not exceeding AZN150,000 a year pay 4% tax in the capital Baku and 2% in the other regions of Azerbaijan. Should their turnover exceed this amount they become VAT payers (18%).</p><p>After oil and gas, agriculture is one of the most significant sectors in the Azerbaijani economy. In order to further develop and support the agricultural sector, tax holidays and exemptions have been granted to entrepreneurs active in this sector, which again applies not just to local but also to foreign companies. Moreover, from March 2011, Azerbaijan introduced VAT and customs duty exemptions on equipment, machinery, as well as specified agricultural products imported into the country for further production and export purposes. In addition to that, subsidies are provided for local farmers to purchase fertilizers, fuel, seeds, as well as for machinery, rent, and leasing needs.</p><h4>What is your assessment of Azerbaijan's import/export profile?</h4><p>Despite an unfavorable 2010, trade turnover in Azerbaijan was about $28 billion. Azerbaijan exports far more than it imports, and the amount of total imports was $6.5 billion. The main import partners were the countries of Eastern Europe. Exports reached $21.3 billion, and the main destination of Azerbaijani products was the EU. The major exported products included oil and gas, petrochemicals, metals, agricultural products, and others.</p><h4>How much success is the country seeing in attracting FDI recently?</h4><p>From 1995 to 2010, out of a total $97 billion of investments made into the country, $54.5 billion were foreign investments. However, domestic investments increased as well totaling slightly more than $42 billion during the mentioned period. As to the sectoral breakdown, the non-oil sector of economy received the largest part of investments, amounting to $54.5 billion. In 2010 we attracted $17.3 billion, out of which $5.2 billion targeted the oil sector, whereas $12.1 billion targeted the non-oil sector, which accounts for the strategy of non-oil sector diversification.</p><h4>How is Azerbaijan's infrastructure developing to promote a healthy business environment?</h4><p>Many mega-projects are underway. One such project is the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad, which is also called the “Iron Silkway". After the completion of this project in 2012, Azerbaijan will turn into a logistic hub by restoring ancient trade routes that will connect Asia to Europe. Further developments in the oil and gas sector related infrastructure are also expected, and I cannot overstate the importance of such completed projects as the Baku-Novorossiysk, the Baku-Supsa pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas line, and certainly, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan line, which goes all the way from the Caspian to Turkey's Mediterranean coast. We have also managed to establish air connections to major European and Asian cities, and Azerbaijan has never been so well connected. Despite the relatively small territory of the country, we have five international airports. The biggest one is in Baku, and it is currently being enlarged. The great number of successful infrastructural projects implemented in Azerbaijan that I've mentioned are thanks to the strategic location of the country on the crossroads of Europe  and Asia.</p><h4>What growth sectors would you like to highlight to potential investors?</h4><p>Alternative energy is a fast emerging sector, especially after the announcement of 2010 as the “Year of Ecology". Many projects were launched over the course of that year by a state agency for alternative and renewable energy sources established in 2009. Solar energy will be promising business in the coming years, as Azerbaijan begins its own solar panel production. The Caspian coast is also a perfect source for wind energy, and pilot projects are being developed with the participation of foreign investors. The number of wind farms will be increased, and tariffs are being developed by the government. I am sure the subsidies will be provided, as showcased in many European countries.</p><p>Tourism is another important sector. We are learning from the experiences of many countries' well-known tourist destinations, such as our close neighbor Turkey. We have six international luxury brand hotels opening up in Baku in 2011: Hilton, Fairmont, Four Seasons, Marriot, Jumeirah, and Kempinski. Of course, we do not only aim at luxury tourism, as most tourists prefer budgetary spending. Therefore, a diversification of hotels is being carried out as well. The telecommunications sector is also developing. Soon, Azerbaijan will launch its first satellite. The Minister of Communications and Information Technologies has forecasted that by 2020-2025 the revenues from this sector would be higher than those of the oil and gas sector. We have five major mobile phone operators in Azerbaijan, among which the most recent to enter the market was Vodafone. More than half of the population is registered as an internet user. Online payments, registrations, taxation, and other e-services are being widely introduced as the sector is developing.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>The European Neighborhood and Partnership Action Plan was intended to promote Azerbaijan's transition to a market economy. To what extent has progress been made in this area?<br></h4><p>First and foremost, I wish to say that the 2006 Action Plan goes well beyond trade and commercial matters. It sets out the areas of cooperation and the benchmarks of success. It is a plan that tries to give a road map to Azerbaijan as to what the areas are we would like to work together on and what the benchmarks are to assess progress in this regard. In those terms, it touches upon political issues, including very sensitive ones such as Nagoro-Karabakh, progress on democratization, and fundamental freedoms besides trade and economic polices. In the economic sphere there has been a lot of progress. This country has seen an impressive evolution in only 20 years of independence. There is good macroeconomic stability and a stable currency. It ranked 38th regarding the favorable conditions for entrepreneurial activity in the World Bank and International Finance Corporation's Doing Business 2010 report. There is inflation, but it is limited, and there are strong revenues from fossil fuels. There are areas in which we invite Azerbaijan to make more progress. This basically pertains to the liberalization of the economy and public finance management and in the transparency of public expenditures. There was a World Bank sponsored Public Finance and Expenditure Accountability (PEFA) assessment in 2008, and the rating of Azerbaijan in terms of public finance management was variable. Some areas were not too bad and other areas needed to be improved. We are working closely with the Ministry of Finance to set up budgetary support and transparency of public finances on controls and on external audits to ensure that the whole basket of public finances that this country enjoys is invested in the best ways for the country. We believe it is in the interest of Azerbaijan, with all of the hydrocarbon generated revenues, to ensure that not only the incoming flows of money are transparent—and this is the case because Azerbaijan qualified for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) process—but also the outgoing flows. One important point in this regard is that revenues should now be used not just for physical infrastructure, but also to develop education and the overall human capital of the country. The country's development will need qualified engineers, doctors, and teachers to make full use of the new infrastructure, hospitals, and schools. The service sector will be in need to be developed to follow the progress of the country. In a nutshell, I personally believe that the impressive progress Azerbaijan has made in the “hardware", and which should be praised, should now be followed by the same investments in the “software".</p><h4>The EU Commissioner for Energy Günther Oettinger has called on Azerbaijan to take part in the Nabucco project “without delay". How significant is Azerbaijan to the EU and its energy needs?</h4><p>The EU has, for the time being, three main corridors of supplies of gas, i.e. Russia, Algeria, and Norway. We want to develop a fourth corridor, called the Southern Gas Corridor, and we have been working on this for a long time with Azerbaijan. It is clear that this is the key country for the development of this corridor for a number of reasons. The main one is that Azerbaijan is the first country that is able to supply new gas from the Caspian basin. The importance of this corridor is that it not only opens a new route, but it also brings new gas to European markets. Azerbaijan has committed itself for a number of years at the highest political level to actually make the Southern Corridor happen and to be the first supplier of gas coming from the Caspian basin. President Aliyev and President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso signed a joint declaration in January 2011, which made it very clear that Azerbaijan's commitment is not only to be the first supplier, but the enabler of the Southern Corridor. Azerbaijan wants to diversify its exports and reach new markets. Azerbaijan sells to Russia, Iran, Georgia, Turkey, and a little bit to Greece, but Azerbaijan wants to have a new stable, rules-based, predictable market and this market is the EU. Why would any producer deprive itself of the possibility to sell directly to a solvent market of half a billion consumers amongst the wealthiest in the world? Of course there are still some issues to be finalized as this is an ambitious project, but it is precisely its ambitious nature that will open up new possibilities and generate more revenues for Azerbaijan, notably through further collaboration between Azerbaijan and other countries in the region such as Turkmenistan. We appreciate these developments as they trigger a regional momentum. However, I think the political decision is extremely clear and companies are working very hard for the time being to turn this into a reality.</p><h4>How has the EU provided support for the diversification of the local economy? What challenges does Azerbaijan face?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's economy relies between 70% and 80% on oil and gas revenues. This is too much for any economy in the world to be so dependent on one commodity; it is even dangerous for the country's future. Azerbaijan is a small trading partner for the EU in terms of percentages, and we would like these to increase. Azerbaijan has a very positive commercial balance with the EU because it exports oil, but it doesn't have the possibility to generate extra revenues because its economy is not diversified and it is not competitive enough in terms of both offer and standards. We have started giving Azerbaijan the possibility to export all of its products to the EU without any customs duties. It's called a General Systems of Preferences Plus (GSP+). In concrete terms, it means that Azerbaijan can export over 6,000 products to the EU without any customs duties. This is a unilateral trading offer that we have granted to Azerbaijan. We are also offering Azerbaijan the chance to enter into discussions with us to negotiate a free trade area between Azerbaijan and the EU. This offer for a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) is on the table and is part of the Eastern Partnership. The problem is that Azerbaijan is not a member of the WTO, and while Azerbaijan is not a member of the WTO, it cannot negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. So here we are, we're offering our hand, but our partner is not able to seize the opportunity because its economy is too monopolized and not diversified enough.</p><h4>What is your outlook for a liberalized visa system between the EU and Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We know that Azerbaijan is very keen on this. Azerbaijan wishes to open itself up and to enable its population to travel abroad, to see for themselves what is happening elsewhere. This is a good political signal that Azerbaijan has resolutely engaged on the path to modernization. The ball is in the camp of the EU, and we've asked for a mandate of negotiation to start discussing visa facilitation. Of course, there are stipulations before such an agreement can be finalized, including readmission agreements, border management, and security issues. I very much hope that this is a gift I will be able to leave Azerbaijan before my term here ends. Visa facilitation is something genuine, it is not a dream. Ukraine and Moldova have done what was necessary to obtain it. Here, in the region, Georgia also has it and the negotiations only took a year and a half. If we start negotiations now, it means Azerbaijan could possibly have visa facilitation by the end  of 2012.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Azerbaijan is attempting, simultaneously and unevenly, to complete the consolidation of its sovereignty, create both a national and international identity, construct a healthy civil society, and establish a viable market economy structured with respect for the rule of law. This is a complex and multifaceted development, which provides the Center for Economic and Social Development (CESD) with potentially huge work to be done toward achieving its economic and social development priorities. The CESD, therefore, concentrates on several intertwined research facets for policy reform and tries to develop a better institutional capacity  to consistently address these issues and provide more of the high-quality work needed.<br></p><p>In recent years the opportunities for think tanks to affect economic policy in the country have increased. Both the attraction of the CESD to the preparation of various programs, and the adoption of various programs and strategies developed by the Center, indicate that our leading think tank's opportunities to impact state policy are growing. The government's adoption of 10 proposals prepared by the CESD in 2010 denotes that the Center has the capacity to influence public policy. Currently, the government of Azerbaijan is looking to cooperate more with public think tanks. A number of strategies prepared by the CESD have been presented to the National Assembly for discussion, and this additionally confirms that the government's intentions to cooperate with think tanks are growing. Additionally, anti-corruption measures have been launched, and some steps have been taken to remove monopolies.</p><p>Azerbaijan's economy is among the fastest growing in the world, with 2009 GDP growth estimated at 9%. Although net exports, fuelled by substantial new oil and gas production, remained the major drivers of growth, the non-oil sector has also recorded positive growth. Booming oil export prices and the contractual shift in the profit-sharing ratio of the oil consortium in favor of the government in 2010, have all contributed to a major strengthening in the external position and to the accumulation of substantial foreign assets. The global financial crisis has also important implications for oil revenue management and overall macroeconomic policy. An increase in oil revenues over the last five years resulted in the improvement of macro-economic indicators. Azerbaijan's GDP reached AZN41.6 billion in 2010, a large increase from the AZN2.7 billion GDP level recorded in 1991.</p><p>Using oil revenues, the development of other sectors can be achieved and as a knock-on effect those sectors would be less dependent on oil. The government has been implementing an “open door" policy to draw investments to the country's economy for a couple of years. Reforms have had some positive impacts. Improvement of the economic opportunities of the country has brought important changes in the structure of total investment. The amount of internal investments has prevailed over external investments. Internal investments constitute AZN7.31 billion or 75.2%, and external investments constitute AZN2.41 billion or 24.8% of the allocation directed toward fixed capital.</p><p>Changes in the legislation and also the simplification of the registration process for enterprises has created a good atmosphere for foreign investors. Now, foreign investors can participate in privatization efforts. As is understood, a change has occurred from a progressive system to a proportional system in terms of income tax for entities and organizations. The amount of investments directed toward the country constitute $95 billion, with $50 billion coming from foreign investors and $45 billion from internal  investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Scotland is blessed with a range of abundant natural resources from North Sea oil and gas and hydro power resources, which were developed in the 20th century, to the wind, wave, and tidal energy that we are increasingly mobilizing in this current century.<br></p><p>The industry that has built up around North Sea oil and gas makes a huge contribution to the economies of both Scotland and the United Kingdom—supporting around 440,000 jobs, almost half of them in Scotland. Today, over 2,000 companies operate Scotland's oil and gas supply chain, with Scottish companies active in more than 40 countries, and exporting to over 80 countries, based around our global oil and gas hub, Aberdeen City. Aberdeen has a global reputation in oil and gas exploration, production, subsea technologies, logistics, and professional services, and is widely regarded as a center of excellence for the industry. A culture of collaboration has seen many of our universities forge strong links with the industry, including the University of Aberdeen Oil and Gas Center, the Robert Gordon University Center for Research in Energy and Environment, and the National Subsea Research Institute.</p><p>Allied to Scotland's technical skills and expertise and supply chain capability, the industry can also call upon a supportive environment and strong infrastructure, with organizations such as Oil &amp; Gas UK, OPITO, and SUBSEA UK—all located in Aberdeen.</p><p>Aberdeen has strong links to Azerbaijan, with commercial partnerships active there since the early 1990s. The importance of these links was underlined in May 2011 with the announcement by Azerbaijan Airlines of a new long-haul air route from Aberdeen to Baku—only the second direct link operating between Azerbaijan and the UK. This supports the movement and engagement of skilled workers between these two important oil and gas regions, encouraging cross-country trade and economic activity to the benefit of both.</p><p>Azerbaijan is already the sixth largest export market for Scotland's oil and gas service/supply base, with a number of our leading companies operating there, including the Wood Group, RBG, Highland Rope Access International, and Fergusson Seacabs.</p><p>While oil and gas is the most obvious connection between our countries, there are other established and developing links. Indeed, I understand a Baku Caledonian Society was set up in 2007 and has been raising funds to support  local charities, as well as promoting Scottish culture.</p><p>In 2010, the Scottish government hosted a senior delegation from Azerbaijan, including the Deputy Minister of Education, where attendees examined our decentralized vocational education and training system. Such engagement, of course, benefits both nations. Several Scottish educational institutions have already established links with those in Azerbaijan—for example between Adam Smith College in Fife and the Azerbaijan Teachers Institute and between Edinburgh's Stevenson College and Mingachevir Tourism College in Baku. Other partnerships are also being considered, which will strengthen the existing connections further.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Private Sector Priorities]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[private-sector-priorities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Azerbaijan's economy has fundamentally changed since 2006, when oil started to be dispatched through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline and a new phase of reforms were initiated.<br></p><p>Industry, construction, and services showed strong turnover and wages growth. Foreign currency inflows, especially US dollars, boosted the state budget and fuelled inflation, which averaged 18% in 2007-08. The role of the State Oil Fund (SOFAZ) during this period allowed a tight control of revenues and expenditures in the oil sector, which prevented Dutch Disease. The rise in oil prices allowed the government to engage in large-scale infrastructure projects to pave the way for the non-oil sectors—a real challenge for the country's future development. The government has engaged in the important modernization of social services programs mostly since 2000, which have played an important role in reducing poverty. With the major expenditures of SOFAZ being transfers to the state budget (50% of budget revenues), the government was able to increase pensions and wages and to invest in schools, universities, and hospitals. Consequently, poverty decreased from 49% to 11% between 2001 and 2009. The national poverty line indicator increased by 3.7 times from AZN24 to AZN89.5 over the same period.</p><p>Although the country managed to record positive growth in 2009, nearly all macroeconomic indicators were affected by the global downturn. The reduction of the nominal GDP to AZN34.6 billion was caused by falling oil prices and moderate rates of non-oil sector development. Indeed, the oil sector contributed to a rise of 14% in GDP, while the non-oil sector contributed only 3%. Azerbaijan returned to high growth in the second half of 2009 with an increasing oil price. The country's GDP increased by 9% over this period. As a consequence, the end of the “transition period" was officially announced by President Ilham Aliyev in the first quarter of 2010. The impact of the financial crisis on Azerbaijan was indeed less severe than in other countries of Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus (EESC). High GDP growth was directly linked to the contribution of the oil sector, thanks to increasing oil exports and higher global oil prices. FDI inflows also recovered during this period.</p><p>However, for a return to former growth rates, Azerbaijan will need to enhance the competitiveness of its economy, which calls for policies that stimulate private-sector development and foster diversification outside the energy sector.</p><h4>PRIVATE SECTOR A PRIOIRITY</h4><p>The private sector is a source of knowledge, skills, and resources, and a key engine of growth for industrial development. In this context, the role played by micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which, on average account for over 90% of enterprises in the world and contribute 50-60% of employment in developing countries, is particularly important. Efforts to foster private sector growth could focus on improving the business environment for SMEs by providing a regulatory framework conducive to entrepreneurship through better policy design including improving business regulation, strengthening the education system, and providing access to finance for SMEs that would encourage the entry of new firms as well as increase their share of employment and contributions to GDP in the private sector.</p><p>Currently, the private sector represents 75% of GDP in Azerbaijan and employs about 64% of the workforce, which is lower than in most countries in the region. Due to the extensive oil production in Azerbaijan, which is dominated by large enterprises representing almost half of GDP with 1% of employment, the SME share in GDP is relatively low. SMEs contributed to only 15% of GDP growth in 2006. The presence of an extensive and prosperous oil sector affects the economy, and small businesses in particular. The strong position of the gas and oil industry also underlined impressive growth rates in the non-oil sector, even more than in the oil sector. On the other hand, the excessive dependence on oil and gas products makes the economy particularly sensitive to price shocks within the oil industry, and represents a risk for non-oil-related manufacturing through increases in the real exchange rate. The capital-intensive oil sector also means that income generation is concentrated in this sector and distribution is uneven. Moreover, many small enterprises related to the oil sector depend on large firms, rather than on internal competitive advantages.</p><p>Today, the SME sector mainly consists of individual entrepreneurs and SMEs that fall under the “small business units" definition. In 2007, only 4,945 new micro, small, and medium enterprises registered as new businesses, fewer than in 2005, and at a lower rate, 7%, compared to the 10% business entry rate of the Europe and Central Asia region. According to the 2008 Statistical Yearbook of Azerbaijan, 13,465 small enterprises and 195,732 individual entrepreneurs were registered in 2007, which represent 7% and 93% of the total registered business population, respectively. At the same time, if individual entrepreneurs are excluded, small enterprises represent 92% of the total number of enterprises and account for 62% of employment. It is important to note that the informal sector is relatively large, which is why any statistics on the private sector size and contribution to GDP need to be regarded with care. According to BEEPS 2009, only 85% of firms were registered when starting operations. Therefore, the estimates for the number and share of employment of the SME sector are most likely underestimated.</p><h4>HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT</h4><p>Strengthening human capital and skills development has been identified by the OECD as one of the key contributors to competitiveness and private sector development. Razzak and Timmins report a strong positive relation between the increase of university-qualified workers and the levels of labor productivity as measured by GDP per person. It is believed that relying on natural resources, cost competition, and strategic alliances do not suffice for reaching sustainable development. Enhancing competitiveness in Azerbaijan will require a higher commitment to investing in human capital as well as introducing reforms that will ensure that the educational system produces skills that match the demand of the labor market and further support private sector development. As a result, three areas should be addressed as priorities by Azerbaijan:</p><p>•Developing a comprehensive human capital strategy involving different ministries and consultation with the private sector</p><p>•Focusing much further on vocational education and training (VET) and continuing education and training (CET)</p><p>•Assessing on a regular basis the level of skill gaps in different sectors of the economy.</p><p>Overall, despite a recovering economy, private sector development should now be a key priority for policy makers. With this regard, human capital development policies should be on top of the list.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of AtaHolding, and how did it develop into such an important local corporate entity?<br></h4><p>AtaHolding has been operational since August 2003. We initially started in the finance sector, and after a short period of time we penetrated other sectors of the economy. We took deliberately careful steps, because we are familiar with Azerbaijan's economy, and we have a responsibility toward the development of its private sector. The holding started to expand and set up industrial, tourism, IT, and service companies. At present AtaHolding is one of the largest groups in Azerbaijan and it consists of eight subsidiaries: AtaBank, AtaInsurance, AtaLeasing, AtaTourism, AtaTechnology, Ata Industry, and Ata Sport. As we have benefited from the favorable business climate over the last eight years in Azerbaijan, the holding went on to invest in various spheres of the economy. In 2008 AtaHolding became a 49% shareholder in VTB Bank in Azerbaijan, opened by one of the largest financial groups of Russia—VTB Group. It should be noted that AtaBank and AtaInsurance are the largest financial institutions in the country. In the tourism sector, AtaTourism's Excelsior Hotel Baku is the only 5+ star hotel in Azerbaijan. On October 18, 2011, Azerbaijan will celebrate 20 years of independence. After gaining independence, the economy required significant renewal. As a result of the far-sighted policies of the late President Heydar Aliyev, oil contracts were given a breath of life and Azerbaijan's economy seized onto this renewed buoyancy. As a result, the oil sector gave impetus to the non-oil sector's development and made it possible to invest in a number of various fields. AtaHolding was established as a result of these emerging needs.</p><h4>To what extent is AtaHolding present in the finance sector?</h4><p>Three of Ata Holding's subsidiaries are represented in the financial sector. One is in banking, one concerns insurance, and one is a leasing company. These are AtaBank, AtaInsurance, and AtaLeasing. Successfully operating since 1993, AtaBank is one of the largest commercial banks in Azerbaijan. The main operating strategy is to develop corporate and retail banking through competitiveness and the provision of a wide spectrum of high-tech bank services. Currently there are 19 branches and four departments of AtaBank operating. AtaInsurance has been active since 2004. The sole founder of the company is AtaHolding. Today, AtaInsurance is a leading company, performing high-quality services at an international level. It provides 27 types of insurance services, among which 22 are voluntary and five compulsory. Currently, AtaInsurance cooperates with the most prestigious insuring and reinsuring companies in the world. Ata Leasing was set up in 2004 by Ata Holding, with a 64% share, and AtaBank, with a 36% share. The main purpose for creating Ata Leasing was to provide entrepreneurs participating in the rapid development of Azerbaijan's economy with the right equipment and resources under favorable conditions. Since 2008 AtaHolding has partnered with VTB Bank. At present, the corporate clients of VTB Bank in Azerbaijan represent small, medium, and large-scale enterprises. As far as future financial projects are concerned, I would like to mention AtaLife, an insurance company that will specialize in life insurance.</p><h4>Do you believe Azerbaijan has the potential to become an IT hub for the region? What would be needed to achieve this goal?</h4><p>Today, technical progress, technological development, modern technologies, and achievements in the field of information communications, electronics, and the aerospace industry define the level of a country's development and its power. In Azerbaijan there are state programs designed to develop ICT and develop the aerospace industry. The government of Azerbaijan is cooperating with leading international IT companies and an e-government project is being implemented. The private sector sets up the most modern technology enterprises, and there are new solutions based on modern scientific achievements. New special economic zones are also being established in Azerbaijan, and a well-developed IT sector is of vital importance to this. The attention paid by the government as well as the private sector to the development of IT will undoubtedly lead to Azerbaijan taking a central regional position in this field. I believe that Azerbaijani IT companies will be able to create the most modern software programs and new computer technologies, which will transform Azerbaijan into an IT exporter.</p><h4>AtaHolding owns the Excelsior Hotel Baku. What sort of regulatory reforms would you like to see to encourage more investment in the tourism industry?</h4><p>There have been a number of successful projects implemented by AtaHolding. Our first project was the construction of the Excelsior Hotel Baku. In Azerbaijan, 2011 has been declared the “Year of Tourism", and there are great opportunities for the development of tourism in Azerbaijan. There are nine climatic zones in Azerbaijan out of the 11 zones existing on the planet. Azerbaijan, or the “Land of Fire", is rich in historical monuments, sights, spas, and resorts. The state sponsors the development of infrastructure and the construction of roads and airports, which in turn helps improve this field. Today there are all the right conditions in Azerbaijan for tourists to have an enjoyable vacation. New hotels are opening every day. In 2012, Azerbaijan will host one of the most prestigious international song contests: Eurovision 2012. Visitors arriving for the event will see the attraction of our capital and the advantages of its tourist offering.</p><h4>What is Ata Holding's ongoing international strategy?</h4><p>We attach great importance to the development of our international relations. AtaHolding is closely cooperating both with the head offices and affiliates of various companies around the world. For example, we have very close relations with VTB Group of Russia and AtaInsurance company co-operates with Slovenian re-insurance company Sava. The main target of AtaHolding in the field of international relations is to attract foreign investment to Azerbaijan. At the same time, AtaHolding has successfully participated in projects outside the country. Domestic growth has urged us to penetrate new markets. We need to be attentive to new markets to develop our economy as well as our company. The investments put into foreign countries will ensure our business interests, expand Azerbaijan's international possibilities, and strengthen our international positions. Currently, the most attractive markets are those of our neighbors in the region.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for Azerbaijan's economy over the medium term?</h4><p>The government has created a favorable environment for the private sector as well as for investments. In particular, the number of state programs focused on the development of the non-oil sector has led to a steady improvement in the country's economy. The favorable credits provided by the state to SMEs led to an increase in the share of the private sector, and most importantly, Azerbaijan has started to satisfy its internal needs for consumer products. The course of economic development initiated by Heydar Aliyev, which is successfully being continued by President Ilham Aliyev, resulted in a 15% economic growth rate over the course of 2009-2010. There are large state investments in the economy as well as investment from the private sector. The private sector invested more in the non-oil sector than the oil sector over that period. Of the $15.5 billion invested in Azerbaijan's economy in 2010, $9.3 billion went to non-oil sector investments. The development of the growth of the non-oil sector in the year 2010 continued and its real growth triumphed general growth to comprise 7.6% of all growth. The comprehensive economic policy, as well as economic reforms, will provide for the steady development of our economy in the years to come. The rate of the national currency stays very stable, the income of the population of the country will be higher than the rate of inflation, and the level of the population's welfare will significantly improve. These sorts of tendencies give us the ground to note that we are surely going to witness future economic growth.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have contributed to Azerbaijan's level of economic diversification?<br></h4><p>The favorable climate created for the private sector by governmental economic policy has certainly contributed to this development. I would like to mention also the role of the efficient integration of the group's financial and intellectual resources in allowing our companies to reach leading positions in their fields.</p><p>In addition, investment initiatives implemented in Azerbaijan in the early 1990s enabled the attraction of billions of dollars of foreign investment into the country. These assets, the major part of which had been invested in the oil and gas sphere, resulted in the development of other sectors in the economy, thus creating favorable conditions for the development of our diverse business group.</p><h4>What makes Azerbaijan attractive to foreign investors?</h4><p>Foreign investments go to countries where predictability and stability are present, and where investors are on firm ground. Azerbaijan's government has managed to create precisely such conditions for investors. Today, Azerbaijan has the right climate of protection for foreign investments, as well as a generally dynamic business environment.</p><h4>What current projects are you implementing in terms of partnerships or production?</h4><p>Our group's Standard Capital brokerage company, jointly with the famous Danish company Saxo Bank, has started to provide services that enable clients to trade on 40 world exchange markets at once, which is a first for Azerbaijan. These transactions are carried out on the Maxis Trader high-technology platform created by our foreign partner. Bank Standard has been in continuous cooperation with international financial institutions within the framework of joint projects implemented in Azerbaijan. In particular, the bank finances the trading transactions of local private sector companies under the auspices of the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank within the framework of the program for the support of companies involved in regional trade. We provide domestic companies with such effective financing instruments as bills of credit with delay of payment. The bank's cooperation with the Islamic Corporation for Development, as well as with other Islamic financial institutions, is also being developed successfully. The further extension of this cooperation is included in the priority plans of Bank Standard. We have also adopted new types of business, one of which is leasing services, and the bank's shareholders have taken the decision to detach the leasing services sphere into a separate entity.</p><h4>How did the global economic crisis affect the AB Standard group of companies?</h4><p>Thanks to the government's solid economic policy, the global financial crisis did not affect the Azerbaijani economy as significantly as it did other economies. A partial impact of the crisis was noticed in the country's banking sector, the after effects of which had an impact on the efficiency of many banks. A long stream of negative information and pessimism in the media disturbed the confidence of clients and local banks, constituting the main threat over that period. The bank's administration faced the task of building relations with clients properly, explaining to them why the global financial crisis had a minimal impact on the Azerbaijani banking sector, and why our depositors should not need worry about their savings' destiny. I think that we have resolved this task very well. Over that period we witnessed a 25% increase in our deposit portfolio. Moreover, the bank managed to increase its aggregate capital and kept its total asset volumes at the same level. These factors considered, we have kept our position as a leading player in the private banking sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>To start with, can you tell me about the genesis of Turkapital?<br></h4><p>Kuwait Finance House (KFH) came to Turkey in 1989. During the 1980s and early 1990s there were hardly any foreign investors coming to Turkey. KFH is therefore considered as one of the first comers to Turkey. KFH invested in Turkey by establishing Kuwait Turkish Participation Bank (KTPB) as a wholesale bank, and then shifted more to retail. Since then, KTPB has faced several financial crises, including the 2001 financial crisis in Turkey, which resulted in the birth of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA). As a result of the new banking regulations, banks were more and more restricted in terms of their investments. That was the ground for us to start thinking more strategically. We decided to establish an investment arm, while letting the bank continue with its commercial banking activities and to expand even further in retail. This is where the idea of Turkapital (TK) came from. TK was established in late 2007, and registered in the Kingdom of Bahrain with a capital of $150 million. The main focus for operations and investments is Turkey and the Turkic republics including Eastern Europe, while the management is in Kuwait.</p><h4>In terms of Azerbaijan, how would you gauge appetite for private equity?</h4><p>In general, private equity (PE) is now entering into a new era globally while it is relatively new in this part of the world, and therefore it becomes a challenge. The laws and regulatory landscape in Azerbaijan do not necessarily match investors' requirements and standards yet. International investors come with a set of basic and general expectations, for example; to see international financial accounting standards applied, or issues pertaining to the tax regime, which may not be available in this part of the world. As a result, this could potentially double the amount of work to be done by investors when it comes to PE, especially in areas like valuations and entering into any investment idea. To put it simply, although it is a tough market environment, it is true for most emerging markets. In Azerbaijan, we have looked at some private equity opportunities in the past but we haven't realized any yet.</p><h4>Do you foresee the environment changing?</h4><p>Yes, it has to and it has been when looking back 3-4 years ago when conditions and the environment for PE were discouraging. I think that given Azerbaijan's potential in terms of geographic location and economic growth prospects, there are many attractive opportunities for global investors. It's also a two-way street; while some of the more aggressive investors would accept some of the local standards and regulations, Azerbaijan is also changing to meet international investor standards and expectations.</p><h4>Where do you specifically see potential in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>There's a lot, especially in public sector and infrastructure projects. This can be in transportation, in health care, and even in education. On the other hand, the private sector offers a lot of opportunities as well. The region as whole is characterized as an emerging market region, and this provides a lot of good opportunities for us to consider. As a sector, real estate also offers a lot of opportunities like development and regeneration projects or fixed income. I remember after establishing our office in Azerbaijan three years ago, we came to rent office space and we were limited to about four or five sites in Baku. Back then, this gave me an idea about what the market offers in terms of vacancies for office space and the potential as well. I also had a chance to go outside Baku and saw the need for much infrastructure development.</p><h4>What are the chances of Azerbaijan developing a competitive Islamic finance sector?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a member country of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and I believe the IDB may lead to promote or introduce Islamic banking laws in Azerbaijan in order to attract investors. Turkey's banking law, which includes participation bank laws, can be a good example for Azerbaijan to take into consideration. Participation banks have been operating for 25 years in Turkey and are successful. I believe Azerbaijan can benefit from Turkey's experience in developing legislation for participation banks.</p><h4>When the financial crisis struck the world, there was a lot of talk about how well sharia-compliant banking performed. How do you think the industry has fared during the crisis?</h4><p>Given a sharia-compliant bank is asset-based in its modes-operandi, one would assume that a sharia-compliant bank would outperform a non-sharia compliant one, especially in a financial crisis similar to that which struck the world recently. However, given the magnitude of the crisis, there were many asset-based financial institutions hit and negatively impacted. I am more comfortable now with the term “ethical banking" instead of sharia-compliant, especially after the crisis. Greed, which many attribute as one of the main causes that lead to the crisis, is assumed to be absent in a true ethical banking institution.</p><h4>Coming back to private equity, can you tell us about some of your flagship investments?</h4><p>We closed the year 2010 with losses, but this is natural for a holding in its first years of operation. During those years we've entered into the automotive sector by acquiring Autoland in mid-2008. It's an auto fleet leasing company for corporate clients. The model under which we operate has been tested and is almost risk free. When we bought the company, it had 100-150 cars. We closed the year 2010 with a fleet size slightly above 2,000 cars. Our aim is to continue growing the fleet size. We've also increased Autoland's capital to about $20 million. Another investment completed was a greenfield; an alternative insurance company, established in Turkey under the name Neova. The sector is regulated in Turkey under the Turkish Treasury. It took us more than a year to finalize all establishment procedures, to comply with all requirements, and for Neova to finally start operations in December 2009. We closed the year 2010 with good results in terms of performance and volume. We use KTPB, which has over 150 branches nationwide, as one of our insurance sales points, and we have contracted with other banks as well, bringing our number of distribution channels to about 500. This is the strength of Neova insurance. We have had 15 months of performance and we have issued over 300,000 policies. A third investment realized is in real estate, through another subsidiary of Turkapital called Iskan Real Estate with a capital of about $50 million. Iskan started with about 120 residential units for sale and to date has sold around 50. Another investment was realized in 2010, when we invested in acquiring warehouses in Istanbul. It was an industrial real estate investment of $20 million. Also, in Azerbaijan, in 2011, we closed our first deal and this was the acquisition of a part of a shopping mall. The deal size was $5.5 million and we own part of a shopping mall, which has tenants. Finally, in the Republic of Tatarstan we have established an investment company with the government of the republic and we are looking to close some deals before the end of 2011.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the special bond between Azerbaijan and Turkey helped to build a healthy business environment?<br></h4><p>Turkey and Azerbaijan share important emotional ties based on religion, language, history, and race. They use the same language, they share a border, and both of them are on the historic Silk Road. This has helped them establish an interactive economic relationship. Additionally, both countries' leaders have historically encouraged Turkish businessmen to come to Azerbaijan. After Azerbaijan became independent, the first country to recognize its sovereignty was Turkey, and the first foreign capital that came into the country was from Turkey. In the independence wars of both countries, mutual support was assured. This support came to fruition in the Çanakkale and Karabakh wars.</p><h4>How has TÜSİAB grown since it was established in 1994, and how have the interests of its members changed over the time?</h4><p>The organization was established in 1994, but Turkish businessmen first came to Azerbaijan in 1989. At the beginning, our trade volume was around $100 million, now it stands at $2.5 billion. The development of Turkish business in Azerbaijan has developed in parallel with Azerbaijan's economy. Azerbaijan's economy has shown stable growth and improves with each passing year. Turkish businessmen have analyzed the market well, and they have been involved in the upward trend seen in the country over recent years. I should mention that the first priority of Turkish businessmen in Azerbaijan is not to earn money. We are brothers and we have serious historical ties. Our first priority is to strengthen this relationship and play a role in both countries' development. For example, we had some issues during the economic crisis, but we didn't leave the country. We shut down some of our offices in other countries, but shutting up shop in Azerbaijan was never an option. Historically, Turkish businessmen have re-invested in Azerbaijan whatever they earned there. These days it is a bit different. As President Ilham Aliyev and Turkish officials have said, Turkish and Azerbaijani businessman should do business together in other countries. There are examples of this now in Africa, the Baltic, and the Middle East.</p><h4>How do you characterize the business environment for foreign investors?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's economy is developing every day. The government has seen the need for economic diversification and President Ilham Aliyev mentions this at every opportunity. Azerbaijan is open to every investor and the conditions are equal. Investors should investigate the market before coming to Azerbaijan. For example, agriculture is a sector that has a lot to offer and this area needs significant investment. Once upon a time, cotton and wine were manufactured in Azerbaijan. Plus, Azerbaijan has diverse seasons so it can produce many different kind of products. In my opinion, everybody should come to Azerbaijan, they should stay here and experience the country and then they will understand the opportunities. Sometimes people think we might be a bit blind because we are insiders and we are biased. Then we invite them to come here, and they change their minds. I should mention that investors should come with a considerable amount of capital, experience, and vital know-how. In addition, we would like to attract Turkish investors' attention to the Azerbaijani agriculture sector.</p><h4>To what extent is TÜSİAB involved in lobbying actions?</h4><p>TÜSİAB is 16 years old and has considerable experience. It is a member of the business council under the president's office. Historically, we have advised the Ministry of Tax, Ministry of Customs, and Ministry of Economic Development when they were drawing up regulations. Now we are directing our attention to the social rights of Turkish businessmen and their families in both countries. We have a relationship with the governments in both Turkey and Azerbaijan and exchange ideas on a series of issues.</p><h4>To what extent is investment being made in Turkey with Azerbaijani capital?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has made a total investment of $3 billion in Turkey over the years, and this will undoubtedly increase.</p><h4>What is your outlook over the medium term for Azerbaijan's economy?</h4><p>We would like to see investment in the non-oil sector, in industry, and in manufacturing. We want to see a more industrialized Azerbaijan. If Azerbaijan can manufacture products for export it will vastly increase its wealth.</p><h4>What opportunities are there in the finance sector?</h4><p>At this moment it doesn't seem like there are many opportunities. The authorities are trying to work on the infrastructure of the finance sector now, and in three to four years we believe there will be investors in the finance sector as well. Finance investors are different from others because they look for more security. Once the market is ready, we believe Azerbaijan will receive investors in this sector as well.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the monetary policy framework of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR)?<br></h4><p>The monetary policy target is to keep inflation at an acceptable level. However, the Central Bank considers financial stability a target as well when pursuing monetary policy. CBAR counts money supply and the exchange rate as interim targets. Benchmarks for these parameters are determined depending on the macroeconomic environment in the country and phases of the economic cycle. The Central Bank utilizes both liquidity injection and sterilization to primarily regulate money supply. Liquidity injection tools include different types of bank lending, as well as the purchase of various forms of securities. Sterilization tools are comprised of the direct or temporary sale of short-term CBAR notes as well as required reserve norms. The Central Bank manages the exchange rate through sale-purchase operations in the forex market. Overall, the bilateral exchange rate of the manat against other foreign currencies has recently been formed depending on the forces of supply and demand in the forex market. CBAR operations are solely directed at the prevention of sharp fluctuations. Currently, the Central Bank is working on improving the monetary policy strategy and the formation of its counter-cyclic design given the post-crisis challenges.</p><h4>What is the interest rate policy that CBAR is using?</h4><p>The interest rate policy of the Central Bank depends on the country's macroeconomic situation, the level of liquidity, and the presence of overheating in the economy. In the event of liquidity shortfalls in the economy, the Central Bank reduces interest rates on its operations. In response to the negative impacts and the deflation threat arising from the global crisis on the Azerbaijani economy, the Central Bank step-by-step decreased the refinancing rate from 15% to 2%. When aggregate demand starts to increase with inflationary pressures underway the Central Bank raises the refinancing rate. Given macroeconomic expectations, the Central Bank started to change its monetary policy toward neutrality from the end of 2010 and the refinancing rate was gradually increased from 2% to 5.25%. The Central Bank will thereafter pursue adequate interest rate policies considering the macroeconomic situation in the country. To note, the refinancing rate of the Central Bank affects interest rates in the country both physically and psychologically. One of the functions of the refinancing rate is to shape adequate expectations hinting to the key direction of CBAR's policy benchmarks.</p><p>Thus, the Central Bank, making changes to the refinancing rate, transfers certain “signals" to the economy regarding the direction of the business climate that feed through to interest rates in the market.</p><h4>Deposits in the local banking system have also shown strong growth over the past year. Can this be described as an indicator of an increase in confidence in the banking sector?</h4><p>If the population rather than professional players of the market entrust their savings to banks, it displays confidence in the banking sector. It also indicates the confidence of the population in the Central Bank as an effective regulatory institution. Within the last 10 years deposits have increased 36 times and equal $4 billion. The growth rate in 2010 increased 36%, and the same trend is being observed in 2011. The sustainability and stability of the banking sector during the global crisis enhanced its credibility. The crisis witnessed no bank bankruptcy and no loss of deposits. The level of deposits protected through the deposit insurance system increased by five times to about $40,000. As a result, even at the peak of the global crisis in 2008 and 2009, the growth rate of deposits was around 30%.</p><h4>What is the reason for the limited presence of foreign banks in Azerbaijan? Do you see the market as ready for a larger foreign presence in the system?</h4><p>The Azerbaijani banking sector is open to foreign bank capital and there are no constraints on the entry of foreign banks to the market. The banking sector hosts several renowned foreign banks, including Yapı Kredi, a part of the Unicredit Group, as well as Russia's second largest bank, VTB Bank. Foreign capital participates in the capital of over 20 banks. These investors include the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the International Financial Corporation (IFC), and the German Investment Corporation (DEG). The Central Bank is interested in the presence of renowned bank brands in our country. There is a high level of interest in the Azerbaijani banking sector. The economic crisis slowed the entry plans of a number of foreign banking institutions to the Azerbaijani market. The local banking sector should be prepared to embrace the above expectations regarding foreign bank capital. The Azerbaijani banking sector is ready to welcome foreign players according to its development level, as well as technological and institutional standing. Favorable conditions are available for the participation of foreign banks, including a legal and regulatory framework in compliance with international best practices and standards, and effective banking supervision.</p><h4>What are the priorities of the exchange rate policy of the Central Bank?</h4><p>The exchange rate policy of the Central Bank is aimed at maintaining a low level of inflation in the country. However, the Central Bank, when pursuing its exchange rate policy, targets preserving the international competitiveness of the country. It should overall be mentioned that the exchange rate policy of the Central Bank has played an exceptional role in preserving macroeconomic and financial stability in recent years. Major international institutions and esteemed foreign experts as well assess the exchange rate of the manat as one of the key anchors of macroeconomic and financial stability. It is appropriate to mention here that the psychological impact of the wave of devaluation in a number of foreign countries—including our neighbors—at the height of the global crisis, caused some agiotage in our internal foreign exchange market. Some people, alarmed at the devaluation of the manat, began to convert their savings in the national currency into forex. Under these circumstances we conducted in-depth analyses related to exchange rate policy, and comprehensively assessed the possible implications of devaluation. We assessed over 20 macro and micro factors. Given the considerable prevalence of foreign exchange reserves over a critical level we found the maintenance of a stable exchange rate of the manat advisable built upon these evaluations. Further processes proved the correct position of the Central Bank. According to the IMF, the Central Bank successfully preserved financial stability through stable exchange rate and liquidity injections into the banking sector. A stable exchange rate enabled a reduction in the level of inflation, a slowdown of the temporary growth in dollarization, and the prevention of negative impacts on households and bank balances. The countries where devaluation was conducted suffered more from recessionary effects during the crisis. According to IMF studies, the slowdown in growth for stable exchange rate countries was 0.9 basis points lower than in countries with a floating exchange rate in 2008—2009. In the new post-crisis period the Central Bank is intending to gradually liberalize the exchange rate regime to increase the counter-cyclical capability of its monetary policy. Depending on the diversification of the country's economy, and thus, currency supply channels, as well as the development of internal foreign exchange market infrastructure, the Central Bank is planning to gradually allow the market to set the exchange rate. In upcoming years, supply and demand in the forex market will mainly regulate the exchange rate of the manat, which will provide a level of flexibility in monetary policy to effectively target inflation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>IBA started operations in 1992 as a national development bank. How has it contributed to the stability of the banking system and the resiliency of the economy in Azerbaijan since then?<br></h4><p>Reorganized in 1992 from VneshEconomBank of the USSR into an independent financial-crediting institution, the International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA) is the same age as independent Azerbaijan. IBA has achieved the successful passage through all stages of the rehabilitation of the national economy and become an efficient financial institution holding the leading position in the banking sector of the country, and acting as its face in the international arena.</p><p>Having gained a foothold as one of the largest and most reliable financial holding brands in the Caucasus region, IBA holds the dominant position in all segments of the country's financial and banking market. Its affiliated structures also dominate in such spheres as insurance and plastic card processing. Over a long period of time, IBA has efficiently represented Azerbaijan on the international scene. And, finally, being the bank of national development, IBA exerts a stabilizing influence upon the Azerbaijani economy as a whole. It must not be forgotten that being positioned at the second level of country's banking system, we, properly speaking, are the main bearer of monetary policy developed at the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR).</p><p>IBA was able to pay down nearly half the sovereign debt of $2.5 billion at the peak of the crisis without outside help, and to honor commitments and syndicated loan repayments to foreign banks. We are proud to have weathered the storm as a positive contributor to regional stability and economic recovery.</p><h4>How is IBA establishing itself on the international stage?</h4><p>IBA has been in operation for 19 years. These were eventful years, with tough challenges, significant changes, and rapid multi-sided development. IBA is recognized as a leading bank in the southern Caucasus by world financial institutions. IBA is a founder of the Baku Interbank Currency Exchange, Baku Stock Exchange, AzeriCard processing center, International Insurance Company, the Joint Leasing Company, and is the first bank to have established its presence outside the country, in Moscow and Georgia. The bank also has representation offices in London, Frankfurt, Luxemburg, New York, and Dubai.</p><p>IBA is the first registered full member of the World Economic Forum's Global Growth Companies Society, both representing the region and being a co-founder of the society.</p><p>IBA, holding a reputable position among the best financial and crediting organization in Eurasia, within last five years has received many international recognition awards, including the “Best Bank" award from Euromoney magazine; “Bank of the Year" from The Banker magazine; “Best Bank of Developing World Markets" from Global Finance; “Best Local Bank in Azerbaijan" and “Best Sustainability Award 2010" from emeafinance magazine, and many others. The bank's rating by Fitch IBCA over last four years increased three fold and today is set at BBB-. The Bank's rating from Moody's Investors Service is set at Baa3.</p><h4>How is IBA contributing to economic diversification?</h4><p>We are reaping the benefit of half a decade of concerted economic diversification policies mandated by the country's President. While 54.4% of GDP comes from the oil sector, 45.6% now comes solidly from non-oil sector activities and makes our small country more stable and independent. Earlier investments are spawning new industries in agriculture, petrochemicals, renewable energy, recycling, manufacturing, and other sectors that make sense for domestic and regional markets.</p><p>We are making new allies in sustainable development practices, which mesh well with Azerbaijani culture, its agricultural roots, and reverence for nature.</p><h4>What is IBA's position in the sector?</h4><p>IBA is the largest and most established bank by far in Azerbaijan and contributes significantly to the stability of the banking system. IBA represents 40% to 50% of the banking market in Azerbaijan. We are 50.2% state-owned by the Ministry of Finance. As the national development bank, IBA investments involve structured initiatives for economic diversification.</p><p>The banking sector includes 46 banks, of which nine have international operations. IBA is the only state bank and has an intensive national franchise of 37 branches and a national penetration with service points in cities and provincial city centers. IBA also has eight international offices and two stand-alone bank subsidiaries in Russia and in Georgia. In Azerbaijan, IBA holds 44.2% of assets, 47.6% of loans, 15.7% of retail loans, 39.4% of deposits, 30.5% of capital, and 44.3% of banking sector profits. IBA has strong government support in its capitalization and is an integral part of the banking system, intermediating in a significant part of the country's overall business activity.</p><h4>What activities does IBA specialize in, and how important is innovation?</h4><p>Since adopting the strategy of universal banking in the early 2000s, IBA renders all kinds of traditional and innovative banking products and services both to individuals and corporate customers. IBA can be rightfully considered as the leader in innovative and electronic banking products and services. The current processes convince the banks of the need to reconsider their attitude toward new technologies. The introduction of innovations is advancing within IBA in many directions. This includes the attraction of financial resources by way of securitization, expansion of the network of electronic service offices equipped with the “cash-in" type ATMs, allowing the payment of credit card bills, the introduction of mobile banking and electronic commerce systems, the application of up-to-date marketing communications, and much more. The bank was the first in Azerbaijan to implement such services as internet banking, mobile banking, urgent money transfers, an SMS notification alert service, and so on. The range of electronic bank services includes both simple and more sophisticated services, such as electronic term deposits and air ticket purchases.</p><p>In 2009 via all channels of electronic banking 498,6000 transactions were carried out amounting to AZN13.6 million. In 2010 the figures were 567,000 transactions worth AZN19.2 million. In general, more than 1.7 million e-banking transactions worth about AZN46 million have been carried out over the 2007-2010 period. In that regard, the bank plans to further develop its e-banking network, open new around-the-clock self-service points, as well as improve internet and mobile banking methods. In addition, the bank has been working toward the improvement of its Flexcube Direct Banking system. Currently, this technology is aimed at corporate users, allowing them to perform almost all operations while sitting in the office. In the future, the bank plans to introduce a retail version of this tool.</p><h4>To what extent is IBA involved in project financing?</h4><p>One of the most rapidly developing directions of IBA operations is project financing. IBA plays an active role in the development of this market. To date the bank has funded about 80 projects, with 50 of them being large and medium sized. These cover the sectors of construction, transport, energy production, trade, telecommunications, and production. Of the projects we participated in, the most interesting include the purchasing of 20 wind park units for energy generation at a cost of ‚¬104 million, the purchase of city buses for urban passenger transport networks at a value of $66 million, and mobile network infrastructure set up for ‚¬24 million. At this time, there are 10 projects being reviewed. The decision to fund the construction of 20 wind generators with a total generation capacity of 50 MW was taken in consideration of strict environmental criteria, and IBA was the guarantor of the deal, with Société Générale and Landesbank Berlin being the main participants. The factor of environmental friendliness will be also taken into consideration in the implementation of projects for the rehabilitation of oil field sites. IBA also has a strong position in trade finance. More than 70 leading banks of the world, mainly European and American, provide us the credit lines for these purposes at a volume of about $1 billion.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us a little bit about the activities of Pasha Bank?<br></h4><p>We opened in 2007 in Azerbaijan, are among the top five banks in the country, and are a part of Pasha Group. We're a commercial bank geared toward serving the needs of corporate clients, both foreign and local companies—such as SMEs—in Azerbaijan. We have about AZN500 million in assets, and we have a large capital base, the second largest in the country. In March 2011 we increased our charter capital by a further AZN8 million, thus reaching AZN123.4 million. This was achieved by a partial capitalization of the profit for 2010.</p><h4>Do you also deal with the local bond market?</h4><p>Pasha Bank underwrites bonds, but our activities in that area are still at a bare minimum. The bond market has only recently emerged in Azerbaijan, and there are very few companies raising capital through the stock exchange. Part of the reason is that there's no tradition for doing this. The stock market has only been around for about eight years. Now, there is an aspiration within the government to transform Baku into a financial center for the whole region, and the preparations to lay the necessary infrastructure to this end are under way. Our strategy right now is to educate our client base so as to make them amenable to the idea of using bonds to raise capital. There is a need for growth and financing, and we need to get people accustomed to using the bond markets. Although the bond market is still in its fledgling stage here, there is plenty of activity going on, with a lot of foreign companies, including asset management firms, banks, and investment companies, considering to invest in Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijani companies needing to finance their expansion abroad. We see great opportunities in these fields for Pasha Bank.</p><h4>What are your views on the state of development of the banking sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The ratio of the total assets of the banking sector to GDP is currently around 35%, which is pretty low. In fact, there are companies in Azerbaijan that are far bigger than the banks, and even the combined banking system would probably not be enough to serve their needs. The banks need to grow bigger and there is a space for that. However, we don't need to artificially enlarge the banks or merge them through administrative or government pressure. What we need is to help banks move ahead and increase their capital base in a natural way, and to create the right kind of infrastructure to serve their needs and foster the right kind of economic incentives and environment to help them grow. This growth will occur through the introduction of new products and use of new financial instruments. At the same time, both banks and the government need to help educate corporate and individual clients as to what services are offered. One of the high priorities in the government's agenda currently is to move away from cash transactions towards non-cash operations. This will increase the role of the banking sector as a whole and further enhance its weight in the country's economy.</p><h4>Do you see room for foreign banks to establish a larger presence in the Azerbaijani market?</h4><p>With the rise of the assets of the banks and the increase of their weight in the economy, competition will intensify. As a result, foreign banks may decide to enter the sector and all the parties will benefit from this. As for Pasha Bank, our top priority is to increase our competitiveness so we are able to compete with the foreign banks not only locally but in foreign markets as well.</p><h4>Do you engage in investment banking activities here?</h4><p>We're not operating as a classical investment bank due to certain regulatory restrictions. Obviously, we see our corporate institutional banking division as setting a base for future full-scale corporate investment banking activities. We are currently building up our capacity, recruiting experienced personnel, training them, and setting up relevant policies and procedures in a bid to provide wealth management services. Currently, the wealth management department is conducting project financing, realizing loan syndications, and conducting ECA-covered financing and corporate investment banking, with more products to follow.</p><h4>Do you have much exposure to the retail side of the industry?</h4><p>No, we're not a retail bank. Our only retail activity is maintaining the accounts of our employees, the salary accounts of our corporate clients, and personal accounts for entrepreneurs whose companies are banking with us. Therefore, there is no need for an aggressive expansion of our branch network. Our existing corporate branches, or business centers as we call them, are operating in the Baku area. However, in the very near future we plan to open new business centers in other cities in Azerbaijan, like in Ganja, the second industrial city of the country, and then another one in Zagatala, in the northwest region close to the Georgian border. Later, we will open another two centers in the south and north of Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What sort of sectors are your corporate clients active in mostly?</h4><p>Our corporate clients are mostly active in the transport, ICT, agribusiness, trading, services, hospitality, construction, and energy sectors. Over 90% of our clients are from the private sector.</p><h4>How was 2010 for Pasha Bank? What are some of the key metrics from your audited financials?</h4><p>That was a difficult year. It was a year when the consequences of the global financial crises were felt most severely. However, the bank has kept its position as the largest commercial bank by total equity, which reached a level of AZN136.82 million, or $171.47 million. As a result of the strategic decision to diversify our assets portfolio, the bank has efficiently managed to keep a balance of services. Pasha Bank's total assets have reached AZN512.30 million or $642 million, meaning a 67% year-on-year increase. The breakdown of the bank's assets were as follows: loans to customers comprise 37% of the bank's assets, the securities portfolio represents 31%, cash and cash equivalents represent 26%, and bank dues make up 5%. The rest refers to other non-current and current assets.</p><p>The loan portfolio of the bank has increased 1.6 times and reached AZN196.08 million, or $245.75 million, while the same figure for 2009 was AZN122.08 million, or $153 million.</p><p>The effective provision rate on the portfolio was 4.2%, compared to 2% in 2009. Non-performing loans (NPLs) have increased from 0.3% of gross portfolio for the period ended 2009 to 0.6% for the year ended 2010 based on the assessment of the valuation techniques by the bank. The bank's net profit for the 12 months ended in 2010 dropped by 14% and comprised AZN13.87 million, or $17.38 million. The main reasons behind this were reducing the average interest rates on loans disbursed to customers, and changing the bank's methodology on valuation techniques related to the creation of loan-loss provisions in the loan portfolio by the group exposure of borrowers, including financial institutions. The interest income of the bank reached AZN33.84 million, or $42.41 million, while non-interest income has doubled and comprised AZN5.26 million, or $6.59 million. Documentary operations balances increased 1.3 times for one year to AZN30.33 million, or $38.01 million, from AZN22.91 million, or $28.71 million in 2009. The ROA of the bank, at 4.09%, is the highest in the sector at the moment. The CAR came in at 53.02% and the ROE was 18.2%.</p><h4>What's your outlook for the economy in 2011?</h4><p>We expect more private sector investment in the country in 2011. The government will continue to act as a major investor, and the government's infrastructure projects are a very important factor in maximizing economic growth. In the longer term, the importance of the banking sector has to increase as well, especially in its ratio to GDP. Once that is achieved, everyone will be a winner.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bank Standard has become the largest private bank in Azerbaijan. How did it become such a major player in the banking sector?<br></h4><p>Bank Standard has grown organically along with the economy supported by the oil boom and the continuous efforts of the state to develop non-oil industries. At the same time, it has benefited from the strategic mix between the inflow of individual clients in a fast-growth environment of personal income as well as the rapid expansion of the corporate sector. The bank has also been successful in offering competitive products to the market while maintaining unparalleled customer service quality.</p><h4>In 2004, the bank underwent a major rebranding exercise, opening services to corporate clients. What were the core reasons for this move, and how has rebranding helped improve the bank's profile?</h4><p>At that point in time, the bank became fully independent from its parent in Moscow and turned into a truly local Azerbaijani bank. The shareholders developed a new strategy that entailed an increased focus on corporate clients and also bet heavily on innovative products for the emerging local financial market. These changes have us to believe that a major rebranding exercise was essential to reflect the strategy change and new approach to doing business. Success followed the rebranding, and today Bank Standard has become one of the top brands in the industry.</p><h4>What are you targeting in terms of loans for SMEs, consumer, and corporate credit?</h4><p>The goal is to further grow along these business lines. Consumers are being targeted through the introduction of new product ranges that cover diverse consumer segments and their expanding needs. Aside from classic corporate credit, we have also made significant progress in offering our clients a variety of trade finance arrangements. Our SME expansion strategy is in the final stages of development.</p><h4>The IMF has noted that the Azerbaijani banking system needs to address the rising level of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the sector. What is Bank Standard's strategy regarding NPLs?</h4><p>We put an extra focus on due diligence work with newcomer clients and our main strategy is to improve pre-screening procedures prior to loan allocation. We have a system in place for the regular monitoring of our corporate client business activities. The level of NPLs at the bank in mid-2010 was less than 10%. Generally, we are very conservative in our approach to the bank's portfolio.</p><h4>With such a limited number of foreign banks in Azerbaijan, do you expect to see a rise in foreign banking activity here in the near future?</h4><p>It would be very much to the benefit of the system to have more foreign banks. This would help introduce new operational standards, improve competition, and serve the ultimate goal of offering clients the best possible service and products.</p><h4>What is behind the Central Bank of Azerbaijan's delayed adoption of Basel II standards?</h4><p>I think Azerbaijan's banks still have a way to go here. Technical capabilities are yet to be developed and a quality statistical legacy is yet to be generated. I could say that between three to five years is a realistic term for the industry to adopt Basel II standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the highlights of the ADB's work in Azerbaijan, and how has the bank been involved in the country's development since the country joined the ADB in 1999?<br></h4><p>We started our operations in 2000 and have evolved since then with a number of projects. In the public sector, we started with some work in social and livelihood, and infrastructure projects. After that we basically narrowed our focus down to infrastructure. Over the last few years we've been working in three sectors: transport, energy, and water supply and sanitation. Our aim was to be more selective with the aim of improving our project implementation ability so as to deliver a better result overall. In the private sector, our work has been focusing on banking and infrastructure.</p><h4>What do you look at when setting your investment agenda?</h4><p>We work with the client, and as far as the public sector is concerned, our client is the Azerbaijani government. Therefore, when setting our investment agenda, we look at the government's own program and its specific needs. Secondly, in terms of long-term strategy, we have set a goal for 2020 and have determined what it is we would like to achieve by then. Our investment decisions, therefore, are the result of a synthesis of our clients' needs and our long-term strategies.</p><h4>What are some of the long-term goals you are looking to achieve?</h4><p>Our 2020 vision contains three main targets, namely to promote inclusive growth, to promote environmentally sustainable growth, and to facilitate and promote regional integration. There are also a number of drivers of social and economic change that we follow closely. These involve the development of the private sector, the encouragement of good governance, support for gender equality, assistance for countries to gain know-how, and to foster partnerships with development institutions, the private sector, and community-based organizations.</p><h4>Do you think the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model could be a significant tool in the ADB's strategy in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We've yet to see a specific policy on the PPP model in Azerbaijan. The potential is there, for sure, but the government needs to create the right regulatory environment for PPPs. We don't see any plans on paper yet, but I know it's a topic of discussion in government circles. Hopefully, we'll see some development on this front in the near future.</p><h4>Does the ADB have any limitations in regards to the public or private sector and its investments?</h4><p>The ADB can invest in government projects as well as private projects. Our largest portfolio right now is from the public sector. That being said, our aim for 2020 is for 50% of our total ADB portfolio to be composed of private sector projects. That's not the target for Azerbaijan in particular, but for the ADB in general.</p><h4>How would you assess the role of the ADB in the development of SMEs in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>SME development normally happens through loans to private local banks. Our role is basically to provide guarantees or loans to local banks so that they can provide loans to SMEs. We don't lend directly to SMEs. We look at a bank's overall financial performance, its credibility, and its transactions. Based on those factors we decide whether we'll provide a guarantee/loan or not.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Ministry of Industry and Energy tried to regulate the activities of Azerbaijan's energy sector since its establishment?<br></h4><p>The Ministry of Industry and Energy is the central executive body conducting state policy and regulation in the industry and fuel-energy complex of the country. The Ministry aims to determine the perspective directions of the relevant area, to ensure the preparation and implementation of sector programs, as well as develop concepts to approve investment programs and to control their performance, to approve normative-legal acts and sector standards, and in general to conduct state control over the activities of state bodies functioning in the relevant field. By taking the principles of energy saving and the effective utilization of oil and oil products, gas, electricity, thermal energy, water, alternative, and renewable energy resources as a priority in regulating the sector, the Ministry coordinates the activities of executive bodies and enterprises, controls the reasonable use of budget resources, conducts state control and expertise over the effective use of energy resources, regulates and supervises security in the energy sector, and protects the environment using its authority. Moreover, the Ministry conducts the control over issuing special allowances for activities in the energy sector, signing contracts in accordance with the existing legislation and ensuring their implementation. The Ministry also participates in conducting state policy on attracting foreign investments to the country. In accordance with the economic policy initiated by the President, the Ministry has given priority to developing the non-oil sector to reduce the dependency of the national economy on oil production, to adjust the quality of oil products made by oil processing enterprises to European standards, to implement nanotechnologies in the oil and gas and petrochemical sectors, to create new enterprises and jobs as the result of the further processing of oil and gas products, to ensure the energy security of the country, and to support the energy security of Europe, as well as to use alternative and renewable energy resources at a maximum level depending on existing capacity. Consequently, more than 70%—or $9.3 billion—of investments made in the country in 2010 were directed towards the non-oil and gas sector. Additionally, more than 900,000 new jobs have been created in the last six years, and the construction of some enterprises to generate alternative and renewable energy, as well as equipment and spare parts, has been achieved. The quality of oil products has been completely adjusted to Euro-2 standards and regular steps have been taken to adjust the quality of oil products to Euro-3 standards.</p><h4>According to some estimates, Azerbaijan is producing 1 million barrels of oil per day. What is behind such a rapidly increasing production rate?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's oil and gas production is increasing year by year. For instance, 50 million tons of oil and 25 billion cubic meters of gas were produced across the country in 2009, while 51 million tons of oil and 27 billion cubic meters of gas were produced in 2010. It should be mentioned that OPEC, the biggest oil organization in the world, also confirmed the annual increase of oil and gas production in Azerbaijan. According to OPEC estimates, oil production in Azerbaijan reached 1.12 million barrels per day, up by 0.13 million barrels, in 2010. As a result of the “Umid" gas field discovery by SOCAR in 2010, the volume of the approved gas resources of the country reached up to 2.5 trillion cubic meters. To professionally organize the exploration activities for discovering new oil and gas fields, to start the development of some onshore wells after their capital repairs, to implement nanotechnologies in this area to achieve higher effectiveness, to make huge additional investments in the big offshore oil fields to increase productivity, and to prepare the newly discovered fields for potential development are among the major factors stimulating the annual increase of oil and gas production in Azerbaijan. All these are incorporated in the Oil Strategy initiated by Heydar Aliyev, Azerbaijan's visionary former leader.</p><h4>The Nabucco pipeline is considered one of the most important plans of the region in terms of integrated energy supply. How much gas can Azerbaijan be expected to provide to this pipeline?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has always expressed its desire to support the realization of the 3,300-kilometer Nabucco pipeline running from the Caspian Sea to Vienna through Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. The estimated capacity of the pipeline is 31 billion cubic meters per year, while the project will cost ‚¬7.9 billion. In this project, Azerbaijan can be both a supplier and a transit country, and so the project can be considered as a priority in terms of diversifying the routes of transferring natural gas. Based on the confirmed gas reserves of the Caspian region and the Near East, the Nabucco pipeline, which will deliver gas to European countries, will not face any shortage of supply. Iraq, together with Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, is considered one of the potential gas suppliers for Nabucco as well. According to the information provided by BP, Azerbaijan had 1.2 trillion cubic meters of gas, Iraq 3.17 trillion cubic meters, and Turkmenistan 7.94 trillion cubic meters of confirmed gas reserves as of January 1, 2009. After the development of the second phase of the Shah Deniz gas field, it is forecasted to be able to produce 8 billion cubic meters of gas for the Nabucco gas pipeline in the first stage. Over the next several years this volume will, of course, increase year by year. It is necessary to conduct the East-West oil production project through the Caspian Sea, which will ensure the delivery of gas resources from Central Asian countries to the Nabucco pipeline. Azerbaijan will support the project with its infrastructure and other technical capacities and skills.</p><h4>Major reforms in the energy sector started in March 2002. The target for the privatization drive was a 60% to 40% private-public ratio. How is this progressing?</h4><p>The major reforms in the energy sector have begun and a 60-40 private-public ratio was set as a target under the privatization process in the framework of these reforms. Our aim is to serve in the interests of enterprises and move toward improved labor productivity, transparency, and sound competition, as well as enlarged production volumes and more sophisticated goods, and to increase the profitability of enterprises and investment inflows, which are among the major aspects stimulating economic development. Therefore, relevant measures are also being taken to conduct the privatization process in the energy sector in a normal way. For this purpose, many supporting enterprises and much infrastructure belonging to the energy sector have been announced open for privatization. Relevant measures are being taken to privatize the major areas. Currently, the private/public sector balance is 85.8% private, to 14.2% public in the oil production sector, 61.9% private to 38.1% public in natural gas production, and 1.4% private to 98.6% public in the power generation sector. In general, it can be claimed that more than 50% of activity in the oil and gas production and power generation sectors is being conducted by local and foreign private companies. All these can be accepted as major steps in privatizing major production enterprises operating in the energy sector.</p><h4>What is the Ministry doing to encourage FDI in the energy sector and what level of attention have you seen?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has become a geopolitical center not only for its oil and gas resources ,but also for its geographical location in the Caspian and Black Sea regions, where the interests of the US, EU, as well as Asian countries intersect. The “Contract of the Century" signed after independence on the development of the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oil fields began a new era in the Azerbaijani oil sector, with many foreign companies participating. Extractable oil reserves in the ACG fields are estimated at 730 million tons, and up until now, investments made total $65 billion. In addition to its economic significance, the Contract of the Century has helped form the political landscape. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan line led to the establishment of friendly relations in the region, and this in turn has created opportunities for FDI. Azerbaijan is continuing its drive to attract FDI, and in 2009 $2 billion of the total $9.2 billion invested in the Azerbaijani economy came from abroad.</p><h4>Oil and gas activities represent a large share of total GDP, while petroleum exports represent 85% of total exports. What is your outlook for non-oil and gas production in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The non-oil and gas sector experienced a high development trend in 2010, with a 34.2% growth rate in the chemical industry, a 7.9% increase in manufacturing equipment, a 23.3% increase in metallurgy, and 8.4% in oil processing. These figures are an indicator of diverse economic growth over previous years. In the coming years, the establishment of new oil and chemistry complexes with high production capacities and quality standards is planned. Comprehensive reforms in these areas will enable Azerbaijan to export oil, chemical, and industrial products in bigger volumes in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate the EBRD's contribution to the development of the Azerbaijani economy since the start of its operations here?<br></h4><p>We started our activities in Azerbaijan in 1991. Since then we have invested about $1.6 billion in 118 projects in various sectors of the country's economy. Approximately 46% of our current portfolio is invested in the energy sector. The EBRD has financed all the landmark projects in Azerbaijan's energy sector such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oil field and the Shah Deniz gas field. We also provide financing to Azerenerji, the state-owned power utility, which is our largest client in the country. Around 23% of our portfolio is invested in the corporate sector. Most of our clients there tend to be local companies. These projects are often quite small by our standards, with values of less than $5 million. However, we have one large client called Garadagh Cement, which is part of the Holcim Group. Recently it decided to build a dry kiln to replace its four existing wet kilns. This is a large investment project of over ‚¬300 million of which the EBRD is providing ‚¬120 million. The financial sector represents 18% of our portfolio. We work with nine banks, five microfinance institutions, and three non-bank financial institutions. The financial sector is where we are most active, having completed more than 70 projects. The remainder of our portfolio, around 13%, is invested in the infrastructure sector. We financed the railway company, road rehabilitation, and AzerSu, Azerbaijan's water utility. Over the past five years we have invested on average $150 million in 15 projects per year.</p><p>When we came to Azerbaijan in 1991 we were determined to support the process of economic transition. Azerbaijan's achievements over these past 20 years have been impressive and I would like to use this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What tools are you developing to encourage private sector involvement in non-prime sectors?</h4><p>Although 46% of our current portfolio is invested in the energy sector, our new country strategy for Azerbaijan—which was adopted in December 2010—aims to support the diversification of the economy. In principle we are no longer involved in the oil and gas sector because a lot these projects can be financed through commercial means. The EBRD's mandate dictates that we not displace private sector involvement, but instead play a supportive, additional role by investing alongside investors, local or foreign. In Azerbaijan we aim to develop the non-oil economy. We do that by investing in the corporate sector, supporting infrastructure development and deepening financial intermediation by providing financing to local banks and microfinancing institutions that are specifically geared towards SMEs. In addition to providing debt and equity financing we also provide consulting services, often financed through donor grants.</p><h4>How will this strategy pan out in 2011?</h4><p>We are currently assessing several projects in the agribusiness sector. Among others we are considering providing long-term debt financing to help expand existing production facilities at a dairy producer, a food wholesaler, and a soft-drink producer. We are also examining investment opportunities in the manufacturing and service sector. We are negotiating with a leading consumer goods retailer, a medical service provider, and a company that provides chemical mixes for BP. The remaining projects will mainly consist of SME credit facilities to local banks and microfinance institutions. Among the more noticeable transactions in the financial sector, the EBRD plans to support the emerging insurance and consumer finance sectors and participate in Azerbaijan's first convertible bond issue. We are also exploring the possibility of supporting Azerbaijan's rapid infrastructure development. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are very active in this area, and we would like to support infrastructure developments in a similar way.</p><h4>How can Azerbaijan benefit from integrating more into the global economy?</h4><p>The long-term development of Azerbaijan's non-oil economy depends on the country's ability to integrate into the global economy. WTO accession would support economic diversification by creating a stable and predictable framework for importers and exporters, resisting protectionist reflexes and signaling a desire to deepen trade in non-oil goods and services. Closer integration also means becoming a more open economy and attracting foreign investment. Foreign investment is not just about money. Foreign investors bring know-how, set new benchmarks, and increase competition and productivity, which leads to lower prices and better products and services. Azerbaijan boosted its oil and gas production by attracting foreign multinationals and as a result became a very wealthy country. The country should mobilize foreign investment in a similar fashion to boost its non-oil economy.</p><p>However, this is not directly our mandate, which is to facilitate investment whether foreign or local. Of course, if there are foreign investors willing to invest in Azerbaijan we would be happy to support that investment and vice-versa we are accompanying Azerbaijani companies who are investing abroad. In that way we are also helping Azerbaijan to integrate into the global economy.</p><h4>In your view, what is the EBRD's legacy so far as it enters its third decade of operations?</h4><p>We've just marked the 20th anniversary of the inaugural meeting of the EBRD's Board of Governors. In the 20 years since the EBRD started its activities, our institution has achieved a lot in support of economic transition. Our success is partly due to our unique model. The EBRD is owned by governments and international organizations, yet its main task is to promote private businesses. We regard change and development as our goals, but due to our ownership structure we are also able to serve as an anchor of stability in a sometimes rapidly changing and often still unstable environment. Transition is not a mere catchword for the EBRD, but our institution's ultimate purpose.</p><p>The results are impressive. By the end of 2010 the EBRD had committed over ‚¬60 billion and mobilized ‚¬115 billion in third-party financing for overall investments with a total value of nearly ‚¬180 billion in our countries of operations. What is even more remarkable is that the EBRD has consistently been able to deliver on its mandate. With our investments we are pursuing clearly defined goals. It is a testimony to the strength of the EBRD that our institution in its 20th year of existence has demonstrated a high degree of flexibility and adaptability.</p><h4>What is your general outlook on the economy here for the next few years to come, and in what direction will your attention be focused?</h4><p>In the medium term, Azerbaijan will continue to prosper due to its oil and gas revenues. However, to remain successful in the long term Azerbaijan needs to do two things. Firstly, it needs to manage its oil wealth transparently so that it can pass it on to future generations. Azerbaijan deserves credit for being the first country to pass independent validation under the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). However, public expenditure could be improved. In this respect, state-owned public utilities should be encouraged to operate in a more accountable manner and public procurement should be strengthened to use public funds more efficiently.</p><p>Secondly, Azerbaijan needs to implement the necessary structural reforms to promote long-term sustainable growth. That growth will no longer come from oil and gas. Instead, it needs to come from the non-oil economy. Earlier I already mentioned some of these reforms: creating a business environment conducive to investment, opening up the economy, and attracting foreign investment. Of course, there are many other reforms that should be implemented in parallel, but in the economic sphere I believe these are the critical ones.</p><p>If these two requirements are met—transparent management of oil wealth and structural reforms to promote long-term sustainable growth—Azerbaijan will have a bright future for generations to come. The EBRD will continue to support Azerbaijan's economic diversification and assist it in meeting these two requirements.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main directions of SOCAR's current operations?</h4><p>SOCAR is one of the largest energy companies in the world. As a government-owned entity it is responsible for all aspects of the oil and gas industry, including upstream, downstream, and midstream operations. It provides natural gas supply to industry and consumers, conducts large-scale scientific exploration and project works, and sells oil, petrochemical products, and gas on the domestic and international markets. The company successfully represents Azerbaijan in regional projects such as Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli, Shah Deniz, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) main oil and Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum (BTE) gas export pipelines, as well as other oil and gas projects that are implemented together with foreign companies. SOCAR is one of the main participants in all production sharing agreements (PSA) projects in the country jointly developed with foreign partners. Since its foundation, SOCAR has dynamically developed, and its structural improvement was always the focus of the government. At present, 21 structural units operate under SOCAR as legal entities. At the same time, tens of joint ventures (JVs), alliances, and operation companies (OCs) jointly established by foreign companies and SOCAR successfully operate in various spheres of the oil and gas industry.</p><h4>How has Azerbaijan's oil and gas strategy developed since 1992?</h4><p>It is well known that Azerbaijan encountered many difficulties after gaining its independence in the early 1990s. The break of economic relations between Azerbaijan and the Soviet republics, the unstable situation within the country, and the lack of financial and technical supply resulted in a serious crisis for the country's energy industry. President Heydar Aliyev started work to restore and develop the oil industry under the slogan “Oil is the national wealth of Azerbaijan". As a result of Heydar Aliyev's Oil Strategy, a PSA on the exploration and development of the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli fields—later dubbed the “Contract of the Century"—was signed by 11 multinational oil companies from seven countries on September 20, 1994. This international project ensured that Azerbaijan assumed possession of its natural resources and showed the whole world its resolve to protect its national, economic, and strategic interests, as well as guaranteeing the state's independence.</p><h4>How important is foreign investment to Azerbaijan's oil and gas industry?</h4><p>From 1994-2010, foreign investment accounted for about $40 billion of Azerbaijan's oil and gas sector. Over that period, 32 PSAs were signed with multinational energy companies. Under those contracts, some $60 billion is estimated to have been invested. The Contract of the Century is considered the starting point of international cooperation in the Caspian basin, as well as for the integration of the regional economies into the global economy. Today, along with economic profit, the new oil strategy has turned Azerbaijan, which is situated at the junction of West and East, into an  integral part of the world community. At present, 34 international energy companies representing 15 countries are involved in oil and gas operations carried out in 30 fields, both onshore and offshore, in Azerbaijan's territory. Overall, 61 fields have been successfully commissioned in Azerbaijan. The implementation of this strategy has contributed to the modernization of the oil industry and taken it to a new stage of quality improvement. Since the signing the Contract of the Century, SOCAR has successfully represented Azerbaijan in joint projects implemented in the country.</p><h4>Does SOCAR intend to join efforts with other foreign partners in projects abroad?</h4><p>SOCAR has already achieved favorable conditions for expanding our operations. Its huge investments abroad have transformed SOCAR into a multinational company. Our new image is supported by opening enterprises and representations abroad, as well as participating in the large-scale projects implemented in those countries. SOCAR's activities in the petrochemical sphere in Turkey are highly estimated by experts. The management of the Petkim company, the largest petrochemical enterprise in Turkey, is carried out within the SOCAR-Turcas alliance. To supply Petkim with reliable raw materials, the SOCAR-Turcas JV plans to construct the new Ege Oil Refinery in the production area of the petrochemical complex in the Aliağa region near Izmir in Turkey. The construction of the plant will contribute to Petkim's increased productivity, meaning SOCAR's oil products will enter the Turkish market. SOCAR is also implementing investment projects in neighboring Georgia, where it is the largest investor and taxpayer. SOCAR also conducts various projects in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Switzerland, the UAE, and other countries. All of these projects strengthen SOCAR's position in the international market and expand the opportunities of our export operations from the shores of the Black and Mediterranean seas.</p><h4>It was announced that 2010 was the “Year of Ecology". To what extent does SOCAR consider ecological issues in its operations and decisions?</h4><p>SOCAR has taken continuous and decisive steps in environmental protection by improving our management systems of ecological safety and coordinating international requirements, solving ecological problems, decreasing the negative affects on the environment and the health of people, and the effective use of natural resources. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) on the exploration and development of oil and gas fields, and the corresponding monitoring to solve ecological problems, were conducted for the first time in 2010. Throughout the year, large-scale works have been carried out to restore the natural landscape in Bibiheybatneft, Balakhanineft, Siyazanneft, Absheronneft Oil and Gas Production Departments of Azneft Production Union, oil and gas production departments named after Taghiyev, Amirov and Narimanov, Muradkhanly and Garachukhur oil-mining, as well as in the areas of JVs and OCs. About 50 hectares of polluted land has been cleaned up and re-cultivated, and artificial ponds have been drained. In addition, design estimates have been prepared for the re-cultivation of 450 hectares of oil-polluted lands. Bioremediation methods have been applied to clean up polluted lands. In 2010, 164 square meters were cleaned of oil sludge and replaced with fertile soil. Azerbaijan holds one of the leading places among the Caspian basin countries for taking comprehensive measures on the protection of the sea surface and aquatic areas from pollution. Continuous monitoring and analysis of the physical and chemical properties of the aquatic environment, oil products, and bottom sediments and the anthropogenic impact level are studied to assess the impact of oil and gas production on the Caspian Sea's ecosystem.</p><h4>Does SOCAR intend to participate in gas transportation projects such as Nabucco?</h4><p>The creation of a reliable gas transit system under the second phase of the Shah Deniz project and from other fields is one of the our main priorities. Azerbaijani gas is considered one of the main sources of Nabucco, the Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy (ITGI), and Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) that are priority projects for the provision of energy security for EU countries. Currently, SOCAR experts are seeking favorable options for Azerbaijan's gas supply to the EU on the basis of long-term agreements. Azerbaijan supports the modern Silk Way-Southern Corridor creating new, direct energy and transportation relations with the EU and other regions.</p><p>SOCAR sees the opening of a new gas supply corridor within this strategy as an important factor for the stability of the European gas market. We actively cooperate with the companies that propose these projects and we are trying to choose the most attractive project based on long-term transit principles including reliability and commercial benefits as well as being able to access the main European markets. We have not yet decided which project to choose.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did AXA choose MBASK to be its partner in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>AXA has a strategy to invest in emerging markets. After having studied all the possibilities, AXA decided to invest first in the Caucasus, starting from Azerbaijan. This country was chosen specifically because of its huge potential, large population, stable financial system, and positive signals in the forecasts for the coming years. AXA sees great potential in the retail business in Azerbaijan. The banking industry is also very active in this environment, in order to produce the credit loans and mortgages for individuals, as well as other products. This is in line with AXA's main strategy, which is financial protection for individuals.</p><h4>What are your strategies for developing the retail insurance sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>A clear long-term strategy is required to develop the right environment. It has to be well understood by the whole market that the distribution network is very important. It is not possible to grow in this market via bancassurance, and also the culture is not ready for direct sales such as internet or mobile technologies. That's why the first element on which we are focusing is distribution channels. AXA plans to co-operate with the sector as a whole, and with the Ministry of Finance and its insurance department, in order to create this awareness in the market. We hope that in a very short period of time professional agency-ship will become a recognized profession. In addition to the distribution network it is also clear that we will invest to increase the insurance awareness in the country by providing customer-oriented solutions.</p><h4>What penetration rates are you targeting?</h4><p>In Azerbaijan, the penetration ratio for motor damage policies is very low. It's less than 10%. We only have obligatory motor third-party liability insurance, for which the penetration rate should be 100%, but is currently in the region of 50%. That's why the industry must come together to increase awareness, to increase service quality, and to encourage people to buy insurance. In the second half of 2011 we expect new obligatory insurance products to provide leverage to the insurance market, thanks to the regulatory office and their efforts on that.</p><h4>What regulatory changes would you like to see to improve the insurance environment?</h4><p>First of all, the regulator in Azerbaijan works very hard to understand the insurance markets worldwide. It performs research and brings in many good ideas. It looks to European standards in terms of reserves, solvency, distribution, capitalization, products, and so on. However, it will take time to get the right framework in place. Firstly, it focuses on the good financial health of a company. This is important, because if a company fails in claim payments, it affects the whole market. Secondly, it is very open minded in terms of foreign investments and foreign applications, and this is very positive.</p><h4>How do you differentiate your products in order to be unique?</h4><p>Differentiating services is a challenge. Products consist of three elements: the product itself, contact management with your client, and claim services. In order to achieve the preferred level we put a focus on customer-focused organization at each level. We have invested also heavily in IT and see it as crucial in order to deliver the best service to our distribution channel and clients. In that regard, AXA looks to be the sector leader.</p><h4>What kind of projects do you have in the IT field?</h4><p>AXA has invested in insurance software, which is going to be online for all distribution channels and regional offices. We promise online services to our clients, and to our partners. We offer 24/7 customer service, not only via our distribution channel, but also via our customer service center. We call it the customer care management model, and it is part of our quest to create a customer-oriented organization.</p><h4>How does AXA MBASK tie into AXA's regional network?</h4><p>AXA Sigorta Turkey is crucial and a very important best practice for us, and this is the Turkish wing of AXA Global. For HR and training we use its HR department as a co-partner in our activities by people hiring or by reorganizing the company. We use the regionalization and profit-center model of AXA Sigorta, and we utilize AXA Sigorta's leading position in Turkey in terms of its distribution network management, and we know very well how to manage the distribution network via IT solutions. In claims management, we bring here all the best practices applicable for Azerbaijan. But always—and this is a rule of the game in our country, in our company, and in the AXA world—we really think globally, but we realize, operate, and manage with local teams. We try to engage local people in global thinking.</p><h4>Is it hard to find skilled people to work in the insurance sector?</h4><p>We are lucky, because MBASK already had a very skilled team, and we have continued with them. There is only one person over the medium term that we hired from AXA Sigorta, and he is now the CFO and the CIO of the company. He came from Turkey, while the rest are 100% Azerbaijani.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for 2011 and onwards, and how do you see the size, nature, and direction of the Azerbaijani insurance market?</h4><p>The Azerbaijani insurance market is not producing enough premiums. It has to start to see the opportunity, and there is potential here. The insurance market is only focused on bancassurance and corporate risks but we should not miss the potential in retail or SME customers. This market closed the year 2010 with a premium level of AZN155 million, which is very low. Our company produced roughly AZN8.5 million in 2010, which is also low. For 2011, from a market perspective, the 1Q results show that it will be a difficult, but 2011 will be a recovery year compared to 2010.</p><h4>Did global prices affect the insurance market?</h4><p>In Azerbaijan, yes, but in 2010 we saw the first signs of recovery. We are now working hard to push growth. All the managers in this company are focusing very much on operational excellence, differentiating our services, lowering expenses, and creating the advantage of differentiation in order to give the best service and price to our agents and clients. This is the unique solution on the way to being preferred.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>It has been some 17 years since the so-called “Contract of the Century" was signed between BP and Azerbaijan. What level of investment has gone into making the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) field such a success?<br></h4><p>The ACG field is a fantastic asset that has hugely contributed to the country's national development turning Azerbaijan into the leading country in the region and supporting regional stability and economic development. We at BP are proud to be the operator of this world-class field that has made us a significant part of Azerbaijan's independent history. To date a total of over $24 billion of investment has been made in the development of the ACG field. In addition, a further $6 billion in investment was committed by the project's shareholders in 2010 through the new Chirag Oil Project. These numbers are huge by all standards.</p><p>If we add to these figures the $10 billion of revenues the project delivers to Azerbaijan every year, the billions of cubic meters of free associated gas, the new facilities built on the most up-to-date design and technology, one of the largest oil and gas storage and processing terminals in the world, a sophisticated web of subsea pipelines, existing facilities refurbished and upgraded to world standards, and tens of thousands of new job opportunities, then the overall benefits from ACG to the country and the region will rise to a huge and extremely impressive scale. The ACG contract has also meant tens of millions of dollars of investment in social development projects, including educational programs, building skills, and capabilities in local communities, improving access to social infrastructure in communities, supporting local enterprises through the provision of access to finance and training as well as technical assistance to public institutions. Clearly, ACG's overall impact on the country's economic development has been massive.</p><h4>What is the current level of production from this field, and what sort of production life do you see the field potentially having?</h4><p>The field is currently producing about 800,000 barrels a day from five production platforms. We are currently building a sixth production platform expected to start up in 2013. From the start of production in November 1997 until the end of May 2011 about 1.8 billion barrels of oil were produced at ACG. To date we have sent over 1,540 tanker loads of ACG crude to world markets via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, which is another world-class project that has enabled Azerbaijan to re-establish its name in the oil history of the world. The total estimated oil production volumes from ACG are expected to be over 5 billion barrels—a huge field that ranks very high in the global industry, and I believe   with further investments and the application of new technologies it will continue to hold one of the top-ranking positions among the world's high-quality fields for more than a decade.</p><h4>What sort of a working relationship has BP had with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), and in what areas is it seeking to develop this relationship further?</h4><p>We are very proud of our record of partnership in Azerbaijan. Since day one of our presence in this country we have seen the continued support and goodwill of the government, SOCAR, and the people of Azerbaijan. This partnership has been at the heart of all the projects we have led—the ACG, BTC, and Shah Deniz developments. This has been a true partnership, the success of which has been a key driver of Azerbaijan's rapid economic development over the past 17 years. This partnership has been a driving force in turning the nation's vision into a reality, and today's reality is that Azerbaijan enjoys unparalleled economic growth and prosperity, and strong and irreversible independence. It is a regional leader and is strongly linked with its neighbors and the rest of the world. This partnership has generated tens of billions of dollars in revenues and will continue to generate massive revenues for many years to come. BP has a long-term commitment to this partnership and we look forward to new joint projects and initiatives both under the already concluded exploration deals and in new opportunities. BP has proven to be Azerbaijan's reliable partner, offering its international expertise and standards, technologies and processes, and creating opportunities to combine these with Azerbaijan's outstanding experience and knowledge of the Caspian basin. This combination has to date yielded very good results benefiting all of the parties involved.</p><h4>How significant is Azerbaijan to BP's global operations?</h4><p>Well, firstly, I would like to highlight that our activities in Azerbaijan form a very important part of BP's global business. In Azerbaijan we are the operator of two major upstream projects, three export pipelines, and two exploration projects. Our activities here also extend to Georgia and Turkey. ACG, with its multi-billion-barrel estimated volumes, is one of the largest reservoirs in BP's portfolio. The planned Shah Deniz full-field development is the largest gas development project operated by BP in the world. This project is expected to export gas to the EU through a new southern corridor that will for the first time link the region with Europe. We regard our new deal with Azerbaijan—the joint exploration and development of the Shafag-Asiman offshore block in the Caspian Sea—as an exciting opportunity that inspires hopes that, in addition to the existing opportunities, Azerbaijan can become a future growth area in BP's global business. As a native Azerbaijani, I am really proud that the business I lead in this region ranks at the top of BP's global business based on the quality of the projects, the benefits it delivers to all parties, and the opportunities it offers for long-term successful partnership in the region.</p><h4>How successful has the Shah Deniz field been in production terms? What can we expect from Stage 2 of the project?</h4><p>Shah Deniz is a huge gas field that BP and SOCAR discovered in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea in May 1999. With over 1 trillion cubic meters of gas in place, it is one of the world's giant gas fields. Production from the field started in 2006—just seven years after discovery. Since that time the field has been delivering gas to the markets of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey within the first stage of development, which can produce approximately 9 billion cubic meters of gas per year and about 50,000 barrels of condensate per day. The success of Stage 1 has been key to developing the next stage of Shah Deniz, which we call full-field development, and is one of the largest gas developments in the world and will provide a further 16 billion cubic meters of gas to the markets of Europe, with the first gas scheduled for 2017. The Shah Deniz full-field development project will include two new bridge-linked production platforms, 26 subsea wells to be drilled with two semi-submersible rigs, and 500 kilometers of subsea pipelines in water depths of up to 550 meters. SOCAR and the Shah Deniz partners have signed a five-year extension to the Shah Deniz Production Sharing Agreement (PSA). The Shah Deniz export transit organization has been established in Ankara to work with Turkey's BOTAÅž and the main prospective EU pipeline groups including Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy Poseidon (ITGI), Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), and Nabucco. The Shah Deniz consortium has requested a firm conditional tariff by October 1, 2011 from all the pipeline groups to enable the selection to be made in the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Statoil's entrance into the Azerbaijani market?<br></h4><p>Statoil made an early entry into Azerbaijan in 1992, and secured participation in the two major offshore projects developed in the 1990s: the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oil field, the Shah Deniz gas and condensate field, as well as their corresponding pipelines, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC), and the South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP). Statoil has an 8.56% share in ACG and 25.5% in the Shah Deniz field. Both fields are operated by BP. Statoil is the operator of the Azerbaijan Gas Supply Company (AGSC) and has, through this, the commercial leadership for the Shah Deniz gas field sales. Furthermore, Statoil is the commercial operator of the South Caucasus Pipeline Company (SCPC). Currently, we are actively working to develop Stage 2 of the Shah Deniz gas and condensate field.</p><h4>What is Statoil's role in the development of ACG?</h4><p>While our share in the ACG field is a limited one at 8.56%, this prolific field is nevertheless among Statoil's top international fields in terms of equity production, and we are contributing actively both commercially and technically to enhance our interests in ACG in close cooperation with BP, the operator, SOCAR, and other partner companies.</p><h4>What level of investment has Statoil made in the ACG field, and what are the company's key expectations from that development?</h4><p>As of end of 2010, only 50% of the total full field development capital expenditure was made. Currently, a new platform, the sixth in the field called the Chirag West Platform, is under construction in Baku and first oil is scheduled for November 2013. In addition, 12 to 15 new wells are put into production each year.</p><h4>Do you see a need for the Nabucco project, and what sort of production guarantees would need to be met to make it feasible?</h4><p>The Shah Deniz consortium needs robust, timely, and cost-effective transport solutions for its gas within the time schedule on which this large project is based, i.e. to cater for first gas from 2017. Statoil prefers transport concepts that are the most competitive on those parameters, and that will therefore bring maximum value to the license partners and the government of Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What are some of the unique aspects of doing business in Azerbaijan in comparison to the 30 or more other markets that Statoil operates in?</h4><p>Oil revenue management is a big challenge for any country that is still developing its infrastructure, institutions, and civil service. Azerbaijan has taken on this challenge by establishing a professional organization with its own State Oil Fund (SOFAZ). Over the course of the past five years under SOFAZ leadership, Azerbaijan has managed to be the first country in the world to be validated by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Statoil was and still is an active EITI participant. The projects and operations in which Statoil plays a major role have already contributed considerably to the improvement of both the local and national economy in Azerbaijan. The revenues that Azerbaijan gains through petroleum projects give the country a unique opportunity to develop infrastructure, create jobs, and increase the well being of its population.</p><h4>How do you think Statoil's Norwegian experience could be of use to Azerbaijan as it seeks to better employ its resource wealth?</h4><p>Norway and Statoil have always been keen on sharing experiences with Azerbaijan. For example, Norway shared its expertise with Azerbaijan with regard to oil revenue management. And a Statoil-supported introductory visit by some key Azerbaijani officials back in 1999 to Norway was useful for the establishment of SOFAZ. However, apart from the oil revenue management, Statoil, as the largest gas exporter to Europe, could share its expertise in the marketing of gas in Europe by establishing gas value chains. As the world's largest operator in waters deeper than 100 meters, Statoil could share expertise in subsea technology. Equally, as the world leader in carbon storage and CO2 efficiency in oil and gas production, it could share expertise  as well.</p><h4>How has Statoil been looking to integrate local Azerbaijani staff into its operations?</h4><p>We have about 60 employees in our Baku office. Only 14, or 25%, of our employees are expatriates. We have one Azerbaijani employee in the management team in Baku, but this number will increase. Apart from that we have five Azerbaijani nationals in mid-level management positions. Currently, 10 Azerbaijani nationals from the Baku office are working in Statoil offices in Norway, the UK, and Russia.</p><h4>What projects has Statoil been involved in to help protect the environment?</h4><p>As an oil production country with a history of over 150 years, and very intensive production in Soviet times, Azerbaijan has a legacy of environmental problems to address. In recent years the government, mostly managed by SOCAR and in cooperation with the World Bank, is swiftly addressing many of the environmental pollution legacies left behind. Statoil actively seeks to assist in this area, either at the invitation of SOCAR or in projects that are managed within the partnership. Generally, Statoil applies the same environmental standards as in other countries. Statoil contributes to bringing environmental standards to a level above national legislative requirements. In Azerbaijan, Statoil helped establish an environmental laboratory in cooperation with Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, financed and provided with guest lecturers on ecological and environmental studies at Baku's Western University. One of Statoil's environmental protection activities is being co-funder of a program for environmental monitoring of the Kura and Aras rivers in the South Caucasus, together with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and NATO. Since 2008, Statoil has organized a series of environment seminars for SOCAR sharing Statoil's experience in this area. At the seminars, among other places, Statoil shared its vast experience in Environmental Management Systems (EMS) and the tools and resources used by the company in day-to-day operations, waste management legislation and technologies, oil spill preparedness, and so on.</p><h4>What is your medium-term outlook for the oil and gas sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In the short to medium term, the development of the Shah Deniz Stage 2 project to open the southern corridor and make Azerbaijan a major supplier of gas to Europe is a very exciting development for the country and for all of the companies that are involved. We also see additional opportunities for further developments both in Azerbaijan and in the region beyond Azerbaijan. The country has, since Statoil first entered in 1992, developed what today is one of the world's leading petroleum regions. Azerbaijan is one of Statoil's top international assets, and remains a key priority in our international strategy. We are excited to continue to deepen our collaboration with SOCAR and the government of Azerbaijan in the next phase.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TPAO is one of the key investors in Azerbaijan. Which oil and gas projects TPAO is involved in the country, and what levels of activity are you seeing in the sector?<br></h4><p>TPAO has shares in four significant projects: ACG, Shah Deniz, BTC, and SCP. The ACG project is focused on oil production in the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field and the Shah Deniz Project is one of the largest natural gas-condensate fields in the world. In the ACG project, a single development plan, composed of seven platforms, has been completed. An eighth platform, called the Chirag oil project, is also under construction. Daily production from the ACG field is around 800,000 bbl/d. This production is transported through three export routes: from the Sangachal terminal in Azerbaijan to Supsa via the Western Route Export Pipeline (WREP), then to Batumi by rail, and then via the BTC pipeline to Ceyhan on Turkey's Mediterranean coast. At the Shah Deniz project, first stage operations are seeing production exported to Georgia, Azerbaijan, and BOTAÅž, Turkey's state-owned crude oil and natural gas pipeline and trading company. The second phase of development for this project is currently being evaluated. The first stage of gas production is targeted to come online in 2017. As can be understood, there has been an increase in demand for natural gas from Europe, Italy, and Eastern Europe. In addition to this, there is an ongoing exploration project called Absheron in Azerbaijan, which is expected to finish drilling the first exploration well in 2011. In addition, the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) has been exploring the Umid-Babek prospect areas. In my opinion, there is a high chance of discovering a further hydrocarbon resource offshore in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What sort of fields will we see coming online in the more distant future?</h4><p>As mentioned by the President of Azerbaijan, the country's gas fields will likely reach their full potential in the next decade. In addition, an agreement has been signed between SOCAR and BP for the Shafag-Asiman D8-D10 blocks. In contrast to years past, the oil and gas industry is growing steadily as a result of a decrease in the risk profile for Azerbaijan. A contentious issue also exists in the form of the Araz-Alov-Sharg fields, which is a reservoir the ownership of which is being contested by Iran and Azerbaijan. Overall, the operating agreements covering the Shah Deniz field will end in 2036, whereas for ACG they will end in 2024.</p><h4>To what extent will Azerbaijan's reserves help to contribute to the Nabucco pipeline project?</h4><p>TPAO is an investor company in the Shah Deniz field. Except for Shah Deniz, all other projects are under developmental stages in Azerbaijan. Therefore, if other exploration projects conclude commercially feasible gas developments, then an aggregation all of this gas volume might help the realization of the Nabucco project.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Azerbaijan's role as an energy hub in the future?</h4><p>Today, Azerbaijan exports more than 1 billion barrels of crude oil from the ACG oil project via BTC to the world. I believe that this amount will rise rapidly in the coming years depending on the country's political relations with the world. Europe is looking at opening up gas pipeline routes via Turkey. Turkey also has a powerful determination and motivation to become an energy hub in that regard.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key areas is your Ministry focusing on at the moment?</h4><p>Our focus is to be clear with our environmental policy. At the time the new ministry was established, there were several quasi ministries that had existed since the Soviet era. These included state committees for ecology and the rational use of natural resources, hydrometeorology, forestry, geology, and fisheries. The Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources is responsible for the protection of 1.25 million hectares of forests. Unfortunately, part of this territory is under Armenian occupation, and we are not able to protect it as we would like.</p><p>We have reforested 6,000 to 10,000 hectares of land partly from planting and partly from allowing nature to regenerate itself. We still have a serious problem with overgrazing. The liberalization of economics allowed people to do the easiest things with very small investments, such as with livestock grazing. Geological surveys are also an important part of my ministry's operations. Over the last decade we have discovered 125 new deposits of valuable materials including gold, silver, platinum, copper, and so on.</p><h4>Are you talking with industry leaders to try and find a balance between the public and private sectors regarding the environment?</h4><p>We try to play a regulatory role in terms of the human impact on the environment. This is the strategy for most sectors in terms of standards for clean drinking water, wastewater, and the re-cultivation of lands. We are a former territory of the Soviet Union, which was very seriously affected by heavy industrial development. Around 1.5 billion tons of oil, which by modern prices is around a trillion dollars, was removed from the Absheron peninsula over the course of 150 years. Some Soviet history books say that the USSR's industrialization was paid for by the sale of pictures from certain galleries. That is just a romantic story. You cannot compete with the Western bloc by just selling a few pictures to Western countries. It was paid for mostly by Azerbaijani oil. What we got was the legacy.</p><p>Its extraction industry was based on the most primitive technologies. The Soviets produced the oil so that it spilled into a lake and then by bucket it was put into a cistern and then exported. As a result, we have 30,000 hectares of heavily contaminated land. A lot of investment is now being put into cleaning up the mess, mostly by the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR). It owns a lot of this land, and we need to maintain good standards in these areas.</p><h4>In Azerbaijan, 2010 was declared the “Year of Ecology". What were the results?</h4><p>It was a tough year for us, and we worked hard, but it was positive for the public as lots of projects were fulfilled and tangible results were achieved. We already had some green areas here in and around Baku, and we added to them considerably. This is actually an arid area. You cannot just plant a tree and watch it grow like in the UK. We had to provide the right soil. We had to clean up the oil contamination. Then we had to secure the water resources to irrigate these trees. Precipitation is very low on the Absheron peninsula, and mineralization in the soil is a problem in some areas. In one year alone we turned 1,420 hectares of the peninsula green. This is a huge achievement as all of those hectares were irrigated. We then installed drainage systems to take away salty ground water. We put in a lot of fertilizer, most of which was natural. We then planted trees, including 400 hectares of olive orchards. We chose to plant olive orchards not for agricultural purposes, but because we identified the breed as stable and ideal for these conditions. We realized many other projects, too, over the course of the year. Such projects include drip irrigation systems, a clean, safe water supply for the villages by Kura River Basin, and much more.</p><h4>Everyone knows about the caviar in the Caspian Sea and the protection of the sturgeon fish. Has your ministry been involved in trying to help support the population and regulate fishing and the companies involved?</h4><p>First of all, it is difficult because there are five countries that have interests in the Caspian Sea. Some countries support the idea of a moratorium on fishing sturgeon. We are now in discussions with some of our neighbors about that. The second thing is that countries are politicizing the environmental issues at hand. They are trying to define different types of sturgeon, such as a Russian sturgeon, which that country then has a right over. There is also, apparently, a Persian sturgeon—yet there is no river where the sturgeon could thrive. In that regard, this is really an environmental issue.</p><h4>When can we expect to see an Azerbaijani sturgeon?</h4><p>I was wondering why we did not have one. We could enforce rules by which all the species have to be named after each country. It sounds funny, but it is a reality. There was a meeting in Baku of the five Caspian Presidents that took place some months ago. They decided to introduce this moratorium and work on it. On the other hand, Azerbaijan is in the middle of an intense period of development. We borrowed money from the World Bank and we built the largest and most modern hatchery. We release 15 million sturgeon fry a year. This is the only country that has taken responsibility and introduced a type of ban on two species of sturgeon fish; the barbel sturgeon and the beluga. We catch them only for reproduction purposes. Poaching is, however, an issue. Yet, most of the fish poachers catch are those we have released in the last seven or eight years. This shows the success we have had in increasing the population. The sturgeon is a very timid fish. It will not leave the area it lives in unless it is big enough to venture into deep water and can defend itself. We have observed this process for some time. It is not good, but it reflects the success we have had. We hope to develop common rules for all five countries to use the Caspian Sea, while taking into account biodiversity as well as economic interests.</p><h4>What sort of things has Azerbaijan done in regards to conforming to the Kyoto process?</h4><p>We try to encourage businesses to be more environmentally friendly, especially in terms of the atmosphere. We have had some major achievements. When the Soviet Union broke up, Azerbaijan was in quite a unique situation. Soviet industry was not a collection of national industries; it was one centralized complex. After the break up, most of our industry died out. We had to survive by developing alternatives based on modern technology. We succeeded with an industry that is four times the size it was. Compared to 1991, when we joined the Kyoto process, we produce half the level of carbon that we are allowed. Additionally, we have not sold our quota to another state. What we have reduced is roughly equal to what Spain is emitting per year.</p><h4>Are there going to be any new laws regarding the environment coming in the near future?</h4><p>The general trend is to harmonize with EU standards. There are some gaps as we are still using certain legal documents inherited from the Soviet Union. It is standard practice to use Soviet laws if there are no specific Azerbaijani laws. However, when a law is developed, it is based on EU standards. There is nothing unexpected in the pipeline, and nothing that will surprise people that want to invest. If the investors are coming from the US or Europe, it will only make the situation more familiar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the origins of Cahan Holding, and in what sectors is it involved in?</h4><p>Cahan Holding was established in 1995 in the city of Nakhchivan. Our first main sector was the automobile sector and the main development of the holding company started after 2000. Now we have operations in many different sectors including automobile, industry, and services. We also officially represent some well-known brands in Azerbaijan. At the moment, our company has over 3,000 employees.</p><h4>Which are your most significant sectors?</h4><p>Right now we are focusing our attention on the industrial sector—we have four large factories. One of them is a tobacco factory and we buy raw materials from Zimbabwe and India and then produce in Nakhchivan. The other is a tea factory, to which we bring in material from Sri Lanka, and then package and distribute it throughout the country. We also have an industrial interest in building materials and construction. We produce air conditioning and heating systems. Our raw materials and components come from Turkey, and we manufacture the units in Nakhchivan before exporting them to different countries. Additionally, we produce 80 different plastic products under Cahan Pen, including plastic doors and windows as well as latches. Since we buy raw materials and components from different countries we decided to open our own offices in Turkey, Kazakhstan, China, the UAE, Iran, and Switzerland. Across all of our offices we employ Azerbaijani citizens as well as locals.</p><h4>What are the benefits in representing international brands in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We want to bring more international companies to Azerbaijan. Right now, we are talking to Ikea about coming to Azerbaijan. We have a site ready for it. We also want to bring in Burger King. We are a very young country, and so we are still learning. Working with these brands helps us develop our own management and marketing practices, as well as improves our economy. International brands are very specific, but at the same time we have our own ideas for the future. As we work with them, we gain experience. We know what they want and we try to push our limits. We are also constructing two duty free shops in Nakhchivan. We are working with Heinemann from Germany on this project as it is the largest international duty free company. There are 21 companies that operate under Cahan Holding. One of them represents Wyndham Group from the US—the Days Brand, also JT International, Berhad, and Redbull, as well as tea brands such as Alokozay Tea, AlFakher, Ahmad Tea, and Akbar. We also import Cuban cigars. In the automobile sector we have four showrooms for the Opel brand. One is in Nakhchivan and the other three are in Baku. We also have a large trade center in Nakhchivan that boasts 500 shops.</p><h4>What is Cahan's strategy in the banking sector?</h4><p>Nahçıvan Bank operates under Cahan Holding, but we don't limit ourselves to just our own bank. We work with International Bank of Azerbaijan and Bank Standard as well. Our bank is very young, and naturally other banks have more experience than us. Our bank is only two years old, and so we are trying to learn from our competitors.</p><h4>Cahan has diversified a lot over the years. How did this help during the crisis?</h4><p>Diversity helped us benefit from the crisis. The construction sector was very badly affected, but our agribusiness segment boomed. This brought a certain level of balance. In 2008 we grew 12% and in 2009 we grew 9%. The first couple of months in 2011 show that it is going to be a good year. In Azerbaijan, the budget is getting bigger and consumer buying power is growing. Furthermore, President Ilham Aliyev reformed the pension system. Previously, people who retired after 2006 were paid more than those who retired before 2006. Now they have increased the pensions of people who retired before 2006. This affects the market positively. Our President is very innovative and he wants to develop the country, which is positive for us.</p><h4>How do you coordinate your operations between Baku and Nakhchivan? How would you compare the two cities?</h4><p>Nakhchivan is an inseparable part of Azerbaijan. Because of Nakhchivan is close to Turkey,  it is the best-developed region in Azerbaijan. There are five-star hotels in Nakhchivan that can be compared to hotels in London. Turkey is developed in terms of industry, management, and tourism. In 2008-2009, many Turkish employees came to Nakhchivan to work and we learned a lot from them. People are very straightforward and hard -working there.</p><h4>In what areas do you see the holding expanding in the short term?</h4><p>We need to focus more on industry. We have a tobacco business, and we want to produce more quality products and export abroad. Additionally, we are planning to establish a tile manufacturing facility. It is a ‚¬5 million investment. We want to manufacture and sell our own products. We have made a start with construction materials and we have an advantage compared with Turkey because we have low tax agreements with CIS countries.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of Azerbaijan's economy in the medium term?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is very young country and its development is faster than any other country within the region. Its people are clever and learn quickly. In 10 years, Azerbaijan will be in a much better position. Geographically Azerbaijan sits in a good place. We have a young population and bountiful natural resources. We predict strong development in Azerbaijan's future. Everybody should work towards realizing this economic development potential. Our people should be well educated. Before there weren't so many people who studied abroad, but now there are a lot. This trend will see more ideas brought back from abroad, and this can only be positive.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the creation of AzMeCo in 2007?<br></h4><p>I used to work in Russia at StroyTransGasOil and came back to Azerbaijan in 2007 when we decided to set up this company and establish a methanol plant, mostly for ecological reasons. Mr. George Olan, a Nobel Prize winner for chemistry, declared that methanol is the 21st century energy source. It is a clean source of energy. With this in mind, the company established its first plant. Around that time, alternative energy was the main issue of discussion across the world, and methanol was one of the alternative energy sources being discussed widely. Currently, Dimethyl ether (DME) is a very well-accepted alternative energy resource internationally, and is a derivative of methanol. It is an alternative to diesel engine fuel. Some leading companies, such as Nissan and Volvo, have begun to use DME in their vehicles, and this is a good example of a renewable energy source being used in the market right now. Compared to diesel, DME is clean burning and contains no sulfur. There are further technological applications for methanol, including its use in batteries. Such batteries can be used to charge telephones and computers while on the move. This is a technology being utilized by Sony and Toshiba, to name just a couple. The possibilities are endless and the advantages it holds over traditional engine fuel are stark. As methanol is a hydrogen carrier, it makes the handling process very simple. There is no danger of a spill, and the substance easily disseminates in water and evaporates from surfaces.</p><h4>What is your estimated timeline for the completion of the plants and the distribution of the product?</h4><p>We have a 10-year plan. First, the plant will be commissioned at the end of 2011, and the next phase will be to begin producing DME. A filling station will be established, and the technology for such a project already exists in some other countries. To further these goals we are engaged in talks with the government and hope to implement the technology as soon as possible. In 10 years time, we are aiming to pass on this technology to trucks, buses, and various other types of vehicles.</p><h4>What will the capacity of the methanol plant be?</h4><p>The methanol plant will have a capacity of 560,000 tons a year. This will throw up another issue, quite literally, in the form of expelled carbon dioxide. We plan to use a mechanism allowing us to capture 140,000 tons of CO2 per year and re-inject it into the mix, and thus increase capacity to 720,000 tons per year. It will enable us to receive carbon credits from the Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund (MCCF), created by the joint initiative of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). For the DME derivative, we are planning to produce 100,000 tons a year. The President declared that 2010 would be the “Year of Ecology", and these drives have continued into 2011. For this reason, we hope to be able to fulfill our aim of seeing trucks and buses using DME as an alternative fuel.</p><h4>What assistance have you had in setting up this operation?</h4><p>Several companies are working on DME technology, and the overall aim is to see DME used across Azerbaijan. In support of our goals, the International Bank of Azerbaijan has provided financial support for us to be able to establish the company and construct the plant. In terms of partners we also have agreements with some European, Russian, and Canadian banks. We also work in close cooperation with the Ministry of Emergency Situations and the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. We are very proud to be a large private petrochemical company in Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>When did Borusan initially come to Azerbaijan, and what were the strategic interests the company was pursuing in coming here?</h4><p>Our first installation was in 1997, and was based on extensive analysis that convinced us of the potential in the country. Our initial interest was to support a forthcoming pipeline project. Until 2006, our operations were then limited to the support of existing pipeline operations; however, around this time the country started to increase its oil income with the help of the BTC and South Caucasus Pipeline operations. This brought a tremendous change, with sector revenues increasing dramatically. We also saw opportunities in the sectors supported by the income generated by the oil and gas industry, namely the service and construction sectors. We needed to remain flexible when we first came to Azerbaijan, because our sector's revenues and opportunities at that time were very limited, and things have gone from strength to strength since 2006.</p><h4>What sort of products do you primarily provide in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Our main line of business is earth-moving equipment, and we are the sole licensed dealer of Caterpillar equipment in Turkey, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kyrgyzstan. Before the recent financial crisis, Caterpillar generated about $51 billion in revenue worldwide. We also deal in generators and agricultural equipment. We are a sector leader in every respect, especially in earth-moving equipment, as well as in generators. But in Azerbaijan, we mostly deal with just two types of equipment: earth-moving equipment for construction, and generators, especially for industrial and oil and gas applications.</p><h4>Who are your primary competitors in the Azerbaijani market, and what is your market share?</h4><p>Our market share stands at around 20% during times of normal business activity, yet it is a constantly changing environment. Our primary competitor for high-quality products is Komatsu, yet Chinese companies also command a good portion of the market with low-class products, as there is a lack of European-style quality requirements in Azerbaijan. We would like to see such standards introduced to this country, as quality products benefit productivity and also addresses environmental concerns.</p><h4>How significant are after-sales services to overall revenues?</h4><p>In order to make customer support income significant, we need to increase the penetration rate in the country, and increase our market share. Once there is a solid base of running equipment, we can expect to obtain reasonable revenues from after-sales service. We currently have a special service agreement with BP in which 25% of our profits come from services. We hope to increase the overall importance of after-sales revenues to total revenues in the future with similar deals, as the market only began to build up in 2006 and remains fairly shallow.</p><h4>Is there much of a market for earth-moving equipment when it comes to building infrastructure such as highways, roads, and railways?</h4><p>Yes. We have looked at the economy sector by sector: general construction, mining, oil and gas, and the other sectors as well. But in this country, because mining is not a major interest, there are two reasonable sectors for us to target: general construction, and oil and gas. There are also some investment projects we are involved in, including big hotels and shopping centers. But mostly, general construction involves the construction of infrastructure.</p><h4>What sort of reforms do you think would help improve your operations in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>A few large companies dominate the sector, and these few companies win most of the large project contracts. These companies represent our main competition, and sell similar equipment. When large companies win projects and sell competitor brand equipment, it makes the market less competitive. Right now, there is a limited group of companies that can work on the available projects. One possible opportunity for us would be if these larger companies hired smaller companies to work on portions of these large projects. Otherwise, if we cannot capture the large projects, we have no chance to sell our equipment.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the sector in 2011, and what challenges will you face going forward?</h4><p>In 2011 we expect to grow about 15-20%. Things will be clearer after the National Assembly approves the investment budget. Then we will see. A problem here is that there is no certain information flowing in the market as to when major projects will take place. This lack of information makes it difficult to prepare bids in time, without previously having heard about the potential of a new project. This can cause problems of supply. We have a production system in place with Caterpillar in which its production is based on our projections. I always have to consider the possibility of short-notice projects, and have gotten used to this as a condition of the Azerbaijani economy. It is therefore more difficult to make accurate business plans.</p><h4>You have worked in places like Georgia and Iran. How does Azerbaijan compare to those countries in this regard?</h4><p>There are a lot of common points, though each country has its own dynamic. In Georgia, our sector is very shallow. We mostly provide service and support with existing equipment. That market is mostly driven by international funds, such as the IMF and World Bank. The regulations are therefore different. Here, the country has its own income. The sectors benefit from this income, especially in service and construction. But we don't know how much will be released, and when. Sometimes, the level of demand drops sharply, without any warning. Sometimes it is just difficult to collect payment. In 2010, we suffered from this for three months. A payment was not released, and we were left waiting. It is the customer's responsibility to pay, whether he has received his payment or not. Going forward, Borusan believes that its products are the most advanced in terms of costs and revenue benefits. However, we believe that in the coming years the difference will come in after-sales service and support. This is our focus currently. We are increasing our manpower, our services, our parts lead times, and our service capacity and capability.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your company and how you came to Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>The company was established in 1994. It was a difficult time, just after the end of the Soviet Union. Starting in 1994 we were baggage traders. We bought confectionery overseas, in countries like Turkey, packed it in luggage, and sold it in Russia or Azerbaijan. Then we gradually started growing. From 1994 to 1997 we bought trucks and expanded our trading volume. Then we acquired a Turkish partner. Our trade volume slowly grew. Until 2002 we only imported goods from Turkey. After that we expanded into Russia and other countries in Eastern Europe. Today about 40% of our imports are from Turkey, with the rest from other countries. We also do our own distribution now. We learned a lot from our experience in Turkey. We now manage trucks and three warehouses in different parts of Azerbaijan, and our facilities are on a par with those in Turkey. We also have serious plans to branch out overseas.</p><h4>Can you explain your shift of strategy from being just a wholesaler to becoming a producer and distributor of brands as a modern trade holding?</h4><p>We are proud to have become producers. We produce Sirab mineral water and we're one of three equal partners companies producing this product. We also produce chocolate under the brand name Ulduz. However, most of our income is still through importation. Our products Sirab and Ulduz together only account for 10% of our total annual revenues.</p><h4>What consumption trends can you identify in Azerbaijan in terms of product origin?</h4><p>That's a difficult question. There are certain tendencies that you find with Azerbaijani consumers. First off, Azerbaijanis place a lot of importance on European products. That's the biggest challenge for local producers. European products are the most esteemed, followed by Russian and Turkish products. Azerbaijani products are generally not preferred, because the brand name is very important here. This is a major challenge. Local producers may actually make the same product as the Russian or Turkish producer, but they have to undersell those imported products to be competitive in the local market.</p><h4>How many brands do you import?</h4><p>We work with 84 producers. That will drop to about 70 soon. From Turkey specifically we work with Eti, Ülker, Sütaş, Åžölen, Bifa, Piyale, Başparmak, Hayat, and Can Bebe, among others, and some of our other international partners include Heinz, Rittersport, and Haribo, to name a few. We also export our products to various countries including Georgia, Russia, and Mongolia. Currently, we've increased our chocolate production capacity to 1,300 tons per month, and so exports are more important than ever for us.</p><h4>What potential does Azerbaijan offer foreign investors in the confectionery sector?</h4><p>The Azerbaijani market isn't a big one, with a population of just 9 million. But if you're looking to produce in Azerbaijan with an eye to exporting to Central Asia, the trans-Caucasus, and Russia, then there is huge market potential. Also we do not pay VAT or other extra taxation in trade between these ex-Soviet countries, and so when you produce here and export to other CIS states, you have an advantage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your company's level of involvement in Azerbaijan's energy sector?</h4><p>Our company is a joint venture between the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) and AzTransRail, a rail forwarder engaged in the transportation of hydrocarbons. Our shareholders' names speak for themselves. SOCAR is a state oil company, being one of the largest entities in the oil sector, and AzTransRail is one of the major hydrocarbon rail forwarders in the region. The company started operations in 2005, inheriting the vision and experience of its shareholders.</p><h4>What changes have taken place in the region's oil and gas sector since you started operations?</h4><p>There has been a clear process of consolidation and institutionalization. In Azerbaijan large-scale projects such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oil and Shah Deniz gas fields, are now operating. In Kazakhstan, the Tengiz and Karachaganak projects are in operations, and the giant Kashagan oil field is being developed. A certain volume of Turkmen crude oil is delivered to the BTC, and a significant share of oil products from Turkmenistan is traditionally transshipped via this route. There is a lot of activity going on, and that means a lot of opportunities and responsibilities for the transportation sector. Azerbaijan has always provided a stable environment for the transshipment of hydrocarbons. In terms of consolidation, there have been investments by SOCAR and its partners in the Kulevi Oil Terminal in Georgia, a modern facility that started operations in May 2009. There is also a new terminal under development in Qaradagh. Furthermore, KazTransOil acquired the Batumi oil terminal. In Azerbaijan and Georgia there has been a lot of international involvement in the development and utilization of infrastructure, and this ensures that the services provided are always monitored for compliance with international standards in terms of quality, safety, efficiency, and flexibility. Overall, there is a high level of cooperation among all the stakeholders. We all share a common goal of making the Azerbaijan-Georgia transit corridor work and to transport as much hydrocarbons as possible from the Caspian shores to the Black Sea.</p><h4>How have the necessary rail connections developed?</h4><p>The Azerbaijani and Georgian railway systems are interconnected in terms of transporting cargo from the terminals located on the Caspian shore in Azerbaijan to the terminals located on the Black Sea shore in Georgia. When terminals are built, it is always crucial to take into account the technical capabilities of the railway  systems, and the technical capabilities of the other terminals. The transit terminals in Azerbaijan need to work in tune with those in Georgia. As well, the requirements of shippers need to be studied and satisfied, while reconciling these needs with the technical specifications of the transshipment facilities being utilized.</p><h4>What investment and development plans are you working on in the medium to long term?</h4><p>Hydrocarbon logistics always require close monitoring and continuous capital investments. Continuous maintenance along with developing of new capacities and/or facilities are capital intensive activities.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the sector's human capital in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has typically been a regional center for the oil industry. It was also one of the historic centers for oil research and science in the former Soviet Union. All these factors, along with the rapid and solid development of the economy, help us in finding many skilled and highly qualified people in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>Would you say that Azerbaijan is developing into a hub for oil and gas flows with other Central Asian states?</h4><p>Yes, that's correct. If a country produces and safely exports its own oil it can always serve as an additional economic stability factor. However, if a country struggles to export its own production, it is impossible to serve as a hub, because conflict would arise in terms of insufficient hydrocarbon transportation capacity. Azerbaijan is one of the rare examples where production can be wholly exported due to the visionary long-term planning implemented, as seen in projects such as the BTC and SPC. They stand out as being the most significant achievements in the oil industry for the last 20-30 years. Azerbaijan can export its hydrocarbons in many directions, providing more than enough transportation capacity. Azerbaijan, therefore, is an extremely viable, stable, and attractive hub for shippers.</p><h4>How do you see your transportation assets developing in the future?</h4><p>Every export and transit route requires a certain combination of assets. We have the right combination of assets to transport crude oil and oil products from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea or via the BTC. I believe our corridor needs to concentrate on developing the further flexibility of these key assets.</p><h4>How would you characterize the business environment for foreign investors engaging in the Azerbaijani energy sector?</h4><p>Anyone attending international oil and gas exhibitions and conferences in the Caspian region can witness that in all cases Azerbaijan is mentioned as one of the best and most stable environments for foreign investments in the region.</p><h4>Do you think there is need for any reforms or changes to make Azerbaijan more investor friendly?</h4><p>I believe that Azerbaijan has provided one of the best possible environments, and you can see many successful developments that prove that. All of the big oil projects are successful. I am sure that Azerbaijan will continue to maintain its leadership in the region in terms of being able to maintain a creative environment for investment in the energy sector as well as in the other sectors of its rapidly growing economy.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the basic principles of Safe Life's activities?</h4><p>The basic principle of the activity of Safe Life is to ensure the fire safety of citizens, to arrange training for fire prevention and emergency situations, and to avoid casualties and loss of material possessions. It is noteworthy that the goals we set during the establishment of the company have been achieved. However, it was not easy to manage because many citizens are inexperienced in this sphere, which complicates the situation considerably. The number of goals set by our specialists increases year by year, along with the expansion of the range of services we offer.</p><h4>What are the main services that Safe Life offers?</h4><p>We audit customer facilities and our specialists inspect all premises and territories listed in the application with special measuring and inspection equipment to find where they have not conformed to the adopted standards of fire safety, as well as highlighting potentially dangerous inflammable and explosive areas. After this, a customer is provided with a list of technological tools and measures necessary to prevent an emergency situation. This list is made in accordance with clearly defined technical specifications so that the facility can be accepted by the State Commission. Our company utilizes all existing techniques to conduct fire prevention monitoring right up to onsite surveillance. Surveillance is carried out by cameras connected to intelligent systems on acquisition and analysis of video images as well as by monitoring facilities through fire control panels. It is noteworthy that a necessary level of fire safety may always be established by various methods. Safe Life experts are always involved in solutions confirming to fire-prevention regulations through consultations. This provides an opportunity to choose a solution that is more optimal for a certain facility and perfectly meets the requirements of customers depending on their financial situation, employment of certain staff, aesthetic requirements, and so on. For example, it is more rational to apply technical tools at hazard-intensive facilities. In cases when 24-hour duty personnel are employed at a facility, there is an opportunity to apply a simplified automatic system or to offer a dual system of monitoring by using a scheme of connection to a panel of central surveillance. There are clients who prefer external wiring on steel pipes in order to save means, whereas others reject an import plastic duct and prefer to acquire wireless detectors</p><h4>What challenges exist in putting out fires on oil and gas platforms?</h4><p>Extinguishing a fire on an oil and gas platform is considered to be the most difficult. To prevent fire on oil and gas platforms, ordinary water is replaced by seawater. Water passes through a special sprinkler and is dispersed into millions of small droplets that later turn into a tight fog. Consequently, the oxygen entering a fire zone is blocked and the fire is put out. That is how our system works.</p><h4>How many employees do you have and what range of skills are required?</h4><p>We have approximately 100 employees. We look for our employees to be experienced, qualified, creative, punctual, intelligent, and good team players.</p><h4>How have security regulations and fire standards evolved?</h4><p>Safe Life maintains tight cooperation with government agencies and organizations by rendering them different services in the field of supply of fire extinguishing equipment and the conduction of training, and so forth. It is noteworthy that of late major importance has been attached to ensure the fire safety of public facilities. For this reason, most our company's operations are in the installation of new or the renewal of old fire warning and safety alarm systems, supply of fire extinguishing equipment, installation of smoke removal and ventilation systems, fire proof doors, and fire alarm systems at strategically important state facilities.</p><h4>Safe Life recently participated in the Seventh Caspian Energy Integration Award 2011 Ceremony and was awarded the prize of safety company of the year. What is the significance of such an award?</h4><p>Winning such an award makes us more responsible in our business and pushes us to comply with the requirements of our customers completely in order to provide them with a high quality of innovative equipment and services.</p><h4>How would you assess the security requirements in Azerbaijan as compared to the standards of neighboring countries and international standards?</h4><p>Safe Life focuses on ensuring non-stop and efficient operation of a system of central surveillance over facilities located on the Absheron peninsula. Customer facilities remain under the surveillance of an operators' monitoring system for 24 hours around the clock. Thus, the fire safety of the facility is under the responsibility of our company. In this way, a client ensures the safety of his facility. As far as the other services offered by our company are concerned, we receive requests from all regions of the country and successfully install the most complicated fire extinguishing systems. In the near future, we plan to expand the range of services on centralized monitoring and carry out surveillance in all the regions of the country. Also, we plan to expand to the international market and are working on entrance strategies.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In coming to Azerbaijan, was the main attraction the oil and gas industry, or was it to upgrade the national electricity grid?<br></h4><p>The first attempt by ABB Group to enter the Azerbaijani market was the investments in the transmission and power generation sector, followed by the oil and gas sector. These were the two primary sectors we were focusing on. In recent years we have extended our portfolio, into all areas of electrical power and automation down to small switches for households.</p><h4>What are some of the big public infrastructure projects that you have worked on here in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In general, we played a major role in the development of the power transmission sector. A large project, recently awarded, was a project in the western city of Ganja with a value of about ‚¬30 million. And then there were the BP oil and gas investments.</p><h4>What were some of the activities you were involved in with BP?</h4><p>With BP we won the contract to supply control safety, which included the safety systems on five offshore oil and gas platforms, a single Shell terminal, and the BTC pipeline through to Turkey. Basically, we supplied all the control safety processes on the BTC, such as fire and gas shutdown systems. It was a substantial project. The installation and commissioning phase was about five years. Now we are into a maintenance phase, which should continue over the lifetime of the installation.</p><h4>Azerbaijan emerged from the Soviet Union with a particular style of electrical grid and infrastructure, and then it had to update fairly rapidly. Is it still in that phase of trying to update, repair, and extend?</h4><p>I would say the major refurbishment phase is more or less over. For sure, there are certain substations from that time period. Soviet products were long-lasting and solid, and therefore had a long lifespan. However, most of the key components have now been replaced. I would say we are in a phase of extension and new installations to meet the growing demand of the market. In the oil and gas sector, the Caspian BP projects are world class. It is a quality installation using the best in class standards, and it will be here for a long time. It was isolated from what was already there, because there are new platforms, new wells, new terminals, and a new pipeline. The result will be world-class oil production for years to come. That is what we have achieved, and we are pushing forward for more of the same in the oil and gas phase.</p><h4>Is your focus more on the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>BP is our main Oil &amp; Gas industry customer in Azerbaijan, and we are seeking to win future jobs with BP. But we are also interested to extend our customer base in that important market segment. Despite that we see a potential demand for other industry infrastructure, as the country will strive to broaden the scope of investments in order to increase the value adding in the country (refineries) and to become less dependent from the oil sector.</p><h4>You mentioned your projects with BP, and the Eurovision project. What are your other outlooks in the medium term?</h4><p>The construction industry is recovering greatly since the crisis 2010, and I'm positive for its development in 2011. We expect quite dynamic development, especially continuing in the oil and gas sector for sure, to develop additional fields. In the pipeline area, there is a lot of interest in transporting oil and gas to Europe so as to become less dependent from Russia. And then there is the further development of the transmission network. We also assume that Azerbaijan will be included in the worldwide move towards energy efficiency and alternative energy. The country has lots of oil and gas, but the government has started to pay attention on how people use energy. That is a major strategy focus of ABB worldwide right now.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As of 2010, some $1.5 billion had been invested into the transport sector. What levels of investment will we see in 2011, and where will it be focused?</h4><p>We will continue to improve the road-transport infrastructure in Baku and other regions of the country in 2011. The roads in the capital will be reconstructed in compliance with international standards, and new bridges and overpasses will be built to meet the increased need for modern public transport. Additionally, we are carrying out general maintenance, and the repairing, reinstatement, and reconstruction of bridges, highways, and roads, as well as executing highway projects highlighted in the State Program for the Regional Economic Development of Azerbaijan in 2009-2013 and the Plan for Additional Measures to Improve the Transport System in Baku in 2008-2013. The quantity of work carried out in 2010 including maintenance totaled AZN1.5 billion. We intend to invest AZN722 million from the 2011 state budget to develop the road network in Azerbaijan, and AZN134.5 million was spent over 1Q 2011. We also intend to invest AZN170 million from the Azerbaijan Highway Budget Fund in 2011 into the maintenance of other roads—AZN60 million of that has been spent within 1Q 2011. A further AZN4.5 million has been spent on maintaining Baku's roads in 2011 from a country total of AZN24 million. Already, the first quarter of 2011 has seen 175.5 kilometers of roads constructed and repaired and six bridges constructed. Meanwhile, appropriate proposals to further improve the transport infrastructure of Baku and suburban settlements have been prepared and submitted to the relevant authorities.</p><h4>How is Azerbaijan working with Georgia to realize the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project?</h4><p>In May 2011 I met with the Georgian Minister of Regional Development and Infrastructure and his team. We discussed developing the relationship between Azerbaijan and Georgia, the potential transportation of transit goods, and the progression of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars project. We made a series of formal agreements relating to funding, design, construction, rehabilitation and reconstruction, and principles and conditions of maintenance of the railway section to Marabda, on the Turkish border, within the framework of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project. Artificial structures are under construction in the Akhalkalaki-Kartsakhi section of the project and the construction of station buildings continues. We are also designing a 4.2-kilometer tunnel that will be constructed on the Turkey-Georgia border. Azerbaijan Agent-Bank will cover the finance for the design, construction, and rehabilitation-reconstruction works and the construction of relevant infrastructure, with a credit agreement covering $775 million. The line of credit contains two phases. For Phase A, which includes work from 2007 until now, the annual percentage is 1%, and covers $200 million over 25 years. For Phase B, the annual percentage is 5%, and covers $575 million over 25 years. The reasons for the financing of Phase B stem from an increase in price of goods and materials within recent years, full reconstruction of the existing Marabda-Kartsakhi railway, works carried out in severe climatic conditions, and so on. I would like to note that Azerbaijan and Georgia came to a consensus and decided to open a joint institution to increase the rationality of transportation and to ensure quick and qualitative work.</p><h4>Is the Ministry providing support to Azerbaijan State Railways to upgrade its infrastructure and rolling stock to prepare for the opening of the new line?</h4><p>We are preparing to buy 50 new locomotives, which operate on alternating current. Ten contractors participated in the tender process, which stipulated the design, supply, and installation of a system with a power of 27.5 kVt, including stations, the contact network, and signal equipment along the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA). The shortlist has been narrowed to four companies and an evaluation report has been submitted to the World Bank for approval. We have set aside AZN34 million of capital investment for the implementation of Support for Railway Trade and Transport and Reconstruction of Railway Projects, which is part of the State Program.</p><h4>The expansion of Baku Port is scheduled for completion in 2013, and it will be able to receive 12 million tons of cargo by 2015. What is the status of the project?</h4><p>The ceremony for laying down the foundations of the “New Baku International Sea Trade Port Complex" was held on November 3, 2010. The Chief Plan and Working Project construction was finalized by Dutch company Royal Haskoning BV, under the Ministry of Transport. The two construction companies that will be carrying out the work for bottom deepening and the New Port Complex are Van Oord BV from the Netherlands and a local company, Azerkorpu OJC. Van Oord BV has been performing bottom-deepening works over the first months of 2011.</p><h4>What kind of measures is Azerbaijan taking to limit transport pollution?</h4><p>A lot of measures have been taken to limit the ecological impact of our transport infrastructure. To improve the road-transport complex, we have planted more than 50,000 trees. The Transport Ministry has also worked to comply with Euro 2 standards, which have been applied to Azerbaijan since July 1, 2010.</p><p>Our specialists have worked very hard to prepare preventative measures against harmful gas emitted into the atmosphere by transport facilities. We are also working on proposals to apply Euro 3 standards and improve ecological standards across  Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[beam-me-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What efforts have been made to improve the telecommunications network over the past decade?<br></h4><p>The telecoms sector in Azerbaijan is developing rapidly and plays an important role in the reliable development of the country's economy. The sector enjoys healthy competition and the investment conditions on offer are favorable. More than $1.5 billion has been invested into the telecommunications sector over the last 10 years, and approximately 21% of that investment was from abroad. New fixed and mobile network operators have entered the sector, and the state's share in five telecommunications companies was sold off through privatization campaigns. The share of the private sector in the telecommunications sector has risen from 62.7% to 80% as a result of our liberalization efforts.</p><p>The telecommunications sector has truly been transformed over the past decade. The country has been fully connected, and approximately 40% of the network has been installed on the basis of next-generation network (NGN) technology, with the national highway network being digitalized as well. The AZDATACOM and DWDM networks transfer high-speed information from Baku to all regions in Azerbaijan to strengthen this information exchange. This groundwork provided great opportunities for the development of our internet infrastructure. The connection speed with international internet networks has increased 50 times and stands at 40 GB per second. It is these ongoing achievements that characterize the dynamic development of the telecommunications sector.</p><h4>What investments has your Ministry encouraged to improve fixed broadband infrastructure and what targets do you have for penetration rates in the upcoming years?</h4><p>In order to access broadband services in all territories of the country we had to update, reinstall, and digitalize the telecommunications network. We are encouraging SMEs to provide internet services in Azerbaijan. No special consent is required for this type of activity. As a result, up to 30 internet providers operate in the country now and all of them are private companies, except for two. The internet segment has seen huge development over recent years. Tariffs for broadband internet services have fallen 10 fold over the last three years, and the volume of internet services has increased almost four fold, with the volume of broadband services up almost seven fold in the last five years. We have a penetration level of 50%, and 15% of these users are broadband internet users. We try to increase the penetration level of broadband services to our society via the provision of technical opportunities, pursuing an effective policy that targets the simplification of connection procedures to provide a quality service. We are currently developing a new strategy to develop broadband internet services, which will determine our long-term development goals.</p><h4>What steps still need to be taken before the full privatization of Aztelekom and what impact will it have on competitiveness?</h4><p>Privatization is strategically important given that Aztelekom is the international operator of Azerbaijan, has a large telecommunications network, and is a universal service operator. In this respect, action must be taken to restructure the company before its full privatization and transformation into a joint-stock company. The privatization of Aztelekom will also stimulate other participants in the market to offer new quality services. In short, the provision of a competitive and healthy business environment for telecommunications operators to develop the market and satisfy users is a main target for us.</p><h4>What is the status of the number portability regulation, and how will it affect the sector?</h4><p>We have met with the representatives of specialized companies in order to make mobile number portability a possibility. Now we are working together to draw up normative legal documents and form a technical basis to regulate the system in Azerbaijan. The progress made so far in the mobile communications sector allows us to predict that the application of the system will positively influence the development of the sector, enhance healthy competition, and enable users to obtain high-quality services on more advantageous terms. Furthermore, it will regulate the effective and reliable use of number resources. Evidence shows that telecommunications operators that offer high-quality, profitable, and modern services attract more subscribers to their networks.</p><h4>How are you cooperating with international partners to launch an Azerbaijani communications satellite and what does this milestone represent for the development of the Azerbaijani economy?</h4><p>Launching the first Azerbaijani satellite is strategically important for the country, and the program is under direct state control. Satellite manufacturing is a new field of industry for our country. Therefore, we are working with a combination of international consulting companies, experts, and local specialists. The agreement to manufacture the first telecommunications satellite for Azerbaijan and its launch was signed with Orbital Sciences Corporation of the US and Arianespace of France, respectively. A close partnership exists with leading international institutions to finance the project. The launch of the first telecommunications satellite is scheduled for late 2012. When speaking about the benefits of the satellite for our country, we do not only pay attention to the financial revenues expected to be generated from the satellite, but also to its strategic role in the development and promotion of national prestige. Azerbaijan will become a member of the world satellite family, and this will create opportunities for the manufacturing and application of satellite technologies. The calculations of local and foreign specialists and consulting companies estimate that the telecommunications satellite will be profitable, and the satellite will be able to cover its expenses within approximately five to seven years of operations. Thereby, this will have a positive influence on the development of the economy.</p><h4>It has been suggested that Azerbaijan could see growth of over 20% in the telecommunications industry in 2011. What are the key drivers behind this growth?</h4><p>The acceptance of the ICT sector as a leader in the development of the economy has paved the way for the comprehensive development of the sector. In the past six years, the ICT sector has grown five fold, with an average annual growth rate of 30-32%. Results from 1Q 2011 provide grounds for our optimistic forecasts. Thus, compared with the statistics of the corresponding period in 2010, the ICT sector has grown 24.7%, with the telecommunications sector specifically seeing growth of 19.2%, and the IT sector growing two fold. We hope a 30% growth rate will be achieved in 2011.</p><h4>What role do you see the IT industry playing in developing the services portion of Azerbaijan's GDP?</h4><p>The ICT industry will play a central role, characterized by the rapid development of the mobile sector for the most part and the dynamic development of the IT sector. IT hardware manufacturing is increasing, the professional levels of new companies are improving, and new companies are actively taking part in the spread of e-banking services and commerce in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani IT companies are not only successfully involved in national projects in the South Caucasus and Central Asia, but also export their products to regional markets. One of the main forthcoming aims is to increase the weight of the sector in the country's economy, promote the activity of new companies, as well as improve local production and export volumes. We have started to create Regional Innovation Zones (RIZs) in order to attain these goals. RIZs will promote investment in the field from both domestic and foreign companies, as concessionary conditions will be applied.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the communications sector in 2011 and over the medium term?</h4><p>We have a number of goals to reach in the next few years in accordance with the State Program on the Development of Information and Communication Technologies in the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2010-2011, the most notable being the formation of e-government services. The necessary measures are also being taken to implement large-scale projects and achieve projects of strategic importance over 2011. I hope that the application of new technologies in the telecommunications sector will increase, with more reliable access to high-quality and modern telecommunications services. The information security of the population will be safely protected, and we will continue to develop satellite technologies and our space industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the background of Azercell's creation in 1996?<br></h4><p>Established in 1996, Azercell was a joint venture between Azertel and the Azerbaijani Ministry of Communications. As of the first quarter of 2008, the company was fully privatized by its foreign partner. Azercell is a consolidated subsidiary of TeliaSonera with 55% of shares via Fintur Holding. Despite incessant and intensifying price competition, the company has managed to maintain its leadership in the market since its first year of operation. In 1998 Azercell was among the first in the world to introduce a pre-paid system for its subscribers, branded SimSim, and this opened a new page in the development of telecom services in Azerbaijan. We have installed 1,800 base stations in Azerbaijan and covered almost all mountainous areas. The company takes its strength mainly from its wide coverage area, strong network, extensive range of services, world-class customer service, highly professional staff, and strong shareholder support. Azercell is also a pioneer in many innovations for the local market such as the pre-paid system, mobile banking, DataKart, mobile marketing, Blackberry services, one-stop-shop offices, and so on. By the beginning of 2010, Azercell had approximately 4 million subscribers. Additionally, the company holds a majority of Azeronline shares, Azerbaijan's leading internet service provider. This ISP was established as a limited liability company in December 1999. Currently, Azercell owns a 55% market share. The company also offers very competitive roaming services.</p><h4>How have you seen the mobile telecoms market in Azerbaijan develop since then?</h4><p>Back in 1996 the market in Azerbaijan was new and open for a new company. Over the years, demand has grown for new technologies and quality. That is why Azercell keeps on paying special attention to increasing its quality and range of innovative services as well as the development of the subscriber base. Today, mobile technology's impact is broad, and it is playing a key role in education. Information sharing through mobile networks and access to the internet via mobile phone brings education to geographical areas where people do not have access to teachers, schools, or educational resources. Our partnership with the national electric network operator will soon result in significant operational efficiency in electricity meter measurements. Similar remote management service projects are ongoing with the urban transport network as well. GPS-based fleet management services have been available to businesses as well now for more than two years. In general, the role of value-added services has become crucial nowadays and is going to grow in the near future.</p><h4>What is the split between post-paid and pre-paid subscribers, and in which segment are you seeing the strongest growth?</h4><p>Mobile users in Azerbaijan prefer pre-paid as a means of payment traditionally. More than 95% of customers use pre-paid, but Azercell has also seen strong interest in post-paid recently with the launch of attractive products like Dövletcell, which is a very advantageous tariff plan for the employees of state-funded companies and organizations.</p><h4>How has Azercell's data/internet component developed? What is the state of your application for a 3G license?</h4><p>From our launch we have observed strong interest in GPRS/MMS services. In our first year it was a hit in the market in terms of our innovative image. This continued for several years. Consequently, Azercell has put significant focus and investment into the 3G network in readiness to launch the next generation network. Upon the allocation of a frequency and license, we are keen to provide world-class service to the Azerbaijani population.</p><h4>What projects are you developing to further Azercell's growth and presence in the sector?</h4><p>Some studies suggest that by 2020 the profits generated from this sector will reach the same level as the oil income of Azerbaijan. Nowadays, the development level of the ICT sector is three times faster than that of the country's overall economic development. Azerbaijan is on the eve of welcoming 3G technology, and as a leading telecoms company we are looking forward to opening this new page in our industry. The introduction of this technology will open up more opportunities for Azercell to present its customers more diverse services with an improved speed. Azercell has always been a pioneer in bringing up-to-date innovations to Azerbaijan. For example, at the annual telecoms exhibition in 2010 Azercell demonstrated a number of advanced technologies, such as the “mobile wallet", a technology used as a bus or metro ticket, as well as a purchasing tool, and much more. At the same time, Azercell was the first company to demonstrate the real capabilities and operation of LTE technology at an exhibition in Baku. We believe that as the relevant regulatory issue is settled, we will start deploying more and more new services based on the latest technologies available in the world.</p><h4>What key regulatory changes do you think need to be made to improve the competitiveness and profitability of the mobile telecoms market here?</h4><p>I think that liberalization of the mobile market should be the ultimate goal for the regulator. Interconnection rates should be normalized for more level competition. New technologies available internationally should be faster integrated into the local market. Necessary legal changes should be made to allow and promote the spread of new services such as mobile commerce, location-based services, mobile banking, and so on.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the mobile sector in Azerbaijan over the medium term?</h4><p>In the medium term I expect the Azerbaijan market to become even more penetrated and sophisticated with new technologies and services. Mobile broadband will be shifting customer demand to new levels. Mobile technologies will continue to spread into the lives of the people making it a richer, easier, and faster experience. Azercell, as it has done throughout its 15-year history, will take the leading role in this trend and provide the best and most cutting-edge technologies and services.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your history in the mobile telecoms industry?<br></h4><p>I ran an operator in Bulgaria. I built it, and sold it twice to private equity firms. I was a board member at TPSA, which is Eastern Europe's largest publicly traded telecommunications company. I've worked in 25 or so countries around the world, both during my time as a consultant or senior executive, almost always in telecommunications, and almost always in the mobile sector.</p><h4>What sort of market share does Bakcell have in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>About 35%. We've seen a huge increase in the last 12 to 15 months, taking 8 to 10 percentage points during that period, both through growth in the number of subscribers and also by taking market share from other companies—a 50/50 ratio overall. We're getting towards the end of the penetration boom, and it's currently around about 100% of the addressable market. That being said, there are elements of dual SIM ownership here, meaning some people have more than one mobile line, skewing penetration figures. That will continue as we sell more data SIMs. The market is moving from a traditional mobile voice-type market to one with more mobile broadband. That will drive further growth in the market.</p><h4>How do you think number portability will change the market?</h4><p>It's an opportunity rather than a threat for us. We're number two in the sector rather than number one, and so we stand to gain more than lose. Mobile number portability doesn't really affect mobile data or mobile broadband. People don't use the number at all. When I was in Bulgaria and we were new entrants to the market, we had a very successful program of selling new data SIMs because there was no equity in the phone number. You never saw it. All you were doing was accessing the internet. However, if you've had your number for five years you've got quite a lot of equity bound up in the number. People know it, and people call you on it when it's a business number. So for us, portability is a good thing.</p><h4>Do you think handset costs are high due to taxation?</h4><p>There's a lively secondhand market in handsets as well. If you want a handset you can get one, so it's not too big an issue. On new imports, sure, handset costs are higher than in other markets. We don't have a subsidy market here, which is good for the operators' economics. We're also at close to 100% of the addressable market, so it can't have been that much of a barrier.</p><h4>What would you identify as your target market?</h4><p>We have a brand that appeals to a broad spectrum of consumers. We have very good value services for lower income users, and higher-feature services for medium and higher income segments.</p><h4>What level of average revenue per user (ARPU) are you generating?</h4><p>If you look at Azercell, their publicly available information from Telesonera states that they're at about AZN8.50, and Bakcell is better than that.</p><h4>How extensive is your network coverage?</h4><p>We cover about 98% of the population and about 90% of the landmass. We'll always keep expanding. The challenge is also depth. Research shows that we have by far the best network performance; however, the perception is that Azercell's network is better than ours. We have to educate customers that the investments we've made in infrastructure over the last 18 months have made our network the strongest in terms of quality and availability. A substantial amount of investment has gone into increasing coverage and capacity.</p><h4>Is your network officially ready to incorporate and provide 3G?</h4><p>Yes. We're ready to launch. Once the spectrum's released to us there's a lot of optimization work to do, and that would be the next phase. We will start in 2011.</p><h4>What other projects are you looking at?</h4><p>We are probably at or around the market average in terms of the mix of subscribers between pre-paid and post-paid services. We want to over-index in post-paid, bringing higher-feature services to higher-value customers, and a 3G platform is required to do that, obviously. Broadband in this country is a bit of a mix of various technologies, from fixed through WiMAX, through Wi-Fi, through mobile, and we're really starting to stamp our presence in that marketplace. This is important to us from a strategic standpoint, both in terms of smartphone usage and in terms of basic broadband access. The internet in all its various guises is an important point of focus for us.</p><h4>Do you think the underdevelopment of the broadband market when it comes to cable internet is giving a chance for mobile companies to expand in this field?</h4><p>Absolutely. When you look at any kind of market where fixed infrastructure hasn't been rolled out aggressively, everyone leapfrogs to mobile. Look at India with voice—no fixed infrastructure, yet massive growth of mobile voice. There's no reason to expect that mobile broadband won't experience the same thing.</p><h4>What is your mix when it comes to post-paid and pre-paid accounts?</h4><p>The market average is around 93-94% pre-paid. We index the market. We over-index slightly in post-paid.</p><h4>That seems to be quite high for pre-paid. What is the reason behind it?</h4><p>It is. Italy's is 90%. My home is in Italy and everybody utilizes pre-paid options—I've got three pre-paid phones in Italy. India's pre-paid ratio is almost 100%. I think the issue of pre-paid or post-paid is about how you pay for the services rather than about the classification of the customers. Historically, pre-paid customers were low value and post-paid customers were high value, but that's now changed quite a lot over the last five or six years, and now it's really about how you pay for the service. If you look at the tariffs, there's little differentiation, and also little difference in usage. The reason customers go post-paid is to get a few more features sometimes, things that we can provide when we have an ongoing billing relationship with the customer, as we can understand a customer's credit status, what he or she pays, how he or she pays, and how regularly he or she pays. Therefore, based on those variables we can offer different services to suit customer needs.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the mobile sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>I haven't been in this market for long, but I am very optimistic. I think there is a huge opportunity in broadband. We believe all markets are pretty much on the same curve—albeit different points of the curve—and we believe this market is about to explode in terms of broadband. Having a 3G network, having strong technology partners, and having a strong franchise with our customers means Bakcell is in a great position.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Where are you looking to position your company within Azerbaijan's cement industry?</h4><p>There is only one integrated cement factory currently operating in Azerbaijan, which has a capacity of 1.3 million tons of cement per year. Comprehensive infrastructure and various other ambitious projects implemented throughout the country, which together with the expansion of civil construction, further spurred growth in cement consumption. As such, in 1997, consumption was just 0.5 million tons, whereas in 2008 the figure had reached 4.3 million tons, which was satisfied through the import of about 3 million tons of clinker and cement a year. A continued increase in cement consumption and limited domestic cement production has led to the outflow of hard currency from the country, as well as increased further dependence of the construction sector on external factors and market shocks. Given all of these long-term growth prospects, the cement market is aimed at ensuring that the growing demand for cement is an important element of economic diversification through import substitution. In this way, the management of our company decided to build the region's biggest cement plant with a production capacity of 5,000 tons of clinker per day and 2 million tons of cement per year. To date, the company has carried out extensive scientific and technical research with the involvement of leading consultants and experts in the field of the cement industry from different countries and developed the technical, financial, and economic plans for the project.</p><p>The Qızıldaş Sement plant is not only intended to substitute imports, but through the introduction of advanced technologies in the project it will enable it to supply the oil industry in Azerbaijan and the whole Caspian region with special brands of oil-well cement that comply with API standards. With an output capacity of 5,000 tons of clinker per day and 2 million tons of cement per year, the plant will not only considerably substitute imports, but also enable Azerbaijan to become an exporter of strategic consumables for the oil industry. The process equipment supplied for the project is being purchased from leading producers in Germany and other European countries, which will ensure high-quality output, safety, and efficiency of operation, as well as minimize power consumption, while preserving high European and global ecological standards. The project envisages the creation of new infrastructure that will improve the quality of life in neighboring settlements. It is noteworthy that the project is significant in terms of the creation of new jobs. It will be the biggest factory not only in Azerbaijan, but also in all of the Caucasus.</p><p>The management decided to implement the project under a turnkey scheme to balance the lack of experience in cement plant construction in Azerbaijan and to ensure technology and knowledge transfer from a reputable international turnkey contractor. The company's management was shaped under best international practice and experienced professionals were invited to take positions with Norm LLC. I was invited to take over the CEO position and lead the company and the whole project. The board proposed this position as I had been working for more than 35 years in Turkey at Oyak Cement Group. The aim of the management team is  to create a very modern factory that is environmentally friendly and has the latest technology. On March 1, 2011, NORM LLC signed a contract with a consortium of companies comprised of China Triumph International Engineering Company and Mitsubishi Corporation. The plant will be put into full-scale operation in 28 months, while early cement will first start to be pumped out six months earlier. We are planning to import clinker and will start production to test the market and penetrate with a new brand name. By the end of 2013 our factory may become one of the key market players.</p><h4>What benefits will the factory bring to Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The factory will substitute the import of cement and subsequently reduce the cash outflow by approximately $150 million per year. Additionally, it will bring competition, which will raise the quality of the cement industry in Azerbaijan. As we enter the market, Garadagh Cement will be forced to improve on quality and pricing. In a market dominated by Garadagh Cement, most cement customers' first choice is Garadagh Cement, as it is a local establishment and has quick access to its customers, while imports are always more risky from in terms of point of delivery time. Reliability and availability are important in this industry.</p><h4>A big consideration in the cement industry is energy costs. What are you doing to minimize their potential impact?</h4><p>There are two types of energy carriers consumed at cement plants—electric power and fuel. For example, in Turkey, the energy contribution rate in the average production cost of clinker is around 60%, and so in order to attain more price competitiveness one needs to consider cost optimization and in particular decrease energy consumption. Over the course of project feasibility and basic design, we selected the most advanced and energy efficient technological equipment with high attention to environmental preservation. In order to dismiss the idea that cement plants are major polluters, dust and exhaust emitters are being applied. We are closely cooperating with relevant public authorities, especially with Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, to ensure the application of the most stringent environmental standards and a monitoring system for a better future with harmony between nature conservation and sustainable industrial development.</p><h4>Will you cater for niche markets?</h4><p>We will produce Portland cement and Pozzolanic Portland cement. In addition, our system was designed to meet the oil extraction industry's requirements and standards for oil well cement. With production of about 100,000 tons per annum, we will not only completely satisfy the Azerbaijan oil industry's needs, but for the first time in the Caspian region we will start the strategic export of oil well cement under API standards to Caspian countries.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of the cement industry in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>There are three cement production projects that are being executed in Azerbaijan, namely Garadagh Cement, which is constructing a new line in Baku with a capacity of 1.7 million tons, and Akkord, which is building a 1-million ton cement plant in the north-western Gazakh region. Last but not least, Qızıldaş Sement—our project—which has the biggest capacity in the country at 2 million tons. Thus, the total installed capacity of cement production will be 4.7 million tons annually, which fully satisfies current market demand. However, our market research predicts further growth in demand, so we are working on capacity expansion options as well. This would enable us to start the project process on a second line immediately after completion of the first line. We have secured enough resources to even triple our capacities in the coming 5-10 years and implement gradual raw materials and market investigations to adequately address the requirements of the rapidly growing Azerbaijani economy.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>You have been CEO of Azerfon since November 2010. What is your assessment of the Azerbaijani market so far in terms of the ICT sector?<br></h4><p>The ICT sector has been designated as very high priority in Azerbaijan and expectations for the future are very high as well. The government is strongly supporting further developments and aims to make Azerbaijan an ICT hub for the CIS region. In that respect, for the last three years Azerbaijan has been one of the fastest growing economies. Azerbaijan plays a leading role in the development of the ICT industry in the CIS region, and ICT is the second fastest developing sector of the country's economy. Intensive economic reforms carried out by the leadership of the country provide favorable conditions for the development of small and large businesses in Azerbaijan. Mobile communication has supported this growth fundamentally. Such dynamic development in the mobile communication market of Azerbaijan makes mobile telephony very accessible and progressive. There is almost 100% mobile penetration in the country, prices keep falling, services become more diverse with the application of latest technologies, and more and more people enjoy mobile connectivity. Based on these, I am confident that Azerbaijan will maintain its technological leadership in the region for a long time.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of price levels in Azerbaijan compared with other countries in the region?</h4><p>In the past the price levels weren't as competitive as other markets in Europe or Turkey, but Azerfon played a very important role in making mobile communications more accessible and affordable, thereby stimulating the market strongly to be competitive. Our brand Nar Mobile has always been popular for its customer-oriented campaigns and transparent prices. For the first time in Azerbaijan Azerfon introduced a pre-paid, credit-based payment system, which allows subscribers to know the real value of their payments and control their communication costs. This practice was applied by the other two operators in Azerbaijan only starting from May 2011. The move from a unit-based system to a pre-paid, credit-based system has led to significant price decreases amongst the competition. As a result, the market has become more competitive. Prices have been reduced by as much as 60%, and the Azerbaijani people have seen that with this push mobile communications are becoming more affordable. The public will no longer be subjected to unnecessarily high prices, and can take advantage of more services for the same price.</p><h4>What changes has Azerfon worked to implement lately?</h4><p>For Azerfon's customers, 2011 will be a year of major changes. As a part of our network expansion plan for 2011, we will significantly increase the number of GSM and 3G sites, expand our network to include metro stations and build an LTE network, providing a major breakthrough in mobile internet speed in Azerbaijan. Azerfon's customers will soon enjoy a superior communication experience as the operator rolls out a significant expansion and modernization of its current GSM and 3G network. Under the first year network modernization contract signed with Nokia Siemens Networks, Azerfon will invest more than $65 million to ensure a superior, quality network in Azerbaijan. Implementation by Nokia Siemens Networks has already begun and is expected to be completed by the end of 2011. Being the key provider of 3G services in Azerbaijan we are focusing on the delivery of data services for customer needs. There is great potential in content development. We will soon implement a “future lab", where we will give students and young professionals along with external investors the opportunity to develop applications.</p><h4>What is Azerfon's current relationship with Vodafone?</h4><p>As you know, Azerfon entered into strategic partnership with Vodafone in 2009, and introduced its second brand, Azerfon-Vodafone (AF-VF), as a prestigious brand with 3G services. This partnership established a new era in mobile communications in Azerbaijan as it coincided with the launch of 3G services. It's a non-equity partnership that gives us exclusivity for delivering Vodafone products and solutions in Azerbaijan, and we get support from a branding standpoint. For instance, this partnership gives us access to Vodafone's global roaming network that enables customers to benefit from our most progressive roaming scheme based on a four zones-four tariffs approach. Vodafone, being the global leader of the telecoms world, has valuable experience in applying 3G technology, and Azerfon makes very good use of this experience and partnership to provide quality communication services to Azerbaijani customers. Through our partnership with Vodafone we are taking our customers to the global level and delivering a world-class communications experience.</p><h4>What's the market positioning of the two brands that you manage?</h4><p>Azerfon operates in the mobile market of Azerbaijan with two brands—Nar Mobile and AF-VF. Nar Mobile, being the most affordable mobile brand, has been providing our customers with diverse offers and services, and gained wide popularity. The AF-VF brand targets high-income consumers, offering attractive packages for data transfer and attractive offers on international calls, along with value-added services. AF-VF is aimed at those customers that are more advanced in mobile communications, that need high-speed mobile connectivity, and travel frequently. Therefore, Nar is the people's brand. We received the People's Brand Award in 2010 for being affordable and appealing to the lower- to middle-income segment.</p><h4>How has the level of internet penetration evolved in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Internet penetration in Azerbaijan is growing dynamically. Since the launch of 3G services by Azerfon we are observing a growth in internet users. Azerbaijani customers follow the global trend of internet usage via mobile phones. Until recently, our 3G services were available only to AF-VF customers, whereas starting from November 2010, Nar Mobile customers can also benefit from high-speed mobile connectivity as well. That means we now have two 3G providers, affordable prices, and a range of 3G services to meet our customers' needs.</p><h4>A new number portability law is to come into effect. What are your views on that?</h4><p>We welcome number portability because it makes us an attractive partner and supplier. It'll help us grow even faster. The coming into effect of number portability will make prices and companies more competitive, but I think we will stand out thanks to our quality of services and offers.</p><h4>How strong is your focus on customer care and service?</h4><p>In Azerbaijan customer care hasn't traditionally been a high priority. We have invested a lot in customer care, and soon our customers will have the best communications experience. We are constantly improving our customer care performance; trying to benefit from our partnership with Vodafone in that regard. We are also investing a lot into our network upgrade and expansion. A recent study conducted by the Wireless Technologies Association (WTA) showed that the average 3G speed in Azerbaijan is 1.7 megabits per second (MBps), which is a higher mobile broadband performance than in the UK. According to similar research done by the UK regulator Ofcom, the average mobile broadband speed in the UK is 1.5 MBps. We feel proud of delivering high-speed mobile connectivity at the best prices in Azerbaijan. Our 3G network allows our customers in Baku and the regions of Azerbaijan to enjoy real mobile broadband service at a higher speed than those in the UK.</p><h4>What's your general outlook for the ICT sector over the medium term?</h4><p>I am certain we will see more growth. I'm glad that the government is really pushing to make Azerbaijan an ICT hub for CIS countries. I think the region will be more competitive and Azerbaijan can realize huge growth in a sector other than oil and gas.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Into which areas is the Ministry of Agriculture trying to encourage the flow of FDI?<br></h4><p>We want to attract FDI mainly into export-oriented agricultural sectors, as foreign investors are able to combine advanced technology and know-how with their capital investments. There are many profitable sectors in Azerbaijan's agricultural sector that have export potential, and investing in these would represent a good use of capital. In that regard, the tobacco sector has great potential. Currently, there are six tobacco fermentation plants that are capable of producing 48,000 tons per year. European-Tobacco-Baku has the capacity to produce 10 billion units annually. Therefore, investment in this sector would be a real possibility. Another profitable sector is beer production. More than 20 enterprises are engaged in brewing, and these enterprises produce more than 3.2 million deciliters of beer every year. Azerbaijan's yearly domestic consumption is 2 million deciliters. It is expected that production could reach 4.5 million deciliters in 2011. Wine production also shows strong potential for foreign investment. The other areas that would be attractive to foreign investors include traditional sectors in Azerbaijan such as silkworm breeding, seed and sapling production, plant nurseries, the production of forage for poultry and animal farming, fruit and vegetable packing, canned foods, fruit nectars and juices, as well as meat and dairy production.</p><h4>What encouragement is the government giving to foreign investors looking to invest in the agriculture sector?</h4><p>Producers in the agricultural sector do not have to pay profit tax, extra cost tax, simplified taxes, or property levies until January 1, 2014. Importing industrial and processing equipment is also free from taxes and custom duties. In addition, there are a number of outreach programs for foreign investors. The “Caspian Agro" international agriculture and food industry fair is traditionally held every year in Azerbaijan, and incorporates business forums to discuss existing possibilities in the country as well as identifying potential fields of cooperation and ways to establish business relations.</p><h4>How has the development of Azerbaijan's agribusiness been progressing? Are there any key areas in which Azerbaijan could develop in this area?</h4><p>One of the priority directions of economic policy, successively conducted by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, is the development of entrepreneurship and agribusiness by improving the business environment. Agricultural producers are exempt from taxes associated with a range of manufacturing and processing equipment imported into the country in order to develop the processing industry. Producers are also eligible for subsidies on agricultural equipment and seeds, improved cattle breeds, fertilizers, and agricultural vehicles. The government has formed a preferential credit system for grain storage warehouses and refrigeration facilities, the construction of greenhouses, small- and medium-scale wineries, cattle and dairy facilities, poultry farming, and the formation of poultry breeding farms or their reconstruction with the help of new technology. In 2010 the Fund for the Support of Entrepreneurship allocated AZN55.15 million to 1,205 entrepreneurs for agricultural goods production and processing. The amount of credits allocated by the Fund regarding the formation of new production areas in the agricultural sector and for the production and processing of agricultural products increases year-by-year. The implementation of these production-oriented infrastructure projects has played an exceptional role in efficiently using internal resources for the production of ecologically clean products, increased wheat output, fruit and vegetable production, and the implementation of new technology.</p><h4>How are you working towards maximizing the country's agricultural output and reducing the need for food imports?</h4><p>Recently, the government has been providing direct and indirect support to agricultural goods producers. In order to stimulate agricultural goods producers, subsidies are allocated from the central government budget across numerous areas of the agricultural sector. Subsidies of AZN307.5 million were provided over 2007-2010 to agricultural goods producers for the cultivation of every hectare under crops and for perennial plants. Together with this, agricultural vehicles, technological equipment, mineral fertilizers, and highly productive breeding animals imported through the AgroLizing public corporation are being leased to the producers of agricultural goods and sold at concessionary rates. As production indicators for the agriculture sector show, the yearly requirement of the country population in fruit and vegetables is being met by domestic production, and the export opportunities for these products are extending every year. Despite this, production in some sectors, especially of meat and meat products, milk and dairy products, as well as some other products, still don't meet the requirements of the population.</p><h4>The agriculture sector grew by 6% in 2008, and again in 2009. What has the level of growth been in 2010, and what is your outlook for 2011?</h4><p>Although plant production decreased after the flooding of the Kura-Aras rivers and their tributaries, improvements in cattle numbers and the renewing of the main herd made it possible to achieve 6.1% growth in animal farming. The year-by-year implementation of the government program concerning the reliable provision of the population with food products during 2008-2015 will continue in 2011. In that regard, wheat production increased its area under cropping, and we expect 2.5 million tons of wheat production in 2011. An increase in vegetable, fruit, and grape production is also predicted. Calculations show that the national demand for meat and meat products, milk and dairy products, and poultry products is being met at a level of 70-75%. We expect a 3-5% increase in this national product coverage in 2011.</p><h4>What sort of contribution can agriculture make towards the diversification of Azerbaijan's national economy?</h4><p>Compared with other sectors of the economy, the agricultural sector has some advantages. These advantages are conditioned by the many natural, geographic, historic, and economic factors, as 9 of 11 climatic zones are present in Azerbaijan, which allows for the cultivation of a wide variety of products. The numerous programs, decrees, and orders signed by the President are aimed at realizing Azerbaijan's potential in the agriculture sector. If we look at the dynamics of the growth rate in agriculture (5.6% in 2003, 6.1% in 2008, and 5.3% in the first trimester of 2011 compared to 2010) we see that this field is rather promising. Our aim is not only to achieve an extensive increase in agricultural production, but also an increase in quality. Furthermore, there are challenges in ensuring that agriculture is both profitable and sustainable, while minimizing any negative effects on the environment. For this reason, a law has been passed concerning the motivation of the production of ecologically safe agricultural goods. Cooperation with international organizations is being implemented in the direction of production increases through preserving resources and employing economically viable and sustainable methods.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the main challenges you have faced since becoming Minister of Labor and Social Protection?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has made significant progress in this field in its 20 years of independence. Improving the social welfare of the people was one of the integral parts of the state government process toward establishing a powerful economy. Social welfare is one of the key indicators that Azerbaijan has passed into a new stage of economic quality and has completed its economic transition to modernity. As a result of our economic prosperity, the standard of living across all levels of society has improved. Naturally, this process requires a new approach to social policy. First of all, we are working to improve the effectiveness of social protection measures for the welfare of low-income families.</p><h4>What is the Ministry doing to alleviate poverty?</h4><p>We expect to eradicate poverty completely in Azerbaijan by 2015. The poverty level came down 9% in 2010. Our strategy is centered on job creation. Over the past seven years we have opened more than 900,000 workplaces, extended the labor capability of our population, and worked to ensure an increase in income. We also have a social aid program that is monitored by the World Bank. This program certainly plays an important role in welfare, but our main target is to help people provide for themselves. For this, we are establishing an information bank so we can analyze why and who needs aid. We have already started a self-support project. First of all, this project looked at 15 families living in a village that received cash to generate incomes. It was determined that family poverty is caused when family members do not meet the requirements of the contemporary labor market. In that respect, our purpose is to prepare and implement various active support programs.</p><h4>How have labor laws changed to meet the needs of a modern economy over the past two decades?</h4><p>Rapid economic development leads to a more advanced workforce that needs modern protection under labor legislation. The Azerbaijan government has a responsibility to improve and protect the welfare of each citizen. Everyone has the right to work in safe and healthy conditions and earn no less than the minimum wage set by the state. We are working with international partners and the World Bank to develop a five-year activity plan within the boundaries of the Social Protection Development Project, which will play a great role in developing and implementing labor legislation, labor protection, and the establishment of health and safety labor conditions in workplaces. Under the law, workers are entitled to paid leave not less than 21 calendar days at least once a year, and the working day should not be more than eight hours. By assuming these provisions as basic, legislation in the labor and employment fields is improving constantly according to the process of economic prosperity. Our law on compulsory insurance related to losing working capacity as the result of accidents came into force in 2010 and plays an important role in paying fees to the families of deceased workers and people who cannot work following accidents. Azerbaijan is a country stepping toward establishing a democratic society with confidence, and our country implements active partnerships with reliable international bodies in the field of providing human rights and liberties, including labor rights. Conventions and recommendations guided by higher democratic and humanist values have been ratified by Azerbaijan and this is represented in our national labor legislation. From this point of view, I consider that our national labor legislation conforms to contemporary requirements in the field of business.</p><h4>What is your Ministry doing to improve the level of workplace skills and provide opportunities for the retraining of citizens in new professions?</h4><p>We look to develop the working capacities of the labor force for a contemporary labor market. Training programs based on the needs of the labor market are gaining strength year by year. Regional Trade Teaching Centers have been established in several regions in recent years, and possess the necessary material and technical basis with regard to organizing proper courses. We have also organized trade courses for invalids, particularly blind citizens, and help is provided to integrate students and graduating seniors into the labor market. We also provide career advice services for high school pupils. Generally, the main purpose of the reform process in labor relations and employment in our country is to strategically develop labor resources in order to increase local employment levels. In recent years, economic prosperity reforms, including the establishment of new workplaces, mostly in the regions, have caused tensions in the labor market. With regards to the settlement employment problem, it appears that there is an efficient opportunity to employ the labor potential and businesses of rural citizens. The state program gives an opportunity to provide the settlement of important challenges in the labor and employment field. Using this opportunity, the Labor Inspectorate Service under the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population, in partnership with employers, takes active measures to provide beneficial employment to unemployed persons and those who are looking for work.</p><h4>What measures are being taken in the direction of adapting the labor force to international requirements?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's economy is actively integrating into the world economic arena. We are establishing a transparent business environment that has resulted in significant foreign investment flows. As expected, this process makes it inevitable that our local labor force will adapt to international standards. A good example is our construction industry. There are many new infrastructure projects and establishments being built. If you look across Baku, or several regions of the country at present, you can see how standards are being met. If you take into account that local citizens play a great role in executing these works as the main labor force, then our labor force is working according to international standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How long did it take to convince Bentley to set up a branch in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>One whole year, including meetings and talks. There was also the time needed to build the showroom, as well as set up the sales and after-sales facilities.</p><p>What was Bentley's management looking for in terms of market potential?</p><p>They were looking for a very reliable partner, and good statistics that they could then compare to other markets. We planned to sell 17 cars per year, and we sold 23. The market in Azerbaijan is ready to see luxury car brands develop as the general economy is booming, and once the infrastructure improves to good standards, sales will increase dramatically.</p><h4>You don't just sell Bentleys, you also service them. How has this side of your business developed?</h4><p>In Azerbaijan there were already around 50 Bentleys at the time we opened. Indeed, service is very important for us as part of our strategy and all of our staff undergo continual training on a regular basis. One very important thing to mention is that all Bentley cars are sold with a three-year warranty over unlimited kilometers.</p><h4>Are you looking to bring in other luxury or super car brands? Do you think the market is ready for that?</h4><p>The most important issue is that infrastructure is not ready for super cars like Ferraris and Lamborghinis; once roads and highways are in a good state of repair, I think that we will see more and more of such cars.</p><h4>Do you aim to build a close and personal kind of relationship with your customers?</h4><p>We do, yes, because owning a Bentley is something special. In fact, we give the opportunity for the owners of Bentley cars to visit our factory in Crewe, UK, where they can see their car being built. You can customize your car however you like—the stitching, the veneer, the color, and the like. One such customer here did just that, and after seeing how the car was made he fell in love with it. There are some funny stories. Like one customer who wanted his car the same color as his toaster. He got it.</p><h4>What's your outlook for the luxury car market in Azerbaijan for 2011 and 2012?</h4><p>It's growing and there's a lot of potential. There are a lot of economic projects going on in the country, in construction, tourism, and of course oil and gas. Azerbaijan's infrastructure is improving year after year. Compared to five years ago, when you would hardly find a good restaurant, now you have world-class restaurants with world-renowned chefs. There are also world-famous brands in fashion, jewelry, everything. So there is now a demand for luxury goods and fine living. People want to eat sushi, they want to buy haute couture, and they also want to buy luxury cars. I think in the near future there will be Ferraris and Lamborghinis—even Bugattis—on the streets of Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the challenges in Azerbaijan since Microsoft decided to open a local office in 2005?<br></h4><p>Microsoft has both the same demand and the same competitors here as it does in more developed markets, like in Western Europe, or the US; but here, the major competitor that we face right now is piracy. Other than that, our experience has been rewarding and we have acted somewhat as a pioneer, as we have done in many other software markets, and have encouraged other large companies such as Oracle to also take the plunge.</p><h4>Microsoft recently signed a memorandum with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in order to fight piracy. What are the ongoing results of this campaign?</h4><p>It is one of our most interesting initiatives in this area actually. We started to work with USAID and some of our local partners in the anti-piracy field, and we drafted a document that specifies the different phases of the project. We have already completed phase one, in which we trained some auditors in this area. We are now expecting the next phases of the initiative, which include a large PR campaign aimed at the whole country in the area of intellectual property (IP). The next stop is working with the young generation, and there are many other initiatives that we have implemented and plan to implement in the future. We understand there is a long way to go to get rid of the piracy culture, but we don't have much other choice, as pirated software currently represents 88% of the entire market. This is one of the highest figures in the world.</p><h4>Has the development of Azerbaijan's education system contributed to the development of Microsoft in the country?</h4><p>Yes. First of all, Microsoft considers globally—not only in Azerbaijan—that education is one of the most important areas of the company's activities. This is not for purely economic reasons, Microsoft considers it a long-term investment. From the get-go in Azerbaijan our aim has been to collaborate with the Ministry of Education. It was not so easy, but we reached an agreement whereby Microsoft provides licensed software for a symbolic price. It is a long-term investment in the future of the country and the company itself.</p><h4>The government has declared IT a priority sector to further Azerbaijan's development. What is the significance of this move?</h4><p>For a country with such rich natural oil resources, even the idea of designating the IT sector as first priority means a lot for companies like Microsoft. The government's understanding that, sooner or later, the oil and gas reserves will be depleted is very important. We need to begin work now to ensure that Azerbaijan's economy is ready for that eventuality. The declaration has only recently been made, and the plan is still only in its formative stages. We expect to begin seeing more concrete steps over the coming years.</p><h4>What potential is there for e-government in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Microsoft has just completed a nationwide project, along with its local partners, to develop an e-signature system. Its launch was announced along with the government in April 2011. The government considers this project a solid base for the development of other e-government initiatives. We have witnessed several real steps toward such a system, but there are still many things to be done.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[road-to-reform]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the aims of reforms carried out in the education sector after 1991?<br></h4><p>After the collapse of the USSR, Azerbaijan implemented important measures in all spheres, and took serious steps toward the improvement of the people's welfare and the realization of new reform strategies. The broad progress made in education, and especially in secondary education, owes much to the direction of the national leader, Heydar Aliyev. During this period, the country developed socially and economically over a golden period. The progress made includes the transformation from eight-year compulsory education into compulsory secondary education, the construction of 680 new schools for more than 250,000 pupils, the strengthening of teacher training, and the greatly improved supply of educational materials. This substantial reform process in the education system, initiated by the founder of the national education strategy, Heydar Aliyev, is today being successfully continued and developed by President Ilham Aliyev, and has become irreversible, with significant measures still being taken toward developing the strategic structure and management of education, its content, the modernization of its infrastructure, the strengthening of its material and technical basis, and the integration of the national education system into the international education system. The government understands the role of education in developing strong human capital, and the desire to see this develop has never been more real than it is today. Azerbaijan also works hard to reward pioneers in the education sector, and has initiated innovative schemes in order to create competitiveness between schools and teachers. Further state programs for the development of the sector have had many successful results. In addition to the modernization of educational materials, more focus has been put on training personnel in accordance with the demands of the labor market and the development of pre-school, vocational, higher education, foreign study, and special needs programs. For the past 20 years there has been a lack of pre-school construction, but for the first time 31 new kindergartens have been built over the last two years, 37 pre-school institutions have been reconstructed, and 134 education institutions have been provided with modern equipment. Furthermore, 14 new teaching aids and more than 40,000 copies of such teaching aids have been prepared and delivered to pre-school institutions. In regards to vocational training, institutions have been established to serve various sectors and eight textbooks have been prepared and printed over the last 20 years. A new portal for vocational training has also been established, and it includes many electronic resources.</p><h4>How significant is scientific research as a part of the education system in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Higher educational institutions conduct fundamental and applied scientific research works and prepare scientific-pedagogical personnel. There are 128 faculties and 682 departments at 20 state-run universities under the Ministry of Education, four state-financed scientific research institutes, four scientific centers, 92 scientific research laboratories, and one scientific research institute under the Azerbaijan State Oil Academy in Azerbaijan at present. In addition one scientific research center and one scientific research laboratory were established and provided with modern equipment in 2010 as a result of measures taken to target the development of scientific infrastructure in the university sector. In 2010 overall, research works on 2,436 topics covering 587 scientific challenges were conducted by universities under the Ministry of Education, and 2,097 research programs were concluded. Eight of these finished works were applied in production processes, 2,089 were applied in teaching processes, and 1,249 were considered as significant scientific results. All research works, developed with significant financial investment, were conducted to meet modern standards. In 2007, AZN1.27 million was allocated to high education institutions, excluding self-supporting universities. In 2010 this figure increased to AZN2.5 million. As a result of these efforts, the number of patent applications has increased, and 48 were issued in 2010, compared with only 12 in 1998. Furthermore, 436 monographs, 338 textbooks, 620 examples of educational material, and 1,421 programs and methodical literature were published in 2010. The number of articles written by Azerbaijanis published in foreign journals also increased to 2,036, well above the 794 published in 2009. The Ministry of Education is also committed to representing Azerbaijan at scientific events and international and local conferences, as well as organizing many events itself.</p><h4>What strategies is the Ministry of Education implementing in order to further integrate the country's education system into the international education system?</h4><p>Azerbaijan joined the Bologna Process in 2005 and outlined future reforms to be carried out in the field of education. The appropriate Action Plan for 2006-2010 was prepared and approved in order to implement the principles of the Bologna Declaration. The expansion of cooperation in the education sector with international organizations and the realization of joint projects with the EU, the Council of Europe, the British Council, UNICEF, UNESCO, and ISESCO play an important role in the integration of Azerbaijan's education system into the international network. The execution of agreements and protocols signed with foreign countries and international organizations and the preparation of such agreements and projects with other countries can also be considered as successful steps taken in this direction. Additionally, Azerbaijan joined three international conventions, as well as the Lisbon Recognition Convention in 1997 for the recognition of its diplomas, and this is an important legal base for recognition in other countries. The Ministry of Education is active in organizing joint conferences and seminars with international organizations, and our scientists participate in events held in foreign countries. In that way, foreign institutions and international organizations are well informed of the progress being made in the Azerbaijani education sector. Higher education facilities are also increasingly taking steps in the preparation of personnel in various specialties from foreign countries. Students from Asia, Africa, and South America have studied various professions at several education institutions in Azerbaijan. Such institutions attracting foreign students include Baku State University, Azerbaijan Medical University, Azerbaijan State Oil Academy, Azerbaijan Technical University, Azerbaijan Architecture and Construction University, Azerbaijan State University of Culture and Art, and Baku Musical Academy.</p><h4>What is the role of private universities in the development of higher education in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>One of the innovations of international experience and a new economic-political system in the Azerbaijani education system is the establishment of private universities. We can see from international experience that the establishment of the private sector along with the public sector has stimulated competition and progress. The creation of a private university network has had many other significant effects. It has widened people's choice and increased opportunities. There are 15 private universities in our country at present. Their activities are controlled by the Ministry, and their teaching and standards are regulated. Among private universities, Qafqaz University possesses the highest rating, and its graduates are distinguished by their professionalism and competitiveness.</p><h4>The government outlined plans for higher education reform over 2009-2013. How is this initiative developing?</h4><p>In recent years significant progress has been achieved in the development of higher education. As we noted, Azerbaijan joined the Bologna Process and took some important measures on integration into the European educational space. The main purposes of the state program on higher educational reforms for 2009-2013 are to integrate the national education system into the European one, to establish its content in accordance with the principles of the Bologna Process, to ensure competitiveness, and to respond to the demand for educated personnel in accordance with the requirements for the development of the country's economy. Additionally, in accordance with the documents of UNESCO and other international organizations, an international classification structure for bachelors degrees has been approved by the government. So far, 26 higher education institutions have been accredited and the credit system has been applied at 29 education institutions under the Ministry and at all private universities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What significant reforms have taken place at the university since Azerbaijan gained independence?</h4><p>The revival in the economy that followed independence caused a revitalization of the education sector. The National Leader and former President, Heydar Aliyev, then went on to grant our institution university status in 2000, and that became the turning point for our operations. Since that time our university has begun targeted actions in the field of innovation, computer technology, and education improvement in terms of staff and materials. The qualitative changes taking place in all spheres of the country's social and economic life for the last five years have laid the foundations for the formation of a quite new system, for stable macro-economic growth, and for sufficient consolidation and integration into the world economy. In parallel with this process, the requirements for the level of trained specialists, economists, the logistics of higher educational institutions, and the renewal and improvement of education infrastructure also changed. In accordance with those requirements, Azerbaijan State Economic University launched radical reforms in several directions. Attitudes to student-professor relations, assessment, and teaching aids changed across the entire educational spectrum. A total of 21 virtual laboratories are operating at the university, and the number of computers used there has exceeded 1,000. E-libraries are functioning at the university, and in order to extend the students' chances of selection, textbooks used in leading European and American universities have been translated into Azerbaijani, and students have been provided with over 150 translated textbooks. A complex set of actions has been carried out to promote the quality of the education process by making use of creative methods.</p><h4>What kind of education reforms and programs are being carried out to train students in accordance with labor market demands?</h4><p>A new innovative model of economic education has been developed and successfully applied at our university. The new model enables students to master the practical skills and abilities required from modern managers alongside fundamental academic training. Market and macro-economic processes are animated virtually in specialized classrooms on the basis of the wide application of information technology and educational software.</p><h4>What is the importance of having foreign students at the university?</h4><p>One of the aims of Azerbaijan State Economic University is to expand our international relations and increase productivity.  We aim to develop cooperation with leading European educational institutions in the framework of the Bologna Process, and develop other projects with universities in Europe. Alongside the projects being realized and to be realized, we maintain durable cooperation in student exchange with a number of universities, in countries such as the US, Australia, Germany, France, Canada, Latvia, Russia, Ukraine, Northern Cyprus, Turkey, and Georgia. On the other hand, at present, over 850 students and MA students from 14 countries from around the world are receiving education at Azerbaijan State Economic University. We involve them in the social life of the university along with their education. It has already turned into a pleasant tradition for our foreign students to participate in social events related to national holidays, to sing Azerbaijani songs, and perform our national dances.</p><h4>How is the university working to further integrate itself into the world education system?</h4><p>Our university is integrating fast into the European and global education system. Our university is a full member of the Association of European Universities, the Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World, the Euro-Asian Association of Universities, the International Association of Universities, and the Council of Universities of the Countries of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization. The achievements of our educational institution are recognized and assessed by a number of local and international institutions. In this regard, the WTO Reference Center and the World Bank's Information Center functioning at our university can be underlined as key aspects of our university's global vision.</p><h4>What is the level of cooperation between the private sector and the university within the framework of your MBA programs?</h4><p>The MBA program operating at our university was established in December, 2001, on the basis of an agreement signed between our university and Moscow State University of Economics, Statistics, and Informatics. The agreement also includes aspects on the improvement of teaching staff and administrative employees. The program sees the training of qualified specialists capable of managing competing enterprises effectively, with a perfect mastery of modern management technology, and awareness of all important areas of modern business. At present, the total number of MBA students exceeds 700, and includes students from Russia, China, Turkey, Sudan, Iran, Syria, and Saudi Arabia. The MBA curriculum is very close to the curricula of the University of California and Chicago Business School. The lectures are conducted by instructors with foreign experience, well-known professors from other universities, as well as professors from foreign countries. Leading private sector companies are also deeply involved in the education process.</p><h4>What measures should be taken to further improve the education sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The adoption of the Education Law in June 2009 is, no doubt, one of the most important steps in the development of the Azerbaijani education sector. No previous law had ever caused such intense public discussion, and the law was eventually very well received by the academic community and the general population. The new law acts as a legal base for the complete guarantee of the right to education for citizens as stipulated in the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and includes the creation of equal educational conditions for each citizen, the maintenance of free secondary education, a more liberal educational system in general, the treatment of education as a factor of national security, and its entrance to the jurisdiction of the market economy as a whole. At the same time, the new law considers the formation of a national model of education based on international experiences.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the aim when establishing the Azerbaijan State Oil Academy?<br></h4><p>Azerbaijan is known as the “oil academy of the world", and this is due to the country's long involvement with natural resources. This academy was originally founded in 1920 as the first higher educational institution with an oil and gas focus in Europe and Asia. Today it is known as the Azerbaijan State Oil Academy (ASOA), and occupies a significant place as a development pioneer with its extraordinary success and achievements. Over the years the academy has remained faithful to its original aim—to train highly qualified engineers and scientific staff in the exploration, extraction, exploitation, and processing of hydrocarbon raw materials. We now have around 7,000 students representing people from all walks of life in Azerbaijan. Many of our students' parents also work in the oil and gas sector, and in some cases our students are third-generation alumni.</p><h4>How did you get involved with ASOA?</h4><p>I was born in 1942 and graduated from the chemistry faculty of Baku State University in 1964. I later obtained my PhD from the Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology. I then followed an academic path from junior researcher to faculty dean, a position to which I was appointed by Presidential Decree in 1997. I am also a full member of Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences and several international academies.</p><h4>What are the main fields of study you offer students?</h4><p>The basic directions of professional training are reflected in the names of our specialized faculties: Geological Prospecting, Oil and Gas Production, Chemical Engineering, Oil-Mechanical, Power Engineering, Automation of Manufacturing Processes, Economics, International Economical Relations, and Management. Training is conducted over 31 specialties during a Bachelor's degree and over 74 specializations during a Master's degree.</p><h4>How has the university worked to become more globally integrated?</h4><p>The Minister of Education signed an agreement and we entered the Bologna system, meaning we are fully signed up to the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). The main language we use for education is Azerbaijani, and we also offer Russian language programs. In addition, over the last four years we have set up English language education for four specialties. We also invite foreign professors from the US and various other partner institutions around the world, as well as send our own staff abroad to gain skills and knowledge.</p><h4>To what extent have you worked to build ties with foreign institutions?</h4><p>In total ASOA supports bilateral cooperation with almost 40 foreign high schools and oil companies. A number of international educational projects have also been implemented recently in partnership with leading centers in the US, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and China. In addition, Bachelor and Master training on various specialties is carried out jointly with universities in Atlanta, Siegen, Cologne, Nice, Genoa, Heerlen, and Warsaw. Within the framework of these programs we have agreements on continuous training at a high level at corresponding universities in the US, Germany, and France.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy opened its doors in 2007. What was the need that you saw in establishing such an institution?<br></h4><p>The Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy is a product of this country's rapid development. As you know, the economy is developing very fast, and as a result of that the government's budget is growing. The number of our embassies has doubled over the past 5 or 6 years, and that has expanded the need for young diplomats. President Ilham Aliyev established the Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy with the purpose of cultivating and training a new diplomatic cadre. That was the main purpose of its establishment. Our initial focus was on the training of diplomats. Our initial attention was paid to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They were recruiting 25 to 30 young diplomats every year and we were training them in six-month courses. Of course later our mission has changed a bit. We've started paying attention to graduate and undergraduate education. However, our initial focus was to train young diplomats for the expanding diplomatic missions of Azerbaijan abroad.</p><h4>What was the strategy for diversifying your portfolio of training programs?</h4><p>We spoke to retired ambassadors and current deputy ministers and heads of department, and based on their input we developed a curriculum with six main diverse areas. Political, economic, and consular issues, public diplomacy, area studies, and protocol and leadership skills, like communications and image consulting. Our six-month course is based on these six areas. We spend an equal amount of time on each of these areas and discuss global political and economic trends, and teach students public diplomacy and media skills. The curriculum was based on the requirements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its day-to-day, practical needs.</p><h4>How will the facilities of your new campus help convey the values in teaching?</h4><p>We believe that learning should take place in an environment where students work in teams and exchange ideas. Our campus contains lots of public areas, like lounges, study rooms, and auditoriums with audiovisual equipment. We tried to decrease the number of classrooms and increase the amount of open, public space where students can get together and team up on projects. We ask our professors to give them assignments that are geared towards that end. The campus is a very good example of Azerbaijan's commitment to education, because it is a big investment. The construction is covered entirely by the government. We tried to build the campus in a green and smart way. We believe that this campus will be the best environment for our students to live and study together. We want this campus to be a 24/7 learning environment.</p><h4>What are the main foreign policy issues that you are preparing ADA students for in their future careers?</h4><p>As our academy grows, we believe that our graduates are no longer limited to working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but can also work in international organizations, NGOs, and the public or private sector. We don't necessarily teach them skills that are only applied in the Foreign Ministry only. But for those for whom that is the goal, we tell them first of all to understand Azerbaijan's priorities and its conflicts with energy and its economic policies, and so on. We also try to teach them different perspectives by bringing professors from countries like Russia, Iran, Turkey, and Georgia. We try to teach our students how to think from multiple perspectives, and not only from narrow limits and see the other side of the picture. We also teach our students to be pro-active. Foreign policy is usually very reactive, so we try to teach them to anticipate trends and develop strategic visions for the future of Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What line of products is Mercedes-Benz focused on in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>We are very focused on passenger car sales. This is firstly because passenger cars are easier to sell. Secondly, when we started operating here a few years after independence, there was absolutely no commercial vehicle business. The commercial vehicle business only really took off in 2003 when the government started to allow construction works and building on a large scale. Since then the demand for construction vehicles such as dumpers, mixers, and so on has increased. These products are supplied from Turkey, which is also another channel for commercial vehicles. These channels are older and better established, making it difficult to get into the supply chain.</p><h4>How has the services side of your operations developed?</h4><p>Services are a true strength of Mercedes in Azerbaijan. Our workers are well trained and very experienced. A lot of them speak German, and this makes communication with our headquarters easy. Our staff are also regularly trained, both in Germany and around the world with our parent company Daimler. Our servicemen and mechanics are also sent for regular training to Moscow, Ukraine, or Kazakhstan, and also in country roughly six to seven times a year. The training courses we run here are taught by experts from Germany, as well as mechanical experts from Turkmenistan, Georgia, and Kazakhstan. These training courses help to back up the knowledge of our staff, as well as teach them new techniques and initiatives. One such initiative was the implementation of electronic diagnosis with a computer, the data of which are then sent over the internet to head office in Stuttgart, meaning no information is lost.</p><h4>How strong is the competition in the luxury car market?</h4><p>Several other luxury brands are represented in Azerbaijan. With respect to the competition, I'm mainly watching BMW's operations. Bentley has also been represented for about two years, and that is a very high end and sophisticated brand. In addition, Porsche has become very popular over the last three to four years. It has a nice outlet in Baku and is performing very well. It is also possible to find exotic brands such as Maserati, but this brand is imported on an individual basis.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the luxury car market in Azerbaijan over the medium term?</h4><p>The sector will not see year-on-year growth forever, as there is somewhat of a limit to the number of products that we can sell. People who have Mercedes cars in their garages might consider another brand should they want another car, and that is also a factor limiting the sector. In 2007 we experienced our best year in terms of sales in Azerbaijan, selling 500 units. The crisis then affected business adversely. Business since then has begun to recover, and the general number of people who can afford cars is increasing. The increase in the number of cars seen on the streets of Azerbaijan over the last couple years is a result of crisis recovery, and we are optimistic about the future of Mercedes sales in the long term. Our goal is to achieve an average sales rate of 250 passenger cars and 100 commercial vehicles per year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Tekfen's activities in Azerbaijan and the joint venture between Tekfen and Azfen?<br></h4><p>Tekfen was established in Turkey in 1956, and we've been in Azerbaijan for 16 years. In 1996 we established a joint venture called Azfen with SOCAR, which has a 60% share in the company, with Tekfen owning the remaining 40%. Both companies are general contractors and are very much alike, even though Azfen is a much smaller company than Tekfen. Some projects we perform as Tekfen, some as Azfen, and some jointly as Tekfen and Azfen. In addition, some projects have been carried out as a three-way partnership between Tekfen, Azfen, and another company. For example, we're currently running a project in the Bayil area as the ATA consortium, which includes Tekfen, Azfen, and AMEC from the UK.</p><h4>What criteria do you use when deciding how to approach a project?</h4><p>If Azfen can do it alone, then that's what we prefer, because that's why we established Azfen. Nevertheless, Azfen has a limited capacity regarding machinery, personnel, experience, and financial capability. In bigger projects that need some financial muscle, Tekfen will go in. When necessary we bring in specialists from Turkey or even other countries and employ them as Azfen personnel.</p><h4>Who are your primary clients?</h4><p>We work in different sectors, although we're very well known in the oil and gas industry, and most of our projects are in that sector. When I say oil and gas, this also includes, for example, SOCAR's management building, which we are currently constructing. It's a giant 40-storey building on Heydar Aliyev Boulevard. Having said that, we are certainly mostly specialized in oil and gas construction, be it pipelines, refineries, compressor stations, or infrastructural projects like harbors, shipyards, roads, and highways. In fact we're number one in Turkey for the construction of highways. When there are challenging projects that nobody else can do here in Azerbaijan, we are the first port of call for many.</p><h4>Has staff training figured in your development plans?</h4><p>Yes, in fact that was the main idea behind the establishment of Azfen. It started off as a small liaison office, and now it's bidding for $500 million projects on its own. So Azfen has matured, almost as much so as Tekfen, except, as I said, in terms of size. Our aim is to educate and train our people at Azfen. We have one of the best welding schools. We bring instructors in and we train our employees to do the jobs that they will be needed for. That having been said, we also learn a lot from our local employees because they are very experienced in local realities, and also Russian construction standards and techniques, which we know little about. Another advantage we have as a Turkish company is that we share a similar cultural heritage with the Azerbaijanis, and speak the same language.</p><h4>What balance has been struck between local and foreign employees?</h4><p>Azfen only employs Azerbaijanis where needed, whereas Tekfen employs only Turks, in general. However, for example at the Bayil oil platform, Azfen and Tekfen share common management, not separate, and AMEC acts independently. There are about 2,000 Azfen and Tekfen employees working on that project. As for the SOCAR tower, we employ 400 people there, around 80% of who are local. In general, I think projects like housing should be left to local companies. They have the capacity to do those projects. We, as foreign companies, should do the work that local companies cannot.</p><h4>What are the challenges for the construction sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The biggest problem is working visas. Having to have a visa to work here is a hindrance. We believe in the free flow of manpower and goods, especially considering the amount of commercial and also cultural ties between Turkey and Azerbaijan. Taxes are also a problem. They're too high, making customs difficult. Both governments are tackling these problems, however, and visa restrictions are set to be lifted. A further problem is infrastructure. The railways and highways have to be modernized, and new ones have to be built where necessary. There is a lot of work going on, and it is on the right track, but there is a way to go yet.</p><h4>Do you take part in infrastructure projects in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Yes, we are waiting for the right project proposals to come along.</p><h4>What sort of strategies did you apply during the economic turndown after 2008?</h4><p>Those years were a loss for us as we spent a lot of time waiting for work to come in, and other contractors suffered a similar fate as things dried up. What we had to do was decrease the number of people working for us overall until a job came up. Once we got a job, we hired the necessary people. That cut our costs down and minimized the adverse effects of the situation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of the company?</h4><p>I think Azerbaijan is in the early stages of a long period of development. It is on the right track and doing the right things in general. Like I said, more has to be spent on infrastructure. I think the situation will improve greatly within the next five years, especially if high oil prices continue, which they are expected to do.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>President Ilham Aliyev announced 2011 to be the “Year of Tourism". What activities have been planned to draw the attention of the international community to Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>The potential for tourism in Azerbaijan is quite rich. The state has taken important steps to enable the development of the sector. To encourage sustainable development in socio-economic and cultural fields, the President of Azerbaijan announced 2011 as the “Year of Tourism". In the light of that, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism has prepared and submitted an action plan to the government in the framework of the “Year of Tourism". According to international practice, the realization of these plans will involve promoting the tourism potential of the country on a wider scale. Within this framework, improvements will be made to vocational training, with the idea to develop the tourism potential of the country through a systematic development of the sector. More effective use will be made of the existing and diverse historic and natural sites of beauty. This will turn tourism into one of the priority sectors of the economy. Furthermore, the organization of info-tours for foreign diplomatic missions to Azerbaijan, and the production of effective information materials in foreign languages, as well as the strengthening of marketing work carried out by foreign diplomatic missions and diaspora organizations are of high priority in our mission to draw foreign attention.</p><h4></h4><h4>What is the scale of the foreign tourism market in Azerbaijan? What are the future targets for the Ministry?</h4><p>We have achieved positive results in the foreign tourism field. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism works to implement foreign tourism policy in the framework of the establishment of bilateral and multilateral cooperation ties and their further expansion. One of the main conditions of bilateral cooperation is the availability of a legal-contractual framework between separate countries. Taking into account that the establishment and development of multilateral cooperation ties is one of the priority directions of tourism policy, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism continues its productive work geared towards the establishment of multilateral cooperation in the field of tourism with the UN, the World Tourism Organization, the Council of Europe, the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the CIS, the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization (BSEC), the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), the Conference for Mutual Activities and Confidence Measures in Asia, and with other international organizations. Presently, the government of Azerbaijan has signed treaties on cooperation in the field of tourism with the governments of 27 countries. Additionally, draft treaties in the field of tourism between Azerbaijan and the governments of 30 additional countries have been developed and submitted to the attention of our counterparts. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism mainly cooperates with Europe, the Islamic world, and CIS countries to develop bilateral cooperation in the field of tourism. The Ministry constantly takes part in international tourism exhibitions held in different countries to promote the tourism capacity of the country and to attract foreign tourists to the republic, as well as organizes information and press tours in the country for foreign tourism industry professionals to develop bilateral cooperation. Thus, information and press tours to our country were organized for the representatives of tourism and mass media organizations of Greece, Egypt, Morocco, and Germany in 2009, and for the representatives of Germany in 2010. Also, in April-May of 2011 we looked to organize press tours for mass media representatives from the UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Germany, and France, as well as information tours for a delegation of tourism and mass media representatives from the Netherlands. In order to promote the tourism potential of Azerbaijan in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Azerbaijan Tourism Association signed a contract with Atlantis, a Dubai-based company, on April 28, 2011.</p><h4>What are the main specialties on offer to foreign tourists in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The location of the country, as well as its position in the contemporary world, has turned Azerbaijan into a very attractive place for tourists. The diverse fauna and flora of our country located in nine climatic zones provides extensive opportunities for the development of different types of tourism. Foreign tourists are attracted to the heritage of Azerbaijan. There are many places of historical interest, as well as superb architecture and workmanship, not to mention fabulous oral folk art and textiles. In addition, I would like to underline specifically the “Azerbaijan Wine Way" and “Alexander Duma in the Caucasus", both international cultural tourism routes realized within the framework of the Council of Europe's “Kiev Initiative". Also, the “Great Silk Road" and “German Settlements in Azerbaijan" can be included as part of the national tourism routes we are developing.</p><h4></h4><h4>What potential does Azerbaijan have to develop a MICE tourism sector?</h4><p>MICE tourism is already a thriving sector in Azerbaijan, and it is one of the priorities of the Ministry. Many recently constructed five-star hotels include modern conference facilities, and this is paving the way for further development of this type of tourism. We are seeing the high-quality organization of various internal and external exhibitions, international forums and conferences, and this is a good signal of the potential Azerbaijan has for MICE tourism.</p><h4>From what areas is Azerbaijan trying to attract tourists, and how is the Ministry working to promote the country as a destination?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is mainly interested in attracting tourists from neighboring countries and Europe. However, along with those tourism markets, other potential targets are the Americas, South Asia, the Middle East, East Asia, and the Pacific. In order to promote the tourism potential of our country on a global scale, the Ministry participates in about 20 international exhibitions annually. Also, the Ministry prepared up to 50 advertising clips in nine languages and distributed them to the visitors of international tourism exhibitions. Advertising clips on the tourism potential of our country are constantly broadcast on the world's most famous TV channels, including EuroNews, Travel Channel, CNN, National Geographic, BBC, and CNBC. Also, in April of each year, Baku hosts the Azerbaijan International Travel and Tourism Fair (AITF).</p><h4>What are the trends of the internal tourism market in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Citizens on vacation in Azerbaijan prefer regions with beautiful nature and extensive tourism infrastructure, including the northern, northwestern, western, and southern regions, along with the Nakhchivan region, Baku, and the Absheron peninsula. Tourists enjoy Azerbaijan's many fine beaches, cultural pursuits, rural activities, and many more recreational possibilities. Furthermore, in order to develop new types of winter tourism in Azerbaijan, a number of tailored works are being carried out. New infrastructure is being built in regions distinguished by their natural beauty and extensive tourism potential. One major example is the Shahdag Winter-Summer Tourism Complex. The total area of the complex, situated between 1,300 and 2,554 meters above sea level, amounts to more than 2,045 hectares. It is envisaged that the main focus in the construction of the complex will be directed to the development of winter sports, mainly the development of mountain skiing. In addition, the complex will include tennis and basketball courts, a golf course, a football pitch, indoor sports facilities, pools, entertainment and game complexes, and trails for hikers and horse riders. In terms of accommodation, three-, four-, and five-star hotels, in addition to small summerhouses, and cottages will be built. On top of that, trade centers, restaurants, and catering facilities will be present, altogether generating a daily capacity to host 5,000 tourists.</p><h4>How does the Ministry of Culture and Tourism try to coordinate investment initiatives with the Ministry of Economic Development?</h4><p>There is endless potential for investment in the tourism sector in Azerbaijan. To date, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism has submitted eight investment projects on tourism. Toward that end the Ministry carries out works for the presentation of these projects. Thus, the Azerbaijan Export and Investment Promotion Fund (AZPROMO), established by the Ministry of Economic Development of the Republic of Azerbaijan, together with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism organize the presentation of investment projects during events in foreign countries.</p><h4></h4><h4>What levels of FDI is the sector seeing?</h4><p>So far, no request has been recorded at the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in respect of large-scale investment ideas. However, the Ministry has contacted several foreign finance organizations to establish tourism recreation zones. Five-star hotels currently under construction in Azerbaijan are mainly built at the expense of local investors. In parallel, there have been foreign investments together with local investments into existing hotel tourism. Azerbaijan is a safe country with extensive opportunities for foreign investments. As an example, investments amounting to $15.5 billion were made in Azerbaijan in 2010. Out of that, $8.2 billion and $7.3 billion were made by foreign and local investors, respectively. Although $6.2 billion was attracted to the oil sector, $9.3 billion went to the non-oil sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What should foreign companies be aware of before engaging in their start-up phase?<br></h4><p>The Azerbaijani government welcomes foreign investors and considers foreign investment to be important for the development of the national economy. Therefore, continuous improvements are being made to the legislation in order to attract more and more investors. In order to be successful in engaging local markets, one should first become familiar with the culture and tradition of the regions. This is a great opportunity for investors to not only do business, but also to expand their knowledge of a variety of cultures around the world, making it easier for them to understand individuals from different backgrounds. Moreover, from the very start, investors should be set on targeting markets on a continuous basis, as well as making new contacts and even more friends. Local partners can also offer a great deal of assistance. This makes processes run more smoothly, enabling investors to achieve their goals in a shorter timeframe. Investors should be aware that although the oil and gas industry is the field attracting most foreign investment, Azerbaijan's economic strategy is to develop the other fields of economy. Thus, foreign companies should view investing in other production or service industries as good opportunities that will also be welcomed and protected by the government. Azerbaijan has concluded numerous bilateral investment treaties and is a party to several multilateral treaties that should give more assurance to foreign investors from countries that are also parties to those treaties. The fact that Azerbaijan is a party to the Washington Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between nations and nationals of other nations means that investors can have any disputes between them and the state settled by ICSID arbitration, which is a neutral forum. Foreign investors should note that Azerbaijan is not a member of the WTO, although accession negotiations are ongoing and Azerbaijan is gradually improving its legislation in accordance with WTO norms and standards.</p><h4>What regulation changes are we likely to see over the medium term aimed at making life easier for foreign investors and start-up companies?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is continuously developing its legal framework in order to create better and easier conditions for foreign investors to do business in Azerbaijan. Older laws are being simplified and modernized, taking into account international practice and the recommendations of international organizations. In early 2011 a new act on Administrative Proceeding and Administrative Procedural Code came into force. This provides a new legislative base from which the judiciary will conduct administrative activities, and judges are now receiving training on the new legislation. The act aims to improve human rights in the country. In the near future the adoption of new important codes such as the Construction Code and the Competition Code is expected. These Codes will unify, harmonize, and simplify the numerous laws and regulations governing these issues. Also, a new draft of the Customs Code will replace the current one. Besides creating more favorable conditions and simplifying the registration and declaration rules, the new Customs Code is expected to foster modernization of the customs infrastructure in conformity with international standards and accelerate Azerbaijan's membership to the WTO. Apart from these major codification changes, various laws and regulations are going to be amended in order to make business easier for foreign investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

It's a Presidential project, run by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and is personally under the control of the President. Without the President's support, it never would have been realized. The aim was to create a world-class destination, and to do it correctly. We purchased the best equipment and materials for this project. Our organization has been around for three years, and our responsibility is to supervise its development.</p><h4></h4><h4>What advantages does this region have for the construction of such a tourism complex?</h4><p>It's a comfortable location, it is mountainous, and it has the right temperatures for skiing. It will work year round, including summer. Its height ranges from 1,300 meters to 3,200 meters above sea level. It can accommodate a huge spectrum of activities and will have something for everyone. It will be situated 32 kilometers from the regional center of Kusar, and the building site is in the territory of the Shahdag national park, which is known for its preserved ecological system and pristine flora and fauna. The central part of the tourist complex is situated on a natural plateau that is 1,640 meters above sea level. The total area of the complex will be 2,000 hectares.</p><h4>What facilities will be on offer?</h4><p>It will be a small city with a daily capacity of 10,000 people. There will be a welcome plaza, with all the information a visitor will need about the complex. There will be 32 hotels spread across the complex, and it will also include youth centers, clubs, a spa, nightclubs, bicycle paths, swimming pools, chalets, aprí¨s-ski facilities, restaurants, shops, boutiques, handicraft workshops, bars, an ecological village, an aqua park, medical clinics, emergency services, sports, and extreme sports facilities. There will also be 14 or 15 ski lifts and 17 kilometers of ski slopes, all interconnected. Sure, it's not a lot compared to Tyrolia or the Alps, but for Azerbaijan it's extraordinary. Also, the car park will be left far enough from the hotel area to avoid noise and pollution.</p><h4></h4><h4>How have you been able to attract investors?</h4><p>It is a huge job. Facilities for 10,000 people must be built, as well as the right infrastructure for electricity, transport, water, sewage, internet, gas, and so forth. We are working with the Austrian and Swiss consulting firms ILF Consulting and Swiss Town Consult. Other investors and contractors include DIA Holding from Dubai, TechnoAlpin of Italy, which is providing artificial snowmaking technology, Doppelmayr Seilbahnen of Austria, which is providing ski lifts, and Pisten Bully, which is supplying snow groomers.</p><h4></h4><h4>What are the next stages in constructing the complex?</h4><p>Construction of the complex has been divided into four stages. The first stage has already been completed—with all electricity, water and gas, sewage, and communication lines having been installed. Also, bridges over mountain rivers have been built and the highway has been extended by 30 kilometers, which connects the complex to the regional center of Kusar. Engineering works to construct the lifts, ski slopes, artificial snowmaking machines, and hotels have also been realized. The next stage will include the construction of new ski slopes and the expansion of the residential zone. The slopes are designed to cater for all types of skiers, with varying degrees of complexity from children to professionals. We will also be constructing summer sports courts as well as facilities for horse riding and rock climbing.</p><h4></h4><h4>How is the project split between government and private finance?</h4><p>The government will finance construction of one four-star hotel, the building for employees and service personnel, as well as the lift base building. The construction of the other hotels, entertainment centers, and other commercial works will be realized by the private sector via open tender.</p><h4>When will the doors first open to visitors?</h4><p>We expect that the first visitors will begin to arrive in December 2011. We plan to accept 430 people. It is possible that tourist numbers will increase to 1,500 in summer 2012.</p><h4>How will the complex be staffed?</h4><p>We will have access to the best students from the Ministry of Tourism's hospitality school. We place a lot of importance on service. If we fail to provide good service, then this whole project will have been a failure.</p><h4>How will the opening of the complex affect the development of the region as a whole?</h4><p>The significance of the resort is very important and is not limited only by the economic component. By constructing the complex, we try to achieve the social goal of developing winter sports and tourism in Azerbaijan. We want to create the conditions for a high-quality relaxation destination for domestic and foreign tourists as well as provide new opportunities for work. The project will employ several thousand local residents as well as those from neighboring regions in providing services. Personnel will include hotel employees, lift operators, underground parking attendants, fire and search-and-rescue personnel, security services, skiing instructors, as well as general services associated with a complex of this size. But the complex will develop the appropriate infrastructure in the region. For example, the electricity and gas supply to adjoining villages will be improved, as will the quality of the highways. The region will also benefit from modern systems of processing and information transferring. The Shahdag complex is of great importance, not only for the development of northern Azerbaijan, but also for the whole country.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How many Austrian companies conduct business in Azerbaijan and what are the main areas of their activity?<br></h4><p>Presently over 30 Austrian corporations conduct frequent business in Azerbaijan in various fields including construction, tourism, and energy. These companies include established names on the Austrian business market such as OMV, Strabag, Doppelmayr, and Coop-Himmelblau. LGP, along with OMV, ASP Consulting, Siemens, and Coop-Himmelblau founded the Austrian-Azerbaijani Chamber of Commerce, which is dedicated to improving business and cultural relations between Austria and Azerbaijan, increasing export-import operations between the two nations, and attracting further Austrian and Azerbaijani companies to enter both markets.</p><h4>Could you tell us about your first experience with Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We have been working on legal projects with clients from Azerbaijan for several years and are proud to say that our firm was one of the first Austrian companies to enter the Azerbaijani market. Beginning initially with the smaller-scale legal cases of private companies from Azerbaijan, we expanded to representing the interests of Azerbaijani clients before the European Court of  Human Rights.</p><h4>Why did a joint venture operation appeal to you above other modes of establishing a presence in the country?</h4><p>In general, it is not easy for a law firm to position itself internationally, primarily as different regions require different business models. One cannot simply employ the same strategy in the enormous markets of Russia or China as in the smaller, network-oriented markets of Azerbaijan. We established a joint venture as we felt that current traditional models are simply sub-par for our clients. Our competitors who operate internationally do so mainly on the basis of a sort of franchise system in which they collaborate with local lawyers under the name of a Western law firm. The most successful local firms, however, are usually well established in their domestic markets and are not inclined to work under a foreign name. Meanwhile, smaller firms operate internationally with loose networks. This does not necessarily make for an ideal solution based on international standards, and consequently we developed a new strategy. Depending on the size of the target market, we maintain different numbers of qualified “best-friend firms", combining this site model with the activities of legal experts in the target markets with our main offices in Vienna and Bratislava. As with BHM, these legal experts not only know every aspect of their domestic markets, but also coordinate collaboration with the appropriate partners for each project and guarantee the necessary quality assurance. Our joint venture became the very first project of its kind in Azerbaijan and the model is a unique solution combining the services of the deep-rooted international experience of LGP with successful local firm BHM.</p><h4>Could you highlight any specific foreign investment success stories in which your firm has been involved?</h4><p>We offer valuable assistance to foreign companies entering the market and are committed to the continued success of the region as a destination for FDI. We have assisted several companies in quickly registering their branch offices in Baku and also providing them with all necessary legal backing and market consultancy services. Today these companies are operating in Azerbaijan successfully with our ongoing cooperation. As I mentioned before we have also established the Austrian-Azerbaijani Chamber of Commerce (ATAZ), which has now attracted numerous members and aims to further strengthen business relationships in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the flight frequencies and passenger volumes changed since you entered the business?<br></h4><p>The frequency of flights has not changed in 15 years. The frequency is regulated by governmental agreements between Germany and Azerbaijan. By law we can only fly four times per week from Germany to Azerbaijan and vice-versa. This is a bilateral agreement, and so the rights for both sides are the same. That is why the frequency does not change. We are currently operating at a 72% load factor. Most of our passengers are from foreign companies, yet the amount of local passengers is growing quickly.</p><h4>What is behind the increase in the amount of local passengers?</h4><p>The financial power of the local population is growing. People who could not afford to travel with Lufthansa before are now able to. Another reason for the growth is that more and more Azerbaijanis are coming into prominent positions in foreign companies, and can afford to travel in various classes. This has led to more passengers choosing to travel Lufthansa, rather than cheaper airlines such as Aeroflot, Turkish Airlines, or Azerbaijan Airlines. Around four or five years ago Azerbaijanis only made up 10% of our passengers, now the number is closer to 25%.</p><h4>What are your future ambitions for Lufthansa in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Lufthansa has a very good relationship with the aviation authorities here as well as the government, and so if we see the need to increase our frequencies we believe it will be possible. But for the time being there are too many market entrants. Therefore, at the moment, I do not see a need for additional capacity in the market.</p><h4>How have the increased capacities impacted Lufthansa?</h4><p>Lufthansa is a premium carrier. We have a real first class and a real business class, and we are the only airline with this product in the market. Our customer group is not affected in the business class and first class categories by capacity increases. Capacity increases mainly impact revenues derived from economy class. Although we have seen a slight negative effect, the recent global economic crisis created more cause for concern as companies began to initiate travel policies prohibiting flying first and business class. Our product is really unique in the market. We have in-built monitors in every seat to provide entertainment, which is not something other airlines offer.</p><h4>Online ticket purchasing is still very unpopular in Azerbaijan, do you see it as a potential growth area?</h4><p>Internet purchases are basically non-existent in Azerbaijan. It is a phenomenon that is similar to the situation in Russia. It may stem from a lack of trust when it comes to using credit cards online. Internet sales only represent around 1% of our total sales. To try and increase that number we offer special fares that cannot be seen in agencies, yet our outlook is not too optimistic as the 1% of tickets we sell through the internet are mostly purchased by foreigners.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkish Airlines (THY) has increased its daily number of flights from Istanbul-Baku from three to four times. How has the market changed over the 20 years that Turkish Airlines has been in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>We have seen impressive development. We started with two flights a week and over the years that has increased. Now we operate three to four flights a day, and this is a signal that the Azerbaijan transportation market is growing quickly. This is a turning point for us in our Azerbaijan operations.</p><h4>What sector is behind this growth?</h4><p>Both tourism and business are behind the growth. In tourism, more people are traveling for holidays and for shopping. Turkey is a good destination for shopping—like Dubai.</p><h4>Is a charter flight from Baku to Antalya being considered in view of the attractiveness of Turkey as a tourist destination?</h4><p>Antalya is a brand and a well-known tourism destination, especially in Azerbaijan. It is very easy to get flight services to Antalya, and it's very inexpensive. It has very comfortable five-star hotels, very good cuisine, and because of this people love Antalya. We don't fly directly to Antalya, but Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL) travels directly there. We have very good connections via Istanbul. Maybe in the future we will have a direct flight, but we don't have any plans for it at the moment.</p><h4>THY has partnered with AZAL in the past. How has this relationship developed?</h4><p>We have good relations with AZAL. Those relations are an issue for the headquarters of THY. We operate separately, but are very friendly. There is no problem or conflict with any airline. It is, however, our only competition in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>THY also flies to the eastern Azerbaijan enclave of Nakhchivan. How would you describe the demand for this destination?</h4><p>We now have three flights between Nakhchivan and Istanbul per week in the summertime, and we fly twice a week during the winter.</p><h4>Will THY add further routes from Azerbaijan to Istanbul?</h4><p>If we do, we will add Ganja as a destination. However, we don't have concrete plans for this yet.</p><h4>What is the company doing to increase passenger capacity?</h4><p>We are improving quality and supply, and we hope that the fourth flight will increase capacity and help passengers get better connections to Europe and other regions. This is the most positive aspect of increased daily flights.</p><h4>How significant is the Azerbaijani market to THY?</h4><p>It is an important market for us because we don't have many cities that we fly to four times a day. Naturally, Azerbaijan is a very important market for THY. As a broader country we have many things in common with Turkey.</p><h4>What is your own background?</h4><p>I was working in Uzbekistan previously. It is easier for us here because we have more Turkish companies in Azerbaijan and more frequency, and because of this I am happy. In Uzbekistan we had five flights a week, and here, just from Baku, we have 28 a week.</p><h4>How important is promotion in increasing your business in Baku?</h4><p>To determine this is very difficult because it requires special evaluation to know what effect a global advertising campaign has on the Azerbaijani market. However, the global names like Manchester United and Barcelona FC are known in Azerbaijan—more so than say Kobe Bryant from the US is here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When did Air Astana enter the Azerbaijani market?<br></h4><p>Astana started flights to Baku from March 29, 2009. On the first few flights there weren't many passengers, but then the market became aware of our new service. At the same time we were competing against another private airline, which operated once a week with a Baku-Tashkent-Almaty flight and once a week on the Baku-Astana route. For people from Almaty and Baku our service was new and comfortable because it was a direct non-stop flight operated on a new aircraft Airbus A320 with good service. In the short period of one year, we managed to stimulate traffic between Almaty and Baku and on August 6, 2010, we added one more service increasing our frequency to three times a week. We have strong passenger numbers for flights in the summer months, and a naturally lower demand during the winter. It is still very popular and we are committed to keeping and developing the frequency because it is more convenient for passengers to plan a business trip or meet friends and family. Even in winter we maintain our three-flight schedule; we are considering a further increase.</p><h4>So seasonality is very much a factor?</h4><p>Yes it is. Usually business traffic in the summer months decreases. According to embassy statistics, 150,000 ethnic Azeris live in Kazakhstan, and so our service between the two countries is good. Ethnic Azeris sometimes come for the first time to visit Azerbaijan—their motherland—on our flights. Some of them have business in Kazakhstan, but it is difficult to make exact forecasts. Nevertheless, we have a stable year around traffic stimulated by business activities.</p><h4>How have you introduced internet sales to your customers and how would you characterize the uptake?</h4><p>The company launched its Internet Booking Engine (IBE) in summer 2008. In Kazakhstan in 2009 and 2010 we made special deals with banks so you can use the call center and then go to the bank and pay, and then your ticket is sent to your e-mail. We see that passengers find purchasing through the internet increasingly convenient, and our sales are up by 40% compared to 2010.</p><h4>In addition to Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL), who are your main competitors?</h4><p>AZAL operates services into Aktau in West Kazakhstan and we operate to Almaty. We are in indirect competition with other carriers that offer services through other countries, but for passengers that prefer a direct service we are the first choice.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Azersun?<br></h4><p>Azersun started its operations back in 1991 in Azerbaijan. At that time, Azerbaijan was at war and the country was suffering from a lack of food. We brought food products into the market and solved the problem partially. We sold food products at suitable prices according to the demand of the people. After 1996, we established factories producing tea, butter, sugar, and canned food. Right now, we have the strongest sales network in the region. Azersun Holding has implemented crucial projects in the agriculture sector.</p><h4>What are the values that lead your enterprise to its leading position in the Azerbaijani market?</h4><p>In every job we do, we aim for quality. That's why all of our products are made with the utmost care and diligence.</p><h4>How many employees do your companies employ in total?</h4><p>We employ almost 6,000 people. However, including all of our side sectors the number exceeds 100,000. That makes us very happy.</p><h4>How do your companies work together to further global development in the agribusiness sector?</h4><p>Azersun Holding enterprises are managed by one system. On top of all, there is company etiquette. This systematizes the company approach. All my personnel own their own job and they are a source of pride for me. We are growing faster because of them. The synergy comes from the respect and good relations among them, and by them believing in what they do.</p><h4>How do you ensure a high standard of produce?</h4><p>We don't present any products to our customers that we wouldn't eat at our own tables at home. We aim for quality. In all our factories, we have modern laboratories, which work under a quality-control system. Our factories work according to ISO standards.</p><h4>How do you promote your business practices?</h4><p>Azersun Holding has its own lifestyle. Our philosophy consists of important values like business etiquette, being sensitive to the environment, and being open to new things. In every area that we operate, like agriculture, construction, and manufacturing, we seek to demonstrate our values.</p><h4>Through your history, you have always had ties with foreign countries. What does this international feature represent today?</h4><p>We attend exhibitions and conferences in different countries. We are very proud to represent the brand “Made in Azerbaijan". Our continuously developing enterprises understand the responsibility of representing the country in every exhibition or conference that they attend to promote Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How have your production facilities developed over time? Are there any plans to expand them?</h4><p>Our holding is growing faster because of President Ilham Aliyev's attention and concern in developing the private sector. Azerbaijan's economy has started to open up, and now Azerbaijani companies can establish enterprises in neighboring counties.</p><h4>How is your network outside of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Our sales network is the strongest distribution network in the Caucasus. Our factory production covers national demand.</p><h4>In what respect has the global crisis affected your business and what mechanisms have you implemented to overcome this period?</h4><p>If I say we weren't affected by the economic crisis, it wouldn't be true. We work internationally and have partners in many countries, and so the crisis had an impact. However, our company philosophy is established on quality and human capital. During the economic crisis, we only delayed our investment projects.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for foreign investment in the food-processing sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>First of all, investors should respect the country's people and law. They should be aware of its law. In every country, quality products find their own customers. We always use a professional approach in assessing product demand and performing market research. Firstly, we always learn the relationship between supply and demand. I don't believe in entering a market without first making market and consumer research. The food industry loves quality. Everybody wants to bring home quality products and quality bread to their home. In Azerbaijan, this love of quality has created opportunities for all investors in different sectors.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the agribusiness sector in the near future?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has great potential in the agriculture, industry, and tourism sectors. The government is taking very significant steps to develop the infrastructure of these sectors and the effort is already evident. If we didn't have government support, we couldn't have these attractive projects in Azerbaijan as a whole. President Ilham Aliyev is very dynamic and visionary. He sees Azerbaijan's future and takes a strong interest in all reforms. I believe Azerbaijan's future will be great because our country's economic policy depends on economic diversification, by investing oil and gas revenues in developing other areas of the non-oil sector. In addition, the globalization of the world economy has meant there are few border constraints in the economic sense. There are very few countries left that are not open to the world, and so Azerbaijan is a very attractive location for foreign  investment.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about the dairy market in Azerbaijan and Danone's operations in the country?</h4><p>The dairy market in Azerbaijan has shown immense growth, increasing by around 100% in three years. We are the leading company in terms of market share. In terms of market size, we're at approximately ‚¬25 million. Most of our products are fresh and pasteurized. We import our goods into Azerbaijan from Russia and Turkey. Some products like UHT milk and Danette come from Turkey, while fresh products like Actimel and Rastishka come from Russia.</p><h4>What would you say are your main challenges in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We have difficulties in transportation, not because of Azerbaijan per se, but because of our products' short shelf life, which is just 30 days. To give you some idea: we produce once a week, our products wait about three days in Russia, that leaves 27 days... then there's another four days on the road, followed by another one or two days for custom clearance, so all in all the average shelf life estimate for any one of our products is about 20 days. This puts pressure on our distribution chain. We serve around 6,000 stores in Azerbaijan, and we cover about 75% of the country. Our maximum coverage could soon reach 8,000 stores.</p><h4>What sort of distribution model do you use?</h4><p>We have a single distributor. It both exports and distributes our products. Danone uses distributors because without a plant it doesn't want to enter the distribution business. Our distributor is Atropatena. In 2008 it presented us with a project aimed at producing fresh dairy products in Azerbaijan. It wanted to invest in Azerbaijan. It's a big plant with a capacity of around 200 tons a day—more than Azerbaijan's current needs, and this factory will be open soon. It'll start real milk production, followed by ayran (a yogurt drink), smetana (Russian sour cream), and other products. We'll export to Georgia, Iran, Turkmenistan, and also southern Russia. Our industrial team DEW (Danone Energy Worldwide) checked all the procedures and necessary steps to be taken in the factory, and figured out which machines we'd need. After the necessary technology transfer we started work on the plant. Once the plant is approved by the authorities, we'll start co-packing.</p><h4>What unique qualities exist in the Azerbaijani FMCG sector?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's market in fresh dairy is a bit like Turkey's. The most marketable products are plain yogurt and smetana. There isn't a big market for packaged milk.</p><h4>Who is your main competition in the Azerbaijani market?</h4><p>There are some Russian products on the market, like Chudo, which is a product made by Wimm-Bill-Dann. It also bought a plant in Georgia. Our biggest competitor is a German company called Ehermann. It produces in Russia and exports to Azerbaijan. Another Dutch company, Campina, also produces in Russia. Our market share is around 65% in revenue terms, but in volume share it's around 61% since our products are more expensive than our competitors'.</p><h4>Is there a big difference in quality between your products and your competitors'?</h4><p>Well, like I said earlier, our products are all fresh and pasteurized. That means they have less of a shelf life than, say, competitors' smetana, which are cheap and popular here, as they are processed using an ultra-high-temperature (UHT) method. That means that its products' bacteria are all killed off, whether they be good bacteria or bad bacteria. As a result, its products have shelf lives of between three and six months. That's its advantage. But most of our products are pasteurized, whereby we kill the bad bacteria and keep the good. That means our products are better for you, since that bacteria is crucial for the immune system and digestion, and provides vitamin D, amongst other things. The competitors' products only provide protein.</p><h4>What sort of reforms do you think would be necessary to improve your business operations here in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>There used to be no support for milk farming. It was only at the beginning of 2011 that support and subsidies were introduced. The government has now increased its aid to undeveloped regions. It gives good credit at low interest rates. Good cow breeds are also being imported into Azerbaijan now, increasing overall milk production. The two main collective farms, left over from the Soviet era, are in Ismaili and Sheki, and have very good production capacities. Every villager knows how to produce milk.</p><h4>What's your outlook for the Azerbaijani market in FMCG and dairy products in 2011?</h4><p>The market is growing rapidly. In the last two years four large milk production companies were established. In the last four years our own growth has been at 25%, which is very good.</p><h4>How do you promote your products?</h4><p>We produce TV commercials with big local celebrities such as actors, Azerbaijani Eurovision contestants, and the like. We also have market promotions, discounts, and taste tests. On top of that we assume social responsibilities in Azerbaijan, distributing leaflets to kindergartens and schools.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What progress is being made on healthcare reform, and what are you targeting in the short term?<br></h4><p>Reform in all spheres, including the medical sphere, is developing rapidly in Azerbaijan. We are upgrading our hospitals and polyclinics by providing them with equipment, heating, and foods that meet our standards. In the past five years, more than 400 new medical establishments have been constructed or renovated. In 2010 alone works on 45 medical establishments were completed by the Ministry of Health and were fully provided with modern equipment and devices. Our priority is to reconstruct the dilapidated system from the inside out. This is being achieved by renovating and constructing new buildings, providing equipment, and raising the level of medical services. Today, these reforms are seen to be successful, and the rapid construction of new medical establishments, the reconstruction and modernization of all available hospitals and polyclinics, and the provision of new equipment are all indicators of progress in our health system. As has always been the case, our target is to provide a basic, universal, and high-quality medical service.</p><h4>Are healthcare reforms being based to any extent on the success of the health sectors in neighboring countries such as Turkey?</h4><p>Of course, every country undertaking large-scale reform partially takes lessons from more experienced states in the field. For instance, the certification process we conducted was a new step for our country and we used the practices of other developed countries as well as other examples, such as introducing the idea of a family doctor.</p><h4>How do you see the role for further international partnerships in health care developing?</h4><p>In general, the Ministry of Health highly values issues related to personnel. In 2010, 128 Azerbaijani medical workers raised the level of their professional abilities by taking qualifications in clinics abroad to improve their diagnostic skills. A number of agreements have been reached in the field of medical science with some well-known medical universities in several countries to exchange doctors and students. According to these agreements, Azerbaijani students take courses to improve their knowledge in Germany, Turkey, Poland, Russian, Belarus, and Ukraine. At present, approximately 40 medical workers are taking advanced professional courses in clinics in Ankara as part of our medical reform project.</p><h4>Does the government have any specific plans to reduce Azerbaijan's reliance on imported medical products by encouraging the construction of new pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities?</h4><p>Of course, we are considering all of our options. At the same time, it should be noted that importing medicine into our country is currently more beneficial than production from a market point of view.</p><h4>Private medical services have been limited to small clinics, general practice, and emergency treatment. Is Azerbaijan considering encouraging the development of the private health sector via investment or privatization to improve the level of service?</h4><p>Private medical establishments are an integral part of the medical sector here in Azerbaijan, as they are all over the world. The Ministry of Health is constantly monitoring conditions in the private medical and pharmaceutical sectors. Currently, there are 252 outpatient, 72 stationary, and 266 dental medical establishments run by the private sector. Moreover, 82 establishments import medical supplies in the pharmaceutical sector and there are 554 private pharmacies. The Ministry of Health is interested in developing the private sector, and conducts meetings and seminars with private sector players and acts as a constant source of advice.</p><h4>Do you have any plans to increase the ratio of physicians and beds per capita?</h4><p>On the contrary, we intend to reduce the ratio as part of our reforms. We are looking to optimize bed funding and structure, and close medical establishments that are proven to be superfluous or inadequate. As a result of reforms implemented by us so far, bed stock has been reduced by 40% to 50% on average in order to improve service quality. This work continues in Baku and other cities around Azerbaijan. These reforms are being implemented according to the standard rules seen in EU member states. Furthermore, the level of personnel is sufficient in our country and we find no need to expand staff numbers at the  present time.</p><h4>What projects are currently underway in Azerbaijan with the World Health Organization and UNICEF? What have been the key achievements of these projects so far?</h4><p>The Azerbaijani medical sector is winning considerable prestige on the international stage after a series of successes. Azerbaijan's hosting of the WHO's 61st Regional Committee for Europe indicates that health care in Azerbaijan is held in high esteem by the most advanced states of Europe. The joint business plan with the Ministry of Health and UNICEF for 2011-2012 is aimed at developing and strengthening the health system. Attention will specifically be paid to the delivery quality of medical services, an improved neonatal aid service, and the provision of technical assistance to the government. UNICEF has specified early diagnosis and preventative medicine purposely aimed at children. The universal iodination of salt is also priority area for us.</p><h4>What are the key public health projects the Health Ministry is currently implementing?</h4><p>Health care has become a very important national issue recently. In response to this, we have begun a formal accreditation process to ensure all higher or secondary professional educational institutes for medicine and pharmaceutical studies abide by the same standards. This process has been implemented for some months and our medical workers have passed through this process very successfully. After initial certification, there follows a residency stage, before the transition to being a family doctor is allowed. Other projects include signing up to the Bologna Process in medical education and continuing our upgrade program across the health sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Nokia Siemens Networks' (NSN) involvement in the Azerbaijani market?<br></h4><p>We started off as Siemens LLC before going into a joint venture with Nokia. Siemens LLC entered the Azerbaijani market with GSM network equipment and services in 2006 after it won the GSM network tender from Azerfon. Azerfon was at that time preparing for its launch into the Azerbaijani mobile market. Shortly afterwards we also won a network modernization tender from Bakcell. Considering our increasing involvement in the country, it was decided to set up a dedicated subsidiary for the network infrastructure business in Azerbaijan. We've since then become a small regional hub, supporting also NSN business in Georgia and Turkmenistan from here.</p><h4></h4><h4>What are some of the main challenges that Nokia Siemens Networks has faced in rolling out the 2G and 3G network in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Our first challenge was that the majority of our team was completely new to this environment. It was quite a challenge to find on short notice skilled local engineers and staff, especially for the implementation, maintenance, and planning of GSM network infrastructure. Azerbaijan was also a completely new legal environment for the first management of the new subsidiary. To find appropriate sites for our radio equipment was also a challenge. When we entered the market, property values were booming—as were the expectations of landowners. Azerbaijan is also today a very dynamic market. But in 2006 and 2007 Azerbaijan experienced growth rates between 20% and 30%, making Azerbaijan then the country with the biggest relative growth rates in the world. So, site acquisition was a challenge, as well as getting the necessary legal permits. Later, site acquisition was taken care of directly by our customers.</p><h4></h4><h4>How would you compare the Azerbaijani market to the other markets that you cover in Georgia and Turkmenistan?</h4><p>The Georgian telecoms market is very deregulated. In Georgia, the first 3G network was commercially launched as early as 2006. So we can say that Georgia is quite ahead of many other countries, including even Russia and Turkey and most CIS countries with regard to launching new telecom technologies. Georgia is very focused on services industries like tourism, banking, infrastructure, transport, and telecommunications. Certainly, the main difference is that Georgia has no big oil or gas resources of its own. Turkmenistan, on the other hand, is exactly the opposite. The telecommunications sector there remains tightly regulated and all telecommunications operators at the moment are government owned. So Azerbaijan is located sort of in the middle. We have a healthy competition here in the GSM sector between the three mobile operators: Azerfon, Bakcell, and Azercell.</p><h4></h4><h4>Who are your main competitors when it comes to the provision of mobile network infrastructure?</h4><p>It's not just a competitive market on the mobile operators' side, but also in terms of infrastructure vendors. All the biggest world players are here and they are very active. Nevertheless, Nokia Siemens Networks could acquire and retain a very strong market share in Azerbaijan. For example, when Bakcell launched a second modernization and capacity extension project in 2009, NSN won the tender against quite tough competition.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[True Fiber]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[true-fiber]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the idea behind the creation of Azertelecom in 2008?<br></h4><p>The intention was to have more telecommunications companies operating in the country in order to boost competition and quality, and lower cost. This is why the company was founded. Our shareholders include Azerfon, Aztelekom, and Baku State Telephone Network (BTRIB). We received a lot of start-up support from these firms in the form of assets and know-how that we could work with. That was the basis to set up the company.</p><h4>What are the primary ICT services that you bring to customers?</h4><p>Azertelecom has all the necessary licenses in the country to perform telecommunications operations, except for mobile operations. Based on those we have three main businesses. One is to handle international telephone minutes; we partly facilitate in-country traffic, and also outgoing traffic from mobile operators. Our second main business activity is international fiber connections. One such connection runs via Georgia and Turkey, and another via Russia; also connections to Iran have been established. We bring the internet to Azerbaijan and also sell it to neighboring countries. The third main line of our business is high-capacity backbone services based on latest stage fiber optical network technology. We offer everything in terms of the voice and data for businesses both nationally and internationally. We count big mobile operators and other corporate customers as our clients.</p><h4>What were the major challenges that you faced in Azerbaijan to roll out your network?</h4><p>There was no need to roll out a completely new network because there already was an extensive fiber network available. We pursue a policy of renting fiber and dark fiber networks. As for challenges, so far the quality of existing fibers is okay, but could be better. The larger challenge is to manage and maintain networks outside of Baku. There are large distances between the cities and villages, and the roads are not always the best. It is therefore impossible to have a technical field engineer immediately in all locations available in case fiber cuts happen or equipment fails. However, we are building our organization and processes to an international quality level and with customer satisfaction in mind.</p><h4>What is the status of e-government development in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Overall, the mission of our company is to serve the country, its population, and companies, both in Baku and the countryside. We are proud to be witnessing the development of e-government in Azerbaijan as a major contribution to the development of the country through the creation of high-capacity network and internet services. E-government will make all data exchanges and databases transparent, connected to one another, and accessible for the entire population and all companies. That is the intention of the whole program in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>Do you  elieve mobile operators represent significant competition in the internet market?</h4><p>I don't see major competition from mobile operators in the field of internet services. The main focus of mobile internet is on mobility, which cannot be provided by fixed-line operators. On the other hand, cable-based infrastructure, like fiber-optic cables provided directly to businesses and residential apartments, offers almost unlimited bandwidth even in both directions, uploading and downloading. Future high-capacity services such as user-generated-content and cloud computing can only be served by fixed-line operators Therefore, while addressing different needs, mobile and fixed internet operators are complementary and are not competing in the field of internet services.</p><h4>What potential does Azerbaijan have to attract foreign investment to the ICT market?</h4><p>The biggest positive here is that the market is still developing fast, and so it is reasonable to expect double-digit growth over the coming years. Still, the PC penetration rate is still not at the level of Europe or Asia; the same goes for internet penetration and capacity used per user. But increased PC and broadband penetrations are the base for any kind of ICT services in the B2B and B2C segments. International investors might participate even during this development stage and will find later a partly underutilized market potential ready for new businesses.</p><h4>What are the main hurdles to increasing the internet penetration rate?</h4><p>On one side the mentioned low PC penetration rate is a hurdle. But also technical problems, the low capacity of existing offers, and insufficient quality of existing lines are blocking development. Azertelecom is positioning itself in exactly this area by rolling out state-of-the-art infrastructure, high quality services, and a strong focus on customers. Of course, there are several areas of the consumer market that we need to educate as well. One such group is the elderly. Generally, the younger generations are more educated in terms of technologies, yet the level of internet use amongst the older generation here is lower than in other countries.</p><h4>What potential does e-commerce have to develop in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>E-commerce is one of the upcoming internet services in Azerbaijan. However, it requires a decent PC, high internet penetration rate, reliable networks, and high-quality customer-friendly applications. Another big need is the implementation of easy-to-use electronic payment mechanisms. All of these elements are under development, and once available e-commerce will boom and customers will learn quickly the benefits of e-commerce from their own experience.</p><h4>What renders Azerbaijan more attractive than its neighboring countries in relation to the ICT market?</h4><p>First of all, Azerbaijan has a very central position at the crossroads between West and East, North and South, Europe and Asia. Our national network and international connections are based on latest-stage DWDM, SDH, and IP/MPLS technology, and the goal is to develop Azerbaijan as the ICT pearl of the region. Due to its strategic geographic position between huge markets such as Russia and Iran, Europe and Central Asia, up to India and China, Azerbaijan may become the international hub of the region. We are building the communications highway for this to become a reality.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the ICT sector in the coming years?</h4><p>As for the country itself, we must work in Baku and all regions, providing information technology and communication means. With our network, we'll bring this prosperity to the entire country. Another of our major plans is to connect the buildings here in Baku directly to fiber cables and bring real broadband to apartments, to the consumer, and to businesses and governmental bodies. We are very active on these projects. So far, there are some DSL and wireless access possibilities, but the quality is not that impressive, and the capacity is low. We are installing completely new infrastructure. In addition to that, a strong customer focus will be a major differentiator.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We've just finished basic refurbishment of the hotel, aimed at improving service standards and giving our guests a true five-star experience.</p><h4>What occupancy rates does the Grand Hotel Europe experience in seasonality?</h4><p>It can vary to 40% at a minimum, though averages around 60% or 70% year round. When major conferences or trade fairs are held, we usually reach full occupancy levels, as most other five-star hotels do in Baku.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the booming luxury hotel market in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The more competitors you have, the more improvements you must make to stay at the cutting edge. For me, more competition is better for business. This growth we are seeing is positive, and was one of the reasons we initiated a major refurbishment of the hotel to keep it at the cutting edge of the market.</p><h4>What portion of the market are you targeting?</h4><p>We are primarily targeting the business market, as it is the mainstay of the five-star market in Baku at present. However, with Eurovision just around the corner, we are likely going to see increased leisure tourism coming in to Baku.</p><h4>The hotel is located in the middle of a sports and concert complex, and is close to a number of major corporate centers. What advantages does the location bring?</h4><p>As all city hotels of Baku, we have the advantage of year-round business here. However, our extensive parking facilities in front of the hotel and main roads at all sides of the property make us more suitable for business travellers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the Azerbaijan Franchising Association play?<br></h4><p>We try and educate people on why franchising is a better way of doing business or opening a business in Azerbaijan. We help them prepare a business plan and a marketing strategy. Often in Azerbaijan, business managers aren't used to drawing up business plans and marketing plans, except when they're applying for credit from banks. But in franchising, you do not get the rights to a franchise without a business plan, and a solid business plan at that. What makes a franchise advantageous and desirable is the name, and what makes the name quality is the consistency in the quality of services offered regardless of in which country it may be. There needs to be trust in a name, for example, people expect a Big Mac in Azerbaijan to be the same as in New York. Another goal of ours is also to help Azerbaijani companies sell franchises. This means money for Azerbaijan, and it also means good PR for Azerbaijan. We provide services for both franchisers and franchisees.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about those services?</h4><p>We organize seminars and essentially give consulting services, free of charge. We're dealing a lot with shopping malls, where big names are required, be it in terms of clothing stores or fast food and so on. Mall operators need big names, they need Benetton and Burger King, for example. Therefore, another thing we do is set up partnerships for franchises to operate within. Money isn't the only issue. You need to find people who understand those businesses, who can manage those businesses, and who can guarantee the set standards that brands demand. We have partnerships with the World Franchise Federation, the Turkish Franchise Association, and with the Baltic Franchise Association, the Greek Franchise Association, and so forth. We benefit a lot from their experience, and we bring members of these associations in for seminars.</p><h4>Have you seen positive results for your efforts?</h4><p>We have been seeing some good results, yet we expect more. There are still big names like Starbucks, Zara, and H&amp;M that simply won't come to Azerbaijan because they cannot develop the right strategic plans as the conditions aren't right for them. We're trying to change that, but it's going to take some time.</p><h4>What about your program for the development of entrepreneurship in the non-oil sector?</h4><p>I met with the Minister of Economic Development about this program, but unfortunately the program hasn't developed yet. We are still trying to promote this and to promote the development of SMEs in Azerbaijan. A large portion of the country's revenue still comes from oil and gas, and this is not a good thing. We need to diversify.</p><h4>What regulatory challenges are there to franchising in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The regulations aren't the main issue, the main issue is that people understand how franchising works. Having said that, incentives such as tax breaks would also help, and that is something we're working to achieve.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you regard the success of the government's plan to increase tourism so far?</h4><p>The hospitality industry, which services tourism, has definitely improved over the last seven years in Iran. Some of that is the private sector, and some of it is the government. Many of the big hotels are state-run and I think they have done their share of renovations and training with the time and effort spent on them. But I think what will fuel further improvement is more tourism.</p><p>For a typical tourist who isn't here for business, we have a lot of historical monuments that need to be well maintained. For those who want to see these or even the inscriptions from 2,500 years ago, we need to provide experienced, informative guides, and additional literature.</p><h4>What should be done in Iran to increase the number of business tourists? For example, micro solutions like service people, not just for your company but the whole tourism industry.</h4><p>Over the last 10 years we have come a long way in terms of service, which is essential to attract business tourists. Foreign guests especially demand a high level of service and we must aim to not only meet their expectations, but exceed them. I would say that the level of service is definitely not what it should be. We have a lot of shortcomings. Obviously, transportation is always a big problem inside Tehran, with the traffic and all. Pollution is also a big problem for many people. But the level of service has definitely improved in Tehran over the last seven to 10 years. However, it will not continue to improve unless we have more foreign guests.</p><h4>And in the last 10 years how has it improved?</h4><p>It has improved a lot. The hotels have improved. The food and beverage industry in Tehran has improved more than any other industry in the whole country over the last decade.</p><h4>What is your target market for Raamtin Residence Hotel?</h4><p>The strategy of the hotel hasn't changed over the last 15 to 20 years. Our focus is on the business professional, and therefore cleanliness, prompt service, and good food are a priority. In 2009 all our rooms were fully renovated and we invested heavily in our internet and IT support.</p><h4>Who are your main competitors in the market?</h4><p>Many new hotels have been built over the last five years, so the market for international customers has become very competitive. We have a strong focus on service and, as well as our recent renovations, we are building the first automated parking structure in Iran. Parking is at a premium here and this will be a major advantage for the comfort of our guests.</p><p>I believe we also have the best food department of any hotel in the country. For example, to cater for our international guests, breakfasts include fresh pancakes, omelets, and French toast to order, plus all the standard items of a breakfast menu.</p><h4>Do your staff undergo specific training?</h4><p>Yes, many of our staff study at hospitality schools and we also provide in-house training. Western tourists have only been in Iran for the last 10 or 15 years. Before that, our staff were not used to servicing foreign guests. The Western world has the highest levels of hospitality, and when Western tourists come to the country they are going to need and expect the same level of service.</p><h4>Have you noticed a change in the countries of origin of your tourists, as Iran increases its ties with Asian and African countries?</h4><p>Absolutely. The majority of our guests were from Western Europe and Japan. Now we still have Western tourists in our hotel, but it seems there are more Asian business tourists, particularly from China and Malaysia. We are still in a transition period, but I think there is more of this to be seen in the next 12 months, and to some extent they are replacing some of the Western business people.</p><h4>What are the busiest times of the year for you?</h4><p>I would say that during exhibitions, those are the best and busiest times of the year for us. Typically, when there is a good exhibition in town, we're completely booked. In Iran, the exhibitions are fairly spread out all year round. We also have a conference room that we rent out for seminars, training, and conferences. Often the attendees travel from abroad, so we house them and host the seminars at the same time. We are in the process of expanding the hotel, so we're going to be building another conference room facility. We are also expanding the restaurant upstairs above the lobby and possibly building another restaurant within the hotel.</p><h4>Do you have any plans to build more hotels outside Tehran? Are there other cities growing in terms of business?</h4><p>There are, definitely Esfahan and Shiraz, and probably Tabriz and Kish. We do not have plans to expand because I'm involved in other businesses, and so I focus on Tehran. Kish Island actually has a lot of domestic tourism. Tourism is doing very well there, and there has been a lot of expansion in the hotel industry in the last 10 years.</p><h4>What would you say to a foreign tourist or business person thinking of coming to Iran?</h4><p>I think essentially what I've heard from so many foreign tourists and visitors is that Iran is a lot different to the way it's portrayed to the international community. Visitors are pleasantly surprised when they visit Iran. There are definitely shortcomings, but I would encourage everyone to come, and the feedback I've had has been fairly positive. What they will see will be very different from what they have seen in the media.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What's the background story to Pars Caravansary?</h4><p>Pars Caravansary is a private tourism development company established as a tourism holding by Ghadir Investment Company (51%) and Aryaalove (49%). Pars Caravansary was established to invest in tourism industry infrastructure, operate tourism facilities focused on rest areas, and offer consulting services to the tourism industry.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the current state of the tourism industry in Iran and where do you see the most room for growth?</h4><p>Iran has a high potential to attract tourists, with its beautiful landscapes, cultural heritage sites, wide range of activities from hiking and skiing in the mountains to beach holidays by the Persian Gulf, the Caspian Sea, and faith tourism. But at the moment the status is not satisfactory. Iran has attracted just 2.3 million tourists in 2009, and this figure is not good relative to other Middle East countries such as Turkey. The tourism industry is very young in Iran. There is little growth in the number of incoming tourists, and we do not expect significant rises in the upcoming years. It seems that the most growth will be in rest areas, chain restaurants, tourism complexes, and chain hotels.</p><h4>How do you think domestic tourism will develop in Iran in the upcoming years? Which destinations will gain popularity?</h4><p>Domestic tourism has undergone high growth in recent years as per capita incomes have increased. The number of personal cars also has affected the quantity of trips. However, traveling is still seasonal and depends on the timing of holidays. Most Iranian people are easy travelers. In some tourism-focused cities such as Mashhad, Shiraz, and Kish Island there are not enough accommodation facilities, whether in the mid-scale and economy segments or even for the luxury segment. We also anticipate transportation will be an attractive segment to invest in after the removal of energy subsidies.</p><h4>In 2005, the government announced a 20-year plan to support the improvement of the tourism industry. As we are coming close to the end of the first quarter of the plan, how do you regard its success?</h4><p>Iran wants to be best in the region and this plan is based on this vision. To realize this plan's targets, Iran must have 8% economic growth each year; however, this target has not been kept. Therefore, the first five years were not in line with the vision.</p><h4>What should be done by the government to support the improvement of the tourism industry in Iran?</h4><p>First, the government should eliminate the barriers in front of tourism development in Iran. The most important barriers are: Iran's international image, the weakness of people's information about tourism attractions, as well as security and safety.</p><p>Secondly, the government must facilitate the establishment of tourism organizations in the private sector and support them to strengthen themselves, provide appropriate regulations, and fairly prepare conditions for firms to compete. Also, public organizations should not compete with private organizations. In other words, the public sector must focus on policy-making.</p><h4>How did you select the areas in which your company will invest? Are you going to have an innovative approach to the Iranian tourism industry as Ghadir Investment seeks to achieve in its other business lines?</h4><p>Pars Caravansary has prioritized its investment outlook into rest areas, chain restaurants, tourism complexes, and chain hotels. We selected these areas after two screening processes. The first process was to consider the attractiveness of a proposition and the second was to evaluate the probability of success. By screening the alternatives from these two stages, areas were selected that had high attractiveness and a high probability of success that also matched Pars Caravansary's capabilities.</p><p>We will definitely bring in an innovative approach. We are going to provide a completely different and innovative rest area concept in Iran that has never existed. In our other investment areas innovation is our first principle.</p><h4>How will Pars Caravansary's investments be financed, and how profitable do you expect these investments to be?</h4><p>We will finance our projects via a portfolio of methods such as commercial bank loans, self-financing formed by unallocated profits (in the future), and other means. For our first project we are going to be financed by credits received from Saderat Bank, which is Ghadir Investment's main shareholder. The areas selected were investigated before and we expect to achieve high profits.</p><h4>Do you intend to enter into any kind of international collaboration to finance these projects or to transfer know-how?</h4><p>Yes, partnership with well-known brands in different parts of our value chain is one of our main strategies. We are seriously studying external collaboration proposals like joint ventures, strategic partnerships, and strategic alliances.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[what-investors-want]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In every country, foreign investors are thinking about where to find the right location to make a profit. In a world of multinational companies and corporate interactivity, business leaders are looking for locations that can offer higher profits, and because of the high level of competition it is not possible to make a good profit just by selling your products and services. Higher profits are now the result of the savings that can be found on taxes, levies, raw materials, labor, and other inputs. As a result, foreign investors look to countries that can provide low-cost labor, cheap and abundant energy and raw materials, and attractive tax regulations. Foreign investors take many risks when they invest abroad, and they want to be sure that when they do there will be a higher level of return.<br></p><p>In Iran, the law governing, attracting, and encouraging foreign investment, commonly called FIPPA, provides a number of major facilities for foreign investors. First, if the business makes a profit, investors are able to transfer all dividends and profits out of the country. If the registration is based on exports, they will be allowed to withdraw all funds from exports depending on the level of permission. In the past there were some restrictions on the transfer of funds out of Iran. The advantage of this law is that even if there are any restrictions imposed, these will not affect foreign investors and they will be able to withdraw their funds. The second advantage is that an investor's capital investment is guaranteed by the government. As a result, investors have the security they need for their capital, and the responsibility of making a profit lies with them.</p><p>If there are safeguards for local investment, there is confidence that the rules and regulations exist to support companies and you will trust that country. Investors look at the regulations and environment that local companies act in. In the past, we had a tax law that was a little bit complicated. The rules and regulations depended all too often on the tax officers. In 2000, the tax code was changed. Full implementation of the law is still being pursued, but this is the first step to provide evidence to a foreign company that if it follows the rules and regulations and prepares proper accounts then these can act in its favor. We also have some labor restrictions from the point of view of the foreign investor. Employers cannot easily terminate the contract of an underperforming employee, and for foreign investors this can be a problem. Local companies face similar difficulties, and all sides should act together to recommend beneficial changes.</p><p>Often, local companies complain that foreign investors ask for too many exemptions, like tax exemptions, work permit exemptions, free energy, and the like. On the other hand, some foreign investors say that in some countries these privileges are written into the law, and any country that wants to attract foreign investment should legalize these incentives. However, I have never seen either case. As an expert in international tax, I have attended many conferences precisely on these issues. I also acted as a local consultant for the World Bank for many years on its projects in Iran, but I have never seen any of these kinds of facilities in any rule book or regulations.</p><p>The most important thing for a foreign investor is the security of their investment, and the stability of the laws and regulations; Iran is trying to show that this is actually the case here. OIETAI, the state agency in charge of implementing FIPPA, has provided extensive support for those seeking to resolve work and residence permit issues, helping them to deal with ministry officials on exports, and getting permissions for the import of machinery and materials. This is what foreign investors want: A committed state agency that will look after their interests.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>Georgia and Azerbaijan are obliged to stand together given their geographic location and common history. We share a common view and we have strong relations. I am convinced that these two countries will be able to create a much better future for themselves through their unity, exemplary relations, and successes.<br></p><p>Both countries have been fragmented by internal conflicts and both continue to be plagued by unresolved problems. Any opponent of Azerbaijan or Georgia is an enemy of both these countries. Our strength is in unity. This is not just what's written on our coat of arms, it is the truth. Those who seek to undermine this unity are opposing our country's interests. Our countries' interests lie in strengthening this strategic partnership.</p><p>The long-term cooperation we have established has already yielded positive results between Baku and the Georgian city of Batumi. Businessmen from Baku work in Batumi, and at the same time business people from Batumi work in Baku. The vessels that have left the port of Batumi are already on their way. This is also the result of cooperation between Baku and Tbilisi. All this is part of our cooperation program. At present, very positive changes are taking place in Baku, and we are very pleased to see them. Development is also under way in Batumi.</p><p>An office for the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) is currently being opened in Batumi, with the consent of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, and we are absolutely sure that this office will operate successfully.</p><p>The Baku-Tbilisi (Akhalkalaki)-Kars railway project signals a geopolitical transformation in our region because a completely new strategic link is opening not only between Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey, but also Central Asia, China, and Europe. Effectively, a modern version of the Silk Road is emerging. This is a project that will take several hundreds of millions of dollars worth of investment, but in the future it will bring in revenue worth billions. This is a project that will certainly be a major guarantee of successful long-term development for each of us.</p><p>This is not just economic progress; this is important strategic progress for our countries. Everyone should take this into account. This is an alternative for Europe, this is a road for oil and gas for Europe as well as a railway and a normal highway, because we are building many roads. We are renovating our Soviet roads enabling China to access Europe via Azerbaijan and Georgia. This is a completely new dimension for our European partners. These are the achievements that are happening now and this is why we are calling this a historic age. We were a region that had almost turned into a dead end, but now we are a region that is needed not just by us but also by others, and that is our special, historic, political, geographic, and economic mission.</p><p>As a result of cooperation with Azerbaijan and Turkey, as a result of a very courageous decision by the Azerbaijani government, Georgia will have an alternative gas supply that provides an increasing share of our gas needs. That means that, unlike many Eastern European countries, we will have a more reliable and cheaper alternative gas supply. Thanks to Azerbaijani gas, 70% of Georgia's needs are met.</p><p>All this has become possible thanks to our friendship. There are no problems between our countries. In recent years our relations have reached the highest possible level, and we will continue working on that. Of course, the foundation of these relations was laid by Heydar Aliyev, and we will do our best to ensure that the relations of friendship we have had for centuries develop further. Thanks to Heydar Aliyev's strategic views, these relations have become stronger. As a result of the tremendous effort made by President Ilham Aliyev, they have strengthened even further. We are absolutely sure that these relations will develop in the interests of stability in our region.</p><p>I believe this is a new start of a very great partnership, friendship and brotherhood. Long live the friendship between Georgia and Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Zqan Holding and what was at the idea behind forming a holding company for your activities?<br></h4><p>Zqan Holding started 11 years ago, and was first developed in London as an idea. While I was studying there, I had the idea to create a holding company in Azerbaijan with a global reach. Zqan Holding's group companies are in the finance, hotel and leisure, construction, and transportation sectors. Our main aim is to be a company that supports Azerbaijan in different markets, to show how the country is developing, and prove that in the business world, Azerbaijan deserves a prime position. Azerbaijan has got a lot of potential and we are aiming to show it to the world. Good businessmen should do business outside the country, but support their country at the same time through promotion mechanisms.</p><h4>What is your assessment of human capital in Azerbaijan when it comes to finding the right person for the job?</h4><p>It is always hard to find skilled and educated people, but through training workers with the necessary skills the right workforce can be developed. We have to be confident that we are attracting the right people. Therefore we have developed an effective selection system. We find the right people for our companies based on our internal HR strategy, procedures, and policies, which are very effective. Zqan Holding has it own internal culture, values, and traditions. I personally believe that the values, beliefs, and objectives of each individual should correspond to the companies within the holding. We currently have approximately 7,000 employees. The best investment is investment in people. That is my approach to human resources in Azerbaijan, and it has worked to create a holding company with many different aspects and one, united synergy. In addition to running training sessions myself, we sponsor people to study in different countries, who then come back with the knowledge they have gained.</p><h4>The holding is deeply involved in the construction sector. What is your evaluation of the industry in Azerbaijan currently?</h4><p>We have won many contracts in the construction sector, and our projects have mainly involved the development of residential buildings. In Guba, around 150 kilometers from Baku, we are also developing one of the biggest hotels in Azerbaijan—the Rixos. The construction sector is booming right now, and people are in the right position to buy houses.</p><h4>As the operator of Le Meridien Hotel, what impact do you expect the development of five-star hotels to have on the sector in general?</h4><p>We are not worried, as new developments are only rising to fill a huge boom in demand. The location of Le Meridien is good, and it has a fixed clientele. I do not expect there to be any visible impact.</p><h4>What challenges remain to improve Azerbaijan as a tourist destination?</h4><p>Lots of things need to be done in this area, especially on the food and beverages side. There is a strong culture of dining in Azerbaijan, and this needs to be played on when it comes to the tourist industry. I believe this is the primary concern right now. To do that, of course, there is a need to educate and train people in how to serve customers. In that respect, four months ago, we sent a few colleagues from our hotels and leisure centers to Los Angeles to study the art of waiting for three months. They have now returned and are passing those skills onto others.</p><h4>What has your contribution to the insurance sector been?</h4><p>There are a lot of insurance companies in the market, but that doesn't mean business is hard to come by. Azerbaijanis like to shop around and compare prices and deals. In that climate, we are focusing on applying fair pricing policies and providing the best customer service.</p><h4>Zqan Holding counts the Bank of Azerbaijan among its group companies. What are you doing to further its development?</h4><p>Service is the first and most important feature in both the banking and the insurance market. Customers should be happy with the services they receive. They have to have peace of mind, and to trust that their money is safe. It is still a small bank, but we are seeing it develop quickly and our outlook is more than positive.</p><h4>How did you see the global economic crisis as the head of a large holding company?</h4><p>The overall effect only constituted a downturn of around 2% to 3% for us. The banking sector was affected more so, but we took the right steps and invested our money in the right places, and therefore we averted any major blows. The construction sector also saw a downturn, but activity is now resuming again. One benefit of running a holding company is that all of your eggs are never in one basket, and that helped us through the difficult years.</p><h4>Are you looking to expand your international ties?</h4><p>Yes, we are. The principal aim of Zqan Holding is to be known globally as an Azerbaijani company. We are trying right now to open factories and sell our manufactured goods worldwide. We have already begun such operations on a small scale, and we export cement to Georgia and Russia.</p><h4>What challenges remain in Azerbaijan to improve the business environment, especially for the construction industry?</h4><p>There aren't any barriers in front of us right now as businessmen. The President has created a superb environment for business to flourish. The economy is open, and the opportunities are endless. It is people who start businesses, and so in order to develop the business environment the government has implemented generous incentives to encourage people to get into the world of business. All kinds of opportunity exist, including tax exemptions on exported agricultural products and others.</p><h4>What would you advise possible foreign investors who are interested in coming to Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Everything the investor needs is here: political stability and trustworthy partners. The economic situation is currently improving tremendously, and wages are also on the up. This is also an indicator that Azerbaijan is on the right track.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Azerbaijan applied for World Trade Organization (WTO) accession in 1997, and I have chaired the meetings of the Working Party since 2000. As Chairman, I have the unique opportunity to oversee and facilitate the process, which is based on substantive work by the acceding government and the results of negotiations with WTO Members. Azerbaijan is a country rich in natural resources. This is quite an advantage already, as resources could be effectively utilized to foster a virtuous cycle.<br></p><p>Just by engaging in its accession process, Azerbaijan is already signaling to the global economy that it is willing to undertake the necessary reforms and play by the rules. The acceding government is, of course, driving the process. The overall speed will depend on the implementation of a WTO-compatible trading regime and the results of negotiations on market access for goods and services. The process will ensure that the trade-related legislation and practices in Azerbaijan comply with international standards.</p><p>The WTO was founded in 1995. However, the multilateral trading system dates back to 1947, when 23 countries signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) with the objective of achieving economic recovery and growth after World War II. For the next 47 years, the GATT governed most of world trade. During this period, global trade grew exponentially. This encouraged countries to further liberalize trade through subsequent rounds of negotiations. The first rounds focused on reducing import tariffs. Non-tariff barriers began to be addressed at the Tokyo Round between 1973 and 1979.</p><div class="quote">“WTO Membership has paved the path toward integration into the global economy and given a strong boost to the business environment in RAMs."</div><p>The Uruguay Round was the eighth and last under the GATT. It was the most comprehensive, as it addressed topics beyond trade in goods. Its results encompass over 500 pages of rules on goods, services, intellectual property, dispute settlement, trade policy review, and the creation of the WTO, as well as market access commitments for goods and services. The results of the Uruguay Round came into force in 1995.</p><p>Since 1995, the WTO has welcomed 25 new Members and 30 governments are in the process of accession. Accession to the WTO is the result of negotiations between the acceding government and WTO Members. The common objective of these negotiations has always been to reach an agreement that would generate mutual trade, increase welfare gains, and strengthen the multilateral rules-based system.</p><p>Accessions are considered on a case-by-case basis. They are adapted to the actual needs of each individual acceding government. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. The results of accession negotiations entail a balance of rights and obligations, which include market access commitments for goods and services and the obligation to abide by WTO rules. In turn, new Members benefit from stable and predictable trade relations with WTO Members.</p><p>WTO accession has proven to be a “win-win game" for both the acceding governments and WTO Members. WTO accession has served as a tool to increase overall welfare and prosperity. Research has shown that being part of the multilateral rules-based system leads to growth, diversification of the economy, and export markets, and it decreases the dependency on trade in a few commodities with limited trading partners. Being a WTO Member also assists countries to attract foreign capital and encourage local businessmen to invest and create new enterprises. It is a fact that recently acceded Members (RAMs) have performed better and grown faster after acceding to the WTO. RAMs, so far, have also been less vulnerable to external and internal shocks.</p><p>Why are countries interested in joining the WTO? Why are countries willing to invest time and resources in a complex process? The answer is simple: because countries can reap actual benefits from WTO Membership. The whole world recognizes that trade is an effective tool for development and poverty reduction. Moreover, the WTO “trademark" sends a positive signal to investors and trading partners worldwide.</p><p>Let's look at the facts: the trade performance of the 25 RAMs has been remarkable. From 1995 to 2009, the trade in goods and services from RAMs grew at rates of 13% and 11%, respectively (much faster than the growth of global trade at 7% for goods and 8% for services). It should also be noted that Albania, China, Georgia, and Lithuania maintained an average annual growth rate of over 20% in the five years following their accessions. Furthermore, recent research has shown that domestic reforms that increase the certainty and predictability of policies, as well as the liberalization of trade in goods and services, have yielded strong positive results for Vietnam.</p><p>Indeed, the results are impressive. Trade is a true and effective tool in the quest for economic growth. However, it would not be prudent to assume that these results were achieved only because a country joined the WTO. In parallel to WTO accession, RAMs have also implemented wide-ranging reforms to strengthen their respective development strategies. The synergies between education, health, financial, infrastructure, and economic reforms are essential in achieving tangible results.</p><p>Over the past 15 years, accession to the WTO has served as an instrument for domestic reforms, particularly in economies in transition and least-developed countries. WTO Membership has paved the path towards integration into the global economy and given a strong boost to the business environment in RAMs. Clear and predictable rules strengthen the confidence of local and foreign investors and accelerate the creation of new enterprises, job creation, diversification of the economy and exports markets, and trade. This is a virtuous cycle, one worth fostering and reinforcing through sound policies and reforms.</p><p>The WTO has a true vocation for universality, and the accession process is at its heart. Each accession strengthens the rules and disciplines of the trading system. Vanuatu, a small archipelago in the South Pacific, is on the verge of becoming the 154th WTO Member. WTO Members are engaged and ready to work with Azerbaijan. They follow developments closely and look forward to welcoming Azerbaijan in the not too distant future. Let's roll-up our sleeves and work!</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Sowing the Seeds of Growth]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[sowing-the-seeds-of-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the state of Iran's agriculture, and how is education figuring in this growth story?</h4><p>Total agricultural production in 2009 rose to 100 million tons from 25 million tons, and this does not include the production of the food industry, which is equal to 30 million tons. This all indicates the remarkable growth and development of Iranian agriculture. Another indicator is the number of university students and graduates of agriculture and other associated majors, which amounts to 200,000 individuals nationwide. The number of universities in different cities that run special courses or offer specialized degrees in areas related to agriculture has also been on the rise. There are also many research centers around the country focusing on increasing agricultural products and productivity, and today they have entered the agriculture sector and their applied scientific findings are being utilized.</p><h4>How do you support scientific research in the agriculture sector?</h4><p>The bank announces topics of interest for scientific research and in return receives proposals, which are taken into consideration; it then finances a number of selected research projects. Most of the topics are, as expected, related to agriculture and economics. We use the research findings to improve the status of production, and support and direct individuals involved in the agriculture sector. In addition, by entering the agricultural sector, researchers and graduates provide traditional farmers with engineering services so that the farmers increase the quantity and quality of their products. The graduates also get the opportunity to directly operate greenhouse and livestock breeding projects, as well.</p><h4>What agricultural development projects has your bank been supporting?</h4><p>In Iran, there are 4.5 million individuals, with their family members making up 25 million of Iran's total population of 74 million, who are active in the agriculture sector. Iranian agriculture, and consequently Bank Keshavarzi's activities, is focused on micro-agriculture. In micro projects, we provide farmers with banking services so that they can improve their production. We have also designed special schemes for special conditions. For example, we finance farmers' working capital specifically in the fall. We provide financial facilities worth $300 for every hectare of cultivatable land. The bank also provides inexpensive financial facilities aimed at improving types of center-pivot irrigation systems and other forms of agricultural machinery.</p><div class="quote">“We have now achieved self-sufficiency in agricultural production..."</div><p>Iran is a country in which you can experience four seasons at the same time. This, of course, has a positive effect on agricultural production and the consumption of agricultural products. The agriculture sector's share in GDP is around 13%, though its share in employment is around 21%. Agricultural products make up 36% of non-oil exports, including different types of fresh fruit, vegetables, and processed food products.</p><h4>Are there any opportunities for foreign investment in Iranian agriculture?</h4><p>Iran's Fifth Five-Year Development Plan aims to attract foreign investment to Iranian agriculture. For instance, we are very much interested in investment that would improve our irrigation networks. Iran has renewable water resources of 130 billion cubic meters, and surface water resources of around 92 billion cubic meters, while some 83.5 million cubic meters of water is being used in agriculture. This is a very good opportunity to invest, because the resources we will allocate to the improvement of the irrigation systems in the upcoming five years amount to $30 billion.</p><p>Another field of activity is investment in improving the level of mechanization in agriculture. Currently, the level of mechanization is around 1% and we aim to increase it to 3%. The resources we will invest in this project will amount to $15 billion in the upcoming five years. Bank Keshavarzi is in charge of financing these projects, and we invite foreign companies to take part.</p><p>In the past, Iran was a food importer. We have now achieved self-sufficiency in agricultural production and can increase our export of agricultural products substantially and constantly, especially the export of meat, poultry, and dairy, because national production volumes have increased and the country is surrounded by appropriate export markets. As you know, exporting these products entails some requirements, such as in terms of transportation. If these requirements are met with the assistance of foreign investment, then products can easily be transported to markets around Iran.</p><h4>Where is Bank Keshavarzi positioned in the banking market, especially with regard  to rural development?</h4><p>Bank Keshavarzi is the only specialized financial institution in Iran that focuses on agriculture. The bank has 77 years of experience and is currently entering its 78th year. It runs 1,900 branches nationwide, and has nearly 17,000 members of staff. Its main mission is agricultural development. In other words, the bank's duty is to contribute to agricultural activities and cooperatives. It was a small institution before the Revolution with total assets of just $20 million. Today, the bank has assets of a more sizeable $20 billion. This also indicates the high growth trend of Iranian agriculture.</p><h4>Do you also run other banking services in non-agricultural sectors? What are your priorities in these other services?</h4><p>We know that we have a special mission for the Iranian economy, which is agricultural development. But we also know we have to operate a fully fledged bank as well. Our electronic banking services are among the most developed in the world because we have managed to make the modern systems of global banking comply with Islamic banking practices.</p><p>In addition to our customers in rural areas, we have many large customers in cities as well. We are using the extent of our electronic banking services to attract major customers in urban areas. We then use the resources we have mobilized via these customers for our special mission in the agriculture sector.</p><p>We also have specialized services for younger Iranians. As a bank, we are very much interested in adding the next generation to our customer group from an early age. Thus, we spend a considerable amount of time on disseminating knowledge about the services banks offer. For example, we conduct training workshops in elementary and secondary schools. We also invite groups of students to our Children and Youth Branches, and these are specifically designed to introduce the banking sector in general and banking services and products in particular.</p><h4>What was the impact of the global economic downturn on the Iranian economy?</h4><p>As you know, the present economic crisis has affected all parts of the world, but it has differed widely from one country to another. However, it is believed that it had a lesser impact on Iran as compared to many other countries. Iran, as the holder of a diversified portfolio of foreign currency reserves, was affected less than those countries that held their assets mainly in only one unit of foreign currency. In addition, investors who managed their portfolios through investment banks were severely affected by the crisis. But, as the rate of return offered by our banks is still very high, many investors have placed their investments in Iran, which is another factor making us more immune to the effects of the global economic downturn.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history behind Behran Oil, and how long have you been with company?</h4><p>The company was first established as a joint venture between a syndicate of Iranian investors (75%) and Esso (EXXON) Oil Company (25%) in 1963. I started working in this company as a lab supervisor when I was 25, and I've been working here for 34 years. I have been involved mainly in the technical aspects of the industry, which I've specialized in, and have authored several books and articles on lubricants for the guidance of Iranian consumers. I also have an Executive MBA, and have had different management responsibilities in this company.</p><p>This is the only company I've ever worked for. The reason perhaps is that at the time of Esso, I saw how they gave importance to the recruitment of competent personnel and their training and development, as well as the very advanced technical expertise of the company. After our Islamic Revolution, the relationship with Esso was cut and we tried to maintain the same corporate culture at the company that was renamed Behran Oil. I think that has been an important factor in making us one of the most successful companies in Iran.</p><h4>How has the company developed over the years?</h4><p>In 1964 the company established a blending plant for which the base oil was supplied from the Abadan refinery and additives were imported from Western countries and these materials were blended to produce Esso-branded lubricants in Iran. Around 1969, the company established a refinery and produced its own base oil. The original capacity of that refinery was 30,000 tons of base oil per year, all of which was converted to motor oils and industrial oils. After the Revolution in 1979, the products were distributed under the Behran brand.</p><div class="quote">“Behran Oil uses all its produced base oil and also imports about 100,000 tons of base oils, because it has the largest market share of lubricants in Iran."</div><p>During the Imposed War between Iran and Iraq, all industries were in the service of defense as well as civil activities, but after the war we went into rapid expansion, and now we are producing 250,000 tons of base oil per annum, as well as 350,000 tons per year of finished products such as motor oils, industrial oils, antifreezes, plus rubber process oils (RPOs), and paraffin waxes. In total, the capacity of our company for the production of finished products is more than 500,000 tons per year.</p><h4>How does Behran rank in terms of base oil production capacity in Iran?</h4><p>Today there are five refineries for lubricants in Iran; The first is Sepehan Oil in Esfahan, which is now a semi-private company that has a nominal capacity of 400,000 tons per annum. The second and third refineries belong to Iranol Oil, which are located in Tehran and Abadan, and have a total capacity of 300,000 tons per year of base oils, and the next lubricants refinery (third in ranking from the capacity aspect) is Behran Oil, located in Tehran, with a capacity of 250,000 tons per year of base oil. The fourth refinery is Pars Oil, located in Tehran, with a capacity of 160,000 tons of base oil per year. All in all, Iran has a total base oil producing capacity of 1 billion liters per year, all of which are of the Group I kind.</p><h4>How much of this capacity is consumed in Iran and how much is exported?</h4><p>The demand for finished lubricants in Iran is about 700,000 tons per year, so, the surplus [base oil] is exported, mainly by Sepahan and Iranol, and some by Pars. The interesting point is that Behran Oil uses all its produced base oil and also imports about 100,000 tons of Group II and Group III base oils, because it has the largest market share of lubricants in Iran.</p><p>Of course, Behran also exports finished lubricants as well as RPOs, paraffin waxes, and antifreeze. In the past, consumers used to change their motor oils about once every 1,000 kilometers, but with the production of higher quality level lubricants (a first for Behran), Iranian drivers now change their motor oil every 5,000 kilometers on average.</p><p>Behran's publications, as well as its technical seminars, have also played an important role in improving popular trust in the quality of nationally produced lubricants and, as a consequence, despite the phenomenal increase in vehicle production in Iran, the consumption of lubricants hasn't increased at anywhere near the same rate. But when it comes to exports, although Iranian base oils enjoy a great deal of popularity, the finished lubricants have a tough time competing in foreign markets due to the profusion of famous international brands. Of course, Behran has been successful in this field, too.</p><h4>What sets Behran apart from its competitors in Iran?</h4><p>The main aspect that sets Behran Oil apart from its competitors is its high brand popularity, which results in a higher market share. As I mentioned before, Behran has to import extra base oils (Group II, III, and synthetic) in order to supply its markets.</p><h4>What sorts of lubricants are produced in Iran? Is there a need to import the more advanced types of lubricants for modern machinery?</h4><p>More than 95% of the lubricants that can be produced using Group I base oil are produced in Iran. Although some special greases and synthetic lubricants are imported, many high-quality modern lubricants that need groups II, III, or synthetic base oils are also produced in Iran—mainly by Behran, of course. There are a number of internationally known companies blending famous branded lubricants in Iran, as well as importing their products for sale.</p><h4>What has been the secret behind Behran's success, and its strong position in the market?</h4><p>I believe that it has to do with our management model. Our management doesn't change much, and we have a high retention rate when it comes to personnel. But perhaps the most important criteria is Behran's organizational culture. Throughout its history, Behran has been committed to producing quality products and is loyal to its customers. In other words, we have never compromised on the quality of our products to make an extra buck. Our products have the approval of the most creditable machinery manufacturers in the world. On top of all this, we have established marketing technical services (MTS) for our industries throughout the country. Behran has MTS offices in the centers of Iran's main provinces. In fact, our engineers are dependable consultants for both industry and the public. We also have strong quality control and R&amp;D facilities, which have enabled us to develop the required lubricants. And the versatility of Behran's products is also an important point. Behran produces more than 1,000 types of lubricants and related products, including different viscosity grades of lubricants and their packaging.</p><h4>What is Behran's share in the engine oil market today?</h4><p>According to official statistics, Behran on its own has a 40-43% share of the motor oil market and a 30% share of the industrial lubricant market in Iran. The company also exports about $40 million in finished lubricants, RPOs, and paraffin waxes.</p><h4>How will the ending of energy subsidies affect your company?</h4><p>In the short run the lubricant industry will encounter a slowdown in demand, especially in the passenger car lubricants segment, but not so much in the commercial sector because buses and trucks have to keep running. But in the long run, we expect normal consumption habits to resume. In Iran we will eventually have to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles, so generally, in terms of lubricants, the size of our market will decrease (because of longer oil change intervals), but I think that the increase in the number of vehicles will eventually bring us back to where we were.</p><h4>What are your investment plans for the future?</h4><p>We have many projects. We intend to establish a Group II and III refinery, even though the technology isn't easily available to us. We are trying to find some other ways of getting around this situation. I believe that in a few years you will find that we are producing Group II base oil. We are also studying our participation in establishing a petroleum refinery that would produce fuels as well as other products.</p><h4>Do you think it was the Esso foundations that gave you the edge that you retained over the years?</h4><p>To some extent yes. In fact, in the first years after Esso left Iran, the refinery that had been built, the personnel who were trained, and the management and other disciplines that were set by Esso, helped us to continue running the company successfully. Later on, other factors like our R&amp;D center, our benchmarking endeavors, and our participation in international and national seminars and conferences through which we both received and shared our experiences have had more important effects on our success. At the present, our colleagues have regular presentations at the ICIS-LOR international base oil conferences in the Middle East, for example.</p><h4>Are you involved in any environmental projects?</h4><p>We are one of the most environmentally aware companies in Iran. We have contributed to environmental protection by increasing the quality level and environmentally friendly formulations of our lubricants and other products. This means higher drain intervals for oils and antifreezes (and so less water and soil pollution), and also longer lifespans for engines, lower emissions, and less air pollution. We have also established sewage and waste treatment systems in our plants. We now convert most of our burning systems from heavy pollutant fuels to cleaner fuels as gas, resulting in cleaner air. We have installed more fuel-efficient electricity generators, and are developing the green space around our plants.</p><p>All of this means that we are at the forefront of environmental responsibility. We also utilize energy management systems that involve a lot of energy auditing and modifications to make energy consumption as cost-effective as possible, and produce less CO2. We are in compliance with ISO quality management systems, such as ISO 9,000, ISO 14,000, and ISO 18,000.</p>]]></richbody0content>
